                                       U.S. Senate,
                                      Committee on Finance,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The hearing was convened, pursuant to notice, at 10:34 
a.m., in Room SD-215, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Ron 
Wyden (chairman of the committee) presiding.
    Present: Senators Wyden, Cantwell, Menendez, Carper, 
Whitehouse, Crapo, Cornyn, Thune, Young, Johnson, Tillis, and 
Blackburn.
    Also present: Democratic staff: Sally Stewart Laing, Chief

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM 
             OREGON, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

    The Chairman. The Finance Committee will come to order.
    Trade cheats in China and around the world are constantly 
looking for new ways to evade U.S. trade laws and rip off 
American jobs and American workers. They wish to sell illegal 
products in America--goods made with forced labor, illegally 
harvested timber, and products that steal our intellectual 
property.
    Trade cheats are a grave threat to American workers, 
farmers, and businesses--in fact, all Americans who play by the 
rules. The most offensive example of trade cheating is the 
state-sponsored forced labor that's rampant in China's Uyghur 
region. The Chinese Government is arbitrarily detaining more 
than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.
    These detainees find themselves thrown into reeducation 
camps where they're isolated from their families and forced to 
work under the worst conditions. The Chinese Communist Party's 
treatment of the Uyghur community is a moral abomination, and 
it threatens American jobs.
    The math is pretty simple: you pay poverty wages, and you 
pollute as you please. Chinese companies have been able to 
flood U.S. markets with cheap goods and undercut all the 
competition. We believe here on this committee that American 
workers are the best in the world, but it's awfully hard to 
compete with slave labor.
    What's the effect here at home? Factories are shuttered, 
and American jobs are lost to China.
    We're going to hear today from Andy Meserve. He's a USW 
local president whose aluminum factory was idled, in part, due 
to forced labor abroad. The problem is that when domestic 
aluminum factories like Andy's get shut down, China is the only 
game. So companies must commit to cleaning up forced labor in 
their supply chains.
    In December this past year, I launched an investigation 
into allegations that the auto industry is still relying on 
supply chains that are tainted by forced labor. The allegation 
is that components for cars--from steel to batteries to tires--
have a huge likelihood of being made with Uyghur forced labor. 
So our committee asked the eight major automakers about their 
supply chains and what they're doing to clean them up.
    This, of course, is a flagship American industry, employing 
more than 90,000 Americans, contributing over $700 billion 
annually to the U.S. economy. America can't allow those jobs to 
be ripped off and sent to an economy that strategically pays 
workers nothing. U.S. law already prohibits importing products 
made with forced labor. The challenge is identifying the 
products and stopping them.
    Customs agents are on the front lines of this effort. The 
Customs folks have a twofold job. First, intercept shipments 
that violate U.S. law. Second, they've got to keep legal goods 
moving efficiently through American ports. A lot has changed 
since 2016, when the Finance Committee passed our last package 
of trade enforcement tools.
    Senator Crapo remembers working on these issues. I see 
Senator Cornyn, Senator Thune. We've been working on these 
issues for a long time, the four of us, in a bipartisan way. 
The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act has produced 
real results. It gave Customs the tools to swiftly crack down 
on duty evasion that hurts American workers and businesses. 
It's helped keep out counterfeits that threaten American 
innovation and public safety.
    He's not here at this time, but Senator Brown deserves a 
great deal of credit for working with us to close an egregious 
loophole that was letting products made with forced labor come 
to our markets. Closing that loophole was enormously important, 
because products made with forced labor can't be allowed to 
enter our country, period.
    Today, Customs has new challenges. COVID-19 changed the way 
people buy and sell goods. E-commerce has exploded. In this 
committee, we said years ago that the Internet is the shipping 
lane of the 21st century, and that has certainly been evident 
over the last couple of years. Shipments have surged. The CBP 
is processing millions more packages, small packages, every 
day.
    Fentanyl and other illicit drugs continue to enter through 
our ports. Illegal seafood is entering the U.S. market and 
threatening the livelihoods of coastal communities. 
Counterfeiters rip off American products, posing an economic 
and health threat to American citizens. Intellectual property 
theft is estimated to cost the U.S. economy up to $600 billion 
every year, much of it from China.
    Foreign companies continue to find new ways to work their 
way around our trade laws. Keeping out the trade cheats is 
something of a game of Whac-A-Mole. In my view, stepping up 
trade enforcement requires finding and stopping the cheats and 
crafting tools that are flexible enough to stop the next round 
of cheaters.
    I'll close by saying it's going to take better coordination 
with Customs and Border Protection across the U.S. Government, 
from the Department of Labor to the fisheries experts in 
Commerce. We'll be working with CBP and others to improve our 
trade laws to make sure these agencies have the tools they 
need.
    This morning's hearing is an important first step. We're 
going to hear from businesses that need inputs, and some 
logistics professionals who work with Customs to keep supply 
chains moving. We'll also hear from folks who work to get 
forced labor out of the supply chains, and an American worker.
    And I know you've worked very closely with us, Mr. Meserve, 
to tell us how it's personally impacted you through this unfair 
competition. We want to hear how Customs can maximize 
enforcement while streamlining imports from Trusted Traders 
with clean supply chains. That's going to help U.S. producers 
get the inputs they need, reduce bottlenecks, and help our 
workers and consumers.
    Senator Crapo, I look forward to your remarks.
    [The prepared statement of Chairman Wyden appears in the 
appendix.]

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE CRAPO, 
                   A U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO

    Senator Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
holding this hearing. It's a very critical issue. And I want to 
thank you, our witnesses, for appearing before us today.
    As I begin, I want to mention two things particularly, 
since this is this committee's first trade hearing of this new 
Congress. First, I want to welcome Ms. Cindy Allen of FedEx 
Logistics. She traveled here today from Tennessee, the home of 
one of our new Finance Committee members, Senator Marsha 
Blackburn. We're very happy to have you both here.
    And of course, I'm also glad to see Senators Tillis and 
Johnson here, who have also just joined the committee. But 
we're going to have to wait a little bit longer to get some of 
the fine folks from your States here before the committee.
    Second, I want to thank Senator Cassidy for his leadership 
on the issue of Customs modernization. He spends a lot of time 
thinking about how to ensure our Customs laws are effectively 
enforced and how to better harness the data to that effect. We 
all look forward to hearing his insights as we consider these 
issues further.
    Modernizing U.S. Customs laws is fast becoming of critical 
importance. The last comprehensive update to our Customs laws 
occurred exactly 30 years ago. A smart reform now will not only 
allow us to seize new opportunities, but also to confront the 
rise of opportunists. Some of those Senator Wyden has already 
mentioned.
    Opportunity is out there right now waiting for the law to 
catch up with it. The drafters of the last modernization could 
not possibly foresee the technological tools available to us 
today, or the sheer number of small businesses that now take 
advantage of international trade, or the benefit to consumers 
of widespread access to e-commerce. But with any new 
opportunity, unfortunately, also comes the opportunists.
    Modernization is imperative to counter both existing 
threats trying to make their way into this country and those on 
the horizon. At the El Paso port of entry, the brave men and 
women of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, 
seized, in just the month of January alone, over 327 pounds of 
methamphetamine, 139 pounds of cocaine, and 42 pounds of 
fentanyl. We've got to close the flow of these drugs over our 
southern border.
    On January 29th, CBP officers at Chicago's O'Hara seized 
counterfeit jewelry and apparel that would have been worth over 
$686,000 if it had been genuine. CBP is also actively enforcing 
a number of withhold release orders and the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Implementation Act to keep goods made with forced labor out of 
this country.
    The good news about Customs modernization is that it's not 
an either/or proposition when it comes to trade facilitation 
and trade enforcement. By making smarter use of data 
collection, we can reduce burdens on both lawful commerce and 
CBP personnel so that we can better focus resources on 
enforcement challenges.
    Let's take an example: something as simple as importing wet 
pet food. Importation currently requires the importer to submit 
data to assist three of CBP's partner agencies: USDA, FDA, and 
the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, or 
NOAA. These agencies cumulatively want 54 data elements, but 21 
of these elements are redundant, and there are 16 inconsistent 
definitions for the same data. Under these circumstances, the 
importer faces the challenge of figuring out what exactly is 
required, and our law enforcement authorities may end with 
information of little utility.
    We can and must do better, particularly given some of the 
supply chain bottlenecks we see at our ports. Fortunately, we 
are well situated to attack the modernization effort today 
because CBP and its advisory committee started thinking about 
many of these issues in 2018, when CBP launched its 21st 
Century Customs Framework Initiative to develop ideas about 
what a modernized Customs regime might look like.
    Combining CBP's efforts with additional expertise, 
including that of our witnesses today, we can create an 
efficient and effective framework. New tools, including 
automation, can help us identify risks at an early stage. We 
need a system where contraband never enters the United States 
in the first place. By catching threats early, we can save CBP 
from engaging in lengthy investigations on U.S. soil to figure 
out whether something is a threat or not. A modern system will 
also expedite lawful commerce to get essential inputs faster to 
our manufacturers and goods to our consumers.
    To sum up, smart Customs modernization will fight and deter 
crime, create jobs, move goods faster, and save Americans money 
all at the same time. This is precisely the type of work this 
committee was set up to do and does well. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues and the committee on taking up that 
challenge.
    Now I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and their 
ideas about how to improve our Customs laws.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Crapo appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Crapo. And I think you're 
spot-on in terms of saying there's enormous bipartisan 
potential here. And for those who are following, in the last 
Congress when there was gridlock, and we went on and on and on, 
on the Senate floor, unable to move, Senator Crapo and I walked 
into the middle of the Senate chamber, literally in the middle 
of the two parties, and put together the amendment that got 
more than 90 votes and freed up what was really, ultimately, 
the CHIPS legislation. And I thank him and look forward to 
working with him as we did before on these trade issues.
    Let me briefly introduce our guests. Ms. Allen, you got a 
little bit of a sendoff already. I note that you're doing good 
work over there at FedEx on regulatory affairs and compliance. 
You've been working in this space for 30 years.
    We already gave Andy Meserve a little bit of a sendoff, 
president of the United Steel Workers, Local 9423, in Kentucky. 
We appreciate him.
    Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights 
Consortium, is doing good work in terms of monitoring labor 
rights abuses around the globe.
    John Pickel is with us, senior director of international 
supply chain policy at the National Foreign Trade Council. He's 
got expertise in a number of issues that are important to us--
anti-counterfeiting, for example.
    And Ms. Brenda Smith is with us as well, global director of 
government outreach at Expeditors International, which does 
global logistics in our part of the world in Seattle. So, we 
welcome her as well.
    So, let's proceed with our witnesses, and we'll begin with 
you, Ms. Allen.

 STATEMENT OF CINDY ALLEN, VICE PRESIDENT, REGULATORY AFFAIRS 
          AND COMPLIANCE, FEDEX LOGISTICS, MEMPHIS, TN

    Ms. Allen. Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and 
members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify 
today. My name is Cindy Allen, and I've been working in 
international trade for 35 years.
    FedEx believes that a connected world is a better world, 
and at FedEx, trade is our business. Expanding global trade is 
essential to our customers, our team, and the economy. In 
modernized trade, Customs processes are key to that. In the 
United States, FedEx employs over 412,000 individuals, 
accounting for nearly 6 percent of the employees in the U.S. 
transportation services sector.
    We play a crucial role in the U.S. supply chain that keeps 
the country, its people, and the economy moving. We are 
immensely proud of our global efforts to combat COVID-19 by 
delivering vaccines and critical PPE. And when the trade 
disruptions congested our ports, FedEx participated in the 
White House Supply Chain Disruptions Taskforce to get trade 
moving again.
    American prosperity is linked to growing markets and 
greater opportunities for U.S. companies, especially small and 
medium businesses, which comprise more than 98 percent of U.S. 
exports. More than 40 million American jobs depend on trade. 
With 95 percent of the world's population and 80 percent of its 
purchasing power outside of our borders, global trade will 
continue to be of critical importance to U.S. economic growth.
    It's not just exports that benefit the American economy, 
but imports as well. Nearly 60 percent of imports are raw 
materials, capital goods, and industrial products which are 
used by U.S. manufacturers and U.S. farmers to produce goods in 
the U.S.
    If the U.S. hopes to strengthen its manufacturing base, it 
must have efficient and reliable access to components from 
around the world. We must recognize that there has been a sea 
change in the profile of global trade, however. The global 
supply chain is more complex and has many more participants, 
shifting from trade between large, multinational corporations 
to package-based trade between businesses and individual 
consumers.
    This shift presents unprecedented opportunities to make 
global trade more inclusive by enabling small and medium-sized 
businesses to participate in the global economy. But it also 
presents challenges for the government as they grapple with the 
impact of increased low-value shipments and its impact on their 
core responsibilities.
    Against this backdrop, FedEx supports the U.S. Government 
in its efforts to update its Customs rules and adapt to a 
changing trade environment. Given the increased number of trade 
participants, the government should focus on requiring the 
right data at the right time from the right party. Appropriate 
guard rails should be included to prevent unnecessary burdens 
on companies and supply chains in the name of data collection, 
especially elements that do not have demonstrated value for 
targeting or admissibility evaluation purposes.
    Governments around the world look to the United States for 
leadership. When considering new requirements on U.S. imports, 
the U.S. should ask whether U.S. exporters, especially those 
SMEs, would support the same requirements being placed on their 
exports by other countries.
    A truly successful Customs modernization needs to be a co-
created approach to leverage best practices and to develop 
feasible joint solutions in a bidirectional manner.
    In our written testimony, we outline seven concepts for 
consideration. For example, the original Customs Modernization 
Act established the International Trade Data System to act as a 
single window for all the agencies. The Automated Commercial 
Environment did deliver that single window, but it currently 
has 47 different panes, one for each of the agencies involved 
in international trade. And the glass is a little bit different 
in every pane.
    To truly unify the trade processes, both for the government 
and for trade, a forum for government-wide policy should be 
established that looks at processes and procedures, and should 
be given the responsibility and the authority to make joint 
decisions for trade and enforcement purposes. And the trade 
must have an active role in this forum.
    Additionally, shipments have a history when they arrive at 
the border. Government agencies have expressed interest in 
receiving critical data associated with these shipments and 
parties to the transactions to better inform their 
admissibility decisions. We propose an iterative or progressive 
filing be developed to allow the right party with the right 
data at the right time to provide data much earlier in the 
supply chain, which should be linked to Trusted Trader 
benefits.
    Lastly, FedEx would like to highlight the importance of a 
current feature of the U.S. Customs laws that facilitate trade, 
the strong U.S. de minimis provision. De minimis is a 
longstanding feature of the United States import system.
    Congress looked at this issue most recently in 2016 via the 
Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, which explains 
that the higher de minimis value threshold provides significant 
economic benefits to businesses and customers in the U.S.--and 
the economy of the U.S. And it's important to note that CBP has 
the same, if not more, opportunity to review, screen, examine, 
and seize shipments in the de minimis environment as they do 
every other shipment into the United States.
    Additionally, in the express environment, we have dedicated 
individuals who work side-by-side in partnership with CBP and 
other government agencies to identify and eliminate goods in 
violations of these laws. We'd love to invite the committee, 
the chairman, the ranking member, to visit the Memphis Airport 
and visit our world hub to see this in action.
    Thank you for inviting me, and I look forward to our 
discussion today. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Allen appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Ms. Allen, thank you.
    Let's go next to Mr. Meserve.

  STATEMENT OF ANDY MESERVE, PRESIDENT OF LOCAL 9423, UNITED 
   STEEL, PAPER AND FORESTRY, RUBBER, MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, 
  ALLIED INDUSTRIAL, AND SERVICE WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION 
                      (USW), OWENSBORO, TN

    Mr. Meserve. Hello. Thank you, Chairman Wyden and Ranking 
Member Crapo, for the invitation. Thank you, members. Thank you 
for the opportunity to testify today on modernizing our trade 
laws and improving our country's trade enforcement. My name is 
Andy Meserve, and I am union president of United Steel Workers 
Local 9423.
    My local represents workers at Century Aluminum, Hawesville 
Kentucky Smelter, located on the Ohio River. Our plant is one 
of six remaining primary aluminum smelters in the United 
States, which when operating employs around 650 union and 
management workers, making up to 250,000 tons of primary 
aluminum a year.
    I'm a maintenance mechanic by trade, meaning that I am 
responsible for ensuring everything from conveyor belts to 
cranes operates safely in a manufacturing process that turns 
raw materials into primary aluminum. My job is to not just fix 
the immediate problem, but to do preventive maintenance and 
find root causes to any breakdowns, making recommendations to 
management on how to solve the problems long-term.
    In some ways, you all are managers of our country's 
economic well-being, so I hope that my testimony today will 
highlight the immediate problems facing our smelter, but also 
make long-term recommendations to ensure the U.S. has a 
competitive primary aluminum industry, which is critical to our 
national security.
    If you Google Hawesville Kentucky Smelter, the first thing 
that comes up are articles that highlight high energy prices 
that temporarily idled my smelter, throwing over 600 workers 
into economic uncertainty. To me, that is like looking at a 
broken conveyor and not asking what caused that failure.
    Yes, energy prices are a factor in our current plant 
idling, but we need to step back and see if we can set 
conditions for success in long-term operations. Aluminum is a 
globally traded commodity in an energy-intensive trade-exposed 
industry. The policies and decisions you make in trade will 
impact whether we have a domestic aluminum industry or not, 
just as much as regional power prices.
    My immediate recommendations to you are that we update our 
trade enforcement laws and quickly respond to illegal trade 
practices, put in place trade rules that better account for 
worker abuses and environmental pollution, and ensure that we 
prioritize Customs and Border Patrol efforts to collect duties 
and stop illegal goods at the border.
    Regarding trade enforcement, the USW has supported a bill 
which passed the House of Representatives last Congress and was 
lead in the Senate by Senator Brown and former Senator Portman, 
commonly known as the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0. The 
legislation would have provided a number of trade law updates 
that would give new tools to U.S. workers and manufacturers to 
fend off illegal dumping and subsidized goods. We urge the 
Finance Committee to take up that bill this Congress and pass 
it as soon as possible.
    Another enforcement action we could take today is stopping 
Russian aluminum imports into the U.S. It's hard for me to sit 
here at this table and not be angry that we allow Russian 
aluminum imports to enter our country while 500 of my brothers 
and sisters and fellow Americans are out of work who could make 
the same product. The USW supports every effort to prohibit 
Russian aluminum products from entering our market. The union 
sees value in placing tariffs on Russian aluminum products, but 
it would be more effective to sanction or place a total ban on 
downstream products that have Russian smelted and cast primary 
aluminum in the supply chain.
    Congress must also do everything you can to limit forced 
labor goods and goods made in countries that prohibit free and 
independent unions from entering our markets. My written 
testimony goes into detail on how forced labor practices in 
China affect the global aluminum supply chain. This must stop. 
We should be making primary aluminum here and not allowing 
traders to hide behind outdated contracting policies which 
allow forced labor goods into globally traded commodities.
    My union has prepared a number of other recommendations to 
better account for dumping and subsidized goods. Significant 
work and my union's dollars have gone into that effort. I 
support those recommendations and ask that you act swiftly on 
them. I do this not just for my union brothers and sisters at 
my local, but also to ensure a better, more democratic global 
market.
    I look forward to answering your questions and thank you 
for your time.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Meserve appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Meserve, and we know 
this is a particularly challenging time for workers. I mean, 
you're trying to come out of the pandemic. You're dealing with 
supply chain issues, and then you're bumping up against these 
unfair trade practices like forced labor and the kinds of 
things you've outlined. And we want to come up with some 
policies that give workers more of a chance to get a fair 
shake, and we appreciate it.
    Okay; Mr. Nova?

  STATEMENT OF SCOTT NOVA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WORKER RIGHTS 
                   CONSORTIUM, WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Nova. Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, thank you 
for the opportunity to testify. My name is Scott Nova. I'm 
executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, an 
organization that monitors working conditions in global 
manufacturing supply chains and promotes respect for worker 
rights. We're a member of the Coalition to End Forced Labor in 
the Uyghur Region.
    I'll address the enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act in section 307 of the Tariff Act. The removal of 
the consumptive demand exception from section 307 and the 
enactment of the UFLPA are rare elements of U.S. trade policy 
that constrain the ability of corporations to produce goods 
under abusive and unlawful conditions overseas and sell them in 
the United States.
    These laws are of immense importance to vast numbers of 
workers and a major step toward fair competition in the global 
economy. Strong enforcement is crucial. Most corporations will 
not of their own volition respond adequately to the risk of 
forced labor in their supply chains, even in circumstances as 
horrific as those we've witnessed in the Uyghur region. That is 
why the UFLPA was necessary.
    In assessing UFLPA enforcement, we are mindful that the law 
is prodigious in scope and the task facing the enforcement 
agency is daunting. We recognize that the executive branch and 
Congress are committed to enforcement. Eight months since the 
law took effect, there are positive indicators.
    Shipments are being detained in a growing list of 
industries, and importers know they face unprecedented 
scrutiny. Many, though by no means all, major apparel brands 
have exited or are exiting the Uyghur region. Demand for 
Xinjiang cotton is plummeting.
    There are also reasons for concern. Customs and Border 
Protection is not reporting adequately on enforcement. For 
example, the data CBP publishes on its most important actions--
stopping shipments with content from the Uyghur region--lumps 
all relevant data points into a single statistic: the number of 
shipments or entries identified for further examination. The 
statistic is so broad as to be meaningless.
    We do know, for example, what percentage of the shipments 
CBP examines are detained versus allowed into the U.S. Solar is 
a priority under the law, but CBP does not publish sufficient 
data for the public to know if its enforcement effort reflects 
that.
    Not only is there no disaggregation of the data by 
industry, much less disclosure of which specific importers are 
trying to bring in banned goods, CBP does not report which 
countries targeted goods are coming from. We also do not know 
whether CBP is addressing industries more recently identified 
as high-risk, like auto, steel, and aluminum. As researchers at 
NomoGaia and Sheffield Hallam University have shown, if you 
bought a car in the last 5 years, there is a good chance it 
contains parts made with Uyghur forced labor. The UFLPA and its 
strong enforcement are the keys to ensuring that your 2024 
Toyota or Ford does not. Your letter to auto executives, 
Chairman Wyden, was an important wake-up call for the industry.
    Insufficient forced-labor reporting by CBP is not a new 
problem. It dates back to the section 307 enforcement push that 
began in 2016. Accountability depends on reasonable 
transparency. It is important to the enforcement of the UFLPA 
in section 307 that CBP provide more and more informative data. 
The UFLPA mandates that the government maintain a list of 
suppliers implicated in Uyghur forced labor so their products 
can't enter the U.S. The list contains only 20 companies and 
has not been expanded since June.
    The decision to add a company must be made carefully and in 
a time frame that allows the list to serve its purpose. 
Independent researchers have identified hundreds of candidates. 
It is important that the Forced Labor Enforcement Taskforce, 
which manages the list, acts expeditiously to add companies 
that deserve to be included.
    Statements by CBP also suggest too much emphasis on the 
tiny volume of goods exported directly from the Uyghur region 
to the U.S. CBP should not ignore this channel but should not 
allocate disproportionate resources to it. To put this in 
perspective, direct U.S. imports from the Uyghur region before 
UFLPA were $300 million per year. The U.S. will import twice 
that volume of goods from all other sources just during the 
time it takes to complete this hearing. Addressing this set of 
issues, hopefully with expanded resources from Congress, will 
strengthen a UFLPA enforcement effort already having an 
unprecedented impact.
    I'll conclude by offering two observations on broader 
enforcement of section 307. First, while Customs modernization 
is a worthy objective, it is vital to ensure that it 
strengthens and expedites forced labor enforcement. Among the 
modifications to avoid would be adding layers to the withhold 
release order process that would give importers violating the 
law new tools to delay enforcement.
    Second, if we want corporations to exercise due diligence 
on forced labor, we need to enforce the law. The reason 
corporations fail at due diligence is not because they can't 
figure out how to do it, but because it costs money to do it 
right, including paying prices to suppliers commensurate with 
running a clean shop.
    By contrast, importing goods made with forced labor in 
violation of the law hasn't cost most corporations anything. 
When the vigorous enforcement of section 307, including fines 
on importers, makes the cost of failing to prevent forced labor 
higher than the cost of succeeding, we will see due diligence 
from industry.
    Thank you, and I welcome your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Nova appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Very good.
    Mr. Pickel?

  STATEMENT OF JOHN PICKEL, SENIOR DIRECTOR, INTERNAL SUPPLY 
  CHAIN POLICY, NATIONAL FOREIGN TRADE COUNCIL, WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Pickel. Good morning, Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member 
Crapo, and members of the committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to discuss these important topics. I'm John Pickel, 
the senior director of international supply chain policy at the 
National Foreign Trade Council, or NFTC. The views expressed 
today are mine and on behalf of NFTC, not representing any 
previous employer or specific company.
    Trade supports 40 million jobs and increases the purchasing 
power of households by $18,000 annually. The U.S. Customs 
system has been tested by recent disruptions, but still 
provides a firm base for American companies to supply families 
and businesses with the products that they need.
    Customs modernization proposals should encompass the 
following principles. One, balance trade facilitation 
enforcement. Effective compliance can be done in a way that 
facilitates legitimate trade. Well-defined challenges should be 
addressed through jointly developed solutions with clear 
outcomes that consider impact on trade flows and promote 
similar balance across government agencies.
    Two, clarify the responsibilities of actors throughout the 
process. As trade models shift, government and industry need to 
set clear expectations and maintain flexibility, particularly 
to ensure that the correct information is being collected from 
the right party at the right point in the process.
    Three, promote partnership between government and industry. 
Partnership constructs need to be updated to promote voluntary 
information sharing that addresses compliance actions earlier 
in the supply chain and improves efficiency of enforcement.
    Four, embrace automation to simplify the processing of 
cargo. Automation improves efficiency but is reliant upon 
inputs from various actors, which can be onerous on small 
businesses. So, required information should be available and 
relevant in addressing critical visibility gaps.
    Five, apply Trusted Trader principles to address emerging 
risk factors. Current Trusted Trader programs were developed in 
partnership with private industry and should adapt to meet 
emerging demands through the same spirit of collaboration and 
trust and provide meaningful benefits aligned with the cost of 
participation.
    Improving the efficiency of the trade processes promotes 
product availability and increases purchasing powers for 
families and businesses. Third Way found that improved 
facilitation in the following areas could create almost 1 
million American jobs.
    First, simplifying border processes ensures predictability 
of rules, fees, and processes. Second, embracing digitization 
has saved the government $1.75 billion, and many hours for 
industry. This system should ensure government-wide 
participation and a process with resources to improve 
functionality. Third, focus on speed and security through risk 
management prioritization with meaningful de minimis and 
informal entry policies to provide quick and compliant 
clearance.
    Congress ensured that over 1 billion annual shipments to 
families and businesses would not be subject to taxes and 
administrative burden by increasing the de minimis threshold in 
2016. These shipments are subject to trade laws and largely 
compliant. De minimis treatment of low-value goods reduces 
costs, but eroding this policy would be a regressive tax that 
disproportionately impacts low-income households and diverts 
resources from current enforcement priorities.
    There is no place for forced labor in American supply 
chains, period. American companies continue to shift sourcing 
away from regions of concern and would like to work with CBP to 
further compliance efforts through testing supply chain tracing 
technologies and anticipating detention prioritizations under 
the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.
    As we address visibility gaps in complex supply chains, the 
trade community craves predictability and clear due diligence 
standards to structure sincere compliance efforts. Engagement 
with partner governments should address the root causes of 
forced labor, including recruitment practices and governance 
around existing laws related to forced labor.
    In closing, I'd like to emphasize that the world will be 
watching how the U.S. seizes the leadership opportunities 
discussed here today. Commitment to trade facilitation through 
open rules-based trading is a standard that we should be 
exporting to our trading partners.
    Thank you for your attention to these important topics, and 
I look forward to your questions.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Pickel.
    Ms. Smith?

   STATEMENT OF BRENDA B. SMITH, GLOBAL DIRECTOR, GOVERNMENT 
 OUTREACH, EXPEDITORS INTERNATIONAL OF WASHINGTON, INC., GLEN 
                           BURNIE, MD

    Ms. Smith. Mr. Chairman, Senator Crapo, and members of the 
committee, thank you for the chance to testify before you 
today. My name is Brenda Smith, and I currently work as the 
global director of government outreach for Expeditors 
International of Washington, a global logistics, freight-
forwarding, and information company.
    Previously, I served for 7 years as the Executive Assistant 
Commissioner for Trade at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 
The views I express this morning are my own and do not 
necessarily reflect the position of my current or past 
employer.
    The pandemic laid bare the weaknesses in a global system 
that moves goods from farmers and manufacturers to consumers. 
In the 40 years that I have worked in this arena, the volume of 
global trade has multiplied 32 times what it was in the mid-
1980s. This staggering growth has been accompanied by an 
overlay of trade agreements, expanded supply chain parties, and 
increased consumer expectations.
    Customs administrations have also evolved over those same 
40 years, mostly in response to border security challenges, 
leaving many trade modernization efforts unfinished. In my work 
on the U.S. single window, I learned the importance of 
developing a clear vision and then translating this vision into 
legal, operational, and technology frameworks.
    My own statement of principles underlying such a vision 
would include the following things. First, leveraging Trusted 
Trader investment to share risk information and truly 
streamline entry and compliance procedures by all regulatory 
agencies. Make the green lane a priority and a reality across 
all types of shipments and all trade processes. This approach 
should extend to expansion and full implementation of AEO 
mutual recognition agreements.
    Second, truly digitizing agency requirements for supply 
chains, including a continued commitment to the U.S. single 
window and a full rationalization of data requirements to 
minimize redundancy and focus on collecting only the most 
important data at the right time from the right party. More 
data isn't always better. Quality is more important than 
quantity.
    Third, planning and practicing a response to supply chain 
disruptions across all government agencies and their supply 
chain partners. Resiliency will be greater if potential 
regulatory and operational flexibilities are determined in 
advance and recognize the lower risks associated with Trusted 
Traders.
    And fourth and finally, a single process across all 
government agencies with requirements for goods crossing 
borders, to include the alignment of their regulations, 
operational processes, Trusted Trader programs, and a 
commitment to using only the single window for the collection 
of data.
    What will it take to implement this vision? There are many 
things that could be included, but I'd like to highlight two 
specific areas: first, an investment in Customs personnel and 
technology; and second, collaboration with stakeholders.
    First, implementation will require ongoing investment in 
the softer parts of Customs infrastructure, specifically 
expertise and technology. Aside from significant investment in 
forced labor capabilities, the level of CBP's nonuniformed 
trade personnel has not materially increased since CBP was 
founded in 2003.
    In addition to ensuring that there are enough specialists 
to handle the growth in trade complexity, these individuals 
need to be well trained in both modern business practices and 
traditional Customs competencies, with a dedicated trade and 
cargo academy and regularly updated curriculum. Today's 
emerging technologies can support greater supply chain 
visibility and a targeted risk management approach that 
facilitates trade and improves revenue collection, compliance, 
and security in ways not possible even 5 years ago.
    The second requirement for modernization is collaboration 
with stakeholders. I worked extensively with the trade 
community and valued forums that allowed frank discussion and 
consensus building among trade stakeholders. Expanding private-
sector engagement with the partner government agencies through 
the Border Interagency Executive Council and driving more 
active regulatory operational and technology coordination 
through forums like the COAC, the Trade Support Network, and 
the BIEC would result in better problem-solving and a trade 
environment that meets the needs of both government and the 
private sector.
    I thank this committee for the opportunity to advocate for 
Customs modernization. Much work remains to be done, but I 
strongly believe that it is worth pursuing as we support 
opportunities for businesses and consumers as they engage in 
the global marketplace.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Smith appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you very much. And all of you have been 
excellent.
    I'll start with you, Mr. Meserve. I was reading your 
statement last night in the wee hours, and I thought you really 
hit it strongly how aluminum made with Uyghur forced labor gets 
into the global supply chains. And you describe how companies 
in China take advantage of slave labor and undercut their 
competitors on environmental laws. And then you were really 
specific about how multiple Uyghur-region producers make 
primary aluminum, and that's made at your facility in Kentucky. 
You know, that's the ball game. Uyghur-made aluminum goes into 
Chinese auto parts and ends up on the international metals 
trading platform.
    So here's my question, because this gets pretty complicated 
and all the rest. It seems to me you've really given us a very 
eloquent statement, a very good statement, saying that all you 
want, all the workers want, is a more level playing field--that 
you can beat the pants off the competition as long as you get 
close to a level playing field. Is that a fair assessment of 
what you're trying to make sure we understand in the Senate?
    Mr. Meserve. Well, thank you for the question. Yes, we have 
520 well-trained steel workers in Kentucky who can make primary 
aluminum. We can do it well. We can compete with anybody in the 
world as long as we're given the opportunity--and like I said, 
a level playing field with market power that's accessible, 
where people aren't flooding the market with goods, driving the 
prices down, or manipulating the LME.
    The Chairman. Well, you tell the members of your union that 
we thought you were a little logical for Washington, DC, but 
you said it really well, and that's what we're committed to 
doing. Senator Crapo and I have been working on this for some 
time--to get you a more level playing field--because this is a 
private economy and markets, and we know you can win in those 
markets if we just get you a level playing field. I thank you.
    Mr. Meserve. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Mr. Nova, our investigations team learned 
about these allegations of troubling practices in the auto 
sector, with the key auto inputs: steel, aluminum, copper. They 
are increasingly made in the Uyghur region, which has 
documented ties to forced labor. We are reviewing the answers 
we've gotten from the companies. I'll have more to say as we 
get a chance to have a more thorough analysis.
    My initial take is, they've got a lot more work to do, and 
we're going to be following up and looking at the entire 
automotive supply chain. And my question to you is--you've been 
working with these companies to eliminate forced labor, so what 
would be your counsel to the automobile companies? What should 
they be doing to ensure that we get this forced labor scourge 
and the products associated with it out of the supply chain?
    Mr. Nova. Well, in the broader sense, they need to take all 
the steps necessary to ensure that none of the inputs that end 
up in their vehicles are coming from the Uyghur region or from 
any producer elsewhere in China participating in the scheme 
whereby the Chinese Government forcibly transfers Uyghur 
laborers to other parts of the country to work under forced 
labor conditions.
    More specifically, the first step is to know where the 
inputs are coming from. And I say that wanting to be clear that 
these corporations could have and already should have known 
where these inputs are coming from.
    The Chairman. Let me make sure we understand that. They 
should have known already?
    Mr. Nova. Should have known already. Sometimes 
corporations, including auto companies, will act as if the 
origins of the inputs that go into their cars are some kind of 
unfathomable mystery. But the reality is, they have the ability 
and the power to know where every single element comes from. If 
they don't know, it's not because the information is 
unknowable, but because they've not prioritized gaining and 
maintaining that knowledge. So they need to start there. They 
need to know where the aluminum comes from. They need to know 
where the other raw materials come from. They need to know 
where every element comes from.
    The Chairman. All right.
    One last question, if I might, Mr. Pickel, for you, on this 
fentanyl issue. This is the single deadliest drug threat that 
our country has encountered. The deaths just keep going through 
the stratosphere, nearly 70,000 in 2021. It definitely has hit 
Oregon very, very hard.
    Last month, Oregon Live reported a massive drug bust near 
Salem, uncovering 45,000 fentanyl pills. Worse yet, these were 
counterfeit pills: fentanyl masquerading as oxycodone, so no 
one knew that one pill--just one pill--could kill them. We're 
hearing constantly from families who've lost kids too early, 
and no community is safe. And we've been very concerned about 
Customs' role here and believe more needs to be done.
    You worked on the STOP Act implementation at Customs, which 
provided Customs more advanced information on air shipments and 
better risk analysis and the like. I, again, think that there's 
a lot more that needs to be done. I mean, I just described to 
you that last month in my State--this is not somewhere else 
thousands of miles away, but in my State--they found 45,000 
fentanyl pills. So what else do you think this committee ought 
to be doing to beef up the enforcement effort to deal with this 
scourge?
    Mr. Nova. Senator, thanks for the question. I think the 
availability of fentanyl is certainly an ongoing issue, and I 
think a small silver lining may be that with passage of the 
STOP Act and enactment of the requirements that you referenced, 
there have been shifts in how fentanyl comes to the United 
States that have been well documented in the press.
    I'm obviously not here representing CBP--and they may have 
additional thoughts on this--but what I would offer is that 
data sharing capabilities, particularly with foreign postal 
operators, provides very valuable insight to enable enforcement 
actions.
    The Chairman. Do you think we ought to be pushing foreign 
postal operators to be working more closely with us?
    Mr. Nova. I think that this committee and the U.S. 
Government should work with those foreign postal operators to 
understand what information is important to target in on that 
particular risk. That may shift over time, so developing a 
dynamic framework for shifting what data is available would be 
very beneficial in an enforcement posture.
    The Chairman. I'm way over my time.
    Senator Crapo?
    Senator Crapo. Well, thank you, Senator Wyden. And I'm 
going to follow up on that exactly. I have been meeting with 
the sheriffs in Idaho across my State because of the very same 
crisis that's happening in Idaho that Senator Wyden talked 
about in Oregon. In fact, one of my sheriffs said to me that 
every State is a border State in the context of fentanyl, 
because it's coming into every single State in massive amounts 
and in massive ways. So I believe this is one of the key issues 
we need to address as a specific risk that comes from our 
border protection.
    You just indicated, Mr. Pickel, that the STOP Act and some 
of the other things that have already been done have shifted a 
little bit, or at least improved our understanding about how 
and where it's coming across the border. I know that at one 
point--and today still, there is still a lot of argument about 
that.
    There are those who say that most of it comes through the 
ports or the ports of entry, and others say it's just coming 
across the border because of the virtual free flow of illegal 
entry across the border. Could you give any of your insight on 
that?
    Mr. Nova. Yes. Thank you, Senator. So, the movement of 
narcotics through ports is a much more controlled environment 
to be able to address enforcement actions and deploy 
technologies that can detect these substances more readily. So, 
pushing those movements into that environment do improve the 
enforcement efficiencies significantly.
    I can't speak to the current flows. I'm not in the 
government anymore. But what I would say is that the sharing of 
information and identifying risk factors earlier in the context 
of supply chain movements will certainly impact the improvement 
of compliance in that area.
    Senator Crapo. All right. Thank you.
    Do any of the other witnesses have knowledge or expertise 
you could share with us on this issue? [No response.] All 
right. Thank you. Then I'll move on.
    Ms. Allen, you intrigued me. Your testimony intrigued me 
when you talked about how what we intended to be a single 
window actually has 47 different window panes, and they are of 
different types of glass, so to speak. Could you elaborate on 
that a little bit? I think that it's probably something that 
most Americans can intuitively understand in terms of a 
description of bureaucracy, but would you please elaborate on 
that a little bit and tell us how maybe we could fix that?
    Ms. Allen. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Ranking Member Crapo. 
I was also glad to hear in your comments that you mentioned the 
multiple streams of data that have to be filed, the same data 
elements, and the different definitions and terms that are used 
in different agencies. I'd like to point to the definition of 
``agent.''
    In a review of all of the 47 different agencies that have 
both the authority to stop goods and have jurisdiction over 
imports and exports, the term ``agent'' is littered throughout, 
and there are 10-plus different definitions of agent. And you 
can imagine I, as a Trusted Trader with the U.S. Government, am 
trying to file that data, so I'm not sure how I'm acting at 
that particular moment. Am I an agent by the definition of FDA? 
Am I an agent of the USDA? Am I an agent of Customs and Border 
Protection?
    So really looking at those common definitions in the 
regulations and streamlining those will help facilitate legal 
and lawful trade. Most companies want to be compliant with the 
law, but it's very complicated. That's why Ms. Smith and I have 
jobs to make sure that we're assisting that trade facilitation.
    There are a couple of things beyond that that we can do. 
One is ensuring that the information that goes into single 
window actually goes through the window. Right now, we have 
agencies that have built systems outside of that single window 
that I, as a Customs broker, have to file data through to get 
release of the cargo. And then I have to repeat that process 
within the single window, so we'd like to have one true single 
window as it was intended in the Modernization Act as it was 
first passed.
    The other thing is the policy, procedures, and processes. 
Every agency has their own jurisdiction. They're authorized by 
different congressional committees to carry out that work, and 
have their own sets of laws and regulations that they must 
comply with, and we understand that. However, as a participant 
in international trade, we would like one body, one forum to go 
to, to really understand what I need to do to be compliant. 
What do I need to do as a trader to meet all those different 
regulations and truly provide that single window experience so 
that we understand what is needed to facilitate the trade?
    Senator Crapo. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the 
information you've provided us and the advice that you've given 
us on that issue. I think we do need to fix it.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. I certainly share your view, Senator Crapo.
    Our next two Senators will be Senator Carper and then 
Senator Cornyn.
    Senator Carper. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Welcome everybody. 
Nice to see you. Thanks for your presence and your input today.
    Last Congress I introduced legislation, along with Senator 
Cornyn, Senator Menendez, and Senator Tim Scott--all members of 
this committee--and it's called the Customs Trade Partnership 
Against Terrorism Pilot Program Act. It has an acronym, as you 
know. I hate acronyms, and I'm inclined not to use one in this 
case, but it was approved--I think unanimously--by both the 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, on which 
I serve, and it was approved by the full Senate, as you may 
recall.
    Our bill would expand a successful program within the 
Customs and Border Protection agency that I'd like to think of 
as kind of like a TSA pre-check, but for goods instead of for 
people.
    A question, if I could, for Mr. Pickel. I love your name. I 
don't know if anybody's told you that today. Makes me smile 
when I say it. And, Ms. Smith, I love your name too, ma'am.
    Ms. Smith. Thank you.
    Senator Carper. In your experience, for both of you, how 
would expanding programs like the one that we're talking about 
here today--the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism 
Pilot Program--improve the efficiency and security of our 
supply chains? And what other measures should we consider here 
in Congress in order to modernize the screening of goods on our 
borders? Mr. Pickel, do you want to go first? I just want to 
say your name again.
    Mr. Pickel. Thank you, sir. I would say any effort to 
expand the participation in the CTPAT--I'll use the acronym--
partnership would be helpful so long as those participants do 
have full control of their supply chain. They would need to 
meet those requirements and understand the limitations of what 
exists within their business models.
    I would say that an important part of reconsidering the 
role of CTPAT would be how can that cadre of willing experts in 
industry be used to tackle new and emerging risks in the 
Customs space; and also, how can we look at the value that 
businesses are getting within their business models, because it 
does require significant resources to participate in these 
programs.
    Senator Carper. All right. Thank you.
    Ms. Smith, any thoughts?
    Ms. Smith. Thank you. My name isn't as quite as interesting 
as my colleague's.
    Senator Carper. You've got a boot on your right foot; are 
you okay?
    Ms. Smith. I am. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Carper. Good. I used to wear one of those.
    Ms. Smith. It's a terrible thing.
    Senator Carper. I broke my foot running a half marathon--on 
the first mile.
    Ms. Smith. I don't have as good a story.
    Senator Carper. All right. But it ended well.
    Ms. Smith. Thank you.
    I think we have an opportunity to take a look at how we use 
Trusted Traders, whether it's the CTPAT program or the 
Authorized Economic Operator programs around the world, and 
really look at the process that we use to facilitate low-risk 
trade. By and large, the members of partnership programs are 
meeting a very high standard for security and for trade 
compliance. And I think we could take a look at the process, 
using a managing-by-account approach, provide more data up 
front, and let the individual transactions, the individual 
shipments which are relatively low-risk, flow through.
    I think that that would set a standard, an international 
standard, and then we can use that for our businesses around 
the world through mutual recognition agreements.
    Senator Carper. All right. Thanks for that.
    One last question, I think. Back to you, Mr. Pickel. 
There's been discussion about the pros and cons of the de 
minimis program, but I want to focus on one specific quirk of 
the program related to the foreign trade zones.
    Every State in our country has at least one foreign trade 
zone, as you know, and Delaware is no exception to that. 
Currently, goods entering the U.S. from other countries are 
eligible to use the de minimis provision. However, goods 
imported through the U.S.-based foreign trades zones into the 
U.S. markets are not. I'm concerned that this disparate 
treatment may have unintended consequences, such as giving 
foreign distributors a cost advantage over distributors located 
in the U.S. foreign trade zones. And this may, in turn, 
incentivize e-commerce operations to be located offshore rather 
than in U.S.-based zones that employ American workers.
    Quick question: in your experience, how do you think the 
U.S. companies would benefit if they could take advantage of de 
minimis when they import goods through foreign trade zones; 
just briefly?
    Mr. Pickel. U.S. companies would benefit from the use of de 
minimis thresholds being applied to entries through foreign 
trade zones. I would say that we would want to work closely 
with you to make sure that that's done in a precise way that 
doesn't have unintended consequences.
    Senator Carper. All right. Thank you. Thank you for your 
brevity and for your testimony.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Carper.
    Senator Cornyn?
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Smith, maybe I'll start with you. The Infrastructure 
Investments and Jobs Act contained about $3.8 billion for CBP, 
including $450 million directly appropriated to CBP, and 
another $3 billion for the General Services Administration that 
can be used for port-of-entry modernization. Would you comment 
on the current state of those facilities--that infrastructure, 
that technology--and what additional investments or what 
additional things that the U.S. Government should do to 
facilitate the flow of legitimate trade and commerce across our 
border? The southern border is what I'm thinking about, 
obviously, coming from Texas.
    Ms. Smith. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. I think we 
have a tremendous opportunity with a huge investment in our 
physical infrastructure. Two points I would make. One, many of 
the ports of entry are constrained by their physical footprint. 
They just don't have room to grow. I do believe, as I mentioned 
in my testimony, we have an opportunity to think about what a 
green lane looks like to facilitate low-risk trade.
    Senator Cornyn. Green lane means you wave it on through, 
right?
    Ms. Smith. Wave it on through. We have good partners, 
compliant partners, low-risk trade. We have the technology. 
Let's apply it to build a process that supports a green lane.
    The second thing I would note is that, as I mentioned in my 
testimony, physical infrastructure isn't the only thing we need 
for the process. The technology and the expertise of the 
Customs personnel are as critical, I believe, as physical 
infrastructure.
    Senator Cornyn. Well, of course, I'm very familiar with the 
men and women in blue who work at our ports of entry along the 
southern border between Mexico and Texas. And frequently when 
we talk about Mexico, when we talk about our southern border, I 
will hear people say we should seal the border, which, if you 
come from Texas, strikes me as very odd. And I guess if you 
think about it, it's pretty odd because Mexico is our single 
largest trading partner, and U.S. companies amount to more than 
half of Mexico's foreign investment.
    So, Ms. Allen, I imagine FedEx does a lot of business in 
Mexico; is that correct?
    Ms. Allen. Yes; we do business in 220 countries around the 
world, so we definitely have a presence in Mexico, and have a 
robust business in Texas, actually operating foreign trade 
zones in Texas, which we support very heavily.
    Senator Cornyn. Me too. Well, I know FedEx has a big 
portfolio, but just focusing now on Mexico, I remember when 
China became fashionable because of the low cost for 
manufacturing in China, and a lot of manufacturing moved from 
Mexico to China. Now we're seeing a reversal of that because of 
concerns about supply chains and because of the rising 
hostility of the Chinese Communist Party, and now we're looking 
for friend-shoring or other friendly places where we can secure 
those supply chains.
    And Mexico, given the fact that they're already a major 
trading partner of the United States, would seem like a logical 
place for those manufacturing facilities to land as part of 
that friend-
shoring. It also strikes me there are other benefits to the 
United States just because our economies and our countries are 
tied together by a common border. And anything we can do to 
help Mexico help itself and prosper and create jobs and 
economic opportunity would take a lot of pressure, I think, off 
of the border itself in terms of illegal migration, but also 
would benefit the United States through increased trading 
opportunities. Would you share some thoughts on that topic?
    Ms. Allen. Firstly, I'll say we are very much in favor of 
trade across the southern border. Our FedEx jobs--we say all of 
our jobs are trade jobs. We have almost 600,000 individuals 
around the world. They are a part of trade, so we have a 
presence in Mexico. I share Ms. Smith's opinion that the 
infrastructure is a challenge on the southern border as well as 
staffing.
    We support additional staffing at the ports. We've found, 
in our experience, that with additional staffing, those ports 
of entry have better outcomes and facilitate trade in a much 
more efficient manner. I also believe that that bidirectional 
education that happens between trade and CBP is a good thing. 
We do meet with our CBP colleagues and the Mexican Customs 
authorities to ensure that we have good working relationships 
to facilitate trade and share best practices and ideas across 
that border every chance we get.
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you very much.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cornyn.
    Next is Senator Tillis.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, when 
I came in, in 2015, I never did a maiden speech, but I thought 
that maybe for this hearing this will be kind of a replacement 
for it.
    The Chairman. All right.
    Senator Tillis. For you all, I thank you for being here. 
Ms. Allen, FedEx was a client of mine back in the 1980s. I 
spent a lot of time in Memphis, and every time I was there, I 
spent a lot of time at Rendezvous too getting some good ribs.
    Mr. Pickel, I know your name is not spelled exactly right, 
but when you get a chance, you ought to take a trip to Mt. 
Olive, the center of the pickle universe and Mt. Olive pickles.
    And to the other witnesses, thank you all. My family has a 
proud tradition of labor membership. I have a brother-in-law 
who started Fruit Growers Express and retired from CSX, and 
another brother-in-law who just recently retired from CSX, and 
other families.
    And, Mr. Pickel, I spent about 10 years of my career as a 
partner at Price Waterhouse in global supply chain management, 
strategic sourcing, offshoring when we had to, and I think we 
have a great opportunity ahead of us. I've heard a lot of great 
ideas from members here on this committee, and I do think the 
focus needs to be on China. There are other bad actors--
actually, we have allies who are bad actors, but I hope that we 
can have a broader view.
    I'll give you an idea of how I think we need to go against 
China and have them notice a whole-of-government, a whole-of-
Congress approach across many committee jurisdictions. Last 
week I met with the DEA, and the transnational criminal 
organizations have completely changed the game on how they 
launder money. They don't go to semi-sophisticated people 
carrying cash around. They go to a global network of banking 
entities that are moving across this globe and laundering 
billions of dollars, known entities that the DEA knows. We need 
to be able to track them down, and we can do that in the 
Banking Committee and maybe here in Finance.
    I have two companies headquartered in North Carolina--one 
is Nucor Steel, which is not a union shop, but a very well-
regarded steel producer--that are being ripped off every single 
day of the year for the last decades. And I've seen some of our 
partners have bad behavior in dumping illegal steel here in 
this country.
    Charlotte Pipe, Mr. Chairman, is a family-owned business in 
downtown Charlotte that has a very sophisticated business, but 
still maintains its old-time foundry image. You can go to a 
province in China, and they have like a Hollywood movie set. It 
looks just like Charlotte Pipe. It's called Charlotte Pipe. 
They print Charlotte Pipe on it, and they dump it in this 
country and other countries. They're one of the biggest 
producers of pipes in the United States. But I think we need to 
let China know we know what they're doing.
    I have a friend, Enes Kanter Freedom. He was an NBA 
standout who basically got fired by the NBA because he stood up 
against the issue of human rights violations against the 
Uyghurs. We need to let them know that they are benefiting from 
literally slave labor and forced imprisonment. We need to let 
them know that we know that they are exploiting our financial 
system. We need to let them know that they're making it unfair 
for union labor to actually compete on a level playing field.
    Can we get all of the links in the supply chain back? 
Absolutely not. And even if we could, we may want to think 
strategically about countries that we do want to have strong 
trading partnerships with, especially in this hemisphere. We 
need to make sure that we have four or five green lanes coming 
across all land ports of entry in Mexico to increase commercial 
traffic there and to get them through here, but also know that 
China is sending precursors to Mexico and poisoning hundreds of 
thousands of people across the globe and killing about 100,000 
people from opioids, fentanyl.
    We need to let them know we know this, and the best way we 
can do that is to have a coordinated effort with the House and 
the Senate and the committees of jurisdiction to say, ``We got 
you. We're going to match you on trade. We're going to compete 
fairly. And we're going to move supply chain links out of China 
to countries we can rely on.''
    And we can't forget how we saw those supply chains break 
down with COVID. So, I think that this is a great opportunity, 
and I believe that there's a huge bipartisan base of people 
here to vote on it. If we have the hearings and we have the 
markups, we can send a message to China that's going to benefit 
the free world, and it's going to benefit free markets. So you 
all can count me in. We'll make sure that we're in touch with 
you all. You can count me in on listening to your priorities, 
because everything I heard in your opening testimony was spot-
on. Count me in to help.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. That was some kind of maiden speech, I'm 
telling you. Well said, Senator Tillis. And for all our guests, 
you really heard just now a capsulized summary of what this is 
all about, and particularly the call for some bipartisanship.
    I understand our friend from Indiana has voted. So what I'm 
going to do is turn this over to him, and then I'm going to try 
and get back as quickly as possible. We've got a list of 
colleagues who may be coming in and out. And I thank you, 
Senator, my friend. Thank you.
    Senator Young [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I 
appreciate your leadership. And I want to thank our witnesses 
for your willingness to appear here today, offer your words of 
wisdom, and share some knowledge about what can be a really 
complex issue.
    Ms. Allen, thank you in particular. We are so grateful for 
the significant presence that FedEx has throughout the State of 
Indiana--in particular, your massive facility in the 
Indianapolis area. It is an amazing city within a city that 
lights up at night and is processing so many shipments, as 
FedEx generally does every day. To be exact, 16 million 
shipments are processed each day. It blows the mind. But a lot 
of Hoosier jobs depend and will depend, as we look into the 
future, on our trade system working effectively. Reducing 
friction where we can, optimizing the systems, all the boring 
stuff of government--that really, really matters to rank and 
file Hoosiers.
    So they've delegated to me to try and sort some of this out 
and improve what we're doing, keep doing what doesn't need to 
be improved. Ms. Allen, can you explain how the international 
express shipping process works at major facilities like FedEx's 
Indianapolis hub? And then I'll give you an opportunity 
momentarily to tell us about the policy changes that have been 
discussed here today and which ones matter most to you.
    Ms. Allen. Thank you, Senator. And I have to say, I grew up 
in Indiana. I actually grew up in Plainfield, IN, which abuts 
the airport, and my high school boyfriend's farm is now the 
FedEx hub facility there--so, near and dear to my heart, and I 
love getting back there.
    Senator Young. Well, he'll be able to see you on YouTube 
now.
    Ms. Allen. That's right.
    Getting shipments in, we take information in from multiple 
sources. Anyone can ship anything anywhere now, and getting 
that information into the systems at the foreign port is really 
critical. They put in that raw information, and we share that 
information with the government. We want to make sure that the 
government, specifically CBP, has an opportunity to understand 
what's coming in to the country, from who, how it's transiting 
into the U.S.
    And when it arrives here, then there's another transfer of 
information on the manifest. So there's a robust amount of 
information for every shipment, regardless of value, as it 
comes into the United States. We then file additional 
information with CBP once the goods are 24 hours out, 
requesting a release, and that means we're telling them this is 
a formal shipment--it's over $2,500 or it's de minimis, it's 
under $800--and file a few more data elements.
    I think it's important to note that the data between a de 
minimis shipment that's under $800 and a shipment that's over 
$800 is just a few data elements for release purposes. So, CBP 
has the opportunity and the information available to make good 
targeting decisions. And in the case of FedEx, we have Customs 
on site in our facilities, and we work hand-in-glove with them 
to make sure that they have the information and access to the 
cargo that they need to, to make those seizures, to identify 
concerning or illicit products.
    We work with them, work with other intelligence agencies as 
well. We welcome them into our facilities because, really, 
there is no place in our network for illegal or illicit 
substances, and we try to do everything we can to work with law 
enforcement to make sure that that is eradicated from our 
system. So, thank you.
    Senator Young. Well, you've gone exactly where I wanted you 
to go. You've painted a picture of a number of forms and 
processes and activities which are essential to your work in 
ensuring that we work together to catch those violations like 
drug trafficking or Chinese counterfeits. And we want to be 
careful, but we want to be bold as we implement policy changes. 
So, would some of the policy changes expressed here today 
improve the process you've laid out, and if so, how? And if 
they'll create challenges, if there are certain ones that you 
have great concerns about, if you could vocalize that to me, it 
would be appreciated.
    Ms. Allen. I think we have a great opportunity before us 
with the Customs modernization. Our written testimony outlined 
seven high-level concepts that we think are great opportunities 
to marry enforcement activities with trade facilitation for 
legal and lawful importers.
    The Trusted Trader system has mainly offered benefits in 
the security and physical areas. We'd like to see that expanded 
from a compliance perspective, and we think there's an 
opportunity to do so. CBP and other government agencies have 
outlined that they would like additional data earlier in that 
process. They want an ability to have access to the data that's 
there. They want to offer companies that want to have a Trusted 
Trader status file that information in an iterative manner as 
it's transmitting through that process that I just spoke 
about--and even before it even becomes a shipment, back to the 
source materials.
    This has a couple of benefits for CBP from an enforcement 
perspective, but also for the trade. If I'm filing information 
all the way back to where that aluminum was actually produced, 
I can prove that I have no forced labor in the supply chain. 
And similarly for trade agreements, if I understand and can 
demonstrate through that filing the origins of those goods, 
it's an automatic qualification for free trade agreements, 
which is an onerous process today to actually qualify those 
goods. So I think there are opportunities for facilitation 
married with that enforcement activity by the delivery of 
Trusted Trader benefits.
    Not everyone is going to be able to do that, specifically 
small and medium enterprises. We help our SMEs a lot, because 
this is not their business. They don't know the international 
laws, and they rely on companies like FedEx to help them 
navigate that process. So I think that you'll find that larger 
companies that do want to do the right thing will participate 
in that, and we'll help our SMEs participate in that trade 
process moving forward.
    Senator Young. Thank you, Ms. Allen. I'm over time, and I'm 
sure my colleagues will have some thoughtful follow-ups. And I 
continue to rediscover the importance of seniority in this 
institution. So, my senior and distinguished colleague from 
Idaho, take the con, as we say in the Navy.
    Senator Crapo [presiding]. Thank you very much, Senator 
Young, and we'll turn it right over to Senator Thune.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks for 
having the hearing today on Customs modernization. I want to 
welcome all of the witnesses.
    In 2015, I led a trade provision with my colleague, Senator 
Wyden, which was included in the Trade Facilitation and Trade 
Enforcement Act--which was the last major Customs bill--and 
that particular provision updated the de minimis threshold for 
imports from $200 for products to $800. The idea behind the 
update was to reduce trade barriers and allow more low-value 
items to be imported into the country duty-free and with fewer 
unnecessary administrative requirements.
    Ms. Allen, in your written testimony, you state that the 
current de minimis provision streamlines trade and benefits 
American consumers, small and large businesses, e-commerce 
platforms, and transportation companies in many sectors of the 
economy. And I know you've touched a little bit on some of the 
issues surrounding that subject, but if you could elaborate on 
the importance of the de minimis provision and why it's so 
critical to American customers and business--and then there is 
a concern among businesses, I would say of all sizes, that that 
threshold could be reduced or even eliminated, as some have 
proposed, and maybe talk about that impact.
    Ms. Allen. Yes, thank you, Senator. De minimis is extremely 
important when you're talking about trade facilitation. Those 
small and medium businesses now have opportunities like they've 
never had before. And if you think about what happened during 
the pandemic, when large-scale shipments had an issue 
transiting through our ports, the e-commerce environment of 
sales was actually exploding and allowing goods to get to 
consumers who didn't have an ability to go out to the stores 
and procure those products.
    So, the de minimis provision actually supports the e-
commerce space to a great degree. We think that it does 
facilitate small and medium businesses and that they're able to 
transit the trade process, which I explained is very complex, 
in a much more streamlined manner.
    I think one of the concerns that I've heard in the industry 
is also the amount of data and the ability of CBP to target 
that. CBP, as I mentioned, does have access to ACAS, which is 
the Air Cargo Advanced Screening data that's filed multiple 
times by air carriers to make sure that the CBP has the 
opportunity to target data, specifically the parties to the 
transaction, when it comes in.
    And then we file a manifest that has more specific data and 
tells Customs where it's coming, where we landed, what's going 
to happen to those goods after the fact, and then we have some 
commercial data that's filed as well. So CBP does have the 
authority, the data, and the opportunity to have enforcement 
actions in the de minimis environment, and specifically in our 
hubs where they're actually located.
    We have a number of seizures that result from that very 
robust targeting process, so I think it's important from a 
small to medium perspective. It's important to continue that 
process for opportunities for the American public.
    Senator Thune. And how about the proposal to change those 
limits?
    Ms. Allen. The proposal to change the limits we would be 
concerned about. We think $800 is a good amount, and I know our 
company worked with you on that provision in TFTEA. The data 
that we see, the average value is much lower than $800. And as 
we are moving that forward, looking at eliminating that--this 
allows companies to not pay a tax. Tariffs are a tax, and the 
de minimis provision has been around for a long time, basically 
to avoid an additional tax on goods coming into the United 
States for small imports, and many of those imports are 
legitimate.
    Senator Thune. I want to hit one other subject here 
quickly, and that has to do with market access, greater market 
access. Better trade facilitation obviously would be a welcomed 
development for U.S. producers and manufacturers as well, but I 
would argue that greater market access would provide some of 
the most durable and outsized results for American businesses 
and workers. So, could you just comment quickly on why it's 
important to expand market access opportunities for American 
exporters--which, according to your written statement, I 
believe, are more than 98 percent small and medium-sized 
businesses?
    Ms. Allen. Yes, the U.S. is a leader. There's no question 
about that. When you go to the WTO, the WCO, those countries 
and those bodies look to the U.S. and say, ``What is the U.S. 
doing?'' So the U.S. has always had a leadership role in market 
expansion, and also Customs modernization activities. CTPAT was 
an idea born in the U.S. and then adopted as the AEO around the 
world, so we have a great opportunity to lead the world in 
market access. And we took a bold step in TFTEA in doing that 
so that we could lead the world in market access and develop 
small and medium-sized businesses, not just here, but globally. 
And that could elevate the economies, not just here, but also 
globally, which is really important. And that de minimis 
provision and its equivalence around the world are critical to 
that.
    Senator Thune. Thank you. And I would add, in terms of the 
trade policy of the current administration, there is really 
zero that I can tell related to market access. There's a whole 
bunch of other things that are being contemplated and 
considered, but that, to me, is the fundamental issue when it 
comes to certainly the ag exporters that I represent.
    Thank you.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell?
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I wanted to ask Mr. Pickel about the Coast Guard 
Authorization Act, which was part of the NDAA bill last year. 
It includes a number of provisions to improve identification 
and enforcement of illegal fishing and forced labor in the 
fishing industry.
    As you know, many agencies have a role in combating this: 
NOAA, CBP, and the Coast Guard. One provision includes the aim 
to improve identification of forced labor at sea by training 
Federal officials so they can identify forced labor on the 
ground. When those officials ultimately identify the forced 
labor, where will that data go? How will we inform law 
enforcement about the flow of those goods?
    Mr. Pickel. Thank you, Senator. So, I'm not familiar, 
personally, as I'm not in that particular position anymore 
within the government. What I would point out to you 
specifically--i.e., fishing concerns--is that there are 
responsibilities spread across several agencies and that there 
are tremendous opportunities to improve information sharing as 
well as joint training programs, particularly between DHS and 
the Department of Commerce and NOAA.
    In that regard, I think that gets to your question in terms 
of making sure that the information is readily available to 
make sure that the identification of suspect shipments is 
specifically identified at the point that it hits U.S. ports.
    Senator Cantwell. You hit on it, and that's what I want--
interagency coordination--because it's a joint effort, and they 
have to share the data and information so that we can grow our 
capacity here.
    Mr. Pickel. And I think one other item I would add to that, 
ma'am, is to identify opportunities for engagement with 
industry so that you're getting the full picture of what that 
industry looks like and how those commodities are coming into 
the U.S. market so that those agencies have the benefit of that 
insight.
    Senator Cantwell. Great. Thank you.
    Ms. Smith, welcome. You have experience, both at CBP and in 
technology issues. Technology can increase Customs clearance 
efficiency in many ways, but you still have to have staffing 
and resources. Do you have a view on the general staffing and 
resources capacity at our Customs clearance at our seaports 
today? Do you have recommendations on what we should do to 
improve that?
    Ms. Smith. I do. And thank you for the question. CBP is 
known by its people in blue, the uniform. But what I would call 
out are the significant number of trade specialists, analysts, 
auditors, and attorneys that sit behind the uniformed force 
that have a lot of the Customs competencies that help ensure 
both trade enforcement and trade facilitation.
    As I noted in my initial statement, the investment in CBP 
workforce writ large since the events of 9/11 has been 
tremendous, but the investment in the nonuniformed trade 
specialists has been relatively minimal, aside from the 
tremendous investment made this past year in the forced labor 
capability. I believe very strongly that the agency needs to 
have the bandwidth to be able to think through what a 
modernized Customs process looks like, to implement the 
regulations, the processes, and the technology. And to do that, 
you not only need to have sufficient numbers of personnel, but 
they need to be well trained in the legal frameworks, but also 
in how modern business works every day. And Cindy Allen 
mentioned the concept of bidirectional education. I think there 
are many companies, including my own, Expeditors of Washington, 
that are interested in working with the government to be sure 
that we understand what the government is looking for and that 
the government understands how business works on a day-to-day 
basis.
    Senator Cantwell. Do you think there's a number there? I 
long ago proposed increasing, at USTR, the number of lawyers, 
because I was like, well, the amount of deals that we're doing 
outside the United States, so if you don't have lawyers to go 
down to Chile or whatever and talk about illegal timber--and so 
we've literally fought for our businesses and consumers because 
we upped the legal capabilities at USTR. Is there some capacity 
bill that we need to do here now for CBP to understand the 
complexity and volume?
    Ms. Smith. Yes, 100 percent. The number that I often use is 
that, during my career in trade over the last 40 years, trade 
has multiplied 32 times. So I think it wouldn't be out of 
consideration to double the Customs workforce. The numbers I 
used when I was at CBP--there are about 3,000 nonuniform 
personnel who do trade on a full-time basis. Doubling that to 
6,000 would make a tremendous difference in their ability to 
modernize, facilitate, and enforce.
    Senator Cantwell. And you're talking about distribution 
throughout the U.S., with the major ports and things of that 
nature, to help catch this illegal activity.
    Ms. Smith. That's right.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
    Senator Blackburn?
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Ms. Allen, 
thank you so much for being here today. Tennesseans are mighty 
proud of FedEx and what they have brought with innovation into 
the logistics industry, and it is quite appropriate that we 
have you before us here today. So, thank you for being here.
    And, Ms. Allen, I want to come to you. You've talked a 
little bit this morning about dealing with data sharing and its 
impacts. And as we look at modernization and really delving a 
little bit into how we avoid a supply chain crisis like we have 
been through, talk for just a minute about the importance of 
protecting that data share, verifying that data share, and 
making certain that rights and responsibilities for that 
transmission are there so that there's accuracy in that 
process.
    I think any of us who've been to the FedEx sort at 
midnight--and if you have never been to the FedEx sort, you 
need to make a trip to Memphis and go through this and see. You 
appreciate the speed and accuracy. So I wanted to give you just 
a moment to drill down a little bit further on that, because 
you all have led that innovation.
    Ms. Allen. Thank you, Senator. And I'm proud to be here 
from FedEx, and it is very nice to have you here.
    We, in our statement, really believe that if you get the 
right data at the right time from the right party, it gives CBP 
and the government the ability to do the right thing and make 
the decisions that they need to make for admissibility.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay, so let's stop right there. It's 
getting the right information in at the right time. So, no 
mistakes on the front end, and then that will speed it along. 
And then I'll come back to you on something else on that. Go 
ahead.
    Ms. Allen. Well, I think that's it. The right data from the 
right party at the right time, and giving that to CBP ahead of 
time, and linking that to Trusted Trader benefits. If you file 
information ahead of time about your products, you should have 
an ability to understand if your goods are going to be stopped 
or if they're going to be released into the United States. And 
the more data that those companies are willing to file, the 
more benefits that they can get.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Now, let me stop right there. How 
do you work with the SMEs and all of these smaller users and 
say, ``This is what is going to get this flagged?'' So how do 
you all work with them? And, Mr. Pickel, I'm going to come to 
you next on this, okay?
    Ms. Allen. We work very collaboratively with our small and 
medium-sized enterprises. We have an education role, and we 
work with the Department of Commerce quite closely to get that 
information in the hands of the small and medium importers so 
that they can understand the complex processes and the 
information that they need to provide to make sure their goods 
are imported in an efficient and compliant manner. We're not 
necessarily educating them on what to do, but we're educating 
them on the law and how it applies to their products, because 
most people don't really understand that. They're in the 
process of manufacturing or in selling their goods. They are 
not experts in Customs law, and that's the opportunity that we 
have, along with our government partners, to help them 
understand that and to assist when they have issues with that.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay.
    Now, Mr. Pickel, I wanted to come to you. I've appreciated 
your comments today, and I know Senator Crapo touched on drugs 
very briefly. And I think we're all astounded with the amounts 
of drugs that were apprehended at our ports.
    We do know there's a lot of bad actors out there. We do 
know that they seem to be emboldened right now. Talk a little 
bit, if you will, about first of all, how you segregate, how 
you say, ``These are questionable shippers; these are people 
who are following the rules and are trying to get that 
education?'' And what is that red flag for CBP?
    Mr. Pickel. That's a great question. And what I would say 
is that we need to acknowledge on the front end that the vast 
majority of parties importing to the United States are 
tremendously compliant, right? So, when you're looking at 
segmenting risks, in the cargo environment particularly, 
information is key--but the right information is key, to Ms. 
Allen's point.
    And information provided to CBP provides a very good basis 
to be able to understand the nature of a shipment that's 
happening. There are companies that go above and beyond to 
really open their books up to the government and say, ``Here 
are our processes.'' And the government will help CBP, through 
the CTPAT program, to help them to understand vulnerabilities.
    That information needs to be shared early in the supply 
chain process so that those compliant parties can take their 
own actions to root out any causes of concern before we get to 
a port, right, before we get into an enforcement scenario.
    Senator Blackburn. Excellent. My time's expired.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Whitehouse, and then Senator Menendez and others 
may come, but we had so many people waiting that I want to make 
sure that Senator Whitehouse and Senator Menendez could be 
next, okay?
    Senator Whitehouse. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    There was a famous thesis not long ago about the world 
being engaged in a clash of civilizations, and I tend to 
subscribe to that thesis, but I think its author got the 
boundary, the line of contact if you will, wrong. I think the 
clash of civilizations that we are in is between rule-of-law 
regimes and regimes that are criminal, kleptocratic, and 
autocratic. And one of the perils that we on the rule-of-law 
side of that clash of civilizations face is the support within 
rule-of-law jurisdictions for assets amassed by the 
kleptocrats, the autocrats, and the criminals, who know that if 
they leave it at home, some bigger kleptocrat, autocrat, or 
criminal is going to come and steal it. So they come and seek 
refuge behind rule of law and they seek that refuge in 
anonymity.
    In order to get those assets where they want to hide them, 
money laundering is the best tool, and there are lots of ways 
we hunt down money laundering. And I want to thank Senator 
Crapo for his leadership in the beneficial ownership battle 
that we had, so that U.S. shell corporations are no longer such 
an obvious tool for money launderers and kleptocrats and 
criminals. But trade-based money laundering has now emerged as 
a means of accomplishing this foul purpose.
    And trade-based money laundering is a little bit difficult 
to track, because the symbol of it may be a perfectly innocuous 
package of goods that is perfectly legal in every respect. And 
if you were to take that package apart and inspect every part 
of it, you would find no contraband and nothing wrong. But 
let's say it was a $750,000 set of goods. If the bill for it 
that went to pay for it was for $7,500,000 or if it was for 
$750, the margin is probably a way of laundering money across 
borders.
    And I'm very interested in that context, particularly, Ms. 
Smith, from you, with how we get--and I'm working with Senator 
Cassidy on this, and I want to signal his leadership on this 
issue first. But what are the things that we can do, and how 
can we continue to work with you to figure out the things we 
can do to solve this without creating a bureaucratic and 
reporting nightmare for people for whom it just is a $750,000 
package of perfectly innocent goods for which they paid 
$750,000.
    Ms. Smith. A very interesting issue and very timely, 
Senator, but it is tough to find. The scope that trade-based 
money launderers work against is $32 trillion worth of trade 
last year; so, a huge range of opportunity for them.
    When we talk about trade-based money laundering, we're 
really talking about the evasion of Customs laws, and so 
expertise in those laws----
    Senator Whitehouse. Although, kind of in a strange way, 
because the delivered product itself might fall totally within 
the Customs laws----
    Ms. Smith. Absolutely.
    Senator Whitehouse [continuing]. Be completely legal and 
innocuous. It's only when the payment moves, and it isn't 
commensurate with the goods that then the problem comes.
    Ms. Smith. That's right. And there are a number of creative 
ways to evade Customs laws. And so, having individuals at CBP 
and other U.S. Government agencies that work with financial 
flows is really critical. So, I would talk about expertise. I 
would talk about having the capacity, the number of boots on 
the ground to actually investigate trade-based money 
laundering, both on the civil side and the criminal side--so at 
CBP and Homeland Security Investigations--and I think a free 
flow of information among U.S. Government agencies first, and 
then second, their international counterparts, because it's not 
a crime that's limited here to the U.S. These flows go all over 
the world.
    Senator Whitehouse. Well, I look forward to continuing to 
work with you on it. I would like to be a good ally to Senator 
Cassidy as we try to solve this problem, and I think getting it 
right will save people a lot of trouble, compared to setting up 
systems that don't catch what we want to catch. Thanks very 
much.
    Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Menendez--and my schedule is pretty 
tight. We're going to have another vote. Unless there are other 
members who come very quickly after Senator Menendez, we're 
going to wrap up.
    Senator Menendez?
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    One of CBP's most important jobs is to safeguard Americans 
from the importation of counterfeit products. These products 
cannot only cost hardworking Americans their jobs and money, 
they can be dangerous, as we saw during the pandemic with the 
huge influx of counterfeit COVID-19 items.
    Mr. Meserve, Mr. Nova, can you talk about how failing to 
crack down on counterfeit goods harms U.S. workers?
    Mr. Meserve. I know of a case a few years ago where Chinese 
companies were sending in primary aluminum in the form of a 
pilot or in some type of shipping arrangement, and then it was 
getting sold and remelted and brought into the country that 
way. What we make at my plant is what we call a ``sow.'' It is 
an internationally recognized good. It's got a shape, a size, a 
weight, and an LME-set price for that. And we have to work 
within that margin of price point to be profitable. And if 
somebody's bringing in a good that's in the wrong shape or 
wrongly marked or mislabeled, then yes, it definitely hurts.
    Senator Menendez. Mr. Nova, do you have any insight on 
that?
    Mr. Nova. I'd just say it is part, I think, of the broadest 
challenge we face, which is that we have a trading system that 
frequently allows goods produced illegally overseas to be 
imported and sold here. Whether that illegality is in the 
context of counterfeiting, or the use of forced labor, we need 
a much more aggressive approach policing that trade to ensure 
that people cannot benefit from abuse of unlawful conditions 
overseas by selling products in the U.S.
    Senator Menendez. This issue is only growing. According to 
the most recent report on intellectual property rights 
seizures, in Fiscal Year 2021 CBP seized more than $3.3 billion 
worth of counterfeit goods, compared to $1.3 billion in Fiscal 
Year 2020--so almost three times as much. The report indicates 
that China and Hong Kong account for more than half of the 
products seized.
    Ms. Smith, how can we better combat the influx of 
counterfeit products from countries like China?
    Ms. Smith. Two things, Senator. I think, one, the continued 
partnership between the government and the private sector, 
particularly the rights holders. They know their business. They 
know their products, and they can help educate and collect 
intelligence on the ground, which is useful to the government 
as they target counterfeit shipments.
    I think the second thing that we have to be sure of is that 
the U.S. Government has the ability to enforce its penalties on 
overseas actors. That can be a challenge. The enforcement 
process is lengthy, and it often does result in not being able 
to collect the penalty, collect the additional duties because 
they can't reach the individual that caused the importation in 
the first place.
    Senator Menendez. Well, we'll have to look at that. That 
has a little bit of a potential foreign relations aspect. We'll 
have to look at that.
    The goal of tariffs is to pressure foreign governments to 
live up to their commitment to American workers and companies 
by forcing foreign producers to make price concessions or lose 
customers. However, too often when tariffs are imposed, they 
end up punishing U.S. importers with goods that are already in 
transit.
    Ms. Allen, Mr. Pickel, is it fair or effective trade policy 
to impose tariffs on goods that are already in transit when the 
tariffs are announced?
    Ms. Allen. Thank you, Senator, for the question. I will 
tell you, as someone who has to apply those tariffs at the time 
of entry, it's a very complex environment today. Some dates for 
tariffs or other trade actions happen at time of export, some 
at time of arrival, some at time of entry, which can be 
different dates, and it's complex. So we'd like to have an 
opportunity to streamline that, also have predictability for 
our customers to know that additional tariffs are going to be 
applied to their goods before they're shipped. That way they 
have better predictability to contain those costs and 
understand how it's going to impact their operations in the 
U.S.
    Senator Menendez. Mr. Pickel?
    Mr. Pickel. Senator, no, it's not fair to have those 
surprises that are impacting not only American businesses, but 
also American consumers as well. Those business decisions and 
purchasing decisions are made well in advance of the 
finalization of the tariff actions, and I believe the action 
you're suggesting would be appropriate.
    Senator Menendez. That's why Senator Cassidy and I 
introduced the Fair Tariff Act in the last Congress. It would 
exempt goods that are already in transit from additional 
tariffs and require a standardized 60 days notice before new 
tariffs take effect. That would ensure that the burden of 
tariffs falls on their intended targets and not on innocent 
imports.
    And so I think, Mr. Chairman, a consistent standard that 
protects goods on the water from surprise tariffs benefits 
importers without compromising the effectiveness of our trade 
policy, and we look forward to working with Senator Cassidy and 
with you, hopefully, to move it forward.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Menendez, your leadership with 
Senator Cassidy is much appreciated. This is an extraordinarily 
important issue, and I look forward to working with you. And 
Senator Crapo and I have been saying throughout this that it's 
going to be a bipartisan issue.
    I want to say to our guests that it's a pretty hectic time 
right now; otherwise, I would make a profound closing address. 
This is an extraordinarily important issue. This is not an 
abstraction. In other words, you have these debates about trade 
policies and trade rules, and it sounds like a lot of alphabet 
soup and the like, but it's really about--as Mr. Meserve talked 
about--the hopes of all these working families that, if they 
can just get a level playing field, they're going to be in a 
position to out-compete anybody anywhere. And so, that's what 
it's about.
    We've got a lot of work to do. You'll hear more about this 
soon as we evaluate the responses from the big automobile 
companies. There we're talking about thousands and thousands of 
workers, and we are not going to sit around and see forced 
labor undercut their hopes, as Mr. Meserve was talking about. 
And we'll have more to say shortly.
    I'm going to close by saying that Senator Brown, of course, 
has been a critical leader in stopping forced labor and 
leveling the playing field for U.S. workers. He couldn't be 
here. He's home in Ohio advocating for the people of East 
Palestine, who are facing an environmental disaster. He's got 
questions for witnesses that we'll submit for the record. And 
we look forward to your answers. It's also a process of the 
Senate Finance Committee that the questions for the record will 
be due in a week, on Thursday, February 23rd, I think.
    I thank all of you. I thank my colleagues. We're going to 
tackle this in a bipartisan way.
    And with that, the Finance Committee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:21 p.m., the hearing was concluded.]

     Prepared Statement of Cindy Allen, Vice President, Regulatory 
                Affairs and Compliance, FedEx Logistics
    Every day, in every corner of the world, FedEx is connecting 
communities, moving goods, and providing services that power the global 
economy. FedEx fuels innovation, creates and supports local jobs, and 
helps lift individuals and their communities. That's why FedEx believes 
a connected world is a better world. At FedEx, trade is our business. 
Trade is the lifeblood of the global economy, and FedEx plays a 
critical role in expanding global trade, helping to build nimble supply 
chains, and delivering local products and services to customers around 
the world. We believe everyone benefits when it is easier to bring new 
ideas and products to the global market. Expanding global trade is 
essential to our customers, our team members, and the economy. We see 
the value of trade every day: our more than 500,000 global employees 
(410,000 in the United States) move an average of 16 million shipments 
daily, serving more than 220 countries and territories.

    In the United States, FedEx provides delivery services to every 
U.S. ZIP code and accounts for nearly 6 percent of employees in the 
U.S. transportation and postal and courier services sectors. In Fiscal 
Year 2022 (FY22), FedEx spent nearly $45 billion with our U.S.-based 
supply chain partners, and in Tennessee alone, FedEx spent $257.3 
million with local suppliers in the first three quarters of FY22. FedEx 
plays a crucial role in the U.S. supply chain that keeps this country, 
our people, and economy moving. We are immensely proud of our global 
efforts to combat COVID-19, and in the United States alone we have 
delivered hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses and boosters, 
as well as ancillary kits and other essential supplies. And when the 
trade disruptions stemming from COVID-19 congested ports in the U.S., 
FedEx participated in the White House Supply Chain Disruptions Task 
Force to help develop solutions to stabilize supply chain disruptions 
to get trade moving again.

    American prosperity is linked to growing markets and greater 
opportunities for U.S. companies, especially small and medium 
businesses, which comprise more than 98 percent of U.S. exporters.\1\ 
More than 40 million American jobs--roughly 1 in 5--depend on trade, 
and trade is critical to the success of many sectors of the U.S. 
economy.\2\ With 95 percent of the world's population and 80 percent of 
its purchasing power outside our borders, global trade will continue to 
be of critical importance to U.S. economic growth.

    It is not just exports that benefit the American economy, but 
imports as well. Imports bring lower prices and more choices for 
American families as household budgets are increasingly stretched. 
Access to imports boosts the purchasing power of the average American 
household by about $18,000 annually.\3\ Imports also give Americans 
access to products that would not otherwise be available--for example, 
fresh fruit in the winter. It is not only consumers that benefit from 
imports, but also U.S. companies that depend on imports for raw 
materials and other inputs. In fact, nearly 60 percent of U.S. 
merchandise imports are raw materials, capital goods and industrial 
products, which are used by U.S. manufacturers and farmers to produce 
goods in the United States.\4\ This lowers costs for manufacturers and 
other businesses and helps them be more competitive globally. If the 
U.S. hopes to strengthen its manufacturing base, it must have efficient 
and reliable access to imported components from around the world.

Trade_and_American_Jobs_

    The rise of global e-commerce represents a sea change in the 
profile of global trade. The trade landscape is shifting from 
container-based trade between large multinational corporations to 
package-based trade between businesses and individual consumers. Put 
simply, the global supply chain is more complex and has many more 
participants. This shift presents unprecedented opportunities to make 
global trade more inclusive by enabling small and medium-sized 
businesses (SMEs) to participate in the global economy. But it also 
presents challenges for governments as they grapple with the impact of 
increased volumes of low-value shipments and their responsibilities for 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
revenue collection and border safety and security.

    Against this backdrop, FedEx supports the U.S. Government in its 
efforts to update its Customs rules and adapt to a changing trade 
environment. We welcomed the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) 
initiative in its 21st Century Customs Framework (21CCF) to address 
modern trade challenges and opportunities and have been engaging in the 
21CCF process since its inception.

    Given the increased number of trade participants globally, the 
first goal of any Customs modernization proposal must be to properly 
define the roles and responsibilities of these new actors. As the U.S. 
government begins to assess what new information should be required for 
importation, it must remain focused on requiring the right data, at the 
right time, from the right party. Rules requiring additional data from 
new stakeholders must ensure that gaps in data availability or 
transmission do not lead to bottlenecks at U.S. ports. Responsibility 
for the accuracy of data should be appropriately assigned to the party 
most responsible for the creation and retention of that data. In 
addition, new legislation should not delegate unfettered authority to 
government agencies. Any new authorities should include appropriate 
guardrails to prevent unnecessary burdens on companies and supply 
chains in the name of data collection.

    Governments around the world look to the United States for 
leadership and as a provider of global best practices. The United 
States must be mindful that new approaches to importing processes could 
be adopted by other countries. Therefore, the United States should, 
when considering new requirements on U.S. imports, ask whether U.S. 
exporters, especially SMEs, would support the same requirements being 
placed on their exports by third countries.

    A truly successful Customs modernization needs a ``co-creation'' 
approach, where the public and private sectors identify the challenges, 
they are trying to address and leverage best practices to develop 
feasible joint solutions. While CBP deserves credit for its outreach 
efforts on 21CFF to date, more in-depth and widespread engagement of 
the private sector is needed as the agency fills in the details behind 
its goals. Moreover, most of the discussion has focused on increased 
trade controls and enforcement, and very little on trade facilitation. 
Any Customs modernization effort should balance grants of additional 
authority to border agencies with appropriate guardrails and trade 
facilitations to receive support from industry. Described more fully 
below are some of the trade facilitative measures that FedEx supports 
including in such an effort.

          Achieving a Government-Wide Policy Approach to Accompany the 
        Single Window: The International Trade Data System (ITDS) as 
        outlined in the original Customs Modernization Act, has been 
        achieved with the delivery of the Automated Commercial 
        Environment (ACE), establishing the technical side of 
        intergovernmental operability with one single window for all 
        agencies who have the authority to regulate the importation and 
        exportation of goods. Unfortunately, this has become a 47-paned 
        window due to various policy, procedures, and processes 
        established by each agency. Customs modernization should define 
        a government-wide decision making, policy, and authority 
        process that is centralized and coordinated with CBP. This 
        policy and coordination approach could be achieved through a 
        council such as the Border Interagency Executive Council 
        (BIEC). Regardless of the mechanism, the authority to make and 
        drive decisions must reside within this forum. Additionally, 
        trade participation to assist in guiding in a manner that is 
        achievable in current and future trade processes should be 
        included.

          Enabling Global Entry for Cargo: Shipments have a history 
        when they arrive at the border. Government agencies, 
        specifically CBP, have expressed an interest in receiving the 
        critical data associated with the shipment to assist with 
        targeting purposes and allow better informed admissibility 
        decisions. An iterative or progressive filing of data should be 
        codified and developed to allow the best party, with access to 
        the relevant data, to file it at the earliest available time, 
        building the data for each shipment until the arrival at the 
        border. This should be linked to Trusted Trader and Authorized 
        Economic Operator (AEO) benefits, such as admissibility 
        decisions that the trade can rely upon, qualifying of certain 
        free trade agreement benefits, and ensuring a secure and 
        compliant supply chain. This program would be in addition to 
        the information already filed for security purposes, especially 
        in the air environment.

          Limiting Redelivery Authority: Outdated language allows CBP 
        to recall goods up to 60 days after admissibility decisions are 
        made. This authority was vested in old statues around quota and 
        visa transshipment concerns that do not exist today. Today, 
        with the speed of cargo delivery, especially when it is direct 
        to the consumer, it is almost impossible to redeliver something 
        to CBP custody outside of 24 hours. This redelivery authority 
        should be removed except in cases that post safety and security 
        concerns.

          Establishing Timelines for Government Response: In most 
        circumstances, the trade is bound by defined timelines, yet 
        there are few timelines CBP is bound by. This leads to 
        uncertainty for U.S. businesses as they try to move forward 
        with business planning and product launches and causes 
        financial uncertainty. The Customs modernization effort should 
        establish reasonable timelines for CBP to respond to trade 
        actions and requests such as petitions, protests, advice, and 
        Customs rulings. If a decision is not produced within the 
        timeline, it should be considered an affirmative response for 
        the trade. Holding agencies accountable to provide timely 
        decisions should be a key part of this legislation.

          Further Facilitating the Informal Entry Procedures: The 
        United States Congress should expand the United States' global 
        leadership in facilitating trade by focusing on the informal 
        entry process, those shipments currently between $800-$2,500. 
        Congress should raise the $2,500 ceiling to a more competitive 
        baseline, while granting CBP the regulatory authority to raise 
        it further. For informal entries, a ``bucket'' system for 
        Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) classification for eligible 
        shipments, e.g., a limited number of classifications instead of 
        the 10,000+ tariff lines should be adopted. Excluded from 
        ``bucketing'' would be shipments subject to ``restricted'' 
        goods where 10-digit HTS codes are required. Further, for those 
        highly integrated networks like express carriers, a simplified 
        release by presentation of commercial invoices should be 
        allowed. Since a bucket system for HTS codes would be utilized 
        to further simplify the process, Congress should expand who can 
        file these informal entries to include nominal consignees like 
        carriers (as currently permitted for de minimis entries).

          Codifying the Express Delivery Sector: To recognize the 
        express delivery process is a unique procedure for providing 
        expedited clearance of shipments based on longstanding success 
        and shared responsibility, including the investments the 
        express industry has made to ensure it meets all Government 
        requirements for data accuracy and completeness, the express 
        delivery sector must be codified. The codification of the 
        express delivery clearance process will allow for:

                <ctr-circle>  A single submission of information, a 
                manifest, covering all goods contained in an express 
                shipment;

                <ctr-circle>  Expedited release of these shipments 
                based on the minimum documentation of a single 
                submission of information; and

                <ctr-circle>  Consolidated entries.

          Codifying the Express Carrier's Right to File De Minimis 
        Entries and Establish a Waiver for the Express Carriers From 
        More Burdensome Requirements When Filing De Minimis Entries: 
        Currently, the express industry's right to file de minimis 
        shipments was created by regulation a long time ago and, for 
        the reasons discussed above, this process should be codified in 
        statute. Further, the hundreds of millions of dollars of 
        investment the express industry has made to segregate Partner 
        Government Agency (PGA) regulated items from its manifest 
        should be considered as a justification for waiving the 
        requirement to provide an HTS code for de minimis shipments in 
        any future CBP rulemaking.

    Regardless of any legislative proposal, Congress should take into 
account competitive considerations. Any new requirements must apply 
equally to express and international mail shipments. We recognize to 
modernize the Customs process, CBP needs additional funding to support 
initiatives like the development of ACE 2.0 to meet the technological 
challenges of the future. Therefore, we support additional funding 
streams to dedicate more funding to CBP. Specific ideas include a 
higher percentage of Merchandise Processing Fee collections made 
directly available to CBP, a charge for each Entry Type 86 Pilot entry 
(with 100 percent of collected proceeds going to CBP for its costs 
incurred for processing those entries), and a revival of the Customs 
Forfeiture Fund, or alternatively creating a new fund of a similar 
nature, to be used exclusively for CBP enhancements of this variety.

    Lastly, FedEx would like to highlight the importance of a current 
feature of the U.S. Customs laws that facilitates trade: the United 
States' strong de minimis provision. De minimis simplifies and 
streamlines documentation, expedites border processes, and eliminates 
duties and taxes, which is a significant trade facilitation measure 
that benefits U.S. consumers, large and small businesses, e-
commerce platforms, transportation companies, and many other sectors of 
the U.S. economy. For example, e-commerce SME customers like Greentop 
Gifts, a Black woman-owned business based in Atlanta, GA, and AnaOno, a 
woman-owned, Philadelphia, PA-based business, rely on this simplified 
process in delivering their products.

    Established by Congress decades ago, de minimis is a longstanding 
and key feature of the U.S. import system. Congress looked at the issue 
recently when it raised the level to $800 in 2016 via the Trade 
Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (TFTEA). This was a deliberate 
policy choice Congress got right. As TFTEA explains, the higher de 
minimis value thresholds provide ``significant economic benefits to 
businesses and consumers in the United States and the economy of the 
United States through costs savings and reductions in trade transaction 
costs.''

    Connecting people with goods, services, ideas, and technologies 
creates opportunities that fuel innovation, energize businesses, and 
lift communities to higher standards of living. At FedEx, we believe a 
connected world is a better world, and that belief guides everything we 
do. A modernized Customs process is key to this.

    We would be honored to invite this committee and its staff to visit 
the largest Customs clearance port of entry in the United States, the 
Memphis International Airport, where our FedEx Express World Hub is 
located.

           Questions Submitted for the Record to Cindy Allen
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo
    Question. Congress is grappling with the problem of supply chain 
delays. FedEx and others played a critical role during the pandemic to 
facilitate the movement of goods.

    How would some of the proposals mentioned in your opening statement 
alleviate the hurdles the shipping industry now faces at our borders?

    Answer. Thank you for your leadership on this issue. The World 
Customs Organization (WCO) measures the performance of the Customs 
processes across countries using time release studies. The WCO 
describes this methodology as ``a strategic and internationally 
recognized tool to measure the actual time required for the release 
and/or clearance of goods, from the time of arrival until the physical 
release of cargo, with a view to finding bottlenecks in the trade flow 
process and taking necessary measures to improve the effectiveness and 
efficiency of border procedures.''\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/facilitation/instrument-and-
tools/tools/time-release-study.aspx.

    Trade facilitation lowers the time in which it takes to clear goods 
through the various border agencies. By giving CBP and other U.S. 
border agencies the tools to release and clear goods more efficiently, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
release times will decrease as the movement of goods is facilitated.

    There is an opportunity to create a new program for cargo 
facilitation akin to CBP's Global Entry program for travelers. 
Government agencies, specifically CBP, have expressed an interest in 
receiving the critical data associated with shipments to assist with 
targeting purposes and allow better informed admissibility decisions. 
An iterative or progressive filing of data should be codified and 
developed to allow the best party, with access to the relevant data, to 
file it at the earliest available time, building the data for each 
shipment until the arrival at the border.

    This should be linked to Trusted Trader and Authorized Economic 
Operator (AEO) benefits, such as admissibility decisions that the trade 
can rely upon, qualifying of certain free trade agreement benefits, and 
ensuring a secure and compliant supply chain. This program would be in 
addition to the information already filed for security purposes, 
especially in the air environment.

    Another area to explore to alleviate release times is the 
Government-wide policy concerning the single window. The International 
Trade Data System (ITDS), as outlined in the original Customs 
Modernization Act, has been achieved with the delivery of the Automated 
Commercial Environment (ACE), establishing the technical side of 
intergovernmental operability with one single window for all agencies 
who have the authority to regulate the importation and exportation of 
goods.

    Unfortunately, as I outlined in my testimony, this has become a 47-
paned window due to various policy, procedures, and processes 
established by each agency. Customs modernization should define a 
government-wide decision-making, policy, and authority process that is 
centralized and coordinated with CBP. Strengthening the original 
Customs Modernization Act regarding ITDS to address the application of 
the single window may achieve this result. Regardless of the mechanism, 
the authority to make and drive decisions must reside within this 
forum. Additionally, trade participation to assist in guiding in a 
manner that is achievable in current and future trade processes should 
be included. Such improved coordination will alleviate the hurdles 
often faced when shipping goods regulated by those other (non-CBP) 
agencies.

    Question. I share your concerns about undue delays and a lack of 
responsiveness from government agencies. As you outlined in your 
opening statement, nearly 60 percent of U.S. merchandise imports are 
raw materials used by American manufacturers. Businesses rely on the 
timely delivery of these inputs.

    From a business perspective, what would be a reasonable timeline 
for CBP to respond to trade actions and requests?

    Answer. In most circumstances, the trade is bound by defined 
timelines, yet there are few timelines CBP is bound by. This leads to 
uncertainty for U.S. businesses as they try to move forward with 
business planning and product launches and causes financial 
uncertainty. The Customs modernization effort should establish 
reasonable timelines for CBP to respond to trade actions and requests 
such as petitions, protests, advice, and advanced rulings. Holding 
agencies accountable to provide timely decisions should be a key part 
of this legislation.

    The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) put out the following 
standard for Customs authorities to issue advanced rulings: ``as 
expeditiously as possible and in no case later than 120 days after it 
has obtained all necessary information from the person requesting an 
advance ruling[.]''\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ USMCA, Article 7.5.6(c).

    CBP should set similar deadlines for other agency decisions such as 
those related to protests, petitions, applications for further review, 
and penalty determinations, coupled with a default rule under which, 
when CBP fails to respond by the deadline, the decision's outcome is 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
then decided, by operation of law, in favor of the trader.

    The lack of timeliness has real-world effects. For example, 
outdated statutory language currently allows CBP to recall goods up to 
60 days after admissibility decisions are made. This so-called 
redelivery authority was created in statutes concerned with quota and 
visa transshipment concerns that do not exist today. Today, with the 
speed of cargo delivery, e.g., the speed required by manufacturers when 
importing intermediary goods to incorporate into their manufacturing 
processes, it is almost impossible to redeliver something to CBP 
custody outside of 24 hours. This authority should be removed for 
normal cases, with the timeline shortened in exceptional cases that 
pose safety or security concerns.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
    Question. The U.S. marketplace has been flooded with counterfeit 
merchandise, often originating from China.

    Knockoffs not only violate intellectual property rights; they also 
threaten the economy and consumer safety. Unfortunately, as consumers 
rely more on online shopping, bad actors are finding new ways to 
exploit legitimate channels to box out businesses and dupe consumers 
with bogus products.

    In 2019, as chairman of this committee, I led an effort to crack 
down on counterfeit goods entering the United States by modernizing the 
Trade Enforcement and Trade Facilitation Act and expanding U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection's (CBP) authority to share information with 
rights holders and other interested parties on suspected counterfeit 
merchandise.

    After then-Ranking Member Wyden and I released a bipartisan 
committee report studying counterfeit goods sold online and their 
effect on businesses and consumers, we found that improved information 
sharing between CBP and its private-sector partners would aid efforts 
to identify and curtail the sale of counterfeit imports, some of which 
may pose significant health and safety threats to consumers. Namely, 
and most pressing of which, is fentanyl--which is coming from China and 
destroying our communities.

    You note in your testimony that the rise of global e-commerce 
presents profound new challenges for the responsibility of governments 
to collect revenue and enforce safety and security.

    What regulatory steps could Congress take to give logistics 
providers and entities such as FedEx the information and tools they 
need to ensure they aren't contributing to the destruction of our 
communities by trafficking deadly drugs like fentanyl?

    Answer. Thank you for your questions on this very important topic. 
The safety of our team members, customers, and the communities we serve 
is our top priority at FedEx.

    FedEx has extensive security measures in place to deter and detect 
the use of our networks for illegal purposes. We follow the laws and 
regulations everywhere we do business and have a history of close 
cooperation with authorities.

    U.S. express delivery companies such as FedEx Express are pioneers 
in providing advanced electronic data to Customs authorities, beginning 
with our industry's groundbreaking work in the 1980's with the U.S. 
Customs Service. That work began a longstanding and productive 
relationship with CBP in addressing the agency's data needs. For 
example, immediately after 9/11, the express industry began to provide 
advanced cargo manifest information earlier than carriers in other 
modes. After the Yemen bomb plot in 2010, the express industry worked 
with CBP to co-create the Air Cargo Advanced Screening (ACAS) pilot 
program which, after running for several years without major hiccups, 
now forms the basis for CBP's ACAS regulations. More recently, the 
express companies have joined CBP's section 321 Data Pilot as the 
agency explores the need for new data elements in light of e-commerce's 
growth.

    We welcome CBP's extension of the Pilot into 2025 because, based on 
our conversations with CBP, we believe there are outstanding issues in 
how future regulations would work. For the same reason, we support 
expanding the pilot to include more members to capture more e-commerce 
business models. Doing so will allow CBP to determine the right data it 
needs to enhance targeting, which party is best positioned to provide 
that data, and at what time that data is most useful.

    Against this backdrop, we support the concept of advanced 
electronic data in a very real and hands-on way. We believe we can 
continue to play a constructive role in this space. Bidirectional and 
actionable information exchanged between the government and the trade 
could provide further insight into the opportunities to prevent the 
introduction of the goods that violate U.S. law.

    To the extent CBP lacks data under the current framework, the focus 
should be on the international postal system. While the STOP Act aimed 
to close this gap in U.S. law, CBP still grants waivers to dozens of 
countries as far as we know, leaving the agency without data on postal 
shipments from the vast majority of origin countries.

    Question. Do you have any other thoughts about ways to responsibly 
regulate the air cargo market and e-commerce in a way that cracks down 
on counterfeit goods?

    Answer. We support a comprehensive approach that looks at entire 
supply chain. This includes enhanced information sharing, moving in 
both directions, between CBP and IP rights holders. For example, we 
support the concept of a government-issued ``bad actors'' of IPR 
violators. Such a government-issued list (populated with distinct and 
specific targets, identified based on name, address, city, and country, 
etc.) could be highly effective in improving the interdiction of non-
compliant shipments.

    This is another area where policymakers must continue to stress the 
importance of equal treatment between the various air cargo modes, 
ensuring that postal shipments are subjected to the same treatment as 
the others. Failing to do so creates competitive imbalances and gives 
illicit traders the ability to exploit regulatory differences to their 
advantage.

                Question Submitted by Hon. Bill Cassidy
    Question. In testimony on February 16th, you indicated that de 
minimis was created to allow small businesses to avoid ``tariffs'' 
which, you stated, are taxes. However, the legal definition of de 
minimis is ``too small to be meaningful or taken into consideration; 
immaterial.'' The purpose of de minimis was to alleviate Customs and 
border protection of having to spend effort on small packages, mostly 
coming in with tourists returning with presents for example. However, 
since 2016 when the de minimis threshold was increased to $800, 
packages coming into the U.S. under de minimis are approaching 1 
billion a year. Though, because CBP has no information on contents, we 
will never know the value, The Wall Street Journal estimated the value 
to be at $67 billion. Other estimates are higher, even up to $150 
billion. According to CBO, this ``tax cheat'' is at least $10 billion a 
year.

    Does FedEx consider 1 billion packages to be trade that is ``too 
small to be meaningful or taken into consideration?''

    Does FedEx consider a $67- to $150-billion trade envelope to be 
``immaterial''? Does FedEx believe that a $150-billion industry should 
be able to avoid taxation? Do you think that the Federal Government has 
the responsibility to close tax loopholes identified by industry in 
public hearings?

    Answer. Thank you for your continued interest in Customs 
modernization. De minimis is not a loophole, but a deliberate policy 
that Congress codified into law. Not only does the law save taxpayer 
money on administrative costs to collect nominal duties, but Congress 
rightly identified that the law provides ``significant economic 
benefits to businesses and consumers in the United States and the 
economy of the United States through costs savings and reductions in 
trade transaction costs.''\3\ This remains true today.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ See Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 
(TFTEA), sec. 901(a)(2), Pub. L. No. 114-125 (2016).

    The international trade community recognizes the importance of a de 
minimis provision, as it is included in the World Trade Organization's 
Trade Facilitation Agreement, the World Customs Organization's 
Immediate Release Guidelines, and numerous U.S. trade agreements as a 
best practice. In fact, a recent study demonstrates that global 
adoption of U.S. trade facilitative measures found in U.S. trade 
agreements, including de minimis, would save the U.S. $88 billion in 
trade costs and lead to almost a million new jobs created across all 50 
States.\4\ U.S. exporters recognize the value of these provisions in 
foreign markets, which is why Congress rightfully noted in Trade 
Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) that the U.S. 
``should encourage other countries, through bilateral, regional, and 
multilateral fora, to establish commercially meaningful de minimis 
values[.]''\5\

    \5\ See TFTEA, sec. 901(b).

    Eliminating or reducing de minimis levels is the equivalent of 
raising taxes, as it will cause more shipments to be subject to 
tariffs. This would be a highly regressive tax, as it falls mainly on 
parties like small businesses and individual consumers for whom paying 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
tariffs could be particularly burdensome.

    Contrary to popular belief, CBP receives an abundance of advanced 
data for all shipments from express carriers, as well as de minimis 
shipments, including, but not limited to, the value for each shipment. 
This gives CBP the same opportunity to review, screen, target, and 
detain shipments in the de minimis environment as they do for other 
shipments regardless of value upon arrival.

    As you correctly noted, in fiscal year 2020, CBP data showed that 
out of a total of $2.42 trillion dollars in import values, de minimis 
shipments represented $67 billion dollars, or only 2.77 percent of all 
trade value into the United States, which is a relatively small portion 
of total trade value.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. John Barrasso
    Question. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare many of the shortcomings 
in our supply chains. Supply chain challenges impacted nearly every 
industry, and those challenges were felt by businesses and consumers 
alike. As we look to strengthen and secure our supply chains, are there 
steps we can take to ensure U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CPB) 
operations aren't exacerbating existing supply chain challenges?

    What changes or improvements to existing CPB authorities should we 
consider to keep goods and services flowing across our borders?

    Answer. Thank you for identifying an important issue. Our 
experience during the pandemic demonstrated that CBP works as well as 
it can given the current statues and regulations. There are several 
opportunities to provide streamlined processes as well as additional 
resources to provided an enhanced experience.

    Congress should expand the United States' global leadership in 
facilitating trade by focusing on the informal entry process, i.e., the 
Customs procedures governing shipments valued between $800-$2,500. 
Congress should raise the $2,500 ceiling to a more competitive 
baseline, while granting CBP the regulatory authority to raise it 
further. For informal entries, a ``bucket'' system for Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule (HTS) classification for eligible shipments, e.g., a 
limited number of classifications instead of the 10,000+ tariff lines 
should be authorized by statute. Excluded from ``bucketing'' could be 
shipments subject to ``restricted'' goods where 10-digit HTS codes are 
required. Further, for those highly integrated networks like express 
carriers, a simplified release by presentation of commercial invoices 
should be authorized. Since a bucket system for HTS codes would be 
utilized to further simplify the process, Congress should expand who 
can file these informal entries to include a nominal consignee like 
carriers (as currently permitted for de minimis entries).

    Along similar lines, Congress should codify longstanding and 
successful models that CBP has crafted via regulation over the last 
several decades. The express industry's right to file de minimis 
shipments was created by regulation a long time ago and, for the 
reasons discussed above, this process should be codified in statute. 
Further, the hundreds of millions of dollars of investment the express 
industry has made to segregate PGA regulated items from its manifest 
should be considered as a justification for waiving the requirement to 
provide an HTS code for de minimis shipments in any future CBP 
rulemaking.

    For the same reasons, Congress should codify the express delivery 
process more generally as a unique procedure for providing expedited 
clearance of shipments based on longstanding success and shared 
responsibility, including the investments the express industry has made 
to ensure it meets all government requirements for data accuracy and 
completeness. The codification of the express delivery clearance 
process will authorize:

          A single submission of information, a manifest, covering all 
        goods contained in an express shipment;
          Expedited release of these shipments based on the minimum 
        documentation of a single submission of information; and
          Consolidated entries.

    Lastly, we support additional funding for CBP officers at the ports 
of entry and to improve those CBP technologies that facilitate the 
movement of goods.

    Question. You noted in your testimony the importance of 
establishing timelines for a response from CBP. I've heard from 
businesses in Wyoming who have had shipments held at U.S. ports for a 
variety of reasons. In some cases, CBP works quickly and the shipments 
move along to their final destination. In other instances, the imported 
goods can sit for weeks or months awaiting CBP action. This is 
unacceptable.

    I agree that Customs modernization must establish reasonable 
timelines for CBP in order to keep goods moving and provide American 
businesses with certainty.

    In your opinion, what is a reasonable amount of time for CBP to 
take action on protests, petitions, and other Customs matters?

    Answer. In most circumstances, the trade is bound by defined 
timelines, yet there are few timelines under law that bind CBP in the 
same way. This causes uncertainty for U.S. businesses as they try to 
move forward with business planning and product launches and causes 
financial uncertainty.

    The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) outlines the following 
standard for Customs authorities when issuing advanced rulings: ``as 
expeditiously as possible and in no case later than 120 days after it 
has obtained all necessary information from the person requesting an 
advance ruling[.]''\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ USMCA, Article 7.5.6(c).

    CBP should be held to similar deadlines for other agency decisions 
such as those related to protests, petitions, applications for further 
review, and penalty determinations, coupled with a default rule under 
which, when CBP fails to respond by the deadline, the decision's 
outcome is then decided, by operation of law, in favor of the trader. 
Any Customs modernization legislation should explore this important 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
topic of holding agencies accountable to provide timely decisions.

    Expedited decisions on freight seized for various reasons should be 
reviewed as an opportunity for earlier resolution. A part of this 
process is updating the very manual processes on the CBP side with 
enhanced capabilities in automated systems, including a comprehensive 
interactive capability with the trade industry. Many seizures are 
resolved and the cargo is admitted into the U.S. for consumption; 
facilitating this process can add value and allow CBP to focus on bad 
actors and shipments.

    The lack of timeliness has tangible effects on traders. For 
example, outdated statutory language currently allows CBP to recall 
goods up to 60 days after admissibility decisions are made. This so-
called redelivery authority was created in statues concerned with quota 
and visa transshipment concerns that do not exist today. Today, with 
the speed of cargo delivery, especially in the direct-to-consumer 
setting, it is almost impossible to redeliver something to CBP custody 
outside of 24 hours. This authority should be removed for normal cases, 
with the timeline shortened in exceptional cases that pose safety or 
security concerns.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our witnesses for 
appearing before the committee today. Before we begin, I will mention 
two things--particularly since this is the committee's first trade 
hearing of the new Congress.

    First, I welcome Ms. Cindy Allen of FedEx Logistics. She traveled 
here to testify today from Tennessee, the home State of one of our new 
Finance Committee members, Senator Marsha Blackburn. Very happy to have 
you both here. Of course, I am also glad to see Senators Tillis and 
Johnson here, who have also just joined the committee, but we will have 
to wait a little longer to get some fine folks from your States here to 
share their expertise.

    Second, I must thank Senator Cassidy for his leadership on the 
issue of Customs modernization. He spends a lot of time thinking about 
how to ensure our Customs laws are effectively enforced and how to 
better harness data to that effect. We all look forward to hearing his 
insights as we consider this issue further. Modernizing U.S. Customs 
laws is fast becoming of critical importance.

    The last comprehensive update to our Customs laws occurred exactly 
30 years ago. A smart reform now will not only allow us to seize new 
opportunities, but also to confront the rise of opportunists. 
Opportunity is out there, right now, waiting for the law to catch up 
with it.

    The drafters of the last modernization could not possibly foresee 
the technological tools available to us today, or the sheer number of 
small businesses that now take advantage of international trade, or the 
benefit to consumers from widespread access to e-commerce. But with any 
new opportunity, unfortunately, also comes opportunists. Modernization 
is imperative to counter both existing threats trying to make their way 
into this country, and those on the horizon.

    At the El Paso port of entry, the brave men and women of U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, seized--in just the month of 
January alone--over 327 pounds of methamphetamine, 139 pounds of 
cocaine, and 42 pounds of fentanyl. We have got to close the supply of 
those drugs coming across our southern border.

    On January 29th, CBP officers at Chicago's O'Hare seized 
counterfeit jewelry and apparel that would have been worth over 
$686,000, if genuine. CBP is also actively enforcing a number of 
``withhold release orders'' and the Uyghur Forced Labor Implementation 
Act to keep goods made with forced labor out of this country. The good 
news about Customs modernization is that it is not an either/or 
proposition when it comes to trade facilitation and trade enforcement. 
By making smarter use of data collection, we can reduce burdens on both 
lawful commerce and CBP personnel so that we can better focus resources 
on enforcement challenges.

    Let us take, as an example, something as simple as importing wet 
pet food. Importation currently requires the importer to submit data to 
assist three of CBP's partner agencies: USDA; FDA; and the National 
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA.

    These agencies cumulatively want 54 data elements. But 21 of these 
elements are redundant, and there are 16 inconsistent definitions for 
the same data. Under these circumstances, the importer faces the 
challenge of figuring out what exactly is required, and our law 
enforcement authorities may end up with information of little utility.

    We can and must do better--particularly given some of the supply 
chain bottlenecks we see at our ports. Fortunately, we are well 
situated to attack the modernization effort today, because CBP and its 
advisory committees started thinking about many of these issues 
starting in 2018, when CBP launched its 21st Century Customs Framework 
Initiative to develop ideas about what a modernized Customs regime 
might look like.

    Combining CBP's efforts with additional expertise--including that 
of our witnesses today--we can create an efficient and effective 
framework. New tools, including automation, can help us identify risks 
at an early stage.

    We need a system where contraband never enters the United States in 
the first place. By catching threats early, we can save CBP from 
engaging in lengthy investigations on U.S. soil to figure out whether 
something is a threat or not. A modern system will also expedite lawful 
commerce to get essential inputs faster to our manufacturers and goods 
to our consumers.

    To sum up, smart Customs modernization will fight and deter crime, 
create jobs, move goods faster, and save Americans' money--all at the 
same time. This is precisely the type of work this committee was set up 
to do, and does well. I look forward to working with my colleagues on 
the committee to take on the challenge.

    Now, I look forward to hearing from the witnesses on their ideas to 
improve our Customs laws.

                                 ______
                                 
  Prepared Statement of Andy Meserve, President of Local 9423, United 
   Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied 
       Industrial, and Service Workers International Union (USW)
    Thank you, Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo, for the 
opportunity to testify today on modernizing our trade laws and 
improving our country's trade enforcement. My name is Andy Meserve, and 
I am the union president for United Steelworkers Local 9423. My local 
represents the workers at the Century Aluminum Hawesville Kentucky 
Smelter, which when operating, employs around 650 union and management 
workers who make up to 250,000 tons of primary aluminum a year.

    Located on the Ohio River, our plant is one of six remaining 
primary aluminum smelters in the United States. Our smelter is, from my 
understanding, the last producer in the NATO region of high-purity 
aluminum used for defense and aerospace applications. These good-
paying, union jobs are teetering on the knife's edge because of global 
politics; decades of decisions by government; and especially important 
to this hearing, international trade.

    I am a maintenance mechanic at the smelter, meaning that I am 
responsible for ensuring that everything from conveyor belts to cranes 
operates safely in a manufacturing process, which turns raw materials 
into primary aluminum. My job is to not only fix the immediate problem, 
but to do preventative maintenance, and also make recommendations to 
management on how to solve any problem long term.

    In some ways, you all are managers of our country's economic well-
being. So I hope that my testimony today will highlight the immediate 
problems facing our smelter, but also make long-term recommendations to 
ensure that the U.S. has a competitive primary aluminum industry, which 
is critical to our national security, and also ensure that our shared 
democratic values flow through our economy.

    If you Google Hawesville Kentucky Smelter, the first things that 
come up are articles highlighting how high energy prices have 
temporarily idled my smelter, throwing over 600 workers into economic 
uncertainty. To me, that is like looking at a broken conveyor belt and 
not asking what caused the failure. Yes, energy prices were a factor in 
our current plant idling, but we need to step back and see if we can 
set conditions for success and long-term operation. Aluminum is a 
globally traded commodity in an Emissions Intensive, Trade Exposed 
Industry (EITI). The policy decisions you all make in trade will impact 
whether we have a domestic aluminum industry or not, just as much as 
regional power prices.

    My immediate recommendations to you under the topic of this hearing 
are that we update our trade enforcement laws to respond faster to 
illegal trade practices, put in place trade rules that better account 
for workers' abuses and environmental pollution, and prioritize Customs 
and Border Patrol's (CBP) efforts to collect duties and stop illegal 
goods at the border.
                           faster enforcement
    As our economies have become more connected globally, governments 
and multinational companies are making economic decisions designed to 
target products like aluminum, in order to capture market share and 
press out competitors. Few other countries have been so aggressive in 
that effort than the People's Republic of China. Today, producers in 
China account for around 58 percent of global primary aluminum 
capacity.\1\ In 2019, China's global aluminum exports rose by 20 
percent.\2\ Chinese aluminum producers have attributed this increase to 
their country's Belt and Road Initiative, which is a series of loans 
and subsidies to third-party countries that help them reduce 
unproductive capacity in aluminum.\3\ These actions have negatively 
impacted U.S. metals markets, something I've worked in for over 22 
years. While direct primary aluminum imports from China into the U.S. 
are relatively low, aluminum is a globally traded commodity, meaning 
price fluctuations are directly impacted by government efforts to 
dominate commodity markets.

    Our trade enforcement laws must respond to these sorts of global 
swings. It is common to see U.S. producers and workers file one 
antidumping and countervailing (AD/CVD) trade case and win, only to 
have to file a new ``successive'' trade case a few years later as 
imports from other countries, often on imports by similar companies, 
undermining the years of work it took to win the first case. For 
example, this is true for aluminum sheet.\4\ We need capable trade laws 
that can respond to repeat offenders and serial cheaters who move 
production to another country in an effort to go around existing AD/CVD 
orders.

    We also need to better account for China's Belt and Road Initiative 
as well. Hundreds of billions of dollars are being spent by China's 
communist leadership to build facilities and export goods into third 
party countries. Our trade enforcement laws have a gaping hole in 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
dealing with these sorts of cross border subsidies.

    These issues are not new, USW supported a bill that passed the 
House of Representatives last Congress and was led in the Senate by 
Senator Brown and former Senator Portman. Commonly known as Leveling 
the Playing Field Act 2.0, the legislation would provide a number of 
trade law updates that will give new tools for U.S. workers and 
producers to fend off illegally dumped and subsidized goods. We urge 
the Finance Committee to take up the bill this Congress and pass it as 
soon as possible.
                            russian aluminum
    Today, roughly 3 percent of our country's aluminum imports come 
directly from Russian sources. We need to be more comprehensive on how 
we push back against Russia's war in Ukraine. It is hard for me to sit 
at this table and not get angry that we allow Russian aluminum imports 
to enter our country while 500 of my brothers and sisters, fellow 
Americans, are out of work who can make this critical national security 
product. While I believe the efforts we've made to help the Ukrainian 
people are worth it, I can also be frustrated that we have spent $50 
billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars to help the people of Ukraine fend off 
Russia's invasion,\5\ yet we haven't stopped Russia's war machine from 
selling aluminum products into the U.S. market.

    The USW supports every effort to eliminate Russian aluminum 
products and downstream third-party country imports from entering our 
market. The union sees value in efforts to place a tariff on Russian 
aluminum products,\6\ but it would be more effective to sanction or 
place a total ban of downstream products that have Russian smelted and 
cast primary aluminum in the supply chain.

                 forced labor in aluminum supply chain
    This committee is well familiar with the forced labor practices 
being used against the Muslim Uyghur population in the Xinjiang region 
of the People's Republic of China. This includes previous USW member 
testimony on the issue.\7\ I wish to provide additional detail related 
to my industry and ensure this committee is aware of recent work that 
highlights more must be done to eliminate forced labor practices in our 
supply chains. Late in 2022, a key report came out regarding the 
automotive sector and forced labor practices in the People's Republic 
of China Xinjiang region.\8\ A number of products were listed in the 
report, but I will focus on aluminum. The report ``Driving Force Auto 
Supply Chains and Uyghur Forced Labor'' highlights how this region of 
China would not be a cost-effective place to process bauxite into 
alumina, but the region's extremely cheap energy and relaxed 
environmental regulation have led to it becoming a prime location for 
smelting. Today, the Uyghur region's production capacity is roughly 8 
million tons per year, representing roughly 12 percent of the world's 
capacity.\9\ For perspective, in 2021, the United States produced 
908,000 metric tons of primary aluminum, significantly below the peak 
domestic output of 5.1 million metric tons in 1980.\10\

    Multiple Chinese producers are implicated in the report of 
producing primarily aluminum that is then spread throughout the 
aluminum auto supply chain. Aluminum without clear indications of the 
original source in trading platforms like the London Metals Exchange, 
through international trading firms, or through Chinese companies with 
unannounced trade links to the Uyghur region should not be permitted on 
American shores and we should hold these international trading firms 
accountable and liable for not purging metals made with forced labor 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
from their systems.

    We also need to better account for forced labor in aluminum 
extrusions. The USW, along with the Aluminum Extruders Association, 
filed a petition for a withhold release order against Dominican 
Republic aluminum extrusions. We joined on this petition because 
Customs on a CBP verification report from an Enforce and Protect Act 
(EAPA) Allegation into Kingtom Aluminio S.R.L. found multiple instances 
of forced labor tactics that were listed in their EAPA report.\11\ The 
USW strongly encourages Congress to ensure that U.S. inspectors of 
products be required to report instances of observed illegal labor and 
environmental practices.

                              environment
    This past December, the USW testified at a House Ways and Means 
Committee Trade Subcommittee hearing regarding trade and the 
environment. The testimony highlighted a recent Department of Commerce 
International Trade Administration report on both the challenges and 
opportunities related to the global market for environmental 
technologies goods and services. The report highlights the nearly $700 
billion in export potential for environmental goods and technologies, 
but for the union, the report also highlighted a more ominous series of 
statistics:\12\ The lack of basic clean air and water enforcement, and 
often regulation, that communities in some of our largest trading 
partners are experiencing.

    For example, in Vietnam, industrial wastewater treatment has 
emerged as a critical need as approximately 75 percent of wastewater is 
being discharged into lakes and rivers without treatment. Congress 
needs to recognize that the third largest exporter into the U.S. is 
poisoning their citizen's air and water ways because corporations want 
to simply bring cheap goods into one of the largest consumer markets--
the United States. The union also highlighted examples of air and water 
pollution in India and Indonesia.\13\

    This pollution needs to be considered an illegal industrial 
subsidy, and U.S. workers and their employers should not have to 
compete against environmental degradation without properly accounting 
for its cost. To give perspective, since the passage of the U.S. Clean 
Water Act, government and industry have invested over $1 trillion to 
abate water pollution, roughly $100 per person per year. While 
challenges remain domestically, we have made marked improvements in our 
water quality.\14\

    Any member of our union who works in an energy intensive, trade 
exposed industry will tell you that fair trade must include mechanisms 
that replicate and encourage our high domestic standards 
internationally. This cannot just be trade facilitation initiatives, 
but also methods to hold firms, importers, and countries accountable 
for this pollution outsourcing. We need to allow workers, both 
domestically and globally, to have access to remedies against 
industrial polluters. For example, recent trade mechanisms in the 
United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) could be extended to 
address bad actors and ensure that foreign governments and 
multinational corporations treat communities with the same care we 
expect for our citizens.
                     other customs and trade items
    There are a host of trade issues facing the country and my 
testimony has highlighted several large issues facing this committee 
regarding trade enforcement and better accounting for environmental 
pollution in trade. There are also several other significant items this 
committee should take up to improve trade enforcement and ensure U.S. 
workers and firms have every tool available to them to fairly compete. 
USW supports or encourages actions on items such as:

          Increasing the penalties for fraudulent actors and repeat 
        offenders of our Nation's trade laws. This should also target 
        the ability of individuals to get permission to import goods 
        into our country. If an individual or company is fraudulently 
        importing goods, their import licenses should be at risk.
          Supporting the U.S. and EU effort to build a global 
        arrangement framework on steel and aluminum. Following the 
        announcement suspending the steel and aluminum 232 duties on 
        the EU and tariff retaliation against the U.S., the global 
        arrangement has the potential to limit carbon intensive and 
        non-market economy steel and aluminum products from entering 
        the two markets with the most amount of import reliance 
        globally. Congress should do everything it can to foster this 
        effort including supporting legislative action if necessary 
        under a successful framework.
          Company's and workers harmed by a U.S. importer's fraudulent 
        or grossly negligent violation of the U.S. Customs laws should 
        be able to pursue a remedy directly against the violator in any 
        venue in which the interested party has suffered damage.
          Congress should take up and pass the National Critical 
        Capabilities Defense Act. This legislation led by Senators 
        Casey and Cornyn would create a whole-of-government process to 
        screen outbound investments and the offshoring of critical 
        capacities and supply chains to foreign adversaries, like China 
        and Russia, to ensure the resiliency of critical supply chains.
          Repealing the Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC). 
        Created in the 2015 Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement 
        Act, this committee appears to be captured by large importers 
        of record and obstructs CBP's trade enforcement agenda outside 
        the public eye. COAC has made recommendations which would make 
        it harder for U.S. workers and firms to track imports that are 
        being dumped and subsidized into the U.S. market, and should 
        not predominate over the interests of domestic industry, labor 
        organizations, human rights organizations, and any other groups 
        with interests in trade enforcement.\15\

                           domestic resources
    We should make every effort to deploy resources passed under the 
Infrastructure, Investment, and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation 
Reduction Act (IRA) to ensure existing energy intensive, trade exposed 
manufacturing facilities are able to upgrade and compete globally. The 
fact that my plant sits less than one hundred miles from the Tennessee 
Valley Authority's (TVA) lower cost power grid should not go unnoticed 
by lawmakers. TVA supplies safe, reliable, clean low-cost public power 
to 153 local power companies and about 60 large industrial customers 
and Federal facilities.\16\ We should make every effort to expand the 
footprint of this federally owned electric utility corporation and 
increase domestic energy production, including renewables. When around 
17,000 kilowatts of electricity are required to produce 1 ton of 
aluminum, improving our energy grid and increasing access for diverse 
affordable energy should be a priority of Congress.

                               conclusion
    Congress must act swiftly and effectively to ensure globally traded 
goods, like aluminum, are traded fairly and with an eye toward the 
democratic values that win the future. When the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that the global 
aluminum industry received up to $70 billion in government support 
between 2013 and 2017, with the large majority of support concentrated 
in China and countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council--we must put up 
more of a fight to defend our values. Most Americans would be appalled 
at learning that the primary aluminum used in our fighter jets could 
come from China, Russia, or countries that outlaw independent trade 
unions like the United Arab Emirates.\17\ We can do better and we must 
do better to ensure that U.S. industry and workers are not starting on 
their back foot in the economic competition.

    I am just a maintenance mechanic hoping to restart the smelter 
where I've worked at for over 20 years. My job helped me raise a family 
and allowed me to call Kentucky home. With proper trade enforcement and 
improved energy security, I believe we can restart and make aluminum in

           Questions Submitted for the Record to Andy Meserve
               Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
    Question. One of the biggest threats to Ohio workers today is when 
countries, like China, find new and novel ways to circumvent our trade 
laws. Current U.S. law doesn't provide enough tools to challenge the 
unfair trade practices of the Chinese Communist Party.

    Last year, I joined with Senator Portman to introduce legislation--
a bill we called Leveling the Playing Field 2.0--to address China's 
anti-competitive trade practices and provide 21st-century solutions to 
address this subsidy shell game.

    Senator Young and I plan to reintroduce this legislation in the 
next few weeks to help U.S. workers and producers prosecute repeat 
offenders and serial cheaters who simply move production to another 
country to get around existing antidumping or countervailing duty 
orders.

    Can you talk about how our legislation updating U.S. trade laws 
would benefit U.S. companies suffering from these new forms of unfair 
trade? Do you agree that these provisions would be useful to address 
the whack-a-mole game of unfair trade practices by the Chinese 
Government?

    Answer. As the largest manufacturing union in North America, 
representing workers in a variety of industries, we need our trade 
enforcement laws that reflect 21st-century challenges.

    The bipartisan Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 would aid the 
union and our member companies who have to use the trade laws in the 
following ways.

          Makes it easier for U.S. workers/companies to stop repeat 
        offenders and speeds the process so manufacturers, agriculture 
        workers, and miners can focus on American made goods.

          Targets Belt and Road Initiative subsidies--right now China 
        is spending billions out of the country to build factories that 
        will dump into the U.S. and other markets. The bipartisan 
        American COMPETES act will give the U.S. government authority 
        to call out those subsidies.

          Improves enforcement--importers constantly pull tricks to 
        try and lower or evade duties. The Leveling the Playing Field 
        Act will clarify processes and timelines making government more 
        efficient in stopping dumped and illegally subsidized goods.

    Technology changes all the time; our trade laws must adjust just as 
quickly. Passing the Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 is a must for 
workers and employers to maintain and improve U.S. competition.

    United Steelworkers urges Congress to pass the bipartisan Leveling 
the Playing Field Act 2.0 as it would aid in stopping this Whac-A-Mole 
issue where multinational employers guilty of dumping goods from one 
country quickly ramp up imports from other countries--undercutting the 
effectiveness of trade measures.

    Question. Several years ago, Congress gave Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) the authority to investigate whether a company has 
evaded antidumping and countervailing (AD/CVD) duties. While CBP has 
made dozens of determinations since that time, Customs fraud continues 
to undermine the value of the United States' antidumping and unlawful 
subsidy trade laws, meaning hundreds of millions of dollars of 
antidumping and countervailing duty fees don't get collected.

    Can you speak to how American manufacturing workers are hurt by 
transshipment and other forms of evasion?

    Answer. Workers and employers who have been negatively impacted by 
illegally dumped and subsidized goods often see several negative 
impacts that range from lost hours at the job, layoffs, concessionary 
bargaining, and/or when plants close--communities see a reduced tax 
base which then trickles through the local economy.

    Employers and unions who chose to use our trade laws to fight back 
often spend millions of dollars proving their case and having to show 3 
years of data--often 3 years of economic harm to receive relief. To 
then have that relief undercut by multinational employers and/or 
unscrupulous importers who try to evade or transship goods.

    As I mentioned at the hearing, there has been a history of primary 
aluminum transshipment. The Wall Street Journal in 2016 highlighted how 
close to $2 billion of primary aluminum was transshipped into Mexico 
(https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-billionaire-linked-to-giant-
aluminum-stockpile-in-mexican-desert-1473356054). These sorts of 
anticompetitive practices reduce domestic sales and hurt communities 
like my own.

                                 ______
                                 
         Prepared Statement of Scott Nova, Executive Director, 
                        Worker Rights Consortium
    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to offer testimony today on the vital 
matter of government enforcement of laws designed to combat forced 
labor in the supply chains of brands and retailers selling goods in the 
United States. My name is Scott Nova, and I am executive director of 
the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), a nonprofit organization committed 
to advancing labor rights in global manufacturing. The WRC conducts 
factory-level labor rights compliance assessments in more than two 
dozen countries; issues public reports of documented labor rights 
violations; and works with relevant actors to secure remedies, with a 
particular focus on the responsibilities of the brands and retailers 
that use the factories in question to make their goods. The WRC serves 
on the steering committee of the Coalition to End Forced Labour in the 
Uyghur Region.

    I will address in my testimony both the enforcement of the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and, more broadly, of section 307 
of the Tariff Act, including some policies and practices of Customs and 
Border Protection that bear on both. The removal of the consumptive 
demand loophole in 2016, which made section 307 enforceable, and the 
enactment of the UFLPA, along with the inclusion of a robust labor 
rights mechanism in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), are 
recent and rare elements of contemporary U.S. trade policy that 
meaningfully limit the ability of corporations to make products under 
abusive working conditions in other countries and then sell them in the 
United States--often undercutting competitors that make goods either 
here in the U.S. or under decent conditions overseas. The bipartisan 
support for these initiatives, exemplified by the Senate's unanimous 
passage of the UFLPA, augurs well. It hopefully signals a trend away 
from trade policies that serve primarily to facilitate corporate access 
to easily exploitable workers overseas and toward policies that protect 
the rights and well-being of workers both at home and abroad. The 
effective enforcement of these statutes, including the UFLPA, is thus 
of enormous importance, both to vast numbers of individual workers and 
to the broader goals of combating forced labor, upholding the rule of 
law, and ensuring fair competition in the global economy.

    By continuing to source from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region 
(``Uyghur region'') while the Chinese Government radically expanded its 
regime of forced labor, leading global brands and retailers made 
themselves a party to abuses of the Uyghur and other Turkic peoples 
that have been deemed crimes against humanity by leading human rights 
organizations.\1\ State-sponsored forced labor in the Uyghur region 
intersects with and reinforces other egregious human rights violations, 
including a vast campaign of arbitrary detention, forced family 
separation, and one of the most pervasive regimes of mass surveillance 
ever imposed.\2\ In 2019,\3\ a point by which forced labor was rampant 
in cotton production, the Uyghur region was the source of roughly 20 
percent of the apparel industry's global cotton supply. In 2020,\4\ the 
region produced 45 percent of the world's solar-grade polysilicon. The 
Uyghur region is also the source of more than 12 percent of the world's 
supply of primary aluminum and produces 10 percent of the world's 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Thus, the supply chains of a huge number of 
corporations that sell products in the U.S. run through a region that 
is the global epicenter of forced labor, where the prevailing 
environment of repression and fear makes human rights due diligence a 
practical impossibility. At the time of the UFLPA's enactment, there 
were tens of thousands of shipping containers arriving at U.S. ports 
every day, laden with sweatshirts, solar panels, and myriad other 
products, all made partly in the Uyghur region, under conditions likely 
involving forced labor. In these circumstances, robust enforcement of 
the UFLPA \5\ is essential to end the complicity of U.S. corporations 
in the horrors unfolding in the Uyghur region.

    In trying to assess UFLPA enforcement to date, as well as broader 
enforcement of section 307, we are mindful that CBP's task is very 
broad in scope and that genuine enforcement against importers of forced 
labor-made products is still in its institutional infancy. Prior to 
Congress's decision to close the consumptive demand loophole, there 
was, in the forced labor realm, virtually nothing for CBP to enforce. 
(Indeed, there was not a single withhold release order (WRO) issued 
between 2000 and 2016.) The enforcement infrastructure specific to 
forced labor was correspondingly minimal, and CBP had no institutional 
memory of robust forced labor enforcement. CBP has had only 7 years to 
develop the infrastructure and methods to identify forced labor-made 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
products, and growing pains are an inevitable part of such a process.

    It is also the case that despite the funds recently appropriated 
for UFLPA enforcement, there remains a large mismatch between the scope 
of the task and the extent of the resources available, both in terms of 
the UFLPA and broader section 307 enforcement. Further expansion of 
CBP's resources targeted specifically to forced labor enforcement is 
necessary for a full-scale enforcement effort.

    With all that in mind, I would like to provide the following 
observations and recommendations in relation to the implementation and 
enforcement of the UFLPA to date.
         enforcement of the uyghur forced labor prevention act
    Since the law went into effect last June, we have seen some 
encouraging indicators of successful enforcement. Shipments across 
multiple sectors are being targeted and detained. Brands, in at least 
some sectors, are being asked to provide an unprecedented level of 
supply chain disclosure. CBP is availing itself, at least to some 
extent, of new technology that allows the geographic origin of the raw 
material comprising a product to be identified through physical testing 
of the product, either during the production process or off of the 
store shelf.

    The WRC believes that CBP, and the other agencies that are part of 
the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force (FLETF), are committed to 
meaningful enforcement of the UFLPA. And there are credible indications 
from industry sources that, at least in the apparel sector, many--
though by no means all--major brands and retailers have exited or are 
exiting the Uyghur region, in response to the advent and enforcement of 
the law. We have also seen recent evidence of a sharp decline in demand 
for Xinjiang cotton as a result of these developments.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Ji Siqi, ``As China's cotton harvest begins, Xinjiang `forced 
labour' law and global recession fears hobble demand,'' South China 
Morning Post, October 7, 2022, https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-
economy/article/3195043/chinas-cotton-harvest-begins-us-xinjiang-
forced-labour-law?module=hard_link&pgtype=article.

    Every enforcement action taken by the U.S. Government--and every 
corporate decision, driven by those actions, to shift sourcing away 
from the Uyghur region and away from suppliers implicated in Uyghur 
forced labor--strikes against the impunity both of the Chinese 
Government and of global corporations that have heretofore been 
complicit in those abuses. The UFLPA is putting substantial political 
and economic pressure on the Chinese Government. And it is forcing 
thousands of global corporations to go through the altogether healthy 
process of adjusting to an unprecedented level of legal and financial 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
risk arising from labor practices in their supply chains.

    Against this encouraging backdrop, there are also significant 
reasons for concern, including the paucity of public reporting from CBP 
and the FLETF on the nature and progress of the UFLPA enforcement 
effort and indications that progress in certain areas has been too 
slow.

    Any assessment of the UFLPA enforcement to date is partial by 
necessity, not only because the law took effect less than 8 months ago, 
but because CBP is, at present, sharing very little information about 
its work. It is important to note, as explained in more detail below, 
that this is not a problem specific to the UFLPA or to the current 
leadership of CBP; it is a lack of transparency that has characterized 
CBPs approach to public reporting with respect to all of its forced 
labor enforcement, dating to 2016. Public reporting by U.S. Government 
agencies on UFLPA enforcement activities is critical for numerous 
reasons, not least the ability of nongovernmental organizations to 
coordinate and collaborate with the enforcement agencies, a goal 
specified in section 2(d)(7) and section 4(b)(3)(A) of the UFLPA.

    As shown in the table below, in September 2022, CBP first started 
releasing data on shipments it has targeted, beginning with the month 
of August 2022.\7\

    The data actually tell us very little, because CBP does not 
disaggregate it in a manner that would give the public a clear picture 
of how the UFLPA is being enforced. CBP is now reporting the number and 
dollar value of entries ``identified for further examination,'' but it 
does not report the number or value of the entries that are actually 
detained. We thus do not know what percentage of shipments targeted for 
``further examination'' are ultimately allowed into the United States. 
CBP also does not indicate which of these entries are targeted under 
the auspices of the UFLPA; the data lumps together shipments targeted 
under the UFLPA and under every extant WRO. CBP also does not provide 
any breakdown of targeted shipments by industry, much less specific 
product category. Nor is there any breakdown by country of origin.

    As a result, we cannot glean from the data CBP is publishing how 
many shipments have been detained--or even how many have been targeted 
for ``further examination''--in any of the high priority sectors 
identified by the UFLPA (cotton, tomatoes, polysilicon) or in any other 
individual sector. We know that some solar panels have been detained, 
but we do not know how many, or from what country or countries they 
were shipped, or why they were detained. We also, of course, do not 
know what companies shipped the panels that were detained, nor which 
companies were attempting to import them. We do not know the answers to 
those questions with respect to any other industry or product. We also 
do not know to what extent CBP is focusing its the enforcement of the 
UFLPA on imports from countries other than the PRC--an important 
question since, in some industries, including apparel, the majority of 
goods containing inputs from the Uyghur Region are not finished in the 
PRC.

    Officials at CBP and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
occasionally disclose bits of more precise information via interviews 
with journalists. For example, in a September 2022 interview with The 
Wall Street Journal, Robert Silvers, the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security Under Secretary who chairs the FLETF, stated that during the 
first 3 months after the UFLPA went fully into effect, 1,452 cargo 
entries valued at $429 million were targeted under the law.\14\ But 
these occasional disclosures add only marginally to the overall 
picture.

Issue, Says U.S. Official,'' The Wall Street Journal, September 27, 
2022, https://www.wsj.com/articles/forced-labor-a-top-tier-compliance-
issue-says-u-s-official-11664271003.

    CBP exhibited a similar lack of transparency with respect to the 
WRO issued on cotton from Turkmenistan in 2018 and with respect to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
other regional and company-specific WROs.

    This lack of transparency precludes a reliable or comprehensive 
assessment of the quality and effectiveness of CBP's UFLPA enforcement 
efforts. In meetings as recently as January 2023, CBP has indicated to 
nongovernmental organizations that it is planning to publish a 
``dashboard'' with more detailed enforcement statistics; however, CBP 
has not provided a specific timeline for when the dashboard will be 
released or information on the level of detail that will be included.

    CBP cites multiple reasons for its approach: capacity limitations, 
constraints ostensibly imposed by the Trade Secrets Act, and 
confidentiality obligations relating to CBP's law enforcement role most 
prominent among them. However, it is difficult to see why any of these 
factors would preclude the sharing of information as basic, and as 
anonymous, as the volume of detentions specifically carried out under 
the UFLPA, or the percentage of detained shipments that originated in 
countries other than the PRC, or the total volume of apparel shipments 
detained, or whether any shipments have been targeted based on the 
involvement in their manufacturing with companies on the Entities 
Lists. Indeed, it is clear to us that CBP, in all of its forced labor 
enforcement work, dating back to 2016 when that work began in earnest, 
has consistently and by a large margin erred on the side of too little 
transparency.

    This is a problem that can and should be rectified within the scope 
of existing law, which allows CBP far more latitude for public 
disclosure than it is utilizing. One of the most important steps that 
CBP and the other FLETF agencies can take to ensure effective 
implementation of the UFLPA is to greatly increase the volume and 
precision of its public reporting on the enforcement process, beginning 
with disclosure of data on the volume of both targeted and detained 
entries that is industry-specific, country-of-origin specific, and 
specific to UFLPA enforcement.

    There are also a number of specific elements of the UFLPA 
enforcement process that are of concern.
The ``Clear and Convincing'' Evidence Standard and Labor Rights Audits 
        in the Uyghur Region
    One of the strengths of the UFLPA is the evidentiary standard 
Congress has applied \15\ to any effort by an importer to prove that a 
product with content from the Uyghur region (or a product partly made 
by a company on the UFLPA Entities List) was made without forced labor, 
thereby overcoming the ``rebuttable presumption'' that forced labor was 
used and gaining entry for the product. Importers must prove their case 
with ``clear and convincing evidence,'' a high standard appropriate to 
the circumstances, to the long history in the PRC of exporters faking 
labor rights compliance, and to the enormous incentives exporters have 
to hide their complicity in forced labor in the context of a 
review.\16\

    An important question concerning CBP's approach to enforcement is 
how it applies this evidentiary standard to potential efforts by 
importers to present, as evidence to overcome the rebuttable 
presumption, labor rights audits conducted within the Uyghur region. 
CBP should give no evidentiary weight to such audits, because reliable 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
audits cannot be performed in the region under prevailing conditions:

          Candid worker interviews are a necessary \17\--indeed, they 
        are the central--element in any reliable labor rights 
        inspection related to forced labor. A worker whose labor is 
        coerced cannot provide an auditor with candid testimony about 
        this coercion unless that worker has good reason to believe 
        they can do so without incurring a significant risk of 
        retaliation, from the employer and/or public authorities.

pdf.

          Given the political conditions in the region, every Uyghur 
        worker has good reason to believe the opposite. The government 
        has effectively criminalized any deviation by individuals from 
        government-approved cultural practices, political views, and 
        personal associations,\18\ and it brutally punishes those 
        suspected of such deviations with extrajudicial internment, 
        criminal prosecution without hope of a fair trial, physical 
        torture,\19\ forced relocation, and other devastating forms of

        multifaceted surveillance apparatus \21\ designed to ensure 
        that deviations from approved thought and practice are 
        detected. Under these conditions, workers from the Uyghur 
        community, or from any other Turkic or Muslim community, who 
        are victims of forced labor would have reason to assume that 
        providing truthful testimony about their circumstances to a 
        private auditor or inspector would not only incur a risk of 
        retaliation but the virtual certainty of retaliation.

          Under these conditions, there is a very high likelihood that 
        a victim of forced labor who is asked to submit to an auditor's 
        interview will provide testimony favorable to their employer 
        and to the government, whether or not that testimony is true. 
        This is why no audit conducted in the region can be relied upon

        in the Uyghur region.

          This is why many reputable auditing firms \22\ ceased 
        conducting labor rights audits in the region in 2020.

    If CBP is treating such audits with appropriate skepticism, the 
``clear and convincing'' standard will be very difficult to meet--as it 
should be--and we anticipate relatively few attempts to overcome the 
rebuttable presumption.
Admissibility Reviews
    As a result, the primary focus of CBP's engagement with importers 
will likely not be the rebuttable presumption, but rather the process 
CBP calls ``admissibility reviews.''\23\ These occur in the context of 
the enforcement of WROs, and now of the UFLPA, when CBP targets a 
shipment because of indications that the products include content from 
a banned region or a banned supplier. Under this process, CBP grants 
the importer the opportunity to demonstrate by evidence that the 
product does not have such content or was not touched by the banned 
supplier. We understand from CBP's statements at informational sessions 
for nongovernmental organizations \24\ that such reviews are a common 
part of its WRO enforcement process and that a substantial number have 
been carried out under the UFLPA. This means that CBP's enforcement 
work under the UFLPA has been, and is likely to be, much more about 
determining where a product's inputs were sourced, and who touched the 
product along the supply chain, than about the labor conditions at any 
facility.

    \24\ Remarks by CBP representatives at the CBP-CSO Roundtable 
Meeting on November 17, 2022.

    It is thus important that this work be done rigorously, to ensure 
importers cannot use these reviews to sneak banned products into the 
U.S. Such reviews are self-
evidently appropriate: if a product does not have Uyghur region 
content, and CBP mistakenly suspects it does, an importer should be 
given the opportunity to prove its case. What we do not yet know is how 
CBP goes about this work. We can glean from some CBP materials, or 
otherwise surmise, the kind of data it seeks from importers, but we do 
not know how CBP vets the veracity of documentary evidence or what 
evidentiary standard it uses. We also do not know how many such reviews 
are being conducted and what percentage of them have resulted in CBP 
deeming the shipment admissible. Unlike the process by which an 
importer seeks to overcome the rebuttable presumption, admissibility 
reviews are not subject to disclosure requirements as to decisions made 
and the evidence on which they are based. Given that a sizable number 
of reviews are likely taking place, it would be impractical for CBP to 
disclose specifics related to each. But CBP could and should disclose 
information about its methods and aggregate data on outcomes, which 
would go a long way toward reassuring observers that an importer is not 
using this process as a runaround to the rebuttable presumption.
Avoiding Excessive Emphasis on Goods Imported Directly From the Uyghur 
        Region
    An important area where CBP can increase both the efficacy and 
efficiency of its enforcement is with improved geographic targeting, 
including less emphasis on products exported directly from the Uyghur 
region and more on products arriving from third countries. Last year, 
the FLETF averred that ``. . . the highest-risk goods include those 
imported directly from Xinjiang into the United States. . . .''\25\ 
Communications from CBP to nongovernmental organizations have 
underscored this category of shipments as a high priority. While such 
imports should obviously not be ignored, they are in practice both tiny 
in number and relatively easy to detect. Indeed, almost all of the 
products entering the United States that include Uyghur region content 
arrive from someplace other than the Uyghur region. This is because the 
primary contributions of the Uyghur region to global supply chains are 
raw materials and other inputs that provide their value added early in 
the production process:\26\ cotton in the apparel supply chain, 
polysilicon in the production of solar panels, PVC used to make 
flooring, aluminum used to make cars. Very few of those finished 
products are manufactured in the Uyghur region. Indeed, even before 
CBP's region-wide WRO and the subsequent enactment of the UFLPA, the 
Uyghur region directly exported only $300 million worth of goods to the 
United States per year.\27\ To put this in perspective, the U.S. will 
receive more than twice that amount, from other trading partners, 
during the time it takes to complete this hearing. In 2019, direct 
shipments from Uyghur region sources represented less than one-tenth of 
1 percent of U.S. imports from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and 
roughly 0.01 percent of all imports. Without minimizing the symbolic 
importance of shipments direct from the Uyghur region, and the need to 
avoid them slipping through, CBP should not focus more than a very 
modest portion of its limited resources on this element of UFLPA 
enforcement, and it should apply any resources saved to shipments from 
third countries, including major exporters of apparel like Bangladesh 
and Indonesia, and major exporters of solar panels like Vietnam.

Expansion of the UFLPA Entities List
    Section 2(B) of the UFLPA requires the FLETF, in consultation with 
the Secretary of Commerce and the Director of National Intelligence, to 
develop and maintain four entity lists and one product list, as 
follows: (i) a list of entities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region that mine, produce, or manufacture wholly or in part any goods, 
wares, articles and merchandise with forced labor; (ii) a list of 
entities working with the government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region to recruit, transport, transfer, harbor or receive forced labor 
or Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, or members of other persecuted groups out 
of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; (iii) a list of products 
mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by entities on the 
list required by clause (i) or (ii); (iv) a list of entities that 
exported products described in clause (iii) from the People's Republic 
of China into the United States; (v) a list of facilities and entities, 
including the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, that source 
material from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region or from persons 
working with the government of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region or 
the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps for purposes of the 
``poverty alleviation'' program or the ``pairing-assistance'' program 
or any other government labor scheme that uses forced labor.

    The current version of the UFLPA Entity List does not have any 
additions since the original version that was published on June 21, 
2022.\28\ The ``list of entities that exported products described in 
clause (iii) from the PRC into the United States,'' per section 
2(d)(2)(B)(iv), remains blank. Across the available lists, there are a 
total of only 20 entities, several of which have additional 
subsidiaries or affiliated entities that may or may not be covered by 
their inclusion.\29\ All of the entities on the list are derived from 
WROs or Commerce Department actions dating from June 2021 or 
earlier.\30\ In other words, despite submissions by researchers \31\ 
directly to enforcing agencies and a series of publicly available 
academic reports since before the law went into effect,\32\ as well as 
more recently, that identified relevant entities and products meriting 
inclusion on these lists, the FLETF has not expanded these lists from 
those that were in effect before the law was enacted.

    An August 4, 2022, Federal Register notice by the Homeland Security 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Department specifies a process for additions to the UFLPA Entity List:

        The FLETF will consider future additions to the UFLPA Entity 
        List based on the criteria described in clauses (i), (ii), 
        (iv), or (v) of section 2(d)(2)(B) of the UFLPA. Any FLETF 
        member agency may submit a recommendation to the FLETF Chair to 
        add an entity to the UFLPA Entity List. Following review of the 
        recommendation by the FLETF member agencies, the decision to 
        add an entity to the UFLPA Entity List will be made by majority 
        vote of the FLETF member agencies.\33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \33\ Department of Homeland Security, ``Notice on the Addition of 
Entities to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act Entity List,''

addition-of-entities-to-the-uyghur-forced-labor-prevention-act-entity-
list.

    It is currently unclear to us whether any FLETF member agency has 
submitted a recommendation to the FLETF chair to add an entity to the 
UFLPA Entity List. What is clear, however, is that there have been no 
additions to the UFLPA Entity List since its original publication 7 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
months ago.

    We recognize that multiple agencies within the FLETF have affirmed 
that it is a high priority to them to work on expansion of the UFLPA 
Entity List. And we recognize the challenges involved in gathering 
evidence and making final determinations. However, the lists are 
integral to the UFLPA, and it will be crucial for CBP and the FLETF to 
achieve progress in identifying more of the companies that fit the 
criteria and adding them to the lists, so that goods produced by those 
companies can be prevented from entering the United States.
Expanding the List of Priority Sectors
    Section 2(d)(2)(B)(viii) of the UFLPA specifies that high-priority 
sectors for enforcement shall include cotton, tomatoes, and 
polysilicon.\34\ Accordingly, the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security's (DHS) June 17, 2022, report to Congress, ``Strategy to 
Prevent the Importation of Goods Mined, Produced, or Manufactured with 
Forced Labor in the People's Republic of China'' (UFLPA Strategy), 
indicates apparel, cotton and cotton products, silica-based products 
(including polysilicon), and tomatoes and downstream products as high-
priority sectors for enforcement actions by U.S. agencies.\35\ CBP's 
``Operational Guidance for Importers'' likewise identifies cotton, 
polysilicon, and tomatoes as commodities with a high risk of forced 
labor, indicating ``the types of documents CBP may require to be 
submitted on or after June 21, 2022.''\36\

    In addition to these sectors, new academic research on supply 
chains published after President Biden signed the UFLPA into law 
indicates the need for expansion. This includes the important work on 
the automobile and PVC (polyvinyl chloride or vinyl) industries by Dr. 
Laura Murphy at Sheffield Hallam University and her colleagues, 
demonstrating how some of the world's largest steel and aluminum 
producers have shifted into the Uyghur region \37\ how these 
commodities and other inputs from the Uyghur region flow into the 
automobile supply chain, and how PVC used in building materials is 
manufactured through state-sponsored labor transfers in the Uyghur 
region.\38\ The UFLPA did not establish a specific process for adding 
additional priority sectors to those specified in the law, nor does the 
UFLPA Strategy shine a light on the criteria and timeline for expanding 
the priority sector list. In a September 2022 conversation with a 
journalist from The Wall Street Journal, Under Secretary Silvers noted 
in general terms that FLETF is ``looking closely at any other product 
category where forced labor may come into play.''\39\ In this regard, 
Chairman Wyden, we applaud your recent letter to major automobile 
manufacturers, asking essential questions about their supply chains, 
and their approach to due diligence, in the context of forced labor in 
the Uyghur region.

priority sectors and urge that the public be updated on the plan 
expeditiously. Given the findings of recent investigative reports, we 
would anticipate that both the automotive industry and building 
materials imports will be given serious consideration for inclusion on 
the priority sector list.
               broader issues of forced labor enforcement
    While the forced labor crisis in the Uygur region is unique in 
scope and brutality, forced labor is a global scourge affecting vast 
numbers of people in dozens of countries. The International Labour 
Organization, in its 2022 report on forced labor and forced marriage 
around the world,\40\ estimates that more than 27 million people are 
currently subjected to conditions of work that constitute forced labor. 
Many of them work within global manufacturing supply chains, making 
clothing, toys, processed foods, electronic gadgets, medical supplies, 
and automobiles for the U.S. and other consumer markets.

    Combined with the UFLPA, section 307 of the Tariff Act is by far 
the most significant mechanism the United States possesses for keeping 
the massive volume of forced-labor-made goods that are flowing through 
global supply chains out of the United States--and for using the 
enormous power inherent in control over access to the U.S. market to 
hold accountable those corporations that practice forced labor and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
benefit from it.

    The following are observations and recommendations related to 
enforcement of section 307.
 The Importance of Remedy, the Limitations of Auditing, and the Role of 
        Unions and Other Civil Society Organizations in Achieving and 
        Verifying Remediation
    Achieving proper remedies for workers subjected to forced labor--
fully compensating workers for stolen wages and other harms and 
establishing viable mechanisms to prevent the recurrence of abuses--
should be a high priority for CBP in its consideration, issuance, and 
modification of WROs. Delivering remedy to workers directly affected by 
forced labor is not feasible in all circumstances; it is, for obvious 
reasons, a practical impossibility to safely transmit compensation to 
victims of forced labor in a Uyghur region internment camp. However, in 
CBP's section 307 enforcement work around the word, especially in the 
case of company-specific WROs, remedy is often readily achievable. 
Remedies in a given case must, at a minimum, include making workers 
whole for any financial loss, including reimbursement of recruitment 
fees, compensation for unpaid or underpaid wages, and reimbursement for 
illegal wage deductions, among other forms of wage theft. If 
enforcement action results in job loss, workers can and should be 
compensated for lost wages. Providing back pay, reimbursing workers for 
illegal fees and deductions, and providing replacement income for job 
loss should be a basic requirement for any employer seeking 
modification of a WRO. CBP should also consider requiring additional 
compensation for non-monetary physical and psychological harm.

    Equally important, effective remediation requires that mechanisms 
be put in place to ensure that employer pledges not to transgress in 
the future are verifiable and, to the greatest extent possible, legally 
enforceable. Employers subject to a WRO have every incentive to make 
promises of reform; unless there is equivalent incentive to keep those 
promises over time, there is little reason to expect improvements to be 
maintained. Employers must, at a minimum, understand that scrutiny will 
be ongoing and that import bans will be reimposed if abuses recur. And, 
where unions are seeking binding labor rights commitments from an 
employer, whether in the form of a collective bargaining agreement or 
an ad hoc pact on remedies, CBP should do everything within its power 
to support this process. CBP should also lend strong support to efforts 
by unions and allied civil society organizations to couple labor-
management agreements with binding commitments from importers to use 
their economic leverage to ensure that employers comply. These 
mutilevel agreements--which advocates refer to as ``Worker-Driven 
Social Responsibility Programs'' or ``Enforceable Brand Agreements'' --
are, by leaps and bounds, the most effective way to lock in any labor 
rights progress achieved through a company specific WRO.\41\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \41\ See: Worker-Driven Social Responsibility Network, https://wsr-
network.org/.

    CBP has demonstrated recognition of the importance of effective 
remedy for workers and, in particular, the value of binding agreements. 
This view is reflected, for example, in the statement \42\ the agency 
issued in conjunction with its decision to modify the WRO against 
Natchi Apparel in India last year--an action CBP undertook partly in 
recognition of binding agreements achieved between worker 
representatives, the employer's parent corporation Eastman Exports, and 
important customers of Eastman, including H&M.\43\

    In order to achieve effective remedy, it is essential for CBP also 
to look with skepticism not only on the claims employers make on their 
own behalf, but also on the reports of third-party auditors hired by 
employers. In its ``Guidance on WRO Modification and Revocation 
Process,''\44\ CBP cites, as an example of the information it considers 
beneficial in assessing a request for the modification of a WRO, 
``evidence of implementation and subsequent verification by an 
unannounced and independent third-party auditor.''

process/.

    While the idea of an ``independent auditor'' sounds good on its 
face, in industry parlance--for example, in the apparel and electronics 
sectors--an ``independent'' auditor is almost always a firm retained 
and paid by the employer being audited, or by one of the employer's 
buyers (the ``independence'' of the audit residing only in the fact 
that the people conducing the audit are not direct employees of the 
company). The auditor is thus accountable to corporations with a vested 
interest in a positive audit outcome, a built-in conflict of interest 
that defines most of the labor rights verification work that takes 
place today in global supply chains. Among the many weaknesses of 
audits carried out in global supply chains under industry auspices, 
interviews with workers are usually arranged with the involvement of 
factory management and conducted inside the workplace or at another 
locale, such as a company-run dormitory, where workers are unlikely to 
feel comfortable speaking candidly, particularly if they have 
information to share that would displease the employer. Depending on 
the circumstances and exact methods used, a company-funded audit may 
offer some useful evidence of compliance; however, unless the results 
are corroborated by candid worker interviews and/or by information from 
truly independent sources, CBP should not consider the results of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
industry audits, alone, to be adequate proof of compliance.

    The conflicts of interest inherent in most industry audits make it 
imperative that CBP, at every stage of the WRO process, work with a 
union that represents workers at the workplace in question, or, where 
there are no representative unions, with local civil society groups 
that have a track record of fighting for workers' interests. These 
organizations are in the best position to articulate workers' 
priorities for remediation--in a far better position than the 
corporations involved or consulting firms acting on their behalf. 
Unions and other civil society organizations with a track record of 
defending workers' interests are also best positioned to evaluate the 
veracity of claims that wrongs have been remedied, that the building 
blocks for longer-term change are in place, and that the employer is 
honoring its commitments over time. Exporters and their customers in 
the U.S. have a powerful incentive to overstate progress, and it is far 
easier for them to do so successfully when they and their paid agents 
are the primary sources of information.

    Remedy for workers who have been subjected to forced labor is a 
vitally important end in itself; but it is also essential for a 
functioning enforcement regime. If workers and worker organizations do 
not see complaints and petitions, and the WROs to which they lead, 
resulting in concrete benefits for workers--if instead they see a 
stream of cases where the only result workers experience is the loss of 
their jobs--then they will, quite rationally, choose not to support the 
process. If we want workers, unions, and allied organizations to play 
their vital role in the enforcement process--as whistleblowers, as 
providers of evidence and testimony, as designers of remediation plans 
and verifiers of their implementation--then we must demonstrate that 
doing so is in workers' interests. If genuine remedies are achieved, 
that will build faith, and participation, in the process.
Corporate Due Diligence
    The fact that so many corporations were (and surely, in many cases, 
still are) sourcing from the Uyghur region underscores the need for 
corporations to conduct effective due diligence within their own supply 
chains. Indeed, the question of due diligence, and how to get 
corporations to do it, is a focal point of much of the present 
discourse around labor rights and corporate accountability.\45\

Downstream_due_diligence.pdf.

    The answer to this question is simpler than it may seem. The best 
way--indeed, the only practical way--to get global corporations to 
perform meaningful labor rights due diligence in their supply chains is 
to make the cost of failing to perform due diligence higher than the 
cost of performing it. Real due diligence carries a price tag, and not 
just for more sophisticated audit methods. Real due diligence will 
reveal that serious labor rights abuses, including in some instances 
forced labor, are present in a brand's supply chains--and will further 
make obvious the ways in which the brand's own sourcing practices, 
including the price pressure it places on suppliers, do not just allow 
but incentivize abuses. Addressing the problems that meaningful due 
diligences surfaces will mean substantial investments in eliminating 
abuses and compensating affected workers at specific facilities (see, 
for example, the hundreds of millions of dollars in factory renovations 
required under the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh to 
turn 1,600 apparel factories with life-threatening safety deficiencies 
into safer structures,\46\ with a substantial portion of the cost born, 
in various ways, by the apparel brands that were signatories to the 
agreement).

May 31, 2022, https://www.rsc-bd.org/en/post/safety-remediation-
progress.

    This will also require changes in sourcing practices: ensuring 
prices paid to suppliers are commensurate with the cost of producing 
under decent conditions and in conformance with applicable law; 
skipping less frequently from supplier to supplier, and country to 
country, in search of cheaper labor costs and instead maintaining 
longer-term relationships with suppliers that demonstrate the 
willingness and ability to run a clean shop; and cutting ties with 
suppliers that commit egregious abuses and refuse to remedy them, even 
when doing so means ending lucrative partnerships. These changes 
involve costs that, while manageable, are substantial. Corporations 
will never voluntarily incur them. They will do so only if their 
failure to root out grievous labor rights violations will cost them 
even more. Historically, even in the case of forced labor, it has cost 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
them nothing.

    This is why strong enforcement of section 307 and the UFLPA is 
vital. If the law is enforced, importers with forced labor in their 
supply chains are caught, and painful consequences are imposed, 
corporations will recognize it as being in their interest to start 
performing their own due diligence to prevent forced labor. If we want 
to see corporate due diligence, we need to enforce the law.

    There are specific measures a brand should use when it wants to 
perform genuine due diligence. In the context of UFLPA compliance, an 
important step toward due diligence, in industries where the 
technologies apply, is taking advantage of the emergence of isotopic 
testing and other forensic technologies that provide corporations a 
means, independent of their suppliers, to determine whether the 
products they are sourcing have content from the Uyghur region. In all 
contexts, a due diligence measure brands should use is to understand 
the political context in which they are operating--recognizing for 
example why a labor rights inspection inside the Uyghur region cannot 
yield meaningful information or why the decisions of governmental labor 
arbitration bodies, operating under authoritarian regimes in Burma and 
Cambodia, should be treated with skepticism.\47\ Another example is 
simply not swallowing uncritically whatever claim a supplier puts 
forward to put a veneer of legality on actions workers are calling out 
as unlawful. Numerous leading apparel brands and retailers, and their 
auditing firms, swallowed just such empty claims from suppliers in 
India in 2020 and 2021,\48\ the suppliers to deny a legally mandated 
minimum wage increase to hundreds of thousands of workers, eventually 
racking up more than $50 million in arrears.

    It is important to note that none of these measures are obscure or 
difficult to put into practice for any sizable corporation. The reason 
corporations fail to perform due diligence in their supply chains is 
not because they do not know how to do it, but because they are not 
convinced it is worth their while. The good news is that enforcement of 
the UFLPA is starting to change that calculation for many corporations 
that are, or were, sourcing from the Uyghur region.
Protecting and Expanding Transparency of Import Data
    Public disclosure of import data is critical to tracing and 
monitoring forced labor risk in supply chains, and it is an essential 
tool in enabling journalists and civil society organizations to conduct 
supply chain investigations to support the robust implementation of 
both section 307 and the UFLPA.

    Currently, public access to ocean freight data is provided under 
Federal law (19 U.S.C. Sec. 1431). There is, however, no public access 
to data on shipments arriving by air, truck, or rail. CBP noted in 
December 2022 that trade via ocean freight accounted for roughly 40 
percent of U.S. imports, meaning there is no publicly available import 
data for about 60 percent of the goods we import.\49\ There is no 
rationale for greater secrecy for shipments arriving by air freight as 
opposed to those arriving by sea. There is a compelling rationale for 
making data from all categories of shipments accessible.

2022 Monthly Operational Update.''

    Industry is pushing in the opposite direction: 30 civil society 
organizations recently wrote to CBP in response to public reports of a 
proposal from U.S. businesses on the Customs Operations Advisory 
Committee (COAC) \50\ to end public access to data on maritime 
shipments:

        The trajectory should be for more transparency, not less. We 
        advocate for disclosure of air, road, and rail manifests, in 
        addition to maritime vessel manifests, while the COAC proposal 
        seeks to shroud all import data behind a thick veil of secrecy. 
        We urge CBP to reject calls for more ``confidentiality'' and 
        instead disclose all types of Customs data--air, rail, maritime 
        and road--to the public. . . .\51\

Transparency-FINAL.pdf.

    In order to support robust forced labor enforcement, Congress 
should protect the transparency of data for ocean-going shipments and 
expand that transparency to shipments arriving by air, road, and rail.
Forced Labor Enforcement in the Context of the de Minimis Exception
    Another area of concern is the impact on forced labor enforcement 
of the de minimis exception under section 321 of the Tariff Act, which 
provides duty- and tax-free treatment to shipments ``imported by one 
person on one day'' with a retail value below $800.\52\ There has been 
significant recent attention to the growing volume of imports 
benefiting from de minimis treatment \53\--most prominently the 
explosive rise of the PRC-based cut-price apparel retailer Shein, many 
of whose direct-to-
consumer shipments are imported under the exception--and the 
relationship between this growth and the decision by Congress in 2015 
to raise the de minimis threshold from $200 per shipment to its current 
level of $800. The primary issue of concern, however, is not the $800 
threshold, as sources indicate that the average value of shipments 
benefiting from de minimis treatment is around $100 \54\ and relatively 
few exceed $200.

    The concern, from the standpoint of the section 307 and UFLPA 
enforcement, is that the limited information disclosure required for 
such shipments, and the streamlined clearance procedures utilized by 
CBP, may have the effect of shielding de minimis shipments not only 
from duty and tax, but also from forced labor scrutiny. Xinjiang 
cotton, for example, has recently been detected in imports from Shein, 
via stable isotope analysis.\55\ Yet there are no indications that any 
products from Shein, which produces exclusively in the PRC, have been 
targeted by CBP in its UFLPA enforcement efforts. That specific problem 
can be rectified quickly, and, indeed, CBP should be applying intensive 
scrutiny to Shein's imports, but the broader question is how to ensure 
that the de minimis exception does not also become a forced labor 
exception. CBP is operating two pilot programs \56\ reportedly designed 
to elicit data on de minimis shipments that is more detailed and that 
is provided earlier in the clearance process. It is unclear whether 
these pilots, which have been running for several years, represent a 
solution; however, whether through the mechanisms being piloted or 
alternative means, it is essential that CBP now move swiftly to ensure 
that de minimis shipments are properly scrutinized for potential Uyghur 
region and forced labor content.

            Questions Submitted for the Record to Scott Nova
                  Question Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
    Question. Following a recent report on the alleged presence of 
Uyghur forced labor in automotive supply chains, I launched an 
investigation seeking information from eight major car makers cited in 
that report. I have asked them for detailed information on their 
efforts to eliminate forced labor from their supply chains. I am 
reviewing their responses and plan to follow up with them and others in 
the automotive supply chain.

    But automakers are not the only companies that have work to do to 
clean up supply chains. Many other sectors with complex and varied 
inputs will need to take steps to ensure compliance with the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act and section 307.

    What steps should companies--including the automakers--be taking to 
ensure there are no products made with forced labor in their supply 
chains?

    Answer. In order to ensure that its products are not made with 
Uyghur forced labor, a corporation must do the following:

          Identify every input in each product's supply chain, from 
        raw material to finished good, flagging any inputs originating 
        in the Uyghur region;
          Work with suppliers to identify alternate, non-Uyghur region 
        sources and replace those inputs;
          Contractually bind suppliers at every level of the supply 
        chain to exclude Uyghur region inputs from the corporation's 
        products;
          Require suppliers, from one end of the chain to the other, 
        to provide documentation that shows the source of inputs and 
        vet this documentation carefully for discrepancies;
          Spot-check compliance through unannounced inspections at the 
        workplace level to ensure that the inputs that a facility 
        claims to use are the ones it actually has in stock and is 
        using;
          Where applicable, use independent isotopic testing to verify 
        that finished and semi-finished products do not have Uyghur 
        region content; and
          Terminate the business relationship with any supplier that 
        provides false information about the origin of inputs; move 
        business to suppliers that have demonstrated reliability in 
        this regard.

    Corporations have the ability to know where their inputs originate. 
When a corporation lacks this information, it is not because the 
information is unknowable; it is because the corporation has not made 
it a priority to gain and maintain the information. Any corporation 
that says it is impossible to determine where every input comes from is 
stating, in effect, that it does not know whether it is in compliance, 
on any given day, with U.S. law--including the UFLPA and section 307 of 
the Tariff Act.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
    Question. Importers continue to use section 321 de minimis tariff 
waivers to import millions of individual shipments daily into the U.S. 
duty-free, much of which comes from China and is likely skirting 
enforcement actions like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act and 
section 301 penalty tariffs.

    The de minimis loophole provides a pathway for counterfeit, unsafe, 
and forced labor products to enter U.S. commerce under the radar. The 
result is that there are: pharmaceutical products coming into the U.S. 
not meeting basic safety standards, bike helmets that won't protect 
children because they are not compliant with basic safety standards, 
and textiles that may violate forced labor protections. And last but 
not least, there is fentanyl which poisons our communities and comes 
into our communities straight from China via this loophole. There are 
billions of dollars of these shipments coming to the U.S. every year 
virtually with no protocols to vet where these products are made, who 
is making them, or if they will keep us safe.

    Representative Blumenauer has legislative efforts on this front, 
and I have worked with Senator Cassidy on the issue.

    Does the de minimis trade provision facilitate unsafe and forced 
labor imports to American consumers?

    Answer. Yes.
    The central problem, from the standpoint of forced labor 
prevention, is not the tariff treatment of these products, but the fact 
that these products do not go through the normal Customs clearance 
process, enjoying instead a less formal, and far less rigorous, 
procedure. The resulting lack of scrutiny has the effect of turning a 
waiver of tariff into a potential waiver of labor rights compliance 
(and compliance with other relevant requirements).

    Regardless of whether the tariff waiver is maintained at the 
current level, or reduced, or otherwise modified, it is crucial to 
apply sufficient oversight to these shipments. Representative 
Blumenauer's Import Security and Fairness Act includes provisions that 
address this urgent need.

    Question. Would you support closing this loophole by removing de 
minimis treatment for products tied to forced labor, and other products 
where there's a potential consumer safety issue or--in the case of 
fentanyl--no public benefit?

    Answer. If the Customs clearance process for shipments coming in 
under the de minimis exception is not modified to ensure full and 
proper scrutiny of these shipments, then the exception should not be 
afforded to any product with a high risk of being tainted with forced 
labor (or a high risk of otherwise violating standards that protect 
human rights and public health).

                                 ______
                                 
            Question Submitted by Hon. Robert P. Casey, Jr.
    Question. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) was a 
landmark advancement in our fight against forced labor on a global 
scale. It has helped United States trade agencies curb the amount of 
product made with forced labor entering U.S. markets. Yet, the UFLPA 
alone cannot solve the problem of forced labor in American supply 
chains. Corporations that import goods to sell in U.S. markets are 
still sourcing inputs and goods from the Xinjiang region of China, 
where forced labor is known to be happening in abundance. Companies 
must be doing their due diligence to find and root our forced labor in 
their supply chains.

    To what extent have existing regulations gone unenforced and failed 
to hold corporations accountable for their complicity in forced labor? 
How can we hold private corporations accountable for their lack of due 
diligence and, in many cases, complicity in the presence of forced 
labor in their supply chains? Furthermore, how do we root out remaining 
forced labor in American supply chains in addition to strong 
enforcement of section 307 and the UFLPA?

    Answer. Section 307 went almost entirely unenforced until 2016; 
corporations could, and did, import forced labor-made goods with 
impunity. Progress has been made in section 307 enforcement over the 
last 7 years; however, the level of resources being applied to this 
enforcement is far below what is required, given the magnitude of the 
task.

    The UFLPA greatly enhances the enforcement process with respect to 
Uyghur forced labor, and Congress has added resources to support this 
enhanced enforcement--a major step in the right direction. Right now, 
however, we do not know how effective enforcement has been since the 
law took full effect last June. This is because Customs and Border 
Protection has provided very little reporting as to the nature and 
extent of its UFLPA enforcement work. CBP made more detailed data 
publicly available for the first time this week, and analysis is 
required to gauge the extent to which these data provide a reasonably 
clear picture.

    It is clear, though, that the percentage of shipments arriving at 
U.S. ports subject to review under the UFLPA is quite small: 0.1 
percent of shipments, according to CBP. We also see that the Entities 
List of companies implicated in forced labor, the creation of which was 
mandated by the UFLPA, remains a very short list.

    While substantial enforcement effort is clearly being made, with 
significant impact on the practices of major brands and retailers, 
these low numbers are a cause for some concern. Given the vast scope of 
the UFLPA--potentially affecting hundreds of billions of dollars in 
imports--we would expect to see a higher percentage of shipments 
scrutinized and many more corporations that have been implicated in 
forced labor added to the Entities List.

    Accountability is crucial. The level of effort corporations make to 
remove forced labor from their supply chains is in direct proportion to 
(1) the likelihood that the presence of forced-labor-made goods in 
their imports will be detected, and (2) the penalties and costs they 
will incur as a result. If corporations believe that the chances of 
getting caught are low and/or that the penalties for getting caught 
will be minor, they have very little incentive to incur the substantial 
cost of achieving broad compliance. The way to hold corporations 
accountable is to ensure that when they import goods tainted by forced 
labor they usually get caught and to impose penalties involving not 
just the denial of entry to tainted goods but the imposition of civil 
penalties on the importer--and additional measures achievable under 
existing law, such as publishing the names of corporations that are 
repeat offenders. This will result in far less forced labor in the 
supply chains of corporations selling goods in the United States.

                                 ______
                                 
                Question Submitted by Hon. John Barrasso
    Question. The Chinese Communist Party continues to commit terrible 
human rights abuses. The Uyghurs, a religious and ethnic minority in 
China, have experienced brutal repression at the hands of the Chinese 
Government. They continue to be subjected to torture, imprisonment, and 
forced labor.

    At least 1 million Uyghurs have been put in internment camps by the 
Chinese Communist Party. Around 100,000 Uyghurs and ethnic minority ex-
detainees have reportedly been used as forced labor in textile and 
other industries in China.

    How effective have U.S. actions been at addressing the human rights 
abuses and the use of forced labor?

    What more should the United States do on transparency and 
enforcement?

    Answer. The enactment of the UFLPA and the use of WROs against 
products with content from the Uyghur region have had a sizable 
economic impact, making the Chinese Government's ongoing destruction of 
the Uyghur people an increasingly expensive enterprise. It is not 
possible to measure the human rights impact with any precision and, 
where a piece of progress can be discerned, it is impossible to know 
what role economic pressure may have played in that particular 
development. What we do know is that the Chinese Government, like every 
other government, makes policy choices based on their perceived costs 
and benefits. When costs rise, they reevaluate. Action to date has 
raised the costs of the Chinese Government's brutal policies in the 
Uyghur region, and that is a good thing for the Uyghurs. The higher the 
costs, the greater the prospect of change, which is why the strongest 
possible enforcement of the UFLPA against corporations complicit in the 
abuses taking place in the Uyghur region is the best way forward.

          Prepared Statement of John Pickel, Senior Director, 
      Internal Supply Chain Policy, National Foreign Trade Council
                              introduction
    Good morning, Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of 
the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today 
and discuss the importance of these topics.

    I am John Pickel, the senior director of international supply chain 
policy at the National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC). The NFTC is the 
premier business association advancing trade and tax policies that 
support access to the global marketplace. Founded in 1914, NFTC 
promotes an open, rules-based global economy on behalf of a diverse 
membership of U.S.-based businesses.

    As Chairman Wyden has noted, I have served in several roles at the 
Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) that promoted the development and implementation of trade 
facilitation and enforcement policies. The views expressed in my 
statement and subsequent conversation are my own and given on behalf of 
the NFTC. I am not representing any agencies where I was previously 
employed or any specific company.

    The efficient and effective implementation of U.S. trade laws is a 
critical aspect of our economic competitiveness. The American Customs 
framework, which dates back to the earliest days of our country, 
continues to be a brilliant example for the international community. 
Any discussion around issues of Customs modernization should begin by 
acknowledging that this system has provided a strong foundation for the 
growth and diversification of trade models that meet the needs of 
American consumers and supplies American made manufacturing products to 
markets around the world.

    In recent years, the trade community has worked within this system 
to accommodate the dramatic expansion in the volume of e-commerce 
shipments, overcome challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and respond to historic supply chain disruptions.

    Trade is a critical driver of every aspect of the American economy. 
Forty million American jobs depend on trade.\1\ Access to imports 
increases the purchasing power of the average American household by 
about $18,000 annually.\2\ Manufacturers rely on imports of 
intermediate goods and raw materials, which represent more than 60 
percent of all U.S. goods imported, to provide high quality products at 
competitive prices.\3\

    Government and the business community share the objective of 
promoting efficient, stable, and compliant supply chains. Trust and 
collaboration will be key in that joint pursuit as business models and 
global economic conditions change rapidly. A close working relationship 
between the private sector and U.S. Government agencies, especially 
CBP, has led to innovations that promote both facilitation practices 
and compliance with U.S. trade laws. For example, the trade community 
has provided technical capacity in developing a single window that 
provides trade data to government agencies, shifted port-level 
processing of individual shipments to 
industry-based Centers of Excellence and Expertise, established Trusted 
Trader programs that provide earned benefits for certain validated 
parties, and many other accomplishments. The basis for this 
relationship is confidence in realizing that the vast majority of 
parties involved in trade transactions are trustworthy, compliant with 
the law, and eager to advance American economic security through their 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
role in a resilient supply chain.

    This committee has a well-documented history of supporting Customs 
policies that balance the importance of facilitating legitimate trade 
and promoting compliance with U.S. trade laws through principles like 
informed compliance, co-creation between government and the private 
sector, and risk-based enforcement. This was most recently codified 
throughout the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 
(TFTEA).
                         customs modernization
    Since 2019, CBP has engaged the trade community to develop a 21st 
Century Customs Framework. NFTC has participated constructively in this 
process directly and in coordination with member companies.

    Modernization of Customs authorities should be very intentional and 
precise, addressing specific gaps or challenges in a way that supports 
well-defined outcomes. As the committee prepares to consider proposed 
statutory changes, I would like to offer several key areas of 
consideration when evaluating legislative efforts to address specific 
needs while preserving the foundations that have served U.S. Government 
agencies and the trade community well for many years.
Balance the Benefits of Trade Facilitation and the Updating of 
        Enforcement Authorities
    The efficient entry of legitimate merchandise into the U.S. 
improves economic conditions; reduces burdens on government agencies, 
businesses, and customers; and provides a high level of overall 
compliance.

    As the committee considers statutory changes to existing 
authorities, please consider three questions:

          What specific non-compliance is being addressed and what 
        information about volume and means of penetrating supply chains 
        is available to inform the most effective response?
          How does the proposal impact the flow of commerce into and 
        out of the U.S.?
          Can an updated authority be structured in a way that reduces 
        red tape in the entry process? (For example, collection of 
        unnecessary data could be difficult for small and medium 
        businesses to comply with and overwhelming for government 
        agencies to ingest and effectively utilize.)
Clearly Articulate the Roles and Responsibilities of Actors Throughout 
        the Import Process
    Clearly and specifically identifying roles and responsibilities, 
with an emphasis on the value of information throughout the import 
process, will promote effective partnership between the government and 
the private sector. For example, information requirements should be 
targeted to address specific risks and be developed in partnership with 
the trade community to ensure the right information is being collected 
from the right party and at the right point in the process. Information 
is likely to come from multiple parties throughout the process, so 
avoiding assumptions about the level of information available to each 
actor and ensuring the ability to consolidate information from 
disparate entities is crucial.

    This process will continue to set an example for the world, with 
interest from our trade partners and strategic competitors alike. 
Promoting a rules-based system that supports a nimble and effective 
Customs framework to serve as this example will be an effective way to 
promote similar practices among our international trading partners. In 
practical terms, we can expect other countries to adopt some of the 
same practices, so American exporters will be expected to comply with 
the evolving U.S. standards as they are adopted by other countries.
Promote Partnership Between Government Agencies and the Private Sector, 
        With a Particular Emphasis on Sharing Information
    Both government regulators and private-industry interests are 
served by effective collaboration. Government and the private sector 
have a shared goal of fostering efficient, resilient, and compliant 
supply chains. Reimagining the exchange of information between 
government agencies and the private sector by reconsidering current 
statutory restrictions will allow the private sector to remove risk 
from its supply chains and make government enforcement more efficient. 
For example, jointly identifying meaningful information that can be 
provided on a voluntary basis, will improve effectiveness for all 
parties.
Embrace Automation to Simplify the Processing of Cargo and Promote 
        Transparency
    This committee has consistently supported the automation of the 
entry process and should continue to prioritize the ability to automate 
proposed changes to trade laws. Automation makes the government more 
effective and allows the private sector to provide better service to 
American consumers. The effective adoption of automation and other 
forms of technology is a tool--a means to an end. In other words, 
please keep in mind that systems still rely upon information generated 
and entered by multiple parties throughout trade transactions. Rather 
than a ``more is always better'' approach, please know that sometimes 
``more is just more.'' Information and data requirements can be onerous 
on all parties involved and may not have a clear benefit to specific 
objectives.
Apply Trusted Trader Principles to Address Emerging Risk Factors
    This committee codified, as the first substantive section of TFTEA, 
the importance of embracing partnership programs that advance the trade 
enforcement and trade facilitation missions of CBP. Existing programs 
have served their national security objectives well and should be 
constantly reevaluated to address the equally important goals of 
promoting trade facilitation and jointly vetting supply chains to 
ensure compliance with U.S. trade laws--particularly as government and 
industry confront new challenges in an ever-changing global trading 
environment. Current Trusted Trader programs were developed in 
partnership with private industry stakeholders and need to be adapted 
to meet emerging demands through the same spirit of collaboration and 
trust. Participants in these programs dedicate significant resources to 
attain membership and complete recurring evaluations. Another critical 
aspect of examining Trusted Trader programs, which promote 
sustainability, is understanding the value of benefits provided to 
participants. These parties have demonstrated a willingness to open 
their processes to government evaluation and should be seen as a cadre 
of constructive experts that have worked alongside the government to 
address past challenges and will continue to do so in the future.

    Whether in the context of a comprehensive Authorized Economic 
Operator program or more targeted approaches, the ``trust'' aspect of 
Trusted Trader programs should be fully embraced in order to share 
information, develop best practices, and foster a constant dialogue 
between the private sector and the government to truly support our 
joint objective of securing resilient supply chains.

    Again, this is an area where the world is watching. Trusted Trader 
programs are used by many of our trading partners to facilitate low-
risk shipments and many of those programs have Mutual Recognition 
Arrangements with the United States that provide reciprocal benefits 
for program participants. Continuing to set an evolving global standard 
for Trusted Trader programs around the world to address emerging needs 
and promote viability of membership will support the adoption of 
compliance standards with our trading partners and facilitate 
transactions for American importers and exporters.
                    importance of trade facilitation
    The reduction of administrative and financial challenges 
encountered when importing into the United States promotes product 
availability, purchasing power, and lowers transaction costs for 
businesses and consumers. Conversely, increasing red tape in the 
importation process is a regressive tax on the American middle class 
that increases the cost of products they purchase for personal and 
business use. This committee has a strong history of promoting trade 
facilitation and encouraging government partnership with the private 
sector to address supply chain challenges. However, as we learned 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, facilitating the importation of critical 
supplies like medical products continues to be a challenge and will be 
a determining factor in the success of U.S. supply chain resiliency 
programs and emergency response.

    Trade facilitation measures create jobs and promote innovation 
through the availability of product inputs. A recent report by the 
Third Way found that reducing administrative burdens throughout our 
supply chain has the potential to save the United States $88 billion in 
export costs and create just under 1 million jobs nationwide--
benefitting every state in the country.\4\ This report outlines clear 
guidance in three areas of trade facilitation that increase compliance 
and resiliency, while reducing costs.

Chains. Third Way, http://thirdway.imgix.net/pdfs/reducing-the-red-
tape-around-supply-chains.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simplify Border Processes
    The foundation of trade facilitation is ensuring clarity and 
predictability of rules, fees, and processes that incorporate the 
expertise of the trade community before being finalized. Penalties for 
not following the rules should be clear and enforcement regimes should 
provide a process for traders to review and appeal determinations. 
Incorporating international standards and commitments in trade 
agreements, such as the trade facilitation provisions of the U.S.-
Mexico-Canada Agreement, is also important.
Embrace Digitization
    Promoting the use of single window systems creates a unified method 
of providing information to the government. The U.S. single window has 
saved the government $1.75 billion and saved the trading community 
775,000 hours.\5\ As you evaluate 
single-window functionality in the U.S., and how to promote this best 
practice among our trading partners, please consider several important 
elements. First, ensure that this is a government-wide system built to 
provide all agencies with information imports and exports, and enable 
release via that system. Second, ensure clarity of downtime procedures 
in the case of system failure or a cybersecurity event. Third, the lack 
of acceptance of digital payments is still a significant barrier. 
Domestically, digital payments save the government and the trade 
community a significant amount of processing costs and staff time. 
Internationally, digital payments reduce the risk of corruption and 
remove the burdens of exchanging money for local currency. Finally, 
single windows should have transparent governance structures that allow 
for existing functionality to be improved and new capabilities to be 
added, with a clear source of funding.

Focus on Speed and Security
    Promoting simplified processes that provide the quick processing of 
compliant shipments is both a key ingredient and result of effective 
trade facilitation. Employing effective risk management programs to 
assess threat levels allows government agencies to release low-risk 
shipments and focus enforcement resources more quickly on goods that 
are more likely to be noncompliant. The adoption of de minimis and 
``informal entry'' treatment of certain entries helps to facilitate 
lower-value shipments that do not pose a risk to revenue collection.

    Notably, TFTEA took the important step of increasing de minimis--
the threshold for items to enter the U.S. free of taxes--from $200 to 
$800 and suggested that the U.S. Trade Representative encourage trading 
partners to adopt similar policies.\6\ In doing so, Congress found that 
``higher thresholds for the value of articles that may be entered 
informally and free of duty provide significant economic benefits to 
businesses and consumers in the United States and the economy of the 
United States through costs savings and reductions in trade transaction 
costs.''\7\ This de minimis policy, also a longstanding U.S. trade 
agreement negotiating objective, has been instrumental in supporting 
the dramatic expansion of online shopping and the e-
commerce models used by American businesses and consumers every day.

    As one aspect of trade facilitation, de minimis treatment of low-
value entries promotes sourcing choices for American consumers and 
producers. Eliminating or reducing the threshold for de minimis 
treatment of low-value goods could make over a billion shipments every 
year subject to tariffs, a tax that disproportionately impacts low-
income households,\9\ and African American and Hispanic families.\10\ 
Furthermore, increasing costs for small businesses to source products 
would negatively impact inflation reduction efforts and stifle 
innovation among our economy's most dynamic entrepreneurs.

    In considering changes to trade facilitation and enforcement 
authorities, I encourage the committee to prioritize consistency 
between enforcement efforts and our trade agreements. This is another 
area where the world is watching, and the U.S. should take the 
opportunity to lead. Promoting adherence and commitment to a rules-
based international system of trade will promote the adoption of those 
standards by our trading partners abroad and give predictability to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
American companies doing business around the world.

    The advancement of the trade facilitation elements described above 
should also be embraced during ongoing trade negotiations such as the 
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) and the Americas 
Partnership for Economic Prosperity (APEP), and as part of regular U.S. 
government engagement at international trade organizations including 
the World Trade Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum, especially during the 2023 U.S. host year.
                              forced labor
    There is no place for forced labor in American supply chains. In 
recent years, this committee has advanced significant changes in 
prohibitions on the importation of goods made using forced labor. 
Specifically, removal of the ``consumptive demand exception''\11\ and 
enactment of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) have 
mandated the use of border measures to prevent the importation of these 
goods. The global trade community has responded quickly to shift supply 
chains from areas where forced labor is a high risk. We have seen this 
happen when CBP issues withhold release orders and during 
implementation of the UFLPA. It is clear that there is a sincere 
commitment by responsible U.S. companies to minimize the risk of forced 
labor from infiltrating supply chains.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, Pub. 
L. 114-125 Sec. 910 (2016).

    The noble objectives of current U.S. trade laws related to forced 
labor are clear, and responsible American importers want to utilize 
those constructs in a way that addresses global supply chain risk. 
Those companies want to work with the committee to identify ways that 
partnership programs and information sharing authorities, for example, 
can be used in new and creative ways that promote compliance before 
goods arrive in the U.S.--making it clear that forced labor is not only 
inhumane, but also bad for business. As we work together toward that 
shared goal, the trade community craves transparency and predictability 
in understanding what is a feasible level of due diligence in 
minimizing risks within supply chains that, for example, can include 
complicated machines containing thousands of components, some of which 
cross borders many times before being incorporated into a finished 
product. Recognizing that government has many of the same gaps in 
visibility when it comes to nuanced supply chains, the seamless sharing 
of meaningful information, and confidence that we are jointly moving in 
the direction of mitigating the presence of forced labor in U.S. supply 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
chains is the best approach to joint success.

    Further, as forced labor efforts relate to countries that are 
willing to partner with the U.S., bilateral and multilateral efforts 
should be used to address the root causes of forced labor and systemic 
factors that contribute to these terrible practices. For example, the 
U.S. Government has an opportunity to work with foreign governments to 
implement best practices related to labor recruitment and basic 
governance that support existing labor laws. Additionally, working with 
foreign partners to promote congruent standards for addressing forced 
labor concerns in supply chains would further the global interest in 
enforcing forced labor prohibitions and promote predictability for U.S. 
businesses exporting to other countries.
                               conclusion
    Thank you for the committee's attention to these important topics. 
Continued partnership between government and the private sector will be 
critical to supporting a comprehensive, predictable Customs framework 
that provides for compliance with U.S. trade laws and supply chain 
resiliency. This partnership will continue to promote our shared 
objectives of fostering efficient and compliant supply chains that 
support American economic security. NFTC and our member companies look 
forward to working with the committee going forward, and I welcome your 
questions.

           Questions Submitted for the Record to John Pickel
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo
    Question. In your opening statement, you stated that Customs 
modernization efforts should address the principle of simplifying 
processes. You also mentioned, in your statement, that increases of red 
tape in the importation process is effectively a tax on the middle 
class by virtue of increasing the cost of goods.

    What are some actionable Customs reforms that would cut red tape?

    Are there certain reforms that would be particularly beneficial for 
small and medium enterprises?

    Answer. Red tape is synonymous with duplicative paperwork. Third 
Way found that increased efficiency in this area could create 987,000 
jobs total, increasing job growth in each State across the U.S. As the 
committee considers changes to Customs authorities, ensuring ongoing 
updates to automation capabilities will greatly promote efficiency in 
facilitating legitimate trade. The current automation framework is not 
entirely paperless and there are many examples of duplicative data 
elements required by various agencies. Businesses of all sizes would 
benefit from the adoption of automation by foreign trading partners, 
such as full information sharing and interoperability between the 
Automated Commercial Environment and ASEAN single window. Small and 
medium enterprises would benefit most from clarity of responsibilities, 
clear due diligence standards, and clear government commitment to 
ongoing trade policies that lower transaction costs. This committee 
should continue to promote the competitiveness of small and medium 
enterprises through a continued commitment to a meaningful de minimis 
level and consider raising the current upper limit for informal 
entries, ensuring increased purchasing power and lower transaction 
costs for low-value shipments that supply small businesses with narrow 
profit margins. These low-value shipments are subject to trade law 
enforcement based on information provided by shippers, have a similar 
compliance rate when compared to other types of shipments, and provide 
meaningful economic benefits to underserved communities. Automating 
changes to Customs procedures, along with ensuring harmonization and 
de-duplication between the data requirements of CBP and the 49 partner 
government agencies that also regulate trade will also be key.

    Question. In your opening statement, you emphasized the importance 
of partnership programs, such as Trusted Traders.

    How may strengthening partnership programs, whether with companies 
in the United States or with U.S. trading partners, facilitate more 
lawful trade?

    Answer. Updating existing partnership programs to focus on the 
benefits of participating entities in accomplishing the regulatory 
responsibilities of government agencies, identifying new applications 
of Trusted Trader principles would improve effectiveness of U.S. trade 
law enforcement, and reducing costs from inspections and administrative 
burdens imposed on low-risk shipments--ultimately benefiting American 
businesses and consumers. Trusted Traders should be provided detailed 
information about risks identified through their supply chain, with 
confidence that such information will be used to address any 
vulnerabilities earlier in the supply chain. Mitigating risk earlier in 
the supply chain is a more effective approach to achieve compliance, 
especially in areas like forced labor enforcement and anticounterfeit 
efforts, than trying to resolve potential compliance issues upon 
arrival at ports in the U.S. Furthermore, specific confidential 
information-sharing and convening authority should be granted to DHS 
that allows bidirectional exchanges of information between government 
agencies and among participating companies throughout the import 
process to further promote compliance in a manner that removes concerns 
about potential liability. In other words, information should be shared 
on a voluntary basis, removing the risk of penalty or other liability 
imposed by the government, and should be held in confidence among the 
government and industry participants.

                                 ______
                                 
                Question Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
    Question. Several years ago, Congress gave Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) the authority to investigate whether a company has 
evaded antidumping and countervailing (AD/CVD) duties. While CBP has 
made dozens of determinations since that time, Customs fraud continues 
to undermine the value of the United States' antidumping and unlawful 
subsidy trade laws, meaning hundreds of millions of dollars of 
antidumping and countervailing duty fees don't get collected.

    Senator Tillis and I are working on legislation that supports CBP's 
efforts and will empower American companies to pursue private rights of 
action against bad actors. We hope to introduce our bill within the 
next couple of weeks.

    You worked at CBP, and likely saw how some importers never pay the 
duties they owe. Would you support strengthening CBP's ability to 
collect on tariffs and pursue certain resident importers who support 
foreign rule-breaking?

    Answer. The evasion of revenue owed to the government is illegal 
and should be pursued vigorously. I look forward to fully reviewing 
your proposed legislation and offer whatever assistance NFTC may 
provide you and Senator Tillis to fully consider the benefits and 
implications of the bill. Generally speaking, the current retrospective 
system of assessing and collecting AD/CVD revenue has an inherent risk 
of evasion and under-collection from bond coverage, which has likely 
factored into the decision by so many countries around the world to 
adopt a prospective AD/CVD system. The vast majority of importers are 
responsible, compliant, and regularly resolve their financial 
obligations to the government. Accordingly, amendments to the current 
statutory framework in this space should ensure due process is provided 
to protect good actors from being harmed.

                                 ______
                                 
            Question Submitted by Hon. Robert P. Casey, Jr.
    Question. Workers in Pennsylvania and across this Nation can out-
compete anyone in the world if the playing field is level. Yet, decades 
of trade cheating like IP theft, state subsidization, and the use of 
forced labor have distorted fair market prices and cost American jobs. 
Pennsylvania's steel industry has especially borne the brunt of these 
unfair trade practices. Anti-dumping and countervailing duties--which 
the CBP plays a critical part in supporting--have been a key part of 
providing a level playing field for American workers and industry. Yet, 
nonmarket economies ceaseless efforts to circumvent U.S. trade law 
continue to permeate our defenses. In your written testimony, you've 
made a set of recommendations to improve CBP's ability to facilitate 
trade and enforce trade remedies.

    How do you propose we focus these recommendations on protecting 
American workers, not just American industry?

    Answer. Compliance with U.S. trade laws is an objective shared by 
the U.S. Government and responsible members of the private sector. If 
crafted effectively, trade facilitation can be achieved in a way that 
promotes compliance to the benefit of American companies and workers. 
For example, the effective utilization of Trusted Trader programs to 
share information between government and businesses would mitigate 
illicit behavior like illegal transshipment that undermines enforcement 
of AD/CVD orders at the time of entry. The effective use of automation 
provides U.S. regulatory agencies with more information in less time 
than a paper-based process, giving the opportunity to identify high-
risk shipments requiring further scrutiny. American-based companies 
that import into the U.S. are overwhelmingly compliant. ``Shrinking the 
haystack'' by removing low-risk shipments from consideration for 
resource-intensive actions at ports allows government agencies to 
allocate precious hours and equipment to more effectively act where 
there is a higher risk of illicit trade, like forced labor and 
counterfeits. More broadly, given that more than 40 million workers 
depend on international trade for their jobs, it is critical for the 
United States to aggressively pursue new trade agreements with key 
economic and strategic allies to increase market access for American 
goods and services and to write high-standard rules that protect 
intellectual property, facilitate innovation and create more resilient 
supply chains.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
    Question. In your testimony, you say that the world is watching how 
the U.S. is for setting standards on trade facilitation and 
enforcement.

    What are some areas the U.S. could take more of a leadership role 
in for setting those international standards?

    Answer. The United States should continue its commitment to 
facilitating legitimate trade, and encouraging our foreign trading 
partners to adopt reciprocal policies that benefit American exporters. 
Easing the flow of trade globally ensures that responsible trading 
partners can meet customer demands and innovate in a dynamic global 
trading environment. This is particularly true when it comes to 
promoting de minimis and informal entry treatment for low-value 
shipments and automation standards (including the ability to process 
electronic payments) that improve efficiency in addressing entry 
requirements in the U.S. and around the world.

    Along similar lines, the United States should build on its global 
leadership in trade facilitation by improving and expanding the 
informal entry process for those shipments currently valued between 
$800-$2,500. While the de minimis threshold for duty- and tax-free 
shipments is a critical component to building a strong SME sector in 
international trade, the key for governments is to establish efficient 
and streamlined collection mechanisms for low-value shipments where tax 
and duty are applicable. Congress should raise the $2,500 ceiling to a 
more competitive baseline, while granting CBP the regulatory authority 
to raise it further.

    In addition, Congress should require CBP, in coordination with 
other agencies, to design and implement a ``bucket'' system for 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) classification for eligible shipments, 
e.g., a limited number of classifications instead of the 10,000+ tariff 
lines currently found in the HTS. We recommend excluding from this 
``bucketing'' system Partner Government Agencies (``PGA'') shipments 
and other ``restricted'' goods where 10-digit HTS codes are required. 
For those informal entries where HTS codes are required, however, an 
expansion of Entry Type 86 clearance processes could also apply. This 
model could then be held up to the world as a best practice and 
continue the U.S. leadership role in setting the gold standard for 
facilitative trade.

    Question. I understand some of your work has focused on advancing 
policies related to anticounterfeiting. Do you have any recommendations 
for this committee on how the U.S. can help lead the way in 
anticounterfeiting measures?

    Answer. Fighting counterfeits has been a hallmark of American trade 
policy with foreign trading partners. Combating trade in counterfeits 
requires a coordinated partnership between the U.S. Government and the 
trade community. Domestically, rightsholders spend significant 
resources protecting their intellectual property and information 
available during the entry process would be helpful in that endeavor. 
First, information shared by U.S. Customs and Border Protection with 
rightsholders to assist in determining whether a shipment is 
counterfeit is restricted to the product and retail packaging. CBP's 
sharing images of other items in or on the shipping box (like address 
labels, invoices, packing lists, promotional materials, etc.) would 
also be helpful to share with rightsholders. Additionally, there is a 
significant gap between the initial sharing of information and post-
seizure data being provided to the rightsholder. Permitting CBP to 
share information throughout the detention, pre-seizure, and seizure 
phases would give rightsholders insight into practices used to steal 
their intellectual property. Finally, working with the Department of 
Justice to prioritize prosecution of counterfeiters would send a strong 
message to illicit actors. In each of these areas, it will be important 
to promote due process standards to appropriately enforce trade laws 
against bad actors, but also ensure that good actors are not 
arbitrarily implicated or harmed.

    Question. I would also like to know your thoughts about how you 
think the government and the private sector can work together more 
effectively to advance policy solutions that achieve a balance between 
trade facilitation and enforcement?

    Answer. There are a variety of ways that collaboration between 
government and the private sector can promote compliance in a way that 
facilitates legitimate trade. First, evaluating current Trusted Trader 
programs to identify how ongoing and emerging challenges are being 
addressed. Calibrating requirements to align with security and trade 
compliance in a way that provides commercially significant benefits 
will provide a meaningful, mutually beneficial framework for government 
and the private sector. Second, effective automation saves the 
government and industry precious resources. Collaborating to address 
current gaps in automation capability and ensuring the effective 
automation of new requirements into the future--including sustainable 
funding structures--will amplify those benefits. Third, which may 
require statutory authority, government and industry should be able to 
share information on a voluntary, confidential basis free from concern 
that such information sharing could violate current law (i.e., Trade 
Secrets Act, Privacy Act, etc.).

                                 ______
                                 
                Question Submitted by Hon. Bill Cassidy
    Question. Does CBP have the ability to police imports without HTS 
numbers?

    Answer. The purpose of the classification of products under the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the U.S. (HTS) is to determine the duty 
liability of an importation, not for policing. CBP does not need an HTS 
code to police shipments, and it is unclear how useful HTS numbers are 
to CBP for purposes of targeting. An HTS code is based off a 
description of the goods, which are required for all shipments, 
including de minimis shipments. In many ways a description of a product 
is better for targeting purposes than an HTS code because one HTS code 
can cover numerous different products, whereas a description often adds 
more detail. The dozens of additional data elements already required 
for each shipment are more useful than an HTS, especially considering 
the costs associated with providing one. Requiring an HTS code would 
increase costs on traders significantly because, by statute, the 
provision of an HTS code is considered ``Customs business,'' which 
necessitates the hiring of a licensed Customs broker. This costly 
burden would fall disproportionately on small and medium-sized 
enterprises.

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
    Question. Naturally, increasing trade leads to more economic 
activity, higher wages, and new job opportunities across various 
sectors. For underdeveloped countries, expanding trade can elevate 
standards and provide economic stability.

    Do you believe there are better benefits associated with a free 
trade agreement versus voluntary frameworks with soft regulations?

    Answer. Binding and enforceable free trade agreements are critical 
tools for unlocking new market opportunities for American businesses 
and workers as well as for enshrining best practices and 
nondiscriminatory rules. While voluntary frameworks can be helpful in 
advancing shared goals, formal agreements, which include market access, 
can provide more robust benefits and durable rules to improve the 
playing field for American businesses and workers and break down 
barriers to enable more resilient supply chains. The U.S. Government 
has an important role to play in aggressively pursuing robust free 
trade agreements, including with key trading partners like the United 
Kingdom.

    Question. As efforts build to promote friend-shoring and re-
shoring, Customs processing should function as a tool instead of a 
barrier as businesses find new sources for inputs. Creating clear 
guidelines and efficient procedures at ports of entry can help 
alleviate some of the stressors created by establishing a new supply 
chain for a given product. In other words, there must be stronger 
collaboration between the government and the private sector to minimize 
hurdles in the process.

    How can efforts to modernize the Customs process help our domestic 
enterprises to friend-shore and re-shore?

    How can partnerships between the government and private sector be 
better leveraged to address our supply chain challenges?

    Answer. Supply chains continue to shift in response to disruptions, 
with a clear trend toward redundancy and expanding closer and more 
secure sourcing options. Resilient supply chains are diverse, agile, 
and reflect ever-changing models driven by customer demands. Government 
policies aimed at reorienting supply chains should be mandated only 
when consistent with U.S. international trade obligations. In keeping 
with those obligations, modernized U.S. Customs processes should be 
applied, to the greatest extent possible, on a most-favored nation 
basis. That said, effective enforcement of U.S. trade laws comes down 
to identifying and segmenting risk. More effectively sharing 
information between trusted partners, to root out risk earlier in the 
supply chain, and adopting technology that provides greater visibility 
into shipments will be key. That more surgical approach is better for 
traders of all sizes than more drastic actions targeting entire 
countries and sectors.

    Question. The ability for U.S. companies to become self-sufficient 
in terms of supply chain resiliency varies somewhat from product to 
product. Some materials simply are not obtainable domestically, so 
supply chains will require sourcing from geographically diverse 
locations. However, among the lessons of the pandemic is that the U.S.-
based companies must do more to secure inputs for strategic goods.

    What tools or resources do U.S. companies need from the Federal 
Government to help remove their supply chains from non-market economies 
that likely use coercion or protectionist policies that distort market 
values?

    Answer. This is a great point, Senator. There is a significant 
trend in U.S. companies diversifying their supply chains to build in 
agility and align with suppliers that are geographically closer and 
more secure to the next stage of manufacturing or end users. The 
Federal Government's sharing of specific information about suspected or 
verified risks in supply chains, particularly with trusted parties, is 
the best way to promote resilient sourcing decisions. The trade 
community wants to be compliant, and they want to create sustainable 
supply chain--which means minimizing risk. To the extent there can be a 
trust-based exchange of information and ideas between government and 
responsible companies, better decisions will be made toward the end of 
compliance and resilience in supply chains that are the cornerstone of 
American economic security.

    Question. As companies are working to comply with the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act and eradicate forced labor from supply chains, 
they have expressed several challenges, including the lack of available 
information from suppliers in China.

    What actions can the administration take to ensure companies have 
the information they need to comply with the law despite the China's 
attempt to set up barriers?

    What actions should this committee consider to support companies 
and their efforts to effectively spot and prevent forced labor in their 
supply chains?

    Answer. There is no place for forced labor in American supply 
chains. Private industry continues to dedicate significant resources to 
compliance programs and social responsibility initiatives that 
implement the letter and spirit of current statutory requirements 
related to forced labor. But the private sector cannot address forced 
labor--particularly state-sponsored forced labor--alone. The 
administration should provide a unified approach to address the root 
causes of forced labor, sharing information about risk assessments with 
private industry to inform specific sourcing decisions. Working with 
foreign trade partner countries to address the root causes of forced 
labor, such as promoting best practices in recruitment and governance 
that supports existing forced labor laws, would be far more effective 
in ending forced labor than addressing information gaps when cargo 
arrives at U.S. ports. Establishing a jointly developed understanding 
of due diligence standards would promote compliance earlier in supply 
chains and streamline admissibility determinations at already congested 
ports.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. John Barrasso
    Question. The expiration of the Generalized System of Preferences 
(GSP) and the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) is hurting our 
manufacturers, businesses, and families across the country. American 
businesses have already paid more than $2 billion in extra taxes due to 
the expiration of GSP. The National Association of Manufacturers 
estimates U.S. manufacturers are paying $1.3 million per day in extra 
taxes due to the expiration of the MTB.

    Can you explain how the expiration of these programs impacts 
businesses, consumers, and U.S. Customs operations?

    Answer. The lapse of these trade preference programs has short- and 
long-term implications for businesses and their consumers. More 
obviously, businesses are paying money to the government that could be 
used for investment in their market competitiveness. Even if GSP 
refunds are provided retroactively, as they have in the past, the loss 
of capital access during this lapse has already impacted business 
decisions, potentially limiting the ability of companies to hire 
employees, offer new products, and innovate. The GSP program is 
intended to promote trade with developing countries, while the MTB is 
meant to ease financial burdens for businesses when importing products 
that can't be procured domestically. Allowing these programs to lapse 
sends an unfortunate, if unintended, message that businesses cannot 
rely on consistent, long-term government commitment to these 
initiatives. The benefits of these programs are undercut by perceived 
lack of commitment because business cannot rely on them to make long-
term sourcing decisions.

    Question. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare many of the shortcomings 
in our supply chains. Supply chain challenges impacted nearly every 
industry and those challenges were felt by businesses and consumers 
alike. As we look to strengthen and secure our supply chains, are there 
steps we can take to ensure U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB) 
operations aren't exacerbating existing supply chain challenges? What 
changes or improvements to existing CPB authorities should we consider 
to keep goods and services flowing across our borders?

    Answer. This is a great point about the importance of resilient and 
compliant supply chains. I would first point out that the spirit behind 
specific authorities is to promote partnership and efficiency in the 
joint objective of promoting resilience and compliance. There should be 
a principle, across trade law enforcement, that improves information 
sharing between industry and government to address compliance concerns 
earlier in the supply chain. Conversely, addressing admissibility 
issues at ports of entry taxes government resources, increases costs 
for American consumers, and negatively impacts business operations. 
There are specific authorities that would promote the facilitation of 
legitimate cargo coming into the U.S., like ensuring long-term 
approaches to automation to better address current and emerging needs 
facing both government and industry. In addition to the other 
authorities mentioned in my statement, I would encourage a fresh look 
at the current authority to require redelivery of cargo that has been 
cleared by CBP. If the government clears cargo which is, in many cases, 
immediately delivered to customers or put on shelves for retail sale, 
requests to redeliver back to the government places an unrealistic 
burden on the trade community and conflicts with modern demands to 
provide timely delivery of products being imported.

    Question. The Chinese Communist Party continues to commit terrible 
human rights abuses. The Uyghurs, a religious and ethnic minority in 
China, have experienced brutal repression at the hands of the Chinese 
Government. They continue to be subjected to torture, imprisonment, and 
forced labor.

    At least 1 million Uyghurs have been put in internment camps by the 
Chinese Communist Party. Around 100,000 Uyghurs and ethnic minority ex-
detainees have reportedly been used as forced labor in textile and 
other industries in China.

    How effective have U.S. actions been at addressing the human rights 
abuses and the use of forced labor?

    What more should the United States do on transparency and 
enforcement?

    Answer. Assessing the impact of the Uygur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act in addressing the atrocities facing Uyghurs and other ethnic groups 
is critical. As I mentioned in my statement, there is no place for 
forced labor in American supply chains. Where supply chain 
vulnerabilities are identified, American companies have shifted their 
sourcing to comply with legal requirements and our shared goal of 
removing risk of forced labor entering supply chains. The efficacy of 
UFLPA will align with advancements in promoting supply chain visibility 
in the government and private sector, and information sharing that 
promotes compliance at earlier points of the supply chain. Furthermore, 
ensuring consistent collaboration with foreign trading partners to 
address root causes of forced labor, like promoting recruitment best 
practices and improving governance in other countries to enforce 
existing laws, will drive more sustainable change related to forced 
labor. Finally, it would be helpful to include specific private-sector 
representatives as part of the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force, 
subject to eligibility criteria and confidentiality, to provide 
industry context as part of the FLETF deliberations.

        Prepared Statement of Brenda B. Smith, Global Director, 
   Government Outreach, Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.
    Mr. Chairman, Senator Crapo, and members of the committee, thank 
you for the chance to testify before you today. My name is Brenda 
Smith, and I currently work as the global director of government 
outreach for Expeditors International of Washington, Inc., a global 
logistics, freight forwarding, and information company. Previously, I 
served for 7 years as the Executive Assistant Commissioner for Trade at 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, during my 35-year career with the 
Federal Government. The views that I express today are my own and do 
not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of my current 
or past employers.

    I would like to highlight four areas of opportunity for Customs 
modernization, that will support both better trade facilitation and 
stronger trade enforcement:

          Leveraging Trusted Traders to manage risk;
          Digitization and single windows;
          Supply chain resilience; and
          Coordination of government agencies operating at the border.
                                context
    The global pandemic laid bare the weaknesses and gaps in the 
complex, global system that transports goods from farmers and 
manufacturers to consumers. In the 40 years that I have worked with 
trade issues, the volume of global imports and exports has grown from 
$854 billion in 1984 to a record-breaking $32 trillion last year. This 
staggering growth has been accompanied by an overlay of new trade 
agreements, expanded parties in the supply chain, and increased 
consumer expectations.
                               challenge
    Customs administrations have evolved significantly over those same 
40 years, but mostly in response to significant border security 
challenges. This security-driven evolution has often left trade 
modernization efforts at the 75-percent completion stage, thereby 
missing the chance to deliver critical benefits for both private and 
public sectors. Incomplete modernization efforts have resulted in:

          Paper or PDF documents remaining part of government 
        processes;
          Multiple systems needed for document/data submission, even 
        where single windows exist;
          Few purpose-built processes or bespoke physical 
        infrastructures that allow for frictionless, low-risk trade;
          Little recognition of Authorized Economic Operator status 
        outside a ``home'' country; and
          Poor regulatory and operational coordination between Customs 
        and other government agencies.
                                 action
    In my work on the U.S. single window, I learned the importance of 
having a clear vision for the effort and then translating this vision 
into the relevant legal, operational, and technology frameworks. My own 
``statement of principles'' underlying a vision for Customs 
modernization would include these provisions:

    First, leveraging Trusted Trader investment to share risk 
information and truly streamline entry and compliance procedures by all 
government agencies. Make a ``green lane'' a reality across all types 
of shipments and all trade processes. This approach should extend to 
expansion and full implementation of AEO Mutual Recognition Agreements.

    Second, digitizing all government agency requirements for supply 
chains, to include a continued commitment to the U.S. single window and 
a full review and rationalization of data requirements to minimize 
redundancy and focus on collecting only the most important data at the 
right time from the right party. More data isn't always better; quality 
is more important than quantity.

    Third, planning and practicing a response to supply chain 
disruptions across all government agencies and their supply chain 
partners. Further, resiliency will be greater if potential regulatory 
and operational flexibilities are determined in advance and recognize 
the lower risk associated with Trusted Traders.

    Fourth, and finally, a single process across all agencies with 
requirements for goods crossing borders, to include alignment of 
regulatory requirements, operational processes, Trusted Trader 
programs, and commitment to using the single window for the collection 
of all data or documents.

    Most of these concepts are not new, and this committee gave 
guidance in these areas during the passage of the Trade Facilitation 
and Trade Enforcement Act. However, meaningful change takes time and 
investment and requires that all stakeholders involved prove the value, 
get feedback, and then iterate. If we capitalize on the opportunities 
that still exist in these areas, U.S. businesses would be more 
competitive, U.S. consumers would benefit, and U.S. Government agencies 
would be more successful in enforcement of laws that protect U.S. 
consumers and businesses.

    What will it take to implement this vision? There are many things 
that should be included, but I would like to highlight two specific 
areas: (1) investment in Customs personnel and technology; and (2) 
collaboration with stakeholders.

    First, implementation will require ongoing investment in ``softer'' 
parts of Customs infrastructure, specifically expertise and technology. 
Customs needs sufficient trade personnel to enforce trade rules, but 
also needs the bandwidth to create and implement new approaches for 
facilitation and enforcement. Aside from tremendous investment in 
forced labor capabilities, the level of CBP's non-uniformed trade 
personnel has not materially increased since CBP was established in 
2003. In addition to ensuring that there is enough personnel to handle 
the growth in trade and complexity, these personnel need to be well 
trained and expert in both modern business practices and in traditional 
competencies such as classification, valuation, and Customs 
enforcement, with a dedicated Trade and Cargo Academy and regularly 
updated curriculum.

    Investment in technology is also an integral part of developing a 
common Customs process and makes it possible to support the data 
collection, transmission, and analysis around compliance with common 
rules. Technology investment must prioritize the continued 
modernization of the Automated Commercial Environment. Today's emerging 
technologies can help supply chain visibility and a targeted risk 
management approach that facilitates trade, improved revenue 
collection, compliance, and security in ways not possible even 5 years 
ago.

    The second key requirement for modernization is collaboration with 
stakeholders. During my tenure at CBP, I worked extensively with the 
trade community in the Commercial Operations Advisory Committee, the 
Trade Support Network (TSN), trade associations, and with individual 
companies. I valued interagency forums like the Border Interagency 
Executive Council (BIEC), which allowed frank discussion and consensus-
building between agencies. Expanding private-sector engagement with the 
partner government agencies through the BIEC and driving more active 
regulatory, operational, and technology coordination through forums 
like COAC, the TSN, and the BIEC would result in better problem solving 
and a trade environment that meets the needs of both government and the 
private sector.
                                results
    Multinational traders face the challenge of meeting compliance and 
service obligations while managing the cost required to deliver value 
to the market. Global security concerns, economic uncertainty, and 
varying Customs and other government agency processes represent real 
business challenges. Trade can be a tremendous engine of economic 
growth--more so if the pieces and parts of the trade process are 
aligned. These processes and the expertise, technology and 
collaboration that underpins them must keep up with the pace of change 
happening in the global economy. When private and public participants 
work together, the outcome should lead to predictability and 
consistency, improved compliance and security, better revenue 
collection, reduced supply chain costs, and improved performance 
overall.
                               conclusion
    Modernization efforts should begin with a shared vision which 
should include four key elements:

          Leveraging Trusted Traders to manage risk;
          Digitization and single windows;
          Supply chain resilience; and
          Coordination of government agencies operating at the border.

    We should then use a staged approach, developed through private- 
and public-
sector collaboration, to develop and implement the legal framework, 
operational approach, and automation. This will enable the trade 
community and government alike to take full advantage of the 
opportunities of modernization and to validate over time that the 
government's trade processes have been simplified and that 
inefficiencies or variables that were previously manual and subjective 
are not exacerbated through automation. We must review and test the 
policy, regulations, process, and technology at each stage in a 
controlled manner across regions and government agencies to assess 
whether the new technology is an improvement.

    I thank this committee for the opportunity to advocate for Customs 
modernization. Much work remains to be done, but I strongly believe 
that it is work worth pursuing, as we support opportunities for 
businesses and consumers as they engage in the global marketplace.

         Questions Submitted for the Record to Brenda B. Smith
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo
    Question. You most recently served as the Executive Assistant 
Commissioner in CBP's Office of Trade, overseeing both enforcement and 
facilitation matters.

    As Congress considers modernizing Customs laws, can you speak to 
the importance of balancing these priorities?

    Answer. The facilitation of legitimate trade and the enforcement of 
U.S. trade laws are both critical to the U.S. economy, its businesses, 
and consumers. Investing in measures that facilitate low-risk trade, 
particularly that of trusted partners, can reduce the cost, time, and 
unpredictability associated with the traditional movement of goods. At 
the same time, the enforcement of U.S. trade laws helps to provide a 
level playing field and the opportunity to compete in the global 
marketplace for compliant businesses. U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) is called on to balance these imperatives.

    From an operational perspective, these two requirements reinforce 
each other. Trade enforcement (the identification of noncompliant 
trade) is often referred to as ``finding a needle in a haystack.'' By 
enabling legitimate, low-risk trade to move across U.S. borders without 
stopping or conducting nonproductive inspections with few results, CBP 
is reducing the size of the haystack, enabling CBP to spend more time 
and resources focused on finding entities or individuals looking to 
evade U.S. laws.

    Question. In your opening statement, you highlighted the need for 
better operational coordination between Customs and other agencies.

    Where do the most glaring breakdowns in communication between CBP 
and other Federal agencies occur?

    Answer. The greatest opportunity for better operational 
coordination resides with the overall vision for how the U.S. moves 
goods across its borders. In the United States, we have several policy 
goals--including border security, trade facilitation, public health, 
consumer product safety, and agricultural security, to name just a 
few--that, by statute or tradition, are operationally executed at the 
border.

    Developing a framework for the streamlined execution of these 
priorities by the government and efficient compliance by the private 
sector is critical to resolving the lack of strategic coordination on 
trade operations. This framework needs to leverage a single approach 
across the government to automation and digitization, admissibility, 
information requirements, targeting and Trusted Trader programs. The 
lack of uniformity in approach by the 50 agencies with equities at the 
border causes breakdowns in communication, resource planning, 
programming of systems, training, and operational execution. Further, 
the resulting inconsistencies and duplication cost the private sector 
time and money, which reduces the benefits of trade to the U.S. 
economy, U.S. manufacturers and U.S. consumers.

            Question Submitted by Hon. Robert P. Casey, Jr.
    Question. Workers in Pennsylvania and across this Nation can out-
compete anyone in the world if the playing field is level. Yet, decades 
of trade cheating like IP theft, state subsidization, and the use of 
forced labor have distorted fair market prices and cost American jobs. 
Pennsylvania's steel industry has especially borne the brunt of these 
unfair trade practices. Antidumping and countervailing duties--which 
the CBP plays a critical part in supporting--have been a key part of 
providing a level playing field for American workers and industry. Yet 
nonmarket economies ceaseless efforts to circumvent U.S. trade law 
continue to permeate our defenses. In your written testimony, you've 
made a set of recommendations to improve CBPs ability to facilitate 
trade and enforce trade remedies.

    How do you propose we focus these recommendations on protecting 
American workers, not just American industry?

    Answer. Three specific areas come to mind when thinking about how 
to support the American worker through our Customs laws. First, 
protection of intellectual property, as these enforcement actions go to 
the core of American workers' ability to innovate and stay ahead of the 
global economy. Second, the enforcement of antidumping and 
countervailing duty orders. Too many American jobs have been lost when 
the businesses they support get priced out of the market. Protecting 
CBP's enforcement authority against violative entities and individuals 
supports domestic economic activity and keeps jobs in U.S. communities. 
Third, the targeting of unfair labor conditions spotlights illegal 
competition from workers in substandard working environments and 
supports fair working conditions for American workers.

                Question Submitted by Hon. Bill Cassidy
    Question. The Consumer Products Safety Commission still regularly 
finds lead in imported children's toys. Under formal entry, they can 
detain a shipment that typically consists of at least an entire 
shipping container, and do a lab test to determine whether that entire 
shipment should be entered.

    But when a toy is shipped by itself directly to a child's house, is 
it still viable to expect the Commission to pay to test that specific 
toy? If they did, and the results tested positive for lead, would CBP 
be able to intercept other de minimis shipments of that same toy?

    Answer. Under current Customs laws, goods in small packages must 
meet the same compliance expectations and exhibit the same level of 
``reasonable care'' as goods in 40-foot containers. In practice, this 
is not always the case. We want people to be able to trust the goods 
that arrive quickly and with relatively low cost on their doorsteps. 
The government's challenge is to determine where best to collect 
information and compel compliance responsibility to keep goods flowing, 
while allowing CBP and other government agencies the opportunity to 
assess risk and stop noncompliant goods.

    CBP and its other agency partners have heavily invested time and 
resources to modernize their processing and oversight of the movement 
of small packages and have learned a great deal, but work remains to be 
done.

    Further streamlining compliance expectations is not the answer. 
Engaging non-traditional actors to collect the right information at the 
right time and extending compliance responsibility to those same 
actors, while mandating the government has sufficient resources to 
enforce those responsibilities, would help to safeguard the health and 
well-being of consumers and promote economic fairness and growth.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. John Barrasso
    Question. The expiration of the Generalized System of Preferences 
(GSP) and the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) is hurting our 
manufacturers, businesses, and families across the country. American 
businesses have already paid more than $2 billion in extra taxes due to 
the expiration of GSP. The National Association of Manufacturers 
estimates U.S. manufacturers are paying $1.3 million per day in extra 
taxes due to the expiration of the MTB.

    Can you explain how the expiration of these programs impacts 
businesses, consumers, and U.S. Customs operations?

    Answer. Other than the duty impact and increased expense to 
consumers resulting from the expiration of these programs, the two main 
costs to both government and industry stem from the unpredictability 
and the rework required to file for and process the revised Customs 
entries if the programs are reauthorized.

    The value of these programs in driving investment overseas and 
building resilient supply chains is significantly diminished when U.S. 
businesses are unable to rely on these programs as part of their 
sourcing strategy. Further, when these programs are allowed to expire 
and then are reauthorized with retroactive applicability, both the 
government and the trade must manage the administrative and duty 
changes in a large volume of Customs entries, taking resources away 
from other priorities like innovation and compliance. Reauthorizing 
these programs in advance would streamline administrative processes for 
both business and government and increase the overall value of these 
programs.

    Question. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare many of the shortcomings 
in our supply chains. Supply chain challenges impacted nearly every 
industry, and those challenges were felt by businesses and consumers 
alike. As we look to strengthen and secure our supply chains, are there 
steps we can take to ensure U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
operations aren't exacerbating existing supply chain challenges?

    What changes or improvements to existing CPB authorities should we 
consider to keep goods and services flowing across our borders.

    Answer. CBP does tremendous, good work in managing the day-to-day 
border operations for a very complex network of global supply chains. 
Opportunities exist to modify the strategic framework around the 
management of the supply chains that cross U.S. borders. Congress could 
provide CBP the legal authority and mandate to test additional ideas 
resulting from stakeholder consultation and government expertise, 
prioritizing more streamlined, digitized, and economically competitive 
trade processes.

    This strategic framework should prioritize more streamlined 
processes for Trusted Traders, a consistent approach to risk management 
among government agencies and CBP enforcement authorities and means to 
effectively pursue those entities and individuals who seek to evade our 
laws--whether they are a U.S.-based business or are located outside the 
United States.

                 Prepared Statement of Hon. Ron Wyden, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Oregon
    Trade cheats in China and around the world are constantly looking 
for new ways to evade U.S. trade laws and rip off American jobs. They 
want to sell illegal products in America--goods made with forced labor, 
illegally harvested timber, and products that steal American IP. Trade 
cheats are a grave threat to the American workers, farmers, and 
businesses who play by the rules.

    The most egregious example of this trade cheating is the state-
sponsored forced labor that's rampant in China's Uyghur region. The 
Chinese Government has arbitrarily detained more than a million Uyghurs 
and other Muslim minorities. These detainees are thrown into 
``reeducation'' camps, where they're isolated from their families and 
forced to work under the worst conditions.

    The Chinese Communist Party's treatment of the Uyghur community is 
a moral abomination. It also threatens American jobs. The math is 
simple. By paying poverty wages and polluting as they please, Chinese 
companies have been able to flood U.S. markets with cheap goods and 
undercut all the competition. American workers are the best in the 
world--but no one can compete with slave labor.

    What's the effect here at home? Factories are shuttered, and 
American jobs are lost to China. We'll hear today from Andy Meserve, a 
USW local president whose aluminum factory was idled, in part due to 
forced labor abroad. The problem is, when domestic aluminum factories 
like Andy's shut down, China becomes the only game in town.

    So companies must commit to cleaning up forced labor in their 
supply chains. In December, I launched an investigation into 
allegations that the auto industry is still relying on supply chains 
tainted by forced labor. The allegation is that components of cars--
from steel to batteries to tires--have a high likelihood of being made 
with Uyghur forced labor.

    I asked eight major automakers about their supply chains, and how 
they're cleaning them up. This is a flagship American industry that 
employs more than 90,000 Americans and contributes over $700 billion 
annually to the U.S. economy. America can't allow those jobs to be 
ripped off and sent to an economy that strategically pays workers 
nothing.

    U.S. law already prohibits importing products made with forced 
labor. The challenge is identifying those products and stopping them. 
Customs agents are on the front lines of these efforts.

    Customs' job is twofold: first, they have to intercept shipments 
that violate U.S. law. Second, they have to keep legal goods moving 
efficiently through the ports.

    A lot has changed since 2016, when the Finance Committee passed our 
last package of trade enforcement tools. That legislation--the Trade 
Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act--produced real results. It gave 
Customs new tools to swiftly crack down on duty evasion that hurts 
American workers and businesses. It helped keep out counterfeits that 
threaten American innovation and public safety.

    Senator Brown and I worked to close an egregious loophole that was 
letting products made with forced labor come through our borders. 
Products made with forced labor cannot be allowed to enter the United 
States, period.

    Today Customs has a whole new set of challenges:

          COVID-19 changed the way people buy and sell goods. E-
        commerce has exploded, shipments have surged, and CBP is 
        processing millions more small packages per day.
          Fentanyl and other illicit drugs continue to enter through 
        our ports.
          Illegally fished seafood is entering the U.S. markets and 
        threatening the livelihoods of coastal communities.
          And counterfeits rip off American products, posing an 
        economic and health threat to American citizens. Intellectual 
        Property theft is estimated to cost the U.S. economy up to $600 
        billion each year, much of it from China.

    Foreign companies continue to find new ways to circumvent our trade 
laws. Keeping out the trade cheats has become a game of Whac-A-Mole.

    In my view, stepping up enforcement requires finding and stopping 
today's trade cheats, and crafting tools that are flexible enough to 
stop the next round of trade cheaters too. It's going to take better 
coordination with CBP across the U.S. Government, from the Department 
of Labor to the fisheries experts at Commerce.

    This year, the Finance Committee will be working with CBP and 
others on how Congress can improve our trade laws and give CBP the 
tools it needs to meet this moment. The hearing this morning is an 
important first step in that process. We'll hear from American 
businesses that need inputs and logistics professionals who work with 
Customs to keep supply chains moving. We'll also hear from folks who 
work to get forced labor out of supply chains, and an American worker 
personally impacted by this unfair competition.

    I also want to hear how Customs can maximize enforcement while 
streamlining imports from Trusted Traders with clean supply chains. 
This will help U.S. producers get the inputs they need; reduce 
bottlenecks, delays, and price increases for consumers; and help 
Customs focus their resources on enforcement to keep out illegal goods.

                    Statement of Michael G. Bindner

Chairman Wyden and the Ranking Member Crapo, thank you for the 
opportunity to submit these comments for the record to the Finance 
Committee, which repeat the same points made to the Committee on Ways 
and Means Subcommittee on Trade in July 2021. These repeat our comments 
from March of that year. I have removed pandemic related content and 
addressed the question of who should be stealing from whom in the 
technology sector.

I am less worried about China stealing our intellectual property. Their 
students have come here, gotten advanced degrees and largely returned 
home. This may plant the seeds of future revolution in China. It also 
means that in many areas of technology, particularly artificial 
intelligence, they are ahead of the game. Perhaps we need to steal more 
from them. Making it easier for Chinese students to stay would be a 
good first step.

A huge issue with China, as well as south Asia and the global south, is 
de facto slavery. Boycotting the products of slavery worked in fighting 
the Confederacy. The mass migration of slaves had more of an impact. A 
boycott of Xinjiang cotton and tomatoes is problematic during a 
pandemic, but generally it cannot succeed as a stand-alone action. Even 
though it may hurt in the short run, we should still do it.

To make a boycott work, we cannot do it alone. At minimum, Islamic 
nations must join in as well and start linking the cause of the Uygurs 
to the New Silk Road. The ethnic Turkmen range from modern Turkey to 
Xinjiang, so a little solidarity on their part could go a long way. If 
we do go this route, the whole effort to interfere in Iran must end. We 
cannot be with South Asian Muslims on some things and expect solidarity 
with them on others.

On the moral front, I am not sure we have room to talk. We hold 
migrants in stark conditions prior to deportation. If you doubt it, 
visit Lewisburg Federal Prison. Also stop in the Federal Prison 
Industries factory while you are there. Visit any food processing plant 
with large immigrant workforces (send people undercover) and see how 
many workers were trafficked and how local law enforcement reacts when 
they decide they want to leave. Examine the plight of sex workers in 
the United States and see how many of their pimps have arrangements 
with local police.

Our best weapon is our example. As long as slavery exists in the United 
States, our moral voice is compromised. Again, I am not saying to 
ignore this situation. I am saying to All In to really fight slavery. 
Also, call it slavery. On the same subject, examine the Chinese 
treatment of peasant workers at their factories. There is a two-level 
society, and American consumers benefit from this. Our commitment to 
abolishing slavery cannot live only in the fringes.

This is not to say that loopholes cannot be closed, although we must 
stop our own unfair trade practices as well. American food should not 
show up in countries just before harvest when doing so depresses the 
price of local agricultural products. Poverty begets slavery. Making 
others poor is an invitation to exploitation.

Poor farmers can either be individual or tenant farmers who are 
essentially peons. The drive for lower food prices for American 
consumers comes at a human cost. This is especially true when only one 
buyer dominates the market, as is sometimes the case for export to 
America (if not often).

Poor factory workers never have access to collective bargaining. This 
factor also drives down wages in American factories--often those with 
immigrant labor bearing the brunt of bad working conditions, poor wages 
and lax enforcement. The major difference is that being blacklisted in 
the United States for attempting to organize is rarely deadly, as it 
can sometimes be overseas.

Improved enforcement takes money and the willingness to accept higher 
food prices. More inspectors with more authority are needed at home and 
abroad. Government or third-party inspection is vital to make sure work 
is safe, fairly compensated and able to organize. We cannot expect 
worker protection in China or Guatemala if we do not insist on it in 
North Carolina and Alabama.

Existing supply chains must be reexamined and should not privilege big 
named brands over smaller importers and suppliers. Citing bad behavior 
must be cited. There is no better education than a ticket.

The long-term solution to labor inequality is employee ownership at all 
points in the supply chain. A multi-national employee owned firm would 
provide all workers an equal standard of living and ownership rights. I 
would hope this would start here. The one pebble that will move 
mountains is allowing market investors the same exception to capital 
gains taxes when shares are sold to a qualified broad-based ESOP (or 
COOP) that privately owned companies now receive. A bigger pebble is 
enacting an asset value-added tax with an internationally agreed upon 
rate with the same loophole. Sometimes loopholes can be a good thing.

Thank you for the opportunity to address the committee. We are, of 
course, available for direct testimony or to answer questions by 
members and staff.

On behalf of the E-Merchants Trade Council, Inc. (EMTC), I am Marianne 
Rowden, CEO of EMTC and respectfully submit this statement for the 
record. EMTC appreciates the opportunity to comment concerning the 
topics covered in the hearing on ``Ending Trade That Cheats American 
Workers By Modernizing Trade Laws and Enforcement, Fighting Forced 
Labor, Eliminating Counterfeits, and Leveling the Playing Field'' held 
on February 16, 2023.

EMTC was formed in July 2021 to represent the interests of the e-
commerce industry by creating a global community of micro, small and 
medium-size enterprise (MSMEs) e-sellers, marketplace platforms, and 
service providers to resolve trade, tax and transportation challenges. 
EMTC's advocacy mission is to support national and international 
policies that simplify cross-border transactions of physical and 
digital goods. EMTC facilitates dialogue among the E-Merchant worldwide 
community and global regulators.

EMTC applauds the Committee for holding this hearing on ``Ending Trade 
That Cheats American Workers By Modernizing Trade Laws and Enforcement, 
Fighting Forced Labor, Eliminating Counterfeits, and Leveling the 
Playing Field.'' We recommend that the Committee hold more hearings to 
receive testimony, comments and input from as many stakeholders as 
possible since the United States' trade policy affects every segment of 
American society. EMTC's comments expand three (3) areas discussed by 
the witnesses during the hearing.

1. Policy: E-commerce Is the 21st-Century Trading System

E-commerce is the trading system of the 21st Century--90% of shipments 
entering the U.S. are low-value shipments (685 million as de minimis in 
FY22) and a significant percentage of shipments exported from the U.S. 
comprise of e-commerce shipments.\1\ In 2021, the Digital Economy 
represented 10.3% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product and created 8 
million jobs. E-commerce activity generated $942 million representing 
25.4% of the 3.70 trillion Digital Economy Gross Output (2021).\2\ 
According to Digital Commerce 360, e-commerce sales in 2022 topped $1 
trillion for the first time, despite lower year-over-year growth, based 
on U.S. Department of Commerce figures.\3\

E-commerce is the trading system that has democratized global trade and 
enabled small businesses and entrepreneurs to participate in global 
market opportunities as both exporters and importers. Since e-commerce 
represents a growing sharing of the U.S. economy and global trade, U.S. 
trade laws should be modernized to facilitate and regulate e-commerce 
commensurate with the risk that such shipments pose to the revenue, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
security and safety of the United States.

      Systems-Based Governance as a New Form of Risk Management

Currently, the U.S. Customs statute is a ``transaction-based'' regime 
in which every Customs entry declaring the applicable tariff 
classification, value, origin, and quantity of the goods is treated as 
a separate and discrete transaction. This means that every entry is a 
declaration to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and serves as a 
basis for assessing a penalty under 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1592 if any 
information in the entry is incorrect. ``Transaction-based'' risk 
management is a problem for both CBP and the importer as a single error 
repeated over a large number of entries elevates non-compliance to 
systemic level (i.e., gross negligence) without the intent to routinely 
violate the Customs laws under the reasonable care standard adopted in 
the Customs Modernization Act.\4\ The scale of e-commerce entries 
number in the hundreds of millions and make ``transaction-based'' risk 
management impractical.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ The Customs Modernization Act was enacted as Title IV of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Pub. L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 
2057 (December 8, 1993).

When transactions-based audits became too time-consuming and unwieldy, 
CBP adopted an ``account-based'' approach to risk management by 
evaluating an importer's internal control policies to determine whether 
the company has procedures in place to exercise reasonable care. 
``Account-based'' risk management works well for large multinational 
corporations that import and export routinely, invest corporate 
resources in trade compliance programs, and join trusted trader 
(Authorized Economic Operator) programs. CBP has moved to ``account-
based'' management system for the largest traders (e.g., the top 1,000 
importers) through its Centers for Excellence and Expertise (CEEs) 
organized by industry, but the percentage of imports entered by the top 
1,000 importers has decreased from 70% to 58% while the number of 
Importers of Record has increased from over 300,000 to 442,897.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ See EMTC Interview with CBP Executive Assistant Commissioner 
AnnMarie Highsmith on December 14, 2022 at: https://vimeo.com/
791769636/748d1c0ff3.

The challenge that e-commerce presents to CBP is how to manage risk 
that is diffuse (i.e., a large number of foreign sellers with no risk 
profile outside its jurisdiction) posed by low-value shipments that are 
irregular in frequency and destination (i.e., to different consumers). 
All imports need to be validated through five (5) regulatory 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
checkpoints:

      Security: to ensure that the goods do not pose a threat to the 
U.S. (e.g., physical threat of a bomb in a package or economic threat 
through a pest infestation) at the port of export;
      Admissibility: to ensure that the goods meet regulatory 
requirements of other government agencies;
      Payment: transmission of duties to CBP or confirm duty-free 
entry of the goods;
      Liquidation: opportunity for reconciliation of any errors or 
updated entry data; and
      Finality: the point at which the entry becomes binding on both 
the importer and CBP so that the only recourse is litigation for non-
compliance or refund.

EMTC believes that e-commerce presents an opportunity to adopt a new 
type of risk management regime--``systems-based governance.'' See Risk 
Management chart in Attachment 1. E-commerce has two unique attributes: 
(1) major investments in computing power by marketplaces and compliance 
platforms; and (2) economies of scale over a large number of shipments. 
The reason why e-commerce has become such a success is because it 
flipped international trade on its head: instead of sellers figuring 
out if it is profitable to scour the globe for buyers of its goods 
taking into account logistics and regulatory costs, computer engineers 
built electronic marketplace platforms that are inherently global to 
enable buyers to find sellers of products they want and facilitating 
that sale to reduce ``friction'' to a minimum (e.g., one-click 
shopping).

Based on the computing power and economies of scale of the e-commerce 
industry, EMTC proposes a ``systems-based governance'' that deploys 
multiple layers of technology (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Machine 
Learning, blockchain) in a holistic system to reduce trade compliance 
risks. E-commerce companies (marketplace platforms, e-sellers) and 
their facilitators (trade compliance platforms, logistics companies, 
brokers, and agents) expend tremendous resources on evolving technology 
and regulatory costs which need to be integrated into the price of 
goods and services for small companies and consumers. EMTC has drafted 
a proposed a statutory change adding 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1484(a)(2)(D):

        (D) When an importer of record or an agent authorized to make 
        entry files information pursuant to an electronic data 
        interchange system using a risk-based methodology to assess the 
        admissibility, tariff classification, value and origin of 
        merchandise required under paragraph (a)(1), it shall not be 
        subject to penalty under section 1592. A risk-based methodology 
        shall mean an electronic system interpreting the Customs laws 
        and regulations by deploying methods such as natural language 
        processing, knowledge representation, image-based analysis, 
        algorithmic decision-making, and machine learning. The 
        Secretary shall accept a risk-based methodology adopted by an 
        importer of record or an agent provided it received a ruling 
        from U.S. Customs and Border Protection or an opinion letter 
        from a Customs expert that the methodology produces 
        consistently correct results.

2. Regulation: ``Global Trusted 2 Trade'' Program

At the regulatory level, CBP's risk management for e-commerce needs to 
conform to the business reality and velocity of the supply chain 
without favoring or disfavoring different business models and 
technologies. CBP needs data that is real-time, verifiable and 
auditable.

Nearly every small business has a role in the global supply chain. 
Whether traditional trade or e-commerce, a supply chain must deliver 
the right product to the right place at the right time for the right 
price. E-commerce by its nature requires significant reduction in the 
order to cash processing time. This can only be achieved through a 
supply chain account composed of certified products, processes and 
people that are granted a simple single release.

Efficient and effective trade can only be achieved by developing a new 
set of laws structured around the certification of people, process and 
products. New regulatory regimes must reflect systems-based governance 
by risk level of the end-to-end process through the use of Artificial 
Intelligence and Machine Learning to capture the right data, not an 
excessive quantity of data.

A ``Global Trusted 2 Trade'' (T2T) Program must recognize that the use 
of digital technology is woven into all aspects of twenty-first century 
trade, including traditional trade transactions. It acknowledges that 
all e-commerce is composed of three distinct, but related pillars--
people, product and process across all participants in the value chain 
that are either upstream or downstream of the cross-border transaction.

Each pillar must understand and work in concert with the other two to 
reduce risk and simplify exports and imports to enable sustained and 
continued growth of e-commerce.

Risk management of twenty-first century trade is more effective through 
the certification of product, process, and people. A ``Trusted 2 
Trade'' program must address the need for collaboration, education and 
certification of all members of the value chain to reduce risk through 
creation of a Trusted Trader-type management account at the supply 
chain level, rather than for each individual participant. Each supply 
chain has an identifiable trade ``passport'' covering its certified 
members and products. See Managing Risk Systems-Based Governance chart 
in Attachment 2.

      Process

In an international e-commerce supply chain, the right product must be 
verified with regard to its origin and its value at the earliest point 
in the supply chain when the best information is available. With high 
interest rates and limited storage space for most small businesses, 
inventories are kept low. The right place means that verified products 
are granted expedited clearances to meet demand for consumption or 
further processing. To attain the right and timely delivery, goods must 
be validated as they pass through the supply chain milestones beginning 
with the point of export production. Finally, goods must be available 
at the right price to meet market demands. The price factor encompasses 
not only the cost of production of the good but the additional supply 
costs to enable the delivery to the final market. This requires access 
to de minimis benefits for package-based trade into U.S. markets and 
increased de minimis privileges globally. The U.S. must set the example 
for this model and leverage its negotiation acumen to support the 
increase with our trading partners.

The e-commerce global supply chain contains more and diverse players. 
In traditional trade a multi-national had an office, factory or 
representative in the exporting country. U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection reported that there were 685.1 million de minimis (low-
value) shipments in FY22.\7\ Small businesses transactions are with 
unrelated parties who offer goods or materials needed for U.S. 
production of a finished product or a market offering. Through e-
commerce small and mid-sized businesses have access to expand their 
sales using platforms with a global market reach. However, the 
increased numbers of participants in any single supply chain also 
increases the complexity of the regulatory regime.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ See CBP Trade Statistics at: https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/
stats/trade.

E-commerce global trade is not well suited to a transaction-based 
system. Traditional transaction-based processing of such shipments will 
break the e-commerce supply chain both upstream and downstream of the 
point of importation as well as adding significant cost. The use of 
technology to manage the movement of goods through each milestone and 
develop a validated import or export will alleviate the impact on the 
supply chain. Milestones may include but are not limited to preparation 
for export, classification, origin and value. E-Merchants Trade Council 
recommends that a specific supply chain be certified for its people, 
process and product. A certified supply chain with the appropriate 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
credentials is eligible to use the simple release process.

      Product

The seller of the goods is in the best position to know or have access 
to the manufacturing details necessary to determine the first sale 
value, origin and classification of the product. The seller, however, 
may not have the trade expertise to apply such information to trade 
laws. In some cases, trade law in the seller's country may differ from 
U.S. law for determination of origin or classification. Artificial 
Intelligence must be applied to capture pertinent data points and 
verify products. Artificial intelligence can evaluate the data and 
determine the appropriate origin and classification by applying the 
U.S. law to the item in question. Accurate commercial data can be used 
to determine the regulatory status of a product. A verified product is 
one component of a certified supply chain for purposes of U.S. import 
or export.

      People

During the verification process for the product, the seller will also 
submit information about the actual manufacturer as well as his company 
if he is a distributor or re-seller of the goods. Through use of 
Artificial Intelligence, the veracity of the seller can be validated. 
Intermediaries in the supply chain such as freight forwarders, express 
carriers and marketplaces may already have an Authorized Economic 
Operator status. Such programs can be a foundation for an e-commerce 
``Trusted 2 Trade'' program that is supplemented by an E-commerce 
Framework of Standards. The sellers require basic training of the 
information elements necessary for the determination processes. Such 
sellers can take foundational courses in business language sufficient 
to certify their understanding of the data necessary to be provided for 
regulatory purposes.

3. Implementation: A New Approach ``Validate As You Go''

Customs modernization that addresses the exponential growth of e-
commerce requires a new set of regulatory requirements that 
accommodates the expanded ecosystem created by more and new 
participants in the process. This system must be separately codified to 
interweave the needs of business and all regulators into one seamless 
tome of agreed upon standards for admissibility as an import or an 
export.

      Global Single Window

Since other countries look to the U.S. for best practices, EMTC 
proposes that the U.S. work towards a single global window based upon a 
risk management system. It should set the standards for global cross-
border transactions using the certified supply chain account model. It 
must apply Artificial Intelligence capable of accumulating critical 
quality data as the good passes through multiple countries with 
simplified processing. Such data should be held by private industry 
certification agents and made available to regulators evaluating entry 
into any territory. In such a case, the verified supply chain is in 
fact a ``global entry passport'' for selling and re-selling goods with 
confidence of a high level of accuracy across the globe. This would 
create a single global window to trade rather than a single country-
centric release.

      Addressing Low-Value Goods Efficiently

Low-value goods, those defined as under US$800 should be processed with 
the lowest cost for the lowest risk imports or exports. Goods in these 
supply chains should be certified for both people and product groups at 
a six-digit level of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Classification 
using artificial intelligence can determine and validate the accuracy 
of the classification for regulatory purposes. De minimis should be 
available for such goods. A simplified process will deliver the right 
products to the right place at the right time for the right price. 
Benefits such as export information gleaned through our system-based 
governance should be offered to partners who meet or exceed the U.S. de 
minimis standard. Such data will enable our trading partners to also 
efficiently process the movement of package-based trade to their 
consumers.

      Duties, Fees and Penalties

As a part of the streamlining of processes, the certified supply chain 
should also be viewed as a single account payer. Duties, fees, taxes or 
other costs should be paid on an account basis and reconciled quarterly 
for any discrepancies discovered. Supply chains that are certified as 
low risk using system-based governance models should receive credit in 
the form of discounted penalties. A sliding scale model can be used for 
moderate risk supply chains to reward efforts to reduce risk. It would 
serve as an incentive to invest in verification of its people, products 
and processes. Multiple or egregious penalties could result in being 
moved to a higher risk level.

      Codify the Process

To ensure that the risk management process is available to all e-
commerce participants, the standards as described here must be codified 
into a new statute for all digital trade. Such standards must apply to 
sellers, marketplaces, forwarders and all types of transportation 
including international mail and express carriers.

    As shown in Attachment 3, digital trade represents 10% of GDP. The 
facilitation and management of this expanding and fast-paced sector 
must be addressed with a regulatory regime that is tailored to the 
needs of this trade community. Such a regime would interweave the 
appropriate requirements from various agencies to eliminate competing 
and different definitions of a single term. Standards must be commonly 
agreed upon for levels of risk. A cross-agency Center of Excellence 
dedicated to e-commerce should be developed to facilitate trade. The 
center agents should be trained in business vernacular to effectively 
communicate with industry members, particularly small businesses, and 
certified in e-commerce processes.

4. Conclusion

In summary, EMTC believes that the Committee should carefully consider 
creating a framework setting out the policy goals and enabling language 
to leverage technology and using new risk management techniques for 
processing e-commerce shipments while not creating regulatory burdens 
on MSME e-sellers.

EMTC appreciates the opportunity to comment on the testimony presented 
at the hearing, and we are happy to discuss the ideas expressed above 
in more detail.

The Honorable Ron Wyden
United States Senate

Washington, DC 20510

Dear Chairman Wyden:

SafePackage LLC would like to submit comments in response to the 
hearing ``Ending Trade That Cheats American Workers By Modernizing 
Trade Laws and Enforcement, Fighting Forced Labor, Eliminating 
Counterfeits, and Leveling the Playing Field'' held by the Finance 
Committee held on February 16, 2023. We strongly concur with the 
Chairman's remarks. We also would like to thank you for calling 
attention to these matters.

Counterfeits, products made with forced labor, and other violative 
goods continue to be available to U.S. consumers via e-commerce. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is under considerable pressure from 
many different entities as its mission of protecting the border cuts 
across many domains. CBP operates on a model based upon advanced 
information, applying intelligence-based or law enforcement-based 
targeting rules against this information, and identifying suspect 
shipments across the priority mission set (national security, 
narcotics, commercial trade violations). For the most part, CBP applies 
a traditional enforcement approach, acting to address those concerns at 
the border to prevent the introduction of violative goods into the 
commerce of the United States that may threaten the health and safety 
of the U.S. consumer. CBP's resources, including staff and funding, are 
inadequate to inspect, interdict, and administratively deal with the 
seizure of the flood of violative goods coming from China.

We do, however, wish to bring to your attention an alternative approach 
that is consistent with existing CBP practices, and does not require 
new legislation or funding. This approach relies on leveraging CBP's 
industry partnership program framework. It also incentivizes companies 
to perform greater ``reasonable care'' responsibilities prior to 
shipping in a cost effective and efficient manner. Companies could also 
agree to reject (prevent shipping) any packages found to be violative 
against publicly known information (i.e., the patent and trademark 
database and known Partner Government Agency requirements).

We have developed an innovative prescreening technology called 
SafePackage. When applied by parties in the supply chain, it could have 
dramatic results by preventing the shipping/importation of high-volume, 
low-value violative goods into the United States by stopping their 
shipment at the point of origin. This could significantly help CBP as 
these items of low value would not have to undergo the costly seizure/
forfeiture/disposition process, but yet they would be prevented from 
entering the commerce of the U.S.

We feel that preventing the shipment of illegal goods at the point of 
origin is the most cost-effective approach for the government. Imagine 
the impact an approach that requires stopping violative goods at the 
point of origin could have on combating the increasing flood of de 
minimis goods violating IPR, forced labor, health and safety laws. CBP 
is rightly focused on high value commercial violations, hard narcotics 
(fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, etc.), and other priority 
trade-related violations (forced labor, revenue loss, other government 
agency requirements).

As pressure mounts on CBP to do more in the e-commerce environment, the 
procedures designed for targeting and supply chain security in the 
traditional commercial environment may not pose the best answer. 
Foreign manufacturers and shippers are relatively small, unknown 
entities. They do not have the same auditable or documented business 
practices. They may also number in the millions and can easily change 
company identifiers.

Violations in e-commerce are easy for CBP to identify, but to take 
sustained action against the high volume of low-value (both in terms of 
cost and potential harm) shipments is not cost-effective. The 
traditional approach of the right data from the right party at the 
right time may support better targeting for priority and lesser 
frequent violations in e-commerce but does not address low-value/high-
frequency violations due to the cost-prohibitive nature of the seizure 
process.

CBP can address e-commerce challenges by leveraging industry 
partnerships to incentivize stakeholders to prescreen and reject 
violative packages prior to shipping. This is consistent with the 
approach in other CBP mission areas such as: CSI (Container Security 
Initiative), ACAS (Air Cargo Advance Screening), and in the immigration 
environment IAP (Immigration Advisory Program), RCLG (Regional Carrier 
Liaison Groups), and Preclearance.

Certain entities in the supply chain already have access to the 
platform/marketplace level data as part of their business 
transactions--namely pictures and item descriptions directly from the 
e-commerce websites. These entities, like logistics and shipping 
providers, can apply an algorithm such as SafePackage, identify 
violations, and stop a transaction before it gets shipped to the US. 
Data on rejected shipments can be shared with CBP.

SafePackage is a patented technology that uses AI and machine learning 
to prescreen products and automatically identify goods that would be 
prohibited from importation into the U.S. SafePackage has been used on 
a large scale in the Chinese e-commerce environment, which accounts for 
over 80% of all packages imported into the U.S.

SafePackage has proven to be more than 99% effective in preventing the 
shipment of goods by screening e-commerce merchandise for compliance 
with laws and regulations pertaining to USPS false labeling, IPR 
infringements, FDA, USDA, DOL (forced labor), FWS, CPSC, and more.

SafePackage believes that prescreening technology could be most 
effective when coupled with CBP's Customs Trade Partnership Against 
Terrorism (CTPAT) program, specifically a special program aimed at 
partnering with the industry engaged in e-commerce shipments. CBP's 
trusted trader program could develop a Minimum Security Criteria for 
participants that ship, import or otherwise play a role in the 
importation and entry of de minimis goods which would incorporate a 
validated prescreening criterion.

By requiring the use of prescreening technology for CTPAT e-commerce 
participants, CBP and U.S. consumers could see the following benefits:

      Reducing the volume of e-commerce shipments CBP would need to 
inspect and allow CBP to focus on higher priorities;
      Reducing the volume and costs associated with the seizure, 
forfeiture, and destruction of violative goods (since any violative 
goods would be stopped at the point of origin);
      The foundation for a partnership role by the trade community in 
preventing the entry of e-commerce goods in violation of U.S. laws;
      An expanded trade partnership in line with past Customs efforts 
dating back almost 40 years to improve security and compliance with 
U.S. laws (e.g., CIP, Land Border CIP, etc.);
      Support for a proof of concept vision beyond the border itself; 
and
      A viable response to Congress and other critics regarding CBP's 
enforcement efforts.

To this end, SafePackage has conducted two technology demonstrations 
for CBP on the effectiveness of applying the SafePackage algorithm to 
shipments prior to foreign departure and rejecting violative 
merchandise. The two examples are a demonstration at the land border at 
Otay Mesa, and a demonstration on air cargo shipments at Los Angeles 
Airport.

The Otay Mesa land border demonstration consisted of running the 
SafePackage algorithm against shipments prior to departing Mexico. A 
third party logistics company consolidates, and ships Chinese made 
goods to U.S. consumers from Mexico. A total of 106,510 packages have 
been run through SafePackage since May 16, 2022, and 3 violations have 
been identified. This provides a way to identify a compliant shipment 
of assorted, de minimus packages on a single truck crossing the border 
and complement CBP's risk management approach to inspections.

The Los Angeles air cargo demonstration consisted of running the 
SafePackage algorithm against shipments prior to departing China. The 
freight forwarding and logistics companies consolidate Chinese made 
goods sold to U.S. consumers from several Chinese based e-commerce 
platforms/websites. A total of 932 packages (1,014 distinct products) 
were screened by SafePackage, and 142 violations were identified and 
rejected.

In sum, SafePackage is recommending that the Finance Committee take 
into consideration the greater role that evolving technology can play 
in preventing the introduction of products in violation of U.S. laws by 
prescreening products and stopping their transport at the point of 
origin. We would be happy to provide additional information or address 
any questions you may have.

Respectfully,

John Farley

Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Committee,

As experts in the international trade of aquatic wildlife and seafood, 
we strongly support the goals of the Finance Hearing ``Ending Trade 
That Cheats American Workers By Modernizing Trade Laws and Enforcement, 
Fighting Forced Labor, Eliminating Counterfeits, and Leveling the 
Playing Field.'' We believe that collecting accurate trade data is 
essential to achieving these goals.

The trade in live animals is extremely biodiverse, encompassing 
thousands of species. Some of these species can be poisonous to humans, 
such as lionfish imported from Indonesia. Some can carry diseases such 
as salamanders or frogs. Some are extremely high value species being 
intentionally hidden as other products to avoid taxes, while some are 
so rare and endangered that they are listed by the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
(CITES), but the traders list them as common species. In our analysis 
of the trade in aquatic wildlife,\1\ we have observed all of these 
cases. We have also created an automated system that can collect all 
relevant information from an invoice, compare that to a declaration to 
ensure it is all properly accounted for and assigned the correct 
harmonized code, and provide Customs inspectors with a report on any 
detected anomalies within the shipment. All this automated processing 
can be done in a minute or two and not impinge upon the speed of the 
trade.

2017. Expanding our understanding of the trade in marine aquarium 
animals. PeerJ, 5, p.e2949.

In the comments during the hearing by Cindy Allen, Vice President, 
Regulatory Affairs and Compliance, FedEx Logistics, we agree with her 
that there should be a ``favored trader status.'' A risk assessment can 
assign a low risk to those companies that present correct declarations 
and associated paperwork, and ensure their products are the first 
priority for release. This will be a benefit to those who do not try to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
hide illegal or counterfeit goods in their shipments.

However, it is also for these reasons that we disagree with her 
statement about harmonized codes that there should be a ``limited 
number of classifications instead of the 10,000+ tariff lines.'' 
Instead, we argue the opposite. We should be automatically collecting 
detailed information from each invoice, and ensuring that it matches 
the information presented on the declaration. The volume of goods, and 
the extent to which they are packaged presents an arena that is ripe 
for goods to be smuggled, or exchanged in avoidance of taxes. The push 
to have only a ``limited number'' of tariff lines will greatly impede 
the goals of this committee, to ``End Trade That Cheats American 
Workers, Fights Forced Labor, Eliminates Counterfeits,'' and it most 
certainly will not ``Level the Playing Field.'' Instead, fewer tariff 
codes will increase the opportunity for each one of these nefarious 
acts to increase, and will uneven the playing field where Americans as 
a whole will be on the losing side.

In our work to automate trade streams, we have current tests occurring 
in Canada \2\ where we see tax and health evasion by misnaming seafood, 
regulatory malfeasance by not declaring CITES species, and a 
significant lack of correct data being entered through their one stop 
window system.

There are data tools that have been developed to address these trade 
data issues. Our system was the Grand Prize winner of the USAID 
sponsored Wildlife Crime Tech Challenge.\3\ There are other solutions 
emanating from the study of the wildlife trade, including X-Ray 
technology \4\ and DNA analysis that can be quickly expanded for 
broader trade categories. Our system was designed for aquatic wildlife, 
but being an automated optical character recognition-based system, can 
quickly be trained to detect invoices containing any wildlife products, 
including but not limited to timber and wood, and leather goods, to 
other non perishable goods such as hardware, computer parts, and other 
commonly traded commercial goods.

There are a multitude of excellent and advanced solutions that can 
rapidly be implemented. We cannot continue a business as usual scenario 
and continue to turn a blind eye to the identity of goods being 
imported into our country. We need to have a full and accurate 
accounting of everything that crosses our borders. This will not hinder 
our ability to do business, rather it will protect our companies and

the environment, and make business stronger and more competitive.

We are happy to discuss our work with the committee or staff.

I'm Jeffrey Hardy, Director-General of the Transnational Alliance to 
Combat Illicit Trade (TRACIT), and I respectfully submit this written 
statement for your hearing record.

I commend you, Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo, and the Senate 
Finance Committee for holding today's hearing focused on ``Ending Trade 
That Cheats American Workers By Modernizing Trade Laws and Enforcement, 
Fighting Forced Labor, Eliminating Counterfeits, and Leveling the 
Playing Field.'' Many of you have been staunch advocates for 
strengthening protections against counterfeits and the illicit economy.

TRACIT is a United States-based, independent, private-sector initiative 
to drive change to mitigate the economic and social damages of illicit 
trade by strengthening government enforcement mechanisms and mobilizing 
businesses across industry sectors most impacted by illicit trade. Our 
members are multinational companies.

The Problem:

Illicit trade is a major and growing policy challenge in the United 
States (U.S.) and across the world. From smuggling, counterfeiting and 
tax evasion, to the illegal sale or possession of goods, services, and 
wildlife, governments are losing billions in tax revenues, legitimate 
businesses are undermined, and consumers are exposed to poorly made and 
unregulated products. These crimes also are tied to human rights and 
labor rights violations, money laundering, illicit financial and arms 
flow, child labor, and environmental degradation.

Given that illicit trade is estimated to account for 5-8% of total 
international trade, its utilization of cargo containers, parcel 
packages, ship and airline capacity, and port capacity clogs the 
world's trade infrastructure. According to the United Nations 
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), there already are not 
enough ports worldwide nor enough labor to process the goods being 
traded across borders, and poor infrastructure creates congestion at 
ports. Delays in shipping causes supply chain disruptions and increased 
costs for all involved.

With estimates of various illicit activities running upward of $3 
trillion, these figures rival the GDP of some G20 countries. These 
costs multiply exponentially when accounting for drains on tax revenue, 
the use of forced labor, obstruction of sustainable development, 
organized crime, terrorism and the plundering of natural resources. 
Moreover, trade in counterfeit and illicit goods has an extensive 
destabilizing impact on American and global security due to its central 
role in facilitating transnational organized crime and illegal flows of 
money, people and products across borders. It undermines the formal 
authority of rule of law, which can disrupt business and discourage 
investment.

More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has escalated an unremitting 
illicit economy to expand and take root, spawning new markets for 
illicit trade, like falsified vaccines, pharmaceuticals and medical 
devices, and deepened age-old illicit trade in alcoholic beverages, 
tobacco and counterfeits.

The pandemic drove Americans online to purchase products that could be 
delivered directly to their homes. This facilitated the growth of the 
sale of counterfeit and illicit goods primarily because nefarious 
third-party sellers exploit e-commerce platforms, which heretofore do 
not sufficiently vet their sellers, quickly take down known 
counterfeits nor ban bad sellers, exposing consumers to unregulated 
products. What types of products are we talking about? We have a 
saying, ``If you make it, they can fake it.'' This means products 
across every industry, including counterfeit automobile parts like 
brakes, seatbelts, air bags, tires; appliances and parts such as water 
filters for refrigerators; toys and other children's products; beauty 
and personal care products; human and pet food; beverages; pesticides; 
jewelry and apparel; cleaning products and on and on. Attached to my 
statement is a comprehensive list.

Additionally, fraudulent advertising on social media platforms, e.g., 
Facebook Marketplace and Instagram, is a devious form of online fraud 
intended to route social media users to rogue websites set up for the 
sole purpose to sell counterfeits, cultivate bait and switch scams, 
steal personal financial information or otherwise put at risk the 
Internet's growing population of social media users. These may be 
American-based platforms, but they serve over 1.4 billion users 
worldwide, equivalent to over three times the entire population of the 
U.S.

In an effort to warn consumers, educate policymakers and encourage 
online platforms to improve system weaknesses, TRACIT and the American 
Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA) published in July 2020 the 
first public report documenting the emergence of fraudulent advertising 
on popular online social networking platforms: Fraudulent Advertising 
Online--Emerging Risks and Consumer Fraud (TRACIT Report: Fraudulent 
Advertising Online--Emerging Risks and Consumer Fraud--Transnational 
Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade, https://www.tracit.org/featured-
report-fraudulent-advertising-online.html).

The 2020 Fraudulent Ad Report showed that fraudulent advertisements on 
Instagram and Facebook targeted more than 70 major international 
brands, some of which received up to a quarter of a million views 
before they were detected. The lack of adequate policies and procedures 
to verify an advertiser/user's true identity and to conduct the 
necessary vetting and due diligence during the onboarding process is a 
system weakness across multiple Internet-based platforms for social 
networking. This enables infiltration of social media accounts by 
fraudulent advertisers and exploitation of social media users. There is 
also little protection from repeat offenders.

What Congress Can Do

Congress should move quickly to solve this exponentially growing 
problem, with far-reaching negative impacts on American security, 
innovation, economic growth and consumer safety. Below are some 
specific actions:

Enhance Consumer Protection Laws

TRACIT joined many companies encouraging Congressional passage of 
legislation to establish better, more uniform rules for secure and safe 
conduct of e-commerce in the U.S., including legislation intending to 
hold online marketplaces and social media platforms accountable for 
keeping bad actors and fraudulent products off their marketplaces. It 
is past time for depending on voluntary efforts by the e-
commerce platforms to remedy the situation, especially when their 
bottom lines benefit from passive enforcement and looking the other way 
as criminals easily manipulate the limited security measures currently 
in place.

We worked with the last Congress to achieve passage of the Integrity, 
Notification and Fairness in Online Retail Marketplaces for Consumers 
Act (INFORM Consumers Act), which is the first step in improving 
consumer protections by requiring e-commerce platforms to conduct more 
due diligence in vetting sellers and requiring sellers to disclose more 
information to platforms and consumers. In December 2022, President 
Biden signed the new law which requires third-party sellers to provide 
government issued IDs and disclose to consumers from where the product 
is being shipped along with a contact link for customers. The INFORM 
Act will help law enforcement, manufacturers, retailers and online 
marketplaces of all sizes work together to protect consumers from bad 
actors selling counterfeit and stolen goods.

But this first step is far from the necessary controls needed to 
mitigate fraud and consumer risk associated with online shopping. 
TRACIT urges Congress to reintroduce and pass the bipartisan bill, The 
Stopping Online Harmful Offers on Platforms by Screening Against Fakes 
(SHOP Safe Act), to enhance consumer protection for e-commerce 
purchases. This law introduces the well-established principle of 
liability, specifically holding e-commerce and social media platforms 
responsible and liable for selling counterfeit and illicit products 
that harm consumers. Only once they have demonstrated responsible due 
diligence, by adhering to a set of prescribed best practices, including 
increased third-party seller vetting and disclosure, expeditious notice 
and take down of counterfeit products, and barring bad actors from 
their platforms, would they be unencumbered from such liabilities.

Modernize Customs Laws

Congress should modernize the law governing U.S. Customs, which was 
established 30 years ago, aiming to create a better balance between 
streamlining the flow of trade with the ever-more critical need to 
better protect U.S. consumers from the flood of counterfeit and illicit 
goods entering the Customs process. We applaud Senator Cassidy's 
leadership in working with government and the private sector to develop 
a draft bill to enhance protections, facilitate trade, increase 
information sharing and engagement with the private sector, and 
strengthen enforcement and penalties. In 2021, the U.S. Customs and 
Border Patrol (CBP) established The 21st Century Customs Modernization 
Framework Task Force consisting of government and private sector 
stakeholders to facilitate discussion and provide recommendations to 
modernize the legal and operational framework for trade. TRACIT has 
actively participated and contributed to this initiative. We believe a 
strong legal framework embedded in legislation will go a long way to 
preventing illicit and counterfeit goods from crossing into the U.S.

TRACIT strongly recommends the establishment of a mechanism to create 
an e-
merchant ID that would be required for sellers wishing to sell into the 
U.S. via e-commerce platforms. The integrity of such a system could be 
maintained through a program similar to the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration's (FDA) Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP), 
established by the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). Such a 
system would enable e-commerce platforms, brands, law enforcement 
agencies and consumers to block bad actors that are not registered. 
This could be similar to a TSA pre-check for sellers of goods. 
Registered importers would be able to step into the green lane for 
Trusted Traders.

It is also time to revisit the level of de minimis exceptions in Sect. 
321 of the Tariff Act for low-value shipments. The current $800 level 
is already outdated and ineffective in addressing the rapid, recent 
increase in e-commerce sales directly to consumers via small parcels 
traveling through the U.S. Postal Service and express carriers. The 
average value of goods shipped is $100 and very few are valued above 
$200.

Focus on Stopping the Use of Forced Labor

TRACIT commends the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) for its 
recognition in its Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy 
Reviews for 2021 and 2022 of the serious dangers to workers who are 
exploited and forced to create, manufacture and distribute counterfeit 
and illicit products. As noted in the USTR's 2021 Report, TRACIT 
conducted a study and produced a report in December 2021: The Human 
Cost of Illicit Trade: Exposing Demand for Forced Labor in the Dark 
Corners of the Economy (Featured Report: The Human Cost of Illicit 
Trade: Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade (https://
www.tracit.org/featured-report-fraudulent-advertising-online.html)). 
TRACIT outlined how criminal organizations utilize forced labor to 
manufacture and distribute counterfeit and illicit products outside the 
purview of labor regulations and government oversight.

The 2021 USTR Report devotes six pages to this human rights crisis and 
calls for more investigation and data on the adverse impact of the use 
of forced labor and child labor in the global production of 
counterfeits. Fully ending these human rights abuses will only be 
possible by eradicating counterfeiting and other forms of illicit 
trade.

Since data is limited, and governments have not yet been successful in 
closing this gap, additional data collected in the field is needed to 
improve the understanding of how illicit supply networks operate, and 
how they recruit, use and abuse their labor force. We endorse the 
USTR's view that governments must actively gather more and better data 
on the incidence of forced labor in illicit operations to improve the 
evidence base for national and international policy-making and standard 
setting. Governments must also strengthen investigative techniques to 
address human rights abuses in illicit trade and dismantle the 
organized criminal networks behind illicit trade.

TRACIT is prepared to collaborate on advanced data collection and is 
willing to contribute information already collected from private 
intelligence and investigations, raids, seizures and other measures 
along illicit supply chains.

Enhance Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) and Other International Agreements

The U.S. Government should continue to work with its trading partners 
to enhance worker protection provisions to explicitly guard against the 
use of exploited labor in the manufacture and distribution of goods and 
services across borders.

The U.S. also should strengthen its leadership in multilateral 
organizations and work collaboratively to create a stronger global 
structure to combat the manufacture and sale of illicit and counterfeit 
goods. The U.S. should work to prioritize illicit trade work programs 
in existing multilateral organizations, e.g., World Customs 
Organization (WCO), World Trade Organization (WTO), the United Nations 
(UN), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD).

TRACIT is working globally to urge governments--including the U.S.--to 
establish a ``whole of government'' approach, appointing officials from 
throughout each government including from Finance, Commerce, Homeland 
Security, Labor, Trade, Customs, and Postal systems to establish an 
action plan for detecting and blocking illicit goods, filling 
governance and regulatory gaps, and training law enforcement and 
Customs officers. We urge countries to establish a reporting mechanism 
for consumers and businesses to alert law enforcement to suspected 
illicit trade. Working with the private sector, governments should 
raise consumer awareness to the dangers of counterfeit and illicit 
trade.

Conclusion

TRACIT stands ready to work with Congress to better protect consumers, 
workers, businesses, the U.S. economy and national security by stopping 
the flow of counterfeit and illicit products into our country. We thank 
the Senate Finance Committee for its leadership on this critical 
imperative.

        COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS WITH HEALTH PAND SAFETY IMPLICATIONS
                    You make it and they can fake it
   All counterfeits present an absolute product safety risk. They are
manufactured outside legal frameworks, are unregulated and do not comply
   with safety standards that are prescribed either internationally or
 locally within a country. If a counterfeit product is ingested, applied
 to the body or used as a safety device, the risks become even greater.
 But the list of products presenting exposure to health and safety risks
           is endless, starting with the products listed here:
