                                      United States Senate,
                                    Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in Room 
226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. Durbin, 
Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Durbin [presiding], Whitehouse, 
Blumenthal, Hirono, Booker, Padilla, Ossoff, Welch, Graham, 
Grassley, Cornyn, Lee, Cruz, Cotton, Kennedy, Tillis, and 
Blackburn.
    Also present: Senators Wyden, Merkley, Schatz, and 
Menendez.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Chair Durbin. This hearing of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee will come to order. I'd like to take a moment to 
first acknowledge that this is our first full Committee hearing 
since the passing of our friend and colleague, Senator Dianne 
Feinstein, a treasured leader of the Senate and this Committee. 
It is a bit unreal to begin these proceedings and to know that 
our dear friend will not be joining us at the dais.
    Dianne conducted herself with steely determination, grace, 
and dignity in all of her work before this body. And I hope we 
will all try to honor her by measuring up to that high 
standard. I want Members to know we're working on a plan to 
honor her personally for her service on the Committee, and 
we'll talk about that a little later.
    Today, we'll hear from five judicial nominees: Judge 
Mustafa Kasubhai--did I come close to pronouncing that 
correctly?
    Judge Kasubhai. Yes.
    Chair Durbin. Good. Nominated to the District of Oregon; 
Judge John Kazen, nominated to the Southern District of Texas; 
Judge Shanlyn Park, nominated to the District of Hawaii; Jamel 
Semper, nominated to the District of New Jersey; and Micah 
Smith, also nominated to the District of Hawaii. 
Congratulations to each nominee, and your family and friends 
who gathered.
    Before I turn to Ranking Member Graham, I want to note that 
each of today's nominees has received blue slips from both home 
State Senators. This includes Judge Kazen, who has received 
blue slips from Senators Cornyn and Cruz.
    Both Senators previously worked with the White House on the 
nomination of Judge Irma Ramirez to the Fifth Circuit. And I 
thank them and the White House for continuing to work in good 
faith to fill judicial vacancies on Texas district courts. I 
look forward to similar progress in other States.
    We have several colleagues joining us to introduce nominees 
today, and first, I'll turn to Senator Graham for any opening 
remarks.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM,
        A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think all of us 
on this side have the same view of Senator Feinstein as you do. 
She was a consequential Senator, an incredibly kind, decent 
person who was passionate about her causes. But you could 
always find common ground if you sought it with Dianne, and she 
will certainly be missed.
    If you're looking for a role model, as a young person, on 
how to conduct yourself, I would recommend Senator Feinstein. 
The life she lived would be a good one to try to replicate.
    So a couple things. Last month was the largest illegal 
crossings, I think, ever--border is in absolute chaos. Ukraine, 
since the war started that was supposed to last 2 weeks, has 
destroyed 50 percent of the Russian combat capability. We spent 
less than 5 percent of our military budget in helping Ukraine, 
and NATO was larger.
    So if you'd told me in the 1980s not one American soldier 
would have to die to reduce the combat capability of the 
Russian military, and you could do that for 5 percent of our 
military budget, nobody would've believed you. Ukraine has 
taken back 50 percent of the territory lost in the initial 
invasion, and back from 2014 even. What more do you expect 
these people to do? They're fighting like tigers. They have 
died by the thousands. It is in our interest.
    To those on the Democratic side, we have to come up with a 
border security plan that will stop the flow: 8,000 to 10,000 
people a day with no end in sight is unsustainable. The asylum 
system is broken. The First Safe Country Rule has been ignored. 
Parole has been abused. I will challenge my Democratic 
colleagues to work with us to find a strong border plan to stop 
what is going on at the border.
    To my Republican colleagues, I don't know how the drama in 
the House ends. But I want us to be the party that recognizes: 
You do not solve your national debt problems by reducing the 
power of your military in dangerous times. It's never cheaper 
to let people take land of others by force of arms because they 
won't stop.
    So if you're worried about adding to the debt, let's make 
sure we don't have a major war between NATO and Russia, and 
that China is not enticed to invade Taiwan.
    Being strong is cheaper than being weak. And if you really 
want to do something about the debt, which we all do, most of 
the money is not in the discretionary accounts. So with that 
Mr. Chairman, ready for the hearing.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Graham. Let me just say 
that I couldn't agree with you more on your statements on 
Ukraine. I was saddened, angered, maybe even embarrassed, that 
we did not include money for Ukraine in the recent Continuing 
Resolution.
    The war goes on. The Ukrainians are sacrificing their 
lives. As the president of Ukraine, Zelensky, told us when he 
met with us just a few weeks ago, we give our lives, we ask you 
to give your money. That's not too high a price to pay to 
defend freedom and democracy in this important part of the 
world. I stand ready and hope that we do this quickly.
    On the issue of the border, I have said it publicly before 
and we are struggling to find a starting date, but I hope it's 
soon, when we do sit down on a bipartisan basis and start 
talking about the border.
    Congress has to accept its legislative responsibility. We 
cannot just point fingers at the White House. We are the ones 
who are commissioned to write the laws and to make the policy 
that the White House should follow. And we have a lot more to 
do.
    We haven't had a significant immigration bill for over 30 
years. We need one and need it now. And I'm ready to join you 
on a bipartisan basis to make that happen.
    We have introductions for our nominees and many of our 
colleagues are here for the purpose. And first up is Senator 
Ron Wyden of Oregon to introduce Judge Kasu----
    Senator Wyden. Kasubhai.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, I appreciate that.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN,
            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OREGON

    Senator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Chairman, 
thank you very much for your courtesy, and all your help with 
our nominee.
    And to colleagues, just one sentence about Senator 
Feinstein. Last night I was looking at pictures. And at an 
event that she organized, there was our former Republican 
Leader here, Senator Cornyn, Trent Lott, standing with Henry 
Waxman, the California liberal. And I said to myself, that was 
part of the beauty of Dianne Feinstein, always bringing people 
together. Remarkable.
    So, Senator Merkley and I are very pleased to be able to 
join all of you to introduce Judge Mustafa Kasubhai, nominee 
for the District Court for the District of Oregon. His 
credentials are so long, I would keep you till breakfast if I 
went through. And I would ask Mr. Chairman, if we could make my 
remarks part of the record, and I'll just make a couple of 
comments.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Senator Wyden. The judge is eminently qualified for this 
position. You've got those qualifications. He was a district 
court magistrate. So in effect, he was the first Muslim-
American judge to be appointed to the Federal bench. And he's 
been in private practice.
    And I think for my first point, because a number of you 
have raised it, Senator Merkley and I hold Town Hall Meetings 
in all of our rural counties. I have some this weekend. The 
judge has extraordinary rural credentials because before he 
served as a magistrate judge, he practiced law in Klamath 
Falls.
    Now, if you're not familiar with Klamath Falls--I've got a 
Town Meeting there in a few days--it's very rural, agriculture, 
natural resources. And it's a place that's recruiting doctors, 
and lawyers, and the like.
    But to give you an idea of these kind of rural connections, 
the judge owns a portable sawmill that he uses to mill logs 
into beautiful finished wood products. So if you ever are 
looking for a way, Senator Whitehouse, to have some wonderful 
floors in your home----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Wyden [continuing]. Don't call Ghostbusters, call 
our nominee because he can do it for you.
    So he is the first South Asian-American to serve on our 
local courts at home when he was appointed as magistrate judge. 
As I said, he was first Muslim American in his 16 years on the 
bench. He won awards for judicial excellence from the Oregon 
Bar, the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, and 
they're a testament to his work ethic and his expertise. The 
unanimous judgment of the American Bar Association was to rate 
him as ``well qualified.''
    And one of the other areas that Senator Merkley and I 
appreciate about the judge is, he's always mentoring students 
in order to create hope and opportunity for the next generation 
of legal professionals.
    Mr. Chairman, I've entered, with your staff, the letters of 
support from across the political spectrum, across Oregon, 
across this country, people who have worked with him.
    I urge all Members of this Committee to support Judge 
Mustafa Kasubhai, and will be happy, as Oregon's United States 
Senators, to work with all of you for those who want additional 
information. But I know some of you asked questions about the 
judge's connection to rural communities, and his are stellar.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Wyden. Senator Merkley.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF MERKLEY,
            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OREGON

    Senator Merkley. Well, I am honored and pleased to add my 
voice to that of my colleague, Senator Wyden, in support of 
this nomination.
    Mustafa Kasubhai's leadership in the law has been evident 
since he first came to our State over 30 years ago as a young 
man to attend the University of Oregon School of Law. And he 
served as president of the Student Bar Association.
    Soon after, he began his career in private practice, 
representing clients throughout Southern and Eastern Oregon 
while working out of offices in Eugene and Klamath Falls. It 
gave him a personal understanding of the challenges facing 
working folks, folks living in rural areas, which can look very 
different in our State, as in so many States, from the 
viewpoints in larger cities.
    His service continued as a member of the Oregon Workers' 
Compensation Board. He was appointed to the Lane County Circuit 
Court in 2007, where he served for a decade. And that was when 
the Board of Judges, which is composed of the active and senior 
Federal court judges for the District of Oregon, elected Judge 
Kasubhai to serve alongside them as a U.S. magistrate judge. He 
served in that position ever since, and in September, President 
Biden nominated him to join their ranks on the U.S. District 
Court for Oregon.
    I appreciate his quote when he said, ``I have always 
imagined that democracy is solar powered. It works when a light 
shines on all of its functions. That light is the rule of 
law.''
    And earlier this week, he visited the National Archives, 
too, and his words pay tribute to the Constitution. So it's 
with admiration and with pride that I commend his nomination to 
all of you sitting here on the Judiciary Committee.
    Thank you for taking into account his sterling credentials, 
his breadth of service at all levels, and the respect and 
admiration of his peers and his students all across our State. 
He's an outspoken champion for justice, a fierce believer in 
democracy, and a passionate advocate for the rule of law.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Ranking Member, and Members of 
the Committee.
    Chair Durbin. Up next is Senator Cornyn to introduce Judge 
Kazen.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN CORNYN,
             A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS

    Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, for allowing me 
to introduce John Kazen, who's been nominated for a vacancy in 
the Laredo Division of the Southern District of Texas.
    Since 2018, he's served as U.S. magistrate judge on the 
district court. He's handled over 85 civil consent cases that 
have gone to final judgment. As Members of the Committee know, 
magistrates ordinarily do not handle the full docket that a 
Federal judge does. But in cases where the parties consent, 
then they can. So he's handled 85 civil consent cases that have 
gone to final judgment as well as almost 2,000 misdemeanor 
cases.
    And it's unusual, at least in my observation, that 
magistrates or their--that parties consent to magistrates to 
try jury trials. But he's had seven civil trials and one 
misdemeanor criminal trial, which is a remarkably high number 
for a magistrate judge, particularly since he's only served 
since 2018.
    Judge Kazen has gotten high praise from the Laredo legal 
community and from the other district judges in Laredo. Judges 
Marmolejo and Saldana rave about his work. A good benchmark of 
this is that Judge Kazen has an overwhelmingly high number of 
consent cases, as I mentioned. That represents, I believe, a 
great vote of confidence in his integrity, his temperament, and 
his legal abilities.
    Prior to his current role, Judge Kazen spent the majority 
of his career in private practice working at a firm he founded 
in 1997.
    It's significant that Judge Kazen has been nominated to 
this position because his father, George Kazen, a revered icon, 
really, in the legal community in Laredo in South Texas, served 
on the Federal bench for 39 years. So I know, Judge, your 
father passed away in 2021, and I'm sad, as I know you are, he 
couldn't be here today to share in this remarkable 
accomplishment of yours. But it's clear that his legacy lives 
on.
    Senator Cruz and I--Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate the kind 
comments you made about our good faith cooperation with the 
nomination process--Senator Cruz and I, as you know, have a 
Federal Judicial Evaluation Committee. It's a bipartisan 
committee of some of the best lawyers in the State of Texas. We 
call it the FJEC, for short, the Federal Judicial Evaluation 
Committee.
    It's an institution that I'm very proud of because we make 
sure, regardless of who's in the White House, that we have 
properly vetted candidates we can recommend to the White House. 
And we appreciate the fact that the White House has been 
receptive to our willingness to work in good faith. Senator 
Cruz, I know, feels the same way.
    And Judge Kazen received the highest marks of any of the 
people interviewed for this position. So I have a great deal of 
confidence that he, Judge Kazen, will faithfully uphold the 
rule of law and the Constitution of the United States. And I 
look forward to supporting his nomination, and I would urge all 
of my colleagues to do the same. Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Cornyn. We have two 
nominees from the State of Hawaii, and I will recognize the 
senior Senator Brian Schatz, first, to introduce Judge Park and 
Mr. Smith.

                STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ,
            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF HAWAII

    Senator Schatz. Thank you very much, Chairman Durbin, 
Ranking Member Graham, Members of the Committee.
    I'm proud to support the nominations of Micah Smith and 
Judge Shanlyn Park to serve as judges on the U.S. District 
Court in Hawaii. Both of them are exceptionally qualified and I 
appreciate the opportunity to help to introduce them to the 
Committee.
    Micah Smith's story is a quintessentially American one. The 
son of an immigrant, he grew up in a housing project on Kauai, 
attending public schools before going to Lock Haven University, 
where he graduated with top honors, and later to Harvard Law 
School.
    For the past 11 years, he has served as a Federal 
prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office, first in the 
renowned Southern District of New York, and, more recently, in 
the District of Hawaii, where he serves as deputy chief of the 
Criminal Division.
    Those who know him often highlight his abiding sense of 
fairness and balanced temperament. A colleague noted, quote, 
``He listens and considers carefully before voicing his 
opinion,'' adding that he has an unwavering commitment to 
achieve a better system of justice that provides access to 
justice for all.
    That same commitment to equal justice underpin Judge 
Shanlyn Park's two decades as a public defender, giving voice 
to those most in need. A graduate of the University of Hawaii's 
Richardson School of Law, she represented low income defendants 
on a variety of complex cases, earning a reputation, among 
colleagues and opposing counsel alike, as a highly skilled, 
compassionate, and solutions-oriented attorney.
    And she brought her integrity and sound judgment to the 
bench, since becoming a State court judge in 2021. In 
supporting her nomination, a former boss remarked, quote, ``The 
law is more than a job for Shanlyn,'' calling her, ``a great 
ambassador for the law.''
    Judge Park's credentials are impressive by any measure, but 
the historic nature of her nomination should not be lost on 
anyone. If confirmed, she would be the first Native Hawaiian 
woman to serve on the Federal bench.
    Both nominees have the legal acumen, as well as the 
character and temperament, required to fulfill the duties of 
the United States district court judge. It's for these reasons 
that I'm proud to work with a Member of the Judiciary Committee 
and my partner in the Senate, Senator Hirono, in supporting 
their nominations to the Federal bench. Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Schatz. Senator Hirono.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MAZIE K. HIRONO,
            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF HAWAII

    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm glad to join 
my colleague Brian Schatz in supporting the two nominees from 
Hawaii. So thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Graham, 
for holding this hearing for our two outstanding nominees, 
Micah Smith and Judge Shanlyn Park.
    And I want to begin by welcoming their families, and their 
friends, and loved ones, including all those who got up really 
early this morning to watch these proceedings in Hawaii.
    So, in introducing Judge Shanlyn Park, she has been 
nominated to serve on the U.S. District Court of Hawaii. Judge 
Park was born and raised in Hawaii, where her distinguished 
career has been spent almost entirely in public service. 
Inspired, no doubt, by her father's work as a longtime Honolulu 
police officer.
    She graduated cum laude from Chaminade University and the 
William S. Richardson School of Law, and she clerked for 
Magistrate Judge Francis Yamashita.
    Prior to her time on the bench, Judge Park served in the 
Federal Public Defender's Office for the District of Hawaii for 
20 years. During her career, she represented numerous indigent 
clients before the U.S. District Court for the District of 
Hawaii and the Ninth Circuit.
    After leaving the Federal Defender's Office, she entered 
private practice and, even there, she demonstrated her 
commitment to serving her community, receiving special 
recognition from the District of Hawaii for providing pro bono 
services.
    In 2021, she was appointed to serve as a Hawaii Circuit 
Court judge, and as a judge, she has earned high marks from 
practitioners and litigants for her even-handed approach and 
well-reasoned decisions.
    Judge Park is held in high regard in the Hawaii legal 
community as demonstrated by letters of support that the 
Committee has received from the former U.S. Attorney Flo 
Nakakuni, Federal Defender Salina Kanai, and a group of 
prosecutors at the Honolulu Department of the Prosecuting 
Attorney.
    National groups have also offered support for her, 
including the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, 
the Native Hawaiian Bar Association, the National Congress of 
American Indians, the Native American Rights Fund, and the 
National Native American Bar Association.
    If confirmed, Judge Park would make history, as noted by my 
colleague, Senator Schatz, as the first--the first Native 
Hawaiian woman to serve as a Federal district court judge. And 
we say it's high time and long overdue.
    Along with Judge Park, I'm pleased to introduce Micah 
Smith, nominated to serve in the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Hawaii. Micah has an impressive legal career. After 
graduating from Lock Haven University, summa cum laude, and 
Harvard Law School, magna cum laude, he clerked on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for Judge Guido 
Calabresi, and then on the Supreme Court for Justice David 
Souter.
    Micah spent 4 years at O'Melveny & Meyers, where he helped 
author a brief in U.S. v. Jones, a pivotal Fourth Amendment 
case before the Supreme Court. And Justice Scalia wrote the 
opinion for a unanimous Supreme Court, siding with Micah's 
client, Jones.
    He then became a Federal prosecutor, a job he has held for 
the last 12 years. He began at the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of New York, where he tried cases on 
racketeering, drug trafficking, fraud, money laundering, and 
murder for hire. He was promoted to deputy chief and then co-
chief of the Violent and Organized Crime Unit, where he 
supervised approximately 20 prosecutors.
    Even with all his success, Micah never forgot where he came 
from. A proud son of Kauai and graduate of Kauai High School, 
Micah returned home to Hawaii in 2018 to join the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Hawaii.
    And he was promoted to deputy chief of the office's 
Criminal Division, and serves as the criminal civil rights 
coordinator, working closely with the Civil Rights Division, 
law enforcement agencies, and other prosecutors to protect the 
rights of people in Hawaii.
    And last year, he was also named chief of appeals and legal 
strategy, responsible for reviewing and editing appellate 
briefs, providing advice to other prosecutors in his office.
    The quality of Micah's work is evident. He has won numerous 
awards in his time at the Department of Justice, including the 
Homeland Security Investigations, New York Prosecutor of the 
Year Award, and U.S. Attorney General's Award for Distinguished 
Service, and many others. The Committee has received many 
letters supporting his nomination, including from national 
organizations.
    So I know that both of these nominees have the kind of 
experience, temperament, and demonstrate a commitment to public 
service, along with their deep roots in Hawaii, which will make 
them excellent judges in the Hawaii District Court.
    And after today's hearing, I know that my colleagues will 
agree, likewise, and I urge their swift consideration and 
confirmation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much, Senator Hirono. And now 
I recognize Senator Menendez.

               STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ,
          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Durbin, 
Ranking Member Graham, and distinguished Members of the 
Committee, it's an honor to join in introducing an 
exceptionally well-qualified nominee for the U.S. District 
Court of New Jersey, Mr. Jamel Ken Semper.
    For more than 15 years, Mr. Semper has tirelessly sought 
justice for the residents who call New Jersey home. It is a 
central theme that runs throughout Mr. Semper's career: an 
unwavering commitment to the rule of law and to the communities 
the law is meant to protect.
    He began his career as an assistant prosecutor in Union 
County, handling a wide range of cases across the appellate, 
juvenile, and adult trial units. Then in Essex County, he went 
after carjackers and murderers, including the first prosecution 
of a homicide under New Jersey's domestic terrorism statute.
    In 2018, he was sworn in as an assistant United States 
attorney in Newark, climbing the ladder, and ultimately serving 
as chief of both the Violent Crime and Organized Crime Units.
    Today, he's the deputy chief of the Criminal Division, a 
role where he is responsible for supervising all phases of 
criminal investigation and efforts.
    In each of these positions, Mr. Semper has demonstrated an 
unflinching fidelity to the rule of law and the role of 
precedent in pursuing cases. Time and time again, he has forged 
the essential balance between keeping New Jerseyans safe and 
building trust between the residents and those who have sworn 
an oath to protect them. This community-focused approach has 
earned Mr. Semper plaudits from individuals and organizations 
representing diverse interests, especially those who advocate 
for communities of color in the Garden State.
    Consider the words of Reverend Ron Slaughter, the pastor of 
Saint James A.M.E. Church in Newark on the day of Mr. Semper's 
nomination. He said, quote, ``Semper has touched all the bases, 
stayed connected to the community, remained patient. This is a 
great day for New Jersey, America, our judiciary, and my 
community.'' And I couldn't agree more.
    Mr. Semper's nomination not only furthers our collective 
goal of addressing judicial vacancies across our State and 
country, it also advances our efforts to diversify the Federal 
bench. It brings us one step closer toward ensuring that our 
most hallowed institutions reflect the rich tapestry of 
America.
    As I said at the start, I am truly honored to introduce him 
today. Why? Because for nearly 18 years, I've always taken my 
constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on judicial 
nominees seriously. It's one of the most solemn obligations as 
a United States Senator.
    I'm a firm believer that our independent judiciary must 
reflect the best of America's values and its citizens. Which is 
why I can honestly say that Jamel Semper's relentless 
commitment to public service, combined with his temperament, 
intellect, and the trust he has built with New Jerseyans, is 
exactly what we look for in a Federal judge. He will no doubt 
be an asset to New Jersey's Federal bench.
    I encourage my colleagues to give him all due consideration 
at today's hearing and urge strong bipartisan support of the 
Committee so that he can swiftly be confirmed to his rightful 
place in the District Court of New Jersey.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator. Finally, Senator Booker 
is here to introduce Mr. Semper as well.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CORY A. BOOKER,
          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Senator Booker. Thank you. It's an honor to join my senior 
Senator in singing the praises of Jamel Semper Fi--I mean, I'm 
sorry----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker [continuing]. Just Semper. Although he is 
always loyal. This guy is incredible. And I don't want to 
repeat the things that Senator Menendez has already said, but I 
do think he left out that this man is incredibly Jersey.
    How Jersey is he, do you ask? He is a graduate of Rutgers 
Law School. He is a native son of Essex County. He is more 
Jersey than the Garden State Parkway. And he, like many people 
who have driven that notable road, has paid it forward. He's 
paid his tolls.
    And I will tell you, perhaps one of the greatest 
contributions he has made to our State before I talk about his 
professional life, is his extraordinary family. Now, I just 
would love my colleagues to see this family and I would ask 
them to stand up right now. It's not a commandment from the 
Senate, but it is a request----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker [continuing]. These are four incredible kids 
who I think are future leaders. I'm happy that the Constitution 
says they have to wait until they're 30 to run against me----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker [continuing]. But it is just an 
extraordinary family that he has. Perhaps his best life 
contribution.
    But I live in Newark, where this man has worked for a very 
long time. He worked--and my Republican colleagues want to 
note--under a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney. And that work that 
they did, they sat together with my police director then, in 
Newark, a man named Anthony Ambrose, and they came up with a 
strategy to keep our city safe.
    At a time that shootings were going up in a lot of places, 
the nominee will know that shootings dropped dramatically in 
the city of Newark because of their prosecutorial strategies. 
When I asked the mayor, when I asked the police director, what 
was one of the key secrets, they pointed to the work that this 
team did. And Mr. Semper was a major part of that.
    What does it mean when you have a city that drops in 
homicides or shootings almost a quarter? Well, it means that 
the city thrives. This is an extraordinary American in so many 
ways.
    In the prosecutor's office, he supervised 36 Federal 
prosecutors in all phases of criminal investigation and 
litigation, helping to drive down crime in our State.
    In his current role as deputy chief, he also supervises the 
Violent Crime Initiative, a joint task force that's set out to 
reduce gun violence in New Jersey communities. And they had 
incredible success.
    I don't want to repeat all of his incredible credentials, 
but I do want to say something very personal. As many people on 
this Committee know that I am very concerned about how many 
people have been chewed up by the criminal justice system.
    We have a nation that has a proclamation that we are the 
free Nation, but we incarcerate more people than any other 
nation on the planet Earth. There are more African Americans 
incarcerated today, and under criminal supervision, than all 
the slaves in 1860.
    And so I asked him in my interview: You're a prosecutor, 
you helped keep my city safe, but how am I sure that young men 
and women coming before you will get a fair shake at the 
criminal justice system?
    And in a very emotional response, he told me what many 
Black men in America have--that the criminal justice system has 
visited upon his family. He's had a close family member who was 
a defendant.
    He brings somebody to the bench that we really need: 
extraordinary empathy. He's helped keep Black communities, like 
the one I live in, safer and stronger. He's done it with 
empathy and heart. He has brought justice to this justice 
system.
    And should we give this great Jersey boy a chance to sit on 
the bench? As he showed with a U.S. attorney nominated by 
Trump, as he showed with a city that is a bright blue city in 
our Nation, that he will find balance, he will find judicial 
restraint, he will find aggressive pursuit of justice. He will 
be the kind of judge that we need in the United States of 
America.
    And I know that this is a day that our ancestors are happy. 
That our bench in New Jersey should further reflect the 
experiences of so many people. This is a Jersey boy that I'll 
assure that will even make my friend from Louisiana, Senator 
Kennedy, proud. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Booker. I thank all the 
Members for coming and introducing the nominees who will now 
approach the witness table.
    [Pause.]
    Chair Durbin. Please remain standing. Thank you. Please 
raise your right hand.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Let the record reflect that all of 
the nominees answered in the affirmative. So we will let them 
proceed.
    And I'm going to start with Judge Kasubhai with a 5-minute 
opening statement. The same opportunity will be given to each 
nominee. Judge, proceed, please.

     STATEMENT OF HON. MUSTAFA TAHER KASUBHAI,  NOMINEE 
       TO SERVE AS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE
       DISTRICT OF OREGON

    Judge Kasubhai. Thank you, Chair Durbin and Ranking Member 
Graham, for the privilege of appearing before this Committee 
for your consideration.
    I'd like to express my deep gratitude to President Biden 
for nominating me, and for giving me a chance to serve my 
country.
    And to my home State Senators, thank you, Senator Wyden and 
Senator Merkley, for those gracious introductions and for your 
strong support. Coming here 3,000 miles away, you brought a 
heart of Oregon that made me feel right at home.
    Now, I'd like to acknowledge some important people who 
brought me into this life, and some people who give my life and 
work deep meaning. I'm the proud son of immigrants, Taher and 
Aviza Kasubhai. They immigrated here as Indian Muslims and, 
soon after, embraced their new identity as American Muslims.
    And in raising me in our faith traditions, I learned the 
importance of justice and mercy, kindness and compassion, and 
pursuing one of the highest callings: public service. And that 
to be in service to others requires practicing humility every 
day.
    And to my wife and best friend, Kristin, it is from our 
seemingly very different backgrounds that we've created a life 
together that's best summed up as ``A Life of And,'' the most 
powerful word in the universe. And when bringing all of each of 
us into the mix, our sum is infinitely greater than the parts. 
And I love you to infinity and back.
    And to our two children, I'm in awe of your beautiful and 
independent spirits. You both are an antidote to cynicism. You 
make me an optimist, and I love you both two times to infinity 
and back, which makes three times to infinity and back a real 
number.
    To Bonnie and Ernie, my mother- and father-in-law, you are 
the salt of the earth. And thank you for welcoming me into your 
home. You bring an abundance of humility and enduring 
commitment to family. And you've taught me that whatever we 
build, we build it for centuries to come. In other words, you 
can't go wrong with adding more concrete.
    And to my friends and colleagues in the District of Oregon, 
I couldn't hope to work with more kind and gracious public 
servants. You embody that ideal of service to others. You make 
me a better judge.
    And finally, I'd like to thank my alma mater, the 
University of Oregon School of Law. The only public law school 
in Oregon, and whose mission is to inspire public service. 
Thank you, to all the deans and faculty through the decades who 
have inspired so many graduates, including me, to make public 
service our vocation.
    Honorable Senators of the Committee, I look forward to our 
discussion.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Judge. Judge Kazen.

     STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN A. KAZEN, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS 
       UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE SOUTHERN DIS-
       TRICT OF TEXAS

    Judge Kazen. Chair Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, thank you 
for scheduling today's hearing. It is a privilege to appear 
before this Committee.
    Thank you, Senator Cornyn, for your very kind introduction. 
I want to sincerely thank Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz, as 
my home State Senators, for your support and recommendation for 
me for this position. And of course, I want to thank President 
Biden for nominating me to the position of district court 
judge.
    I would not be here if it were not for the examples that my 
parents, Barbara and George Kazen, set for me throughout my 
life. My mother, Barbara, dedicated her life to serving the 
community and to helping the less fortunate of our community. 
My father was, to me, the embodiment of dedication and public 
service to the law. Although they have both now passed, they 
have given me their spiritual strength throughout this process.
    I'd like to introduce my wife, Hayley, who is here with me 
today, who has always been a source of inspiration and strength 
to me throughout our 30 years of marriage. We are very proud of 
our daughter, Claire, who is finishing her last year of 
veterinary school, and who could not miss the days to travel 
here because she's in the midst of her rotations. And so we're 
sad to miss her, but we are very proud of her.
    Here, instead, is one of our nieces, Ms. Mia Escobedo, who 
is a political science major at Texas State University. She was 
able to take a few days off from college and join us. She was 
interested in this very constitutional process.
    There are so many family and friends, and court staff, and 
current and former law clerks, who are watching and who have 
been incredibly supportive to me throughout this process. And I 
want to thank all of them from the bottom of my heart.
    I would also not be here without the mentors that I've had 
throughout my legal career. There is, of course, my father, but 
also Judge Robert Parker, who I clerked for after graduating 
from law school. The lawyers--many lawyers that taught and 
trained me at Kemp Smith law firm in El Paso, Texas, my former 
law partners in Laredo, and so many other lawyers and judges 
that I've learned from over the course of my career.
    But I particularly want to recognize the two district 
judges at our Federal courthouse in Laredo: Judge Diana Saldana 
and Judge Marina Garcia Marmolejo, who have been mentors and 
role models to me during the past 5 years that I have worked 
with them as a magistrate judge. They have been tremendously 
supportive to me throughout this process, and I appreciate 
their guidance and mentorship.
    Senators, I look forward to answering your questions.
    Senator Booker. Mr. Chairman, I didn't know--he pointed out 
his wife, and his wife did not identify herself. I don't know 
if she's--there she is. Okay. So good to see your family here.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Booker. Judge Park.

     STATEMENT  OF  HON. SHANLYN A. S. PARK,  NOMINEE  TO 
       SERVE AS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DIS-
       TRICT OF HAWAII

    Judge Park. Aloha. Good morning, Chair Durbin, Ranking 
Member Graham, and Members of the Committee. I am grateful and 
humbled to appear before you this morning as you consider my 
nomination.
    I'd like to thank President Biden for the honor of this 
nomination. And I'd like to thank Senator Hirono and Senator 
Schatz for their very kind words this morning, and for their 
recommendation to the President.
    I would like to take a moment to introduce a few important 
people in my life. First, my husband, Ku'uhaku Park, who has 
been with me for the last 28 years. His love and support, I 
couldn't do it without him.
    Next, my parents, Louis and Barbara Souza. My parents' 
support, love, and foundation have always been with me. They 
could not travel here with me today, and I hope they figured 
out how to use the link that I sent them----
    [Laughter.]
    Judge Park [continuing]. So that they can be watching at 
4:30 in the morning in Hawaii.
    I'd like to acknowledge and thank my two wonderful 
children, Kamalu and Kahiao. Being their mother has been an 
honor, and I am so proud of the people that they have become.
    I come from a large family and have many supportive 
friends. I won't go through that list today, but I do want to 
thank and acknowledge them, as well.
    I especially want to thank Judge Leslie Kobayashi. If I am 
fortunate to be confirmed, I would be humbled and honored to 
fill her vacancy. Judge Kobayashi has been my mentor, my 
friend, my inspiration. She's the type of judge who leads by 
example, and administers justice fairly and impartially, and 
embodies the word, ``Aloha.''
    I also want to acknowledge friends and colleagues spanning 
my 25-plus-year career. These lawyers and the legal staff that 
I worked with embody hard work, integrity, kindness, and I have 
learned so much from them each and every day.
    Finally, I want to acknowledge and thank my State court 
family. I am so incredibly grateful to my colleagues on the 
State of Hawaii judiciary, especially Judges Trish Morikawa, 
Lisa Cataldo, Rowena Somerville, and Jeanette Castagnetti. My 
colleagues are good individuals who do good work to make Hawaii 
better, and I am proud to serve the people of Hawaii beside 
you.
    And finally, I'd like to thank my hardworking staff, Crista 
Odom and Trevor Tomashero, as well as my past and present law 
clerks. These individuals allow me to do my job daily, and they 
have made my chambers a vibrant second home.
    Thank you, again, for the opportunity to appear before you 
today, and I look forward to your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Judge. Mr. Semper.

      STATEMENT OF JAMEL K. SEMPER, NOMINEE TO  SERVE AS 
        UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF
        NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Semper. Thank you, Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member 
Graham, for scheduling this hearing. I'd like to thank 
President Biden for the honor of this nomination. I'd like to 
thank Senator Menendez and Senator Booker for your recommending 
me to the President, and along with your kind words this 
morning.
    For 15 years, I've dedicated my career to public service by 
upholding the rule of law. I've been blessed to serve with 
selfless public servants.
    I'd like to thank my former colleagues at the Union County 
and Essex County Prosecutor's Office.
    I would like to thank all my State and Federal law 
enforcement partners and all of my colleagues at the United 
States Attorney's Office in the District of New Jersey.
    I'd like to thank my friend and mentor, New Jersey's former 
U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito, who first gave me the honor of 
serving my country 5 years ago.
    With me today is my mother, Judy Wilson, an immigrant from 
Guyana who came to America after her mother, who served as a 
house aide to a family in New York, immigrated my mother to 
Brooklyn, where our American story began.
    Also with me today is my big brother, Khalid Alexander 
Semper. A September 11th cancer survivor who helped put me 
through law school.
    Also with me today is my life partner, my wife, Lucinda 
Jordan McLaughlin. We met 15 years ago while serving as 
prosecutors. We never imagined that our journey would bring us 
before this Committee. We are blessed to be here today with our 
four children who are the absolute center of our lives, and who 
I hope will be quiet during the course of this hearing.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Semper. I would like to thank my father, Edrich Ken 
Semper, who we lost 5 years ago after a long and brave battle 
with cancer. While serving as a police officer in his native 
Trinidad, my father came to America with the hope of becoming a 
forensic scientist so he could return home to serve. The vast 
opportunities he received in America, led him to become an 
engineer and a small business owner in New Jersey for 30 years. 
My father infused us with a love for America and a passion to 
serve others.
    I'm very grateful to him, and I look forward to answering 
your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Mr. Semper. And Mr. Smith.

    STATEMENT OF MICAH W. J. SMITH, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS 
      UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR  THE DISTRICT OF
      HAWAII

    Mr. Smith. Chair Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, and Members 
of the Committee, thank you for considering my nomination 
today.
    Thank you to Senator Schatz and Senator Hirono for their 
generous introductions this morning and for their strong 
support. Thank you to their judicial selection committee for 
recommending me to the Senators.
    And thank you to President Biden for the tremendous honor 
of this nomination. It's especially an honor to be considered 
for the seat held by Judge Seabright, a fair and thoughtful 
judge, and a dedicated public servant.
    I wouldn't be here today without the love and support of my 
family and friends. And so I'm grateful for the opportunity to 
introduce some of them to you today.
    My parents, Betty and Bill, flew in from Texas to be here. 
My mother grew up in what was, at that time, the Territory of 
Hawaii, in plantation housing. My father grew up in Central 
America in Honduras, and he immigrated to the United States as 
a young adult. And through their sacrifices and hard work, they 
made it possible for their four children to have a better life. 
And one of their children is sitting before this honorable 
Committee today. I thank my parents, and I thank our great 
country, for making stories like ours possible.
    My wife, Tiana, is also here. Tiana and I grew up together 
on the island of Kauai. It's a small, tight-knit rural 
community. And for the last 20 years, I've been blessed with 
her optimism, humor, and love. Tiana is accompanied today by 
our 10-year-old son and our 7-year-old daughter. And like Mr. 
Semper, I'm very hopeful they'll sit still during the hearing, 
and we're so proud to be their parents.
    My siblings are all here, as well: my big sister, Anna; my 
big brother, Luke; and my younger brother, Jonathan. They're 
quite simply the best siblings anyone could possibly have.
    And last, I'd like to thank my professional family. I won't 
mention everyone by name. But I would like to mention Justice 
David Souter and Judge Guido Calabresi, whom I had the honor of 
clerking for early in my career, Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan, 
whom I had the privilege of working with at the law firm of 
O'Melveny & Myers.
    I'd also like to thank my fellow law clerks from those 
years, and my colleagues from those years, as well as my many 
friends from the U.S. Attorney's Offices in the District of 
Hawaii and the Southern District of New York. Two of those 
friends, Ryan Poscablo and Robert Boone, were able to join me 
at this hearing, as well.
    So, thank you, again, Senators, and I look forward to your 
questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Each Member of the panel will have 
5 minutes of questioning.
    Judge Kazen, you presided over several naturalization 
ceremonies, including two this year. In one of your addresses 
to our new citizens, you said, and I quote, ``Your journey is 
not over. America is a country of immigrants. America has been 
made great by immigrants. We are all children of immigrants.''
    That was a very poignant and profound statement, 
particularly in light of the gathering today. We have so many 
people aspiring to serve this Nation whose stories are stories 
of immigrants coming to this country at great sacrifice to be 
part of America.
    Are there any other observations you'd like to make about 
your naturalization experience?
    Judge Kazen. Senator, I tell--I talk to the participants in 
the ceremony that I am the product of immigrants. I'm a fourth-
generation Lebanese immigrant. My great-grandparents immigrated 
from Lebanon.
    And so I share with them the example that my grandfather 
and my father, and what they accomplished and what their 
children, is what I mean of their story has not ended. Their 
children and their descendants will contribute, and have the 
potential to contribute to this country, and enrich this 
country.
    And so, the only other thing I can think of is presiding 
over those naturalization ceremonies is one of the most 
rewarding things I do as a judge because those people, after 
they take the oath of citizenship, they are glowing with pride 
to become citizens of this country.
    And it's something that you can tell it's been a life 
accomplishment for them. It's extremely rewarding to share that 
experience with them.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you for sharing that with us. Judge 
Park, I'm going to ask you a hard question. You served as 
public defender for 20 years, I believe?
    Judge Park. That's correct.
    Chair Durbin. And I've taken a look at some of the cases 
that you were called on to defend criminal defendants before 
the court. Some of the crimes that were charged were absolutely 
horrible against those defendants.
    What did you view as your responsibility as public defender 
and as an attorney when it came to the defense of these 
individuals?
    Judge Park. Senator, I felt that it was my responsibility 
pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution to provide 
these individuals with zealous representation. That is what the 
Constitution demands, and that is what I provided to these 
individuals.
    So many individuals who come into the criminal justice 
system don't have an understanding of the crime that they've 
committed, the impact.
    And so throughout my career, I worked on many cases, as 
you've acknowledged. And throughout that process, I've 
advocated for those individuals, but also understood the impact 
that their offense had on others and tried to acknowledge that 
when we were dealing with the case.
    Chair Durbin. Judge Kasubhai, I hope I get your name 
correct before the end of the hearing. Am I close?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, it's Kasubhai. And yes, you are 
right on.
    Chair Durbin. I looked at your record. Looks like 4 years 
or so, maybe 5, as magistrate. Another 11 or 12 as a State 
court judge, and you come here today. Can you tell me about the 
nature of a courtroom?
    Many people's experience is limited to what they've seen on 
television. And having practiced before being elected to 
Congress in the Central District of Illinois and getting to 
know the Federal judges, I know the temperament of a judge and 
the environment of the courtroom itself has such an impact on 
whether people feel that they're being treated justly and 
fairly.
    What is your experience?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, over the 16 years that I've had 
the privilege of serving as a judge in both the State of Oregon 
and in our District Court of Oregon, temperament and demeanor, 
particularly from the judge.
    But that also extends to the way in which our staffs engage 
with the people that come into our courtroom, absolutely impact 
how access to the courts might really turn into actually 
accessing the courts. So it turns the potential into the 
reality.
    The foundation of that is humility. And frankly, humility 
is the foundation of all things that come from the court and 
upholding the rule of law. And so what I try to do when I sit 
on the bench is to ensure that people--I extend to people 
graciousness and patience. So they have not just the 
opportunity to be heard, but to be deeply heard for the cases 
to be considered.
    And when I issue a ruling, whether somebody prevails or 
doesn't prevail, I want that ruling to be conveyed in a way 
that helps them to think of the court as a place in which 
decisions can be decided impartially without regard to who they 
are and that they were heard.
    Chair Durbin. First man I ever worked for in politics said 
humility is a first casualty in politics. And maybe that's the 
case. I hope that our deportment on this side of the panel will 
be excellent today, as well. Senator Graham.
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Kasubhai, in 2020 
while you're a magistrate judge, you apparently gave a speech 
stating that Ibram Kendi is an amazing historian, author, and 
he does important work in the history of the construction of 
race. You wrote a book, am I right, called, ``How to Be an 
Antiracist'' ?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, I want to make sure I understood 
the question. I didn't write a book----
    Senator Graham. Or it was an article? What was it?
    Judge Kasubhai. I believe the author, Ibram Kendi, wrote a 
book about how to be an anti-racist.
    Senator Graham. Okay. I'm sorry. Yes. So you cite him in 
this speech. And here's what he argues: ``That the only remedy 
to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only 
remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.'' Do 
you agree with that?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, discrimination in the treatment 
of--of treating anyone negatively is not appropriate. And our 
courts, through the Students for Fair Admissions, has also 
clarified that as a national guidepost.
    Senator Graham. So you don't agree with that?
    Judge Kasubhai. The statement that you meet discrimination 
with discrimination is not part of what our courts should be 
upholding. It has been clear in our guidance from the Supreme 
Court, as well.
    Senator Graham. So you do not agree with Mr. Kendi's 
proposition as I read it to you?
    Judge Kasubhai. That is correct.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Tell me about the--is it a pamphlet 
of your court? I think you created, ``Pronouns in the Courts'' 
guide. Tell me about that.
    Judge Kasubhai. I developed what's often called sort of a 
``cheat sheet'' for the bench of just the simple prescriptions, 
or language, that I could use to ensure access to the courts. 
That everybody who comes before the court can be acknowledged 
and identified in dignified ways.
    And that related to the issue of the use of pronouns and 
honorifics such as Mr., or Ms., or Mx., and for that matter, 
Mrs. And so I invite people, when they come to court and 
introduce themselves, to offer their identity in the way of 
their honorifics.
    Senator Graham. Is that practice used by other judges, or 
do you know?
    Judge Kasubhai. I know that other judges identify their 
pronouns, for example, in their signature emails, and that 
other judges throughout the State, in Oregon, encourage people 
to identify their pronouns when coming into court so they, 
also, can ensure that people are dignified by identifying 
themselves in the courtroom.
    Senator Graham. I can't say the name of the--I guess it's 
the plaintiff here, somebody v. the City of Eugene. Are you 
familiar with that case? B-O-U-D-J-E-R-A-D-A.
    Judge Kasubhai. Boudjerada.
    Senator Graham. Yes. That case, is it--did that case come 
before you? Or did you rule that Eugene, Oregon's citywide 
curfew, in response to rioting, and looting, and acts of 
violence, was unconstitutional?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, under the First Amendment, and 
that was the structure and the analysis in that case, involved 
a time, place, and manner restriction on protests.
    Senator Graham. Do you think you appropriately applied 
existing precedent of Oregon law to this case?
    Judge Kasubhai. In every instance, Senator, I strive to 
apply binding precedent from the Ninth Circuit, as well as the 
Supreme Court.
    Senator Graham. Well, this one, to me, seems like legal 
gymnastics to get around the most recent case in Oregon, but 
that's just my opinion.
    Further along, in this same case, you recently ruled, I 
think, Eugene's city manager and police chief are not entitled 
to qualified immunity regarding their decision to implement the 
curfew. Is that correct?
    Judge Kasubhai. In that follow-up opinion, after analyzing 
the issues of First Amendment and the time, place, and manner 
restrictions, I subsequently considered the issues with respect 
to several 1983 claims against individual officers, as well as 
the chief of police and the city manager.
    In that opinion, I found that the individual officers were 
not subject to suit because of qualified immunity. But----
    Senator Graham. Well, I didn't ask you that. I asked you 
about the police chief.
    Judge Kasubhai. And with respect to the police chief and 
the city manager, in--with the actions that were taken, in 
light of what our--what I determined to be----
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. Clearly--a clear violation of 
a constitutional right----
    Senator Graham. One last question. How would you describe 
the violence and the destruction of property in Eugene, Oregon? 
How would you describe that?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, violence and destruction of 
property anywhere is----
    Senator Graham. Would you consider it a riot? A riot?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, the facts before me were involving 
the issues of whether the citywide curfew, as opposed to a 
curfew within narrow boundaries, was constitutionally 
appropriate.
    Senator Graham. I would encourage my colleagues to look at 
this particular scenario and make your own decision whether or 
not a curfew was justified. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Graham. Senator Whitehouse.
    Senator Whitehouse. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations 
on your nomination. I wish you well going forward. I was glad 
to see so many colleagues speak so highly of each of you.
    I've been watching our court in Rhode Island, and also 
courts around the country, witnessing a very significant 
diminution in civil jury trials, jury trials generally, civil 
jury trials, in particular.
    Some years ago, the then-chief judge of our Rhode Island 
District Court noted that they hadn't seen a civil jury trial 
in 3 years.
    Now, with the appointments that we've made to that court, 
it has opened back up, if you will, and now civil jury trials 
are happening again. But civil jury trials have been, I think, 
considerably discouraged by actions of the Supreme Court, as it 
relates to rules of procedure. And even more discouraged by the 
Supreme Court, as it relates to agreements to handle matters 
through private mediation and arbitration, very often forced on 
consumers in massive contracts that they have no ability to 
negotiate.
    So, I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on the role of 
the civil jury. I think our Founding Fathers saw it as not just 
a fact-finding adjunct to a judge, but actually an important 
part of our constitutional structure of governance.
    And, in particular, those of you who've been magistrates, 
in some cases, it's the magistrate's job to try to make sure a 
case does not go to trial, and to put pressure on parties to 
settle so that the judge doesn't have to go through running a 
jury trial. And I want to make sure that that's not the way you 
behave, and that's not the way you would behave as a judge.
    And I guess I'll just go right down the line, if you don't 
mind saying a quick word on your view of upholding the 
institution of jury trials, should you be confirmed. Judge 
Kasubhai.
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, jury trials are enshrined in our 
Constitution within the body itself in the Sixth and Seventh 
Amendments. With respect to civil jury trials, they're a 
cornerstone to our democracy.
    When Senator Merkley described a comment that I made about 
democracy works and only works when you shine the light on it, 
the juries are what bear witness to that which happens in our 
courtrooms and that which is determined to be fact or not. They 
are an incredible moderator to that which is, and which is not. 
And without the jury system to help set that tone, to set that 
model going forward, we lose a piece of our democracy.
    Judge Kazen. Senator, it's different--I understand your 
question to focus on jury trials in civil cases. There's a few 
things about that as I--well, I presided over my first jury 
trial as a judge within a few months of taking the bench as a 
magistrate judge. I do strongly believe in civil cases and the 
party's right to have their cases heard and have their issues 
aired in front of a jury.
    As a lawyer, of course, that comes from my background of 
being primarily a civil trial lawyer. And so, I've believed in 
the right to get to a jury and to try cases. And it is, as I 
tell the jurors in the cases when we're doing jury selection, 
that their being there, they're participating in a fundamental 
right under our Constitution. They're participating in the 
Constitution. They're exercising their constitutional rights by 
participating. So I do believe it's a very important right.
    Senator Whitehouse. Judge Park.
    Judge Park. Most of my experience has been in the criminal 
jury trial system. However, I will share this, it is vital to 
our justice system to have jury trials.
    I have had the pleasure of talking with jurors after the 
conclusion of their cases to ask them about their experience. 
And while many are very honest and say they didn't, you know, 
coming in, they didn't necessarily want to serve, by the end of 
the trial, they were all honored to serve their country and to 
do their duty.
    And they recognized the importance of that process to be a 
jury of their peers to an individual who has been charged with 
an offense. So I've recognized, and see, how vital jury trials 
are. And I would say, in the State of Hawaii, civil jury trials 
are happening all the time. So it's alive and well there.
    Senator Whitehouse. Mr. Semper, you'll be the last, because 
my time has just run out.
    Mr. Semper. Thank you, Senator. I share the views of my 
colleagues. As a lawyer, I've spent a considerable amount of my 
time in front of juries putting important and difficult 
questions in front of them. I think the jury system is an 
indispensable feature of our legal system, and if I were so 
fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would certainly do what I 
could to facilitate the jury trial process.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Whitehouse. Senator Cornyn.
    Senator Cornyn. Judge Kazen, I'm glad that the Chairman 
asked you about your experience with naturalization ceremonies. 
My experience has been the same. It's one of the most positive, 
hopeful experiences that I've ever had, like you suggested 
participating in that process.
    Of course, what we're talking about is legal immigration, 
which, I think, has been an important part of the lifeblood of 
our country, our culture, and our prosperity. Illegal 
immigration has been a disaster.
    You are going to be sitting as an Article III district 
judge in a border city, Laredo, Texas. Right across the border, 
Nuevo Laredo, where, when I was in college, we used to go over 
to dine, and shop, and things like that. No one goes to Nuevo 
Laredo anymore because of the violence, and the kidnappings, 
and the like.
    But can you just describe a little bit of the changes that 
you've seen in Laredo, a border city in Texas, over the last 
few years when it comes--in terms of the volume of migrants, 
the drugs, and the violence?
    Judge Kazen. Senator, of course, I've grown up and lived 
along the border my entire life. I've raised my daughter in 
Laredo, Texas. And so, you know, it's--we're part of the 
community.
    It is--illegal immigration is a serious problem for the 
border communities, and the Nation in general. We see, of 
course, a heavy volume of immigration criminal cases in our 
courts. That makes up the majority of the cases that we deal 
with.
    I don't personally, honestly, in my day-to-day life living 
in Laredo, I haven't experienced a particular change as a 
result of the immigration issues and the illegal immigration. 
But certainly, it is reflected in the volume of cases that we 
deal with. Even as a magistrate judge, I handle a lot of 
different pieces of those criminal cases and it is a serious 
issue that we deal with.
    Senator Cornyn. Senator Whitehouse talked about the dearth 
of civil jury trials. Have the immigration docket and border 
courts like yours made it difficult to get to civil jury trials 
because of the volume of cases?
    Judge Kazen. Historically, that is exactly correct. I mean, 
traditionally over the years, it was my father, as a judge. As 
you know, we have deadlines to resolve civil cases. And so it's 
been the--we say at the courthouse is: The criminal docket is a 
jealous mistress, and it is difficult to focus attention on the 
civil docket seriously because of the heavy, heavy criminal 
docket that we have along the border.
    And so one of the things I was told by my district judges 
that I was hired to do, as a magistrate judge, was to focus 
attention--because of my background experience with civil 
litigation, was to focus attention on the civil docket and try 
and get cases--civil cases to trial if the parties consented to 
me.
    Senator Cornyn. Of course, there's probably no bigger 
impediment to access to the courts in a civil case than the 
cost of hiring counsel and the time it takes. And, in fact, if 
you look at the statistics, I think one of the reasons why 
there's so few civil jury trials these days is because the cost 
of litigation.
    And I worry that, more than anything else, that we've 
priced access to justice in a civil case out of the price range 
for most litigants. Unless, of course, you happen to be 
catastrophically injured and are able to negotiate a contingent 
fee with the lawyer representing you, or perhaps you're hired 
by an insurance company, or some Fortune 500 company.
    But that's just--that's a huge concern of mine. Not 
something you all can necessarily solve, but I think it's a 
huge problem for our country in terms of access to justice. 
There's no--I mean, you might as well put the lock on the front 
door of the courthouse for many people because they just can't 
afford to get there or the time it takes to get their case 
resolved.
    Judge Kasubhai--if I'm pronouncing that correctly--let me 
just ask you--Senator Graham asked you about some comments in 
an Oregon State Bar Bulletin, I believe, entitled, ``Is There a 
Place for Us? '' You stated that, ``We must set aside 
conventional ideas of proof when we're dealing with the 
interpersonal work of equity, diversity, and inclusion.''
    And in that same interview, you said, ``As a judge, I can 
appreciate the challenge of employing a different mode for 
understanding truth.'' Could you explain what you meant by 
those words?
    Judge Kasubhai. Yes, Senator. First, I'd like to explain 
that in the course of all of the time that I've served on the 
courts, that the rules of evidence, the burdens of proof, the 
standards that have been established by the law and precedent, 
have always been that which I have followed and upheld.
    Senator Cornyn. Well, that's reassuring, but you can 
understand why I would ask a question about different modes for 
understanding the truth and setting aside conventional ideas of 
proof. Are you talking about in the courtroom or outside of the 
courtroom?
    Judge Kasubhai. Absolutely not in the courtroom. What I was 
referring to was the idea of sitting down and talking with a 
friend from a different background. And when that friend from a 
different background might explain an experience, to be able to 
simply set aside the idea of saying, ``Well, prove it to me,'' 
but simply accept that that was that friend's experience, to 
understand where that friend was coming from.
    So oftentimes lawyers could be accused of always trying a 
case no matter who they might be talking to, including friends. 
And so the idea of setting that normal skill and technique 
aside when talking with somebody, whether it be at a coffee 
shop, or even in a meeting, to be able to look at each other 
with dignity and understand that people have different 
experiences.
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you. My time's up.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Cornyn. Senator Blumenthal.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, all, 
for your service to your States and our Nation. And I'm really 
impressed by the distinction of your backgrounds and your 
determination to continue careers of public service. Thank you 
and congratulations.
    Mr. Smith, I'm going to give you an opportunity to continue 
the response to Senator Whitehouse's question, because he 
didn't have time to finish, and it's an important question, if 
you have anything to add.
    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate the question 
and the opportunity to comment on it. Our--the Founding 
generation recognized the importance of the civil jury trial, 
right? It was enshrined in the Seventh Amendment. I do think 
it's one of the bulwarks of our legal justice system.
    One of the things I would say is, both the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, and, in slightly different language, the 
Federal Rules of Evidence, recognize that it is important for 
judges not just to ensure the just disposition of cases, but 
also the speedy and, to the extent possible, inexpensive 
disposition of cases.
    And I do think that judges have a role in trying to help 
move cases along so that it can be possible for some parties to 
try their cases, because civil jury trials, like criminal jury 
trials, are very important, not just for ensuring just results, 
but also for giving citizens and members of the community an 
opportunity to participate in that process.
    Senator Blumenthal. Great. I noticed that you clerked for 
Judge Guido Calabresi, and then for Justice Souter, two members 
of the Federal bench. I know well Guido Calabresi has been a 
longtime friend in Connecticut, and then worked for the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, and 
then went to Hawaii. How did you happen to go to Hawaii?
    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Senator. I really appreciate the 
question. My wife and I both grew up in Hawaii, and we'd always 
known that we wanted to move back home at some point.
    I had been working in the Southern District of New York for 
about 6\1/2\ years, and in the summer of 2018, my son, my 
oldest child, was getting ready to start kindergarten. And when 
we got to that point, we were thinking about what kind of 
education, what kind of upbringing we wanted him to have. And 
obviously upbringing is great everywhere.
    But for us, having grown up in Hawaii, a particularly 
special place for us, we wanted our children to grow up there. 
So that was one of the reasons why that was the time period 
where we decided to move.
    Senator Blumenthal. Well, Hawaii's gain was our loss on the 
East Coast, so. But congratulations.
    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Blumenthal. Mr. Semper, you have extraordinary 
experience as a prosecutor. And now as deputy head of the 
Criminal Division in the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey, 
I note that you were the lead prosecutor in the first homicide 
prosecution under New Jersey's domestic terrorism statute, if I 
have that correctly.
    Mr. Semper. That's correct, Senator.
    Senator Blumenthal. Maybe you can impart to us some of the 
lessons of that prosecution and how we should be mindful of the 
need, either for strengthening our laws or in some ways 
reforming them, so as to focus on domestic terrorism, which I 
view as the most persistent and lethal threat to our internal 
security right now.
    Mr. Semper. Thank you, Senator. In that particular case, 
the defendant was radicalized online. During the time of the 
incident, he had sought after a lot of material related to 
ISIS, and his ultimate goal was to go to Syria to join the 
caliphate.
    During that radicalization process, he killed three men in 
his native State of Washington before coming to New Jersey, 
which he was going to use as a jump-off place to go to the 
Middle East before he ultimately took the life of the victim in 
our case.
    The lessons that I learned in that particular matter was, 
one, it was a collective effort by law enforcement. We were 
very fortunate enough to have an intelligence-sharing apparatus 
between the local authorities in Washington, the Federal 
agencies who we worked with, and also our local authorities in 
New Jersey.
    I have found generally, in my experience with law 
enforcement, that there is no ``I'' in ``team,'' and 
collaboration is really key to identifying threats and 
neutralizing them. As far as the rest of it, the policy stuff, 
I would leave to you all, the experts. But certainly, it was a 
case unlike others I had dealt with, up to that point.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. My time has expired, but I 
wish all of you well. You're going to be great judges, and you 
will be the face and voice of justice for most litigants who 
can't afford to take appeals, as you well know.
    And I would just add my voice to others who talked about 
the immigration naturalization proceedings, which I do 
regularly. I'm going to be doing them this Friday in 
Connecticut. I love doing them. They give me hope and 
inspiration, especially as I get out of Washington from time to 
time. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Blumenthal. Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to all of you 
for being here, for your willingness to be considered for these 
important positions. Judge Kasubhai, I'd like to start with 
you, if that's all right.
    A few months ago, in May of this year, you gave a 
presentation to the Oregon State Bar in which you included the 
following in your remarks, quote, ``DEI, Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion, is the heart and soul of the court system. Can we 
say that? Yeah, I just did, and I say it proudly.'' Mr. 
Kasubhai, Judge, could you explain what that means?
    Judge Kasubhai. Yes. Access to justice is at the heart of 
the work that I do within the courtroom, and ensuring that 
everybody who--everybody is dignified and treated with dignity 
when they come into the courtroom, and for me to preside over 
those cases----
    Senator Lee. Right. But you'd say that's the heart and soul 
of the judicial system more than equal justice under the law, 
more than the Constitution, more than the law itself, or the 
job of interpreting the law fairly, where litigants before you 
have disagreements as to the law's meaning?
    Judge Kasubhai. In the way in which, and in the context in 
which, I was using the term and referring to diversity, was the 
idea and the ideal of equal justice under the law. That 
everybody, no matter what their background, beliefs--whatever 
that might be, that everyone is entitled to access to the 
courts, and that equity.
    Senator Lee. All right. Let's circle back to that one in a 
minute.
    The First Amendment's protection of free speech is 
foundational. It's been described as one of our first freedoms. 
It's been described accurately, I think, fairly by many, as 
being upstream from all of our other rights, and it has to be 
protected vigorously. And we also know that there are time, 
place, and manner accommodations that can go along with that.
    Among other things, there are special exceptions that occur 
where riot control measures are necessary due to an outbreak of 
coordinated overt violence.
    In a case that's been referred to briefly in the hearing 
today, but not much, this Boudjerada v. City of Eugene, you're 
dealing with some interesting circumstances. You had riots 
taking place--there were three nights of terror in Eugene, 
Oregon, during the BLM riots of 2020, where, in your words, the 
following was going on, quote, ``A crowd applying graffiti, 
lighting fireworks, and blocking traffic, throwing glass 
bottles toward officers, surrounding a patrol car, smashing its 
windows and puncturing its tires''--with the officers inside 
the patrol car, mind you.
    The group, quote, ``started fires in the roadway, attacked 
people in vehicles in the downtown area. Several businesses 
were vandalized and looted, and several officers were 
injured.'' You went on to state that, ``Members of the group 
carried heavy backpacks and bottles, and were communicating via 
radios.''
    So, in response to this, the city implemented some riot 
control measures. They imposed a citywide curfew, one that 
lasted 7 hours. We had three rioters who were arrested during 
the curfew, and despite the Ninth Circuit precedent in the 
Menotti case, addressing a very similar curfew in Seattle, you 
decided that the Eugene, Oregon, curfew was unconstitutional.
    Can you explain to me how consistent with the Ninth Circuit 
precedent in the Menotti case--how does a 7-hour curfew through 
the middle of the night in the wave of such destruction and 
terror prevent ample means of communication? Can you explain 
that to me?
    Judge Kasubhai. The Menotti case did provide guidance and 
assisted me in evaluating the legal analysis that I applied.
    There were two curfews that had been imposed. One was a 
downtown curfew, so there were geographic restrictions. That 
was not the curfew that was before me, nor did I find that 
unconstitutional.
    It was a citywide curfew that actually subjected everybody 
in the city, well beyond the boundaries of downtown, to out 
into the residential neighborhoods such that the application of 
that curfew--that citywide curfew--could have criminalized 
people's behavior of just trying to get home, well outside of 
any of the riots and the protests.
    Senator Lee. You've praised Ibram X. Kendi as someone who 
you like, as an amazing historian and author. And you said that 
you've liked--you would like to push some of Ibram X. Kendi's 
ideas even further.
    I'm sure you're aware, he's famous for saying, quote, ``The 
only remedy to racist discrimination is anti-racist 
discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is 
present discrimination. The only remedy to present 
discrimination is future discrimination.'' Kendi also stated 
that, ``In order to truly be an anti-racist, you have to be 
anti-capitalist.''
    So I'd like to know, first of all, what would you do to 
push Ibram Kendi's ideas even further? And do you believe 
someone should be praising--someone who is currently a Federal 
magistrate judge, be praising someone who encourages 
discrimination in any circumstance?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, I don't recall having ever 
remarked that I want to push Ibram Kendi's ideas further. In 
questions earlier in this hearing, I clearly stated that the 
ideas that have been described here, that have been attributed 
to Ibram Kendi, are not ideas that are consistent with the 20 
years in my public service, 16 as a judge.
    And the record that I have shown striving to apply the law, 
the Constitution, and Supreme Court precedent, would not be 
consistent with this idea of supporting the ideas that you've 
described as Ibram Kendi's.
    Senator Lee. So you're saying that you have never said that 
you would like to push some of Ibram Kendi's ideas further?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, I don't recall having made that 
particular statement.
    Senator Lee. Okay. I see my time has expired. We'll follow 
up on these in writing. These are concerning. One of the most 
fundamental laws we have that's embedded within our 
Constitution is that governments can't treat people differently 
on the basis of their race, and that's why this is important to 
ask you about. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Judge Kasubhai, this case, Boudjerada case, 
has come up several times. Can you tell me, was that subject to 
review by the district court? How did they view your ruling?
    Judge Kasubhai. That was a case in which the parties had 
not consented, and it was reviewed by a district judge and 
adopted without opinion on the issue of the constitutionality 
finding, with respect to the curfew. The follow-up finding and 
recommendation is still before the district judge and is on 
review.
    Chair Durbin. I see. I believe that we have Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations to 
each of you. To ensure the fitness of nominees before any of 
the Committees on which I sit, I ask the following two initial 
questions. So we will just go right down the line, starting 
with Judge Kasubhai.
    Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted 
requests for sexual favors, or committed any verbal or physical 
harassment or assault of a sexual nature?
    Judge Kasubhai. No, Senator.
    Judge Kazen. No, Senator.
    Judge Park. No, Senator.
    Mr. Semper. No, Senator.
    Mr. Smith. No, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Have you ever faced discipline, or entered 
into a settlement, relating to this kind of conduct?
    Judge Kasubhai. No, Senator.
    Judge Kazen. No, Senator.
    Judge Park. No, Senator.
    Mr. Semper. No, Senator.
    Mr. Smith. No, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. For Judge Park, you spent the majority of 
your career working in the Office of the Public Defender for 
Hawaii. Public defenders play a vital role in the justice 
system by ensuring that all defendants, regardless of means, 
have their constitutional rights to counsel.
    Can you speak, briefly, to the importance of having strong 
prosecutors and defense attorneys in our adversarial justice 
system?
    Judge Park. Thank you, Senator. The Sixth Amendment 
requires that there is a right to counsel. And the reason why 
that is, is so that there can be a balance of power with 
respect to these cases.
    Individuals who are charged with an offense are simply 
charged. The Government has the burden of proof, and to prove 
that charge beyond a reasonable doubt. And it is necessary to 
have attorneys represent these individuals in order to hold the 
Government to that high burden of proof that is required under 
the law.
    And so that is something that I did for 20 years. And I 
find that the right to counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment 
is vital in order to have a fair and just legal system.
    Senator Hirono. For both you, and Mr. Smith, parents can 
have a profound impact on our lives.
    Mr. Smith, your father immigrated to this country from 
Honduras. After completing seminary, he worked his way through 
college as a janitor, and went on to earn a doctorate and 
become a professor.
    Judge Park, your father spent a long career on the Honolulu 
police force rising to the rank of major, and serving as 
president of the police officers' union.
    For both of you, how have your parents' experiences 
impacted your lives and your careers? And this includes your 
mothers, although I just mentioned your fathers. Go ahead. 
Judge Park.
    Judge Park. I had the honor of witnessing my father work 
hard as a Honolulu police officer. His example of public 
service is what drives me to this day. Growing up, I used to 
paddle canoe, and didn't want to catch the bus home after being 
wet for so long, and would go to the Honolulu Police Department 
and sit until my father was ready to come home.
    But he was so dedicated to his job, and doing the 
investigations that he did inspire me. And so he was vital to 
my decision to enter into the law. And my mom's support of him 
throughout his legal career was critical. My dad would not have 
been able to do the level of police work that he did without 
her love and support.
    Senator Hirono. And he would agree with that.
    Judge Park. And he would agree with that.
    Senator Hirono. Mr. Smith.
    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Senator. When you're fortunate, as 
Judge Park and I were, to have the kinds of parents we did, 
your parents help you see what's possible just watching their 
life stories. The things that they were able to do, from where 
they started and where they ended up, makes it possible for 
their children to think the same thing. And I know that my 
siblings and I all feel that way.
    Since my father was already discussed a little bit, let me 
say just a few things about my mother. My mother became a Head 
Start teacher, a substitute teacher in public school. I 
remember having her in one of my classes at least once. And as 
a kid, that's always embarrassing.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Smith. And you know, in the summer, she would sometimes 
work shifts at Kmart to help pay the bills. And, I think, when 
you see a parent just dedicating themselves to helping their 
families do well, it teaches you those values.
    Senator Hirono. In the brief time that I have left, again, 
for both of you, Judge Park and Mr. Smith: Judge Park, you 
would be the first Native Hawaiian woman to serve in the 
Federal district court; Mr. Smith, your father, as I said, is 
an immigrant from Honduras, and your mother is of Japanese 
ancestry. In my view, the judiciary should reflect that 
diversity of our Nation, and both of you reflect the vibrant 
diversity of Hawaii. Could you just, very briefly, talk about 
why diversity is so important, as I assume it is important, to 
each of you?
    Judge Park. I think diversity is important, both personal 
and professional diversity on the bench, because a diverse 
bench represents the community that it serves. And when you 
have a diverse bench it builds and brings integrity to the 
institution. And so I think it is very important.
    Senator Hirono. Mr. Smith?
    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Senator. I think diversity in its 
broadest sense is very important. And I do agree with Judge 
Park that when the community sees that the bench, and all 
positions of public importance, are open to everyone from all 
sorts of walks of life, backgrounds, perspective, it promotes 
and ensures trust in those institutions.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Hirono. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Kasubhai, 
I'm looking at an order you issued as a magistrate judge, here, 
requiring the use of pronouns in your court. Do you require the 
use of pronouns, the declaration of one's pronouns in your 
court?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, that may be referring to perhaps a 
trial management order or a scheduling order of some kind?
    Senator Kennedy. Yes--no, it's a statement. You issued it. 
Here it is.
    Judge Kasubhai. Oh, it's an invitation for people to 
identify their pronouns and/or their honorifics.
    Senator Kennedy. I'm looking at your requirement that you 
issued to all people in your court. You say, quote, ``When you 
introduce yourself in a meeting, you should say, `My name is 
Judge Blank, and my pronouns are blank'.'' Is that right?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, those were not requirements or 
rules. Those were suggestions and----
    Senator Kennedy. They were suggestions?
    Judge Kasubhai. Those were suggestions and invitations----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. For people to use.
    Senator Kennedy. And you also, in your directive, you say, 
quote, ``I'd like counsel to . . . introduce themselves giving 
your full name and your honorific, such as''--M-S period, 
``Ms., Mx., or Mr.,''--not Mrs., ``and if your client will be 
making an appearance, I ask you to please introduce them to the 
Court by giving me their full name and their honorific, such 
as''--M-S period, ``Ms., Mx., or Mr.,'' end quote. Is that 
right?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, it's not a directive. Again, it's 
an invitation for people to----
    Senator Kennedy. Oh----
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. Introduce themselves.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. It's an invitation?
    Judge Kasubhai. Yes.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. All right.
    I'm looking at an article from the Oregon State Bar 
Bulletin from May of 2021, and I want to read one of your 
quotes. Quote: ``We have to set aside conventional ideas of 
proof.'' Let me say that again. ``We have to set aside 
conventional ideas of proof,'' you said, ``when we are dealing 
with the personal and interpersonal work of equity, division, 
and inclusion. As a judge, I can appreciate the challenge of 
employing a different mode for understanding truth than that 
which most lawyers are accustomed to in our work,'' end quote. 
Did you write that?
    Judge Kasubhai. That is a quote from that article.
    Senator Kennedy. So, when we're dealing with equity, 
diversity, and inclusion, we should set aside conventional 
ideas of proof. Is that right?
    Judge Kasubhai. In the larger context of interpersonal and 
personal relationships, the idea of being able to have a 
conversation with somebody----
    Senator Kennedy. Yes. But you didn't talk about a 
conversation. You said proof.
    Judge Kasubhai. It's in the context of having a 
conversation with somebody about the issue of their 
background----
    Senator Kennedy. So----
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. And their experience.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. When the issue is equity, 
diversity, or inclusion, we should have a different set of 
proof. Is that right?
    Judge Kasubhai. When it comes to the space in which people 
have interpersonal relationships with one another, the idea of 
respecting and dignifying each other with their experiences is 
an important part of----
    Senator Kennedy. So--so all issues have one set of proof, 
which has been handed down by our State supreme courts, our 
U.S. Supreme Court, except, you think we ought to have a 
different set of proof when equity, diversity, and inclusion 
are at issue. Is that right?
    Judge Kasubhai. In all of my years on the bench, Senator, I 
have applied the law, the rules of evidence----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. The case precedent.
    Senator Kennedy. Let me move on. I'm looking at the notes 
you gave us from a speech you made in February 7th, 2020. It's 
entitled, speech, ``Reflections on Equity and Privilege,'' to 
the Oregon Blacks in Government. You wrote, quote, ``White male 
straight people allow privilege to remain in place,'' closed 
quote. Did you say that? Did you write that?
    Judge Kasubhai. Without looking at the specific----
    Senator Kennedy. Here it is----
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. Speech here----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. You turned it in.
    Judge Kasubhai. Well, if that's on the piece of paper, 
Senator, then I have----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. No reason to----
    Senator Kennedy. You also wrote, quote, ``Privilege is 
incredibly similar to narcissistic personality disorder,'' 
closed quote. Did you write that?
    Judge Kasubhai. Without looking at everything in the 
context of that statement, it appears correct.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. You wrote, quote, ``The identity of 
Muslims also need to be normalized in a country that is so 
deeply Islamophobic.'' Did you write that?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, I did. And what I'd also like to 
clarify is that in the context of my work on the bench, I have 
treated everybody equally without regard----
    Senator Kennedy. I understand.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. To their background----
    Senator Kennedy. I'm sorry. I just want to get through 
this. I'm going to run out of time. You also wrote, quote, ``I 
am disappointed about the way in which the Founding Fathers of 
this country perpetuated inequity,'' closed quote. Did you 
write that?
    Judge Kasubhai. In the context of the issue of slavery, 
that was something that I had----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. Been considering.
    Senator Kennedy. You know, your notes you gave us from a 
speech on May 17th, 2023, ``Does Race Matter?'' you said, 
quote--quote,``Does race matter? Hell yes,'' closed quote. 
``You know that T-shirt at the Saturday markets, the one that 
says something like, `Love sees no color,' and it has all the 
colors of the rainbow all over it, and it's like a tie dye 
shirt. Well, the first time I saw it, I said, `Ah, how sweet.' 
Then I got angry. If love doesn't see color, then I don't have 
allies,'' closed quote. Did you say that?
    Judge Kasubhai. Yes. And that was to explain that the work 
of equity is to help understand where people are coming from, 
not to ignore who they are.
    Senator Kennedy. And you also----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Chair Durbin. Senator, the time.
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, I know. I'm sorry. Can I have 30 more 
seconds?
    Chair Durbin. Thirty more seconds, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Judge, you seem to be obsessed with race 
and sexuality. I mean, you even go so far as to say that when 
race, and sexuality, and diversity, and inclusion are at issue, 
we need a separate standard of proof in the United States 
Federal judiciary. How are litigants going to be able to trust 
you?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, that's not what I've said. There 
is----
    Senator Kennedy. Sure you did----
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. No different standard----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Sure you did, it's bigger 
than Dallas. I read it to you.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. When you look at----
    Senator Kennedy. You turned in these documents. I didn't go 
looking for them.
    Judge Kasubhai. When you look----
    Senator Kennedy. You seem proud of it.
    Judge Kasubhai. As anyone who reviews my record on the 
bench----
    Senator Kennedy. I have.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. Thousands of cases----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Chair Durbin. I'm going to let you finish responding and 
we're--your time has expired, but go ahead.
    Judge Kasubhai. The rule of law is an absolute for me, the 
work that I have done on the bench over the last 16----
    Senator Kennedy. That's not what you say.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. The work that I've done on the 
bench----
    Senator Kennedy. But that's not what you say.
    Chair Durbin. Judge, finish your sentence.
    Judge Kasubhai. The work that I've done on the bench in 
ruling over all the people's cases that have appeared in front 
of me, from all backgrounds of all faiths, you'll find that I 
have upheld the rule of law, and upheld the precedent of our 
Constitution, and our Supreme Court, and the Ninth Circuit.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, if this Chairman would give me time, 
I could go through the cases and prove----
    Chair Durbin. Well----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. That that's not the case.
    Chair Durbin. Senator----
    Senator Kennedy. I just don't see how you can be a fair-
minded judge.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Booker.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much. Mr. Kasubhai, I--my 
favorite author is James Baldwin. Would you--love his books, 
quote from his books--would you make the presumption that I 
agree with everything James Baldwin has said?
    Judge Kasubhai. I wouldn't presume that, Senator.
    Senator Booker. I read my colleague J.D. Vance's book, 
``Hillbilly Elegy.'' I have bought it for other people. Would 
you think to ascribe to me all the views of my colleague, J.D. 
Vance?
    Judge Kasubhai. No, sir.
    Senator Booker. I have a little--forgive me, this is a 
little petty. I'm about to do this, but--I have bought Senator 
Cotton's book. I bought it because he didn't give it to me.
    [Laughter.]
    That's the petty part, I apologize. It's actually a real--
--
    Senator Cotton. I'll still sign it for you, though, if you 
want to.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. But it is actually pretty extraordinary. 
Senator Cotton surprised me. He's quite a historian. Would you 
ascribe to me all the views of Senator Cotton?
    Judge Kasubhai. No, sir.
    Senator Booker. Even if I've quoted from his book----
    Senator Cotton. But you should.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. Even if I've quoted from his book, would 
you do that?
    Judge Kasubhai. I would not, sir.
    Senator Booker. So the book that's been brought up, ``How 
to Be an Antiracist,'' which was on Time Magazine's must-read 
list, which was a runaway bestselling book--would it be a 
mistake for anybody to ascribe to you all the views of the 
author?
    Judge Kasubhai. It would.
    Senator Booker. Yes, absolutely. I agree that there's some 
points in the book that are worth quoting, and I can't--I don't 
remember, but I imagine I may have. But there are definitely 
parts of the book that I don't agree with, as well. And I--
that's the same for you.
    Judge Kasubhai. It is correct, sir.
    Senator Booker. Does my race matter?
    Judge Kasubhai. Without going into a couple of hours of a 
conversation, Senator, it depends on both the person as well as 
how people perceive them.
    Senator Booker. But isn't that the point? Like, what a 
crazy question: My race, does it matter? It's such a hotbed of 
discussion in America now. It's often very polarizing. But the 
truth of the matter is, it's part of my identity. I'm a 
Christian, I'm an American, I'm a Black guy. And to me, 
obviously, those are identifying features that matter.
    Within the criminal justice system, would it be fair to 
have a judiciary that did not have African Americans?
    Judge Kasubhai. It's important for diversity to be 
represented on the bench. Experience is the life of the law.
    Senator Booker. Right. Because the law is independent in 
many ways--should be, I should say, independent of racial 
reasoning when applying the facts of the law. Right?
    Judge Kasubhai. Correct.
    Senator Booker. But I've seen lots of studies, you don't 
need to comment on, about implicit racial bias in the law. We 
know from the data that if you control for other factors--
income, geography, education--that African Americans in the 
criminal justice system have tended to get longer sentences for 
similar crimes. Are you aware of that research?
    Judge Kasubhai. I'm aware of that research.
    Senator Booker. Right. And so the idea that diversity is 
important to talk about, to have a criminal justice system that 
reflects the diversity of the population. Many people, even if 
it's just for the matter of faith in the system of minority 
groups, one would say that diversity is very important. Yes?
    Judge Kasubhai. Absolutely.
    Senator Booker. But I think there's at least a spirit that 
I'm feeling that your views on the importance of diversity--
urgency, I would say, of diversity, that your understanding 
that the legitimacy of the courts, your understanding that 
everybody from Harvard Business School to consulting companies, 
like McKinsey, have said diverse teams are better teams.
    There's some kind of confusion with, perhaps, those so 
strong beliefs and your ability to be an objective judge in 
legal matters and to apply the law. And I would just like to 
ask you, when it comes to the cases that come before you, what 
is the process by which you go about to coming to conclusions?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, it's a very stringent--stringent 
and rigorous process. It starts with reading the briefs, and 
then reading them again, and making sure I understand the 
issues that have been raised before me, the law that is being 
applied and invoked by the parties.
    And then working through each and every one of those 
arguments, and understanding the rules that are being invoked, 
and testing--testing the hypotheses that the parties are making 
in their arguments----
    Senator Booker. Right.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. Over and over and----
    Senator Booker. Yes.
    Judge Kasubhai [continuing]. Over again.
    Senator Booker. And so I don't need to go through the 
rigorous processes, but I just--you don't care what their 
pronouns are when you're applying the law.
    Judge Kasubhai. Absolutely not.
    Senator Booker. You don't care the color of their skin when 
you're applying the law.
    Judge Kasubhai. Most certainly not.
    Senator Booker. Yes. You are applying the law, even though 
you do believe, like most of the people around this dais, that 
having diverse teams is a good thing for America. When it comes 
to doing your job, you have a rigorous processes of which these 
things don't enter.
    Judge Kasubhai. You said it better than I could, Senator.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much. The last thing I just 
want to say is to Jamel Semper: Your mother is extraordinary. 
Is that true or false?
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. That is a trick question.
    Mr. Semper. Senator----
    Senator Booker. You know you're under oath, yes?
    Mr. Semper. Senator, before God and country, my mother is 
quite extraordinary.
    Senator Booker. She is an immigrant to this country. Yes?
    Mr. Semper. Yes. Yes, she is.
    Senator Booker. She has two extraordinary children, from my 
understanding. Right?
    Mr. Semper. She does.
    Senator Booker. You and your brother?
    Mr. Semper. Yes.
    Senator Booker. Your brother got cancer in his 9/11-related 
heroism. Yes?
    Mr. Semper. Yes. Yes, he has. Yes, he has.
    Senator Booker. Yes. And he has been supportive of you 
because he's the older brother. Right?
    Mr. Semper. Yes. He and my mother helped put me through law 
school. I'm incredibly grateful for them.
    Senator Booker. Right, right. So you will do right by this 
country if you should you get this position?
    Mr. Semper. Senator, if I am fortunate enough to be 
confirmed for this position, I will do all that I can to serve.
    Senator Booker. And you will do right by your mama. Right?
    Mr. Semper. I have and I will.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Semper. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Blackburn.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And 
congratulations to each of you on your nominations. And it's so 
wonderful to hear your introductions of your families. And I'm 
so pleased, Mr. Semper, that you now have a Congressional edict 
to be good to your mama.
    [Laughter.]
    I think that is just awesome. We mamas like things like 
that.
    We're also informed by looking at your records and reading 
your writings. And Judge Kasubhai, I want to come to you 
because as I looked at some of your readings and writings, your 
decisions, you seem to have an affinity for Marxism.
    And in a 1994 essay, you criticize the concept of private 
property. And I'm going to quote you here. You argued that, and 
I quote, ``Property incites rebellion,'' end quote. And this is 
one of the many positive statements that you have made about 
Marxist approaches and Marxist policies, Marxism.
    And, you know, President Reagan--as I was reading some of 
your things that leaned toward Marxism, I thought of President 
Reagan's comments when he said that the march of freedom and 
democracy would leave Marxism on the ash heap of history. And 
that's exactly where it belongs, because Marxist regimes, as of 
2023, have been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million 
people.
    So, it disturbs me when I see this leaning to Marxism in 
your writings. So, a yes-or-no question: Are you a Marxist?
    Judge Kasubhai. No, Senator.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Will you, right now, disavow the 
tenets of Marxism that you have praised in some of your 
writings?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, I have not praised Marxist ideas, 
and I would disavow any other system than that which is--than 
that would have--be supported by our U.S. Constitution and our 
laws.
    Senator Blackburn. I appreciate your comment, but sir, in 
your writings you have given the opposite opinion. But you've 
also made a number of concerning statements regarding sexuality 
and the disempowerment of women.
    Specifically, you've aligned yourself philosophically with 
a professor who has espoused the disturbing views that all 
heterosexual relationships are, per se, infused with violence, 
and that all sexual acts should be viewed as rape.
    Not only is this view wrong and offensive, but also, and 
perhaps more importantly, it undercuts the important work that 
is being done across this country to empower survivors of 
sexual assault.
    When you say that all sexual acts are rape, you 
delegitimize and silence women who actually are victims of 
sexual assault. So, how can women possibly trust that they will 
be treated fairly in your courtroom given your disturbing views 
on this subject?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, that law review article to which 
you're referring, I believe was published--I wrote in 1995. I 
did not align myself with those ideas. The law review article 
summarizes several different theories of laws----
    Senator Blackburn. We're familiar with the article. Do you 
regret citing these very concerning statements?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, the description or summary of 
these different theories is not a subscription to, or an 
attestation of, the validity of----
    Senator Blackburn. Do you denounce the view that all women 
are, per se, disempowered by our system?
    Judge Kasubhai. I do not ascribe to those theories that I 
was summarizing in that article. And I would also turn to my 
years of serving on the bench and treating all people fairly--
--
    Senator Blackburn. Let me--let me move on. I've got 30 
seconds.
    I also was troubled by your involvement as the prosecutor 
in the Gonzalez case. Mr. Gonzalez was arrested for allegedly 
raping a 12-year-old little girl. The FBI eventually reviewed 
the media seized from his home and identified horrific images 
of child sexual abuse.
    The sentencing memo that you prepared--oh, this is for Mr. 
Smith. Your sentencing memo, you outlined Mr. Gonzalez's 
heinous crimes. The images that were found on his phone were 
created in his home, in his own bedroom, with girls as young as 
10 years old.
    And they found out he had parties, he would offer them 
illicit substances, he would then abuse them. And he did this 
multiple times over a 15-year period of time. It started in 
1997, and still, with all of that information, you went far 
below the guidelines.
    And, in fact, for this repeat child abuser, you recommended 
a sentence of just over 10 years, and he had done this to kids 
for 15 years. So, why did you do that?
    Mr. Smith. Thank you for the question, Senator. I do recall 
the case of Mr. Gonzalez. That was a case that, I believe, I 
was assigned when I had just started in the Office. I 
recognized immediately the seriousness of those offenses, and, 
I believe, I had Mr. Gonzalez prosecuted within a month or so 
of my having been assigned the case.
    When I make sentencing recommendations in court, especially 
as a new prosecutor in the General Crimes Unit in the Southern 
District of New York, I make those sentencing----
    Senator Blackburn. Okay.
    Mr. Smith [continuing]. Recommendations----
    Senator Blackburn. Well, the court rejected your 
recommendation. They went above you, to 15 years, and then gave 
him an additional 10 years of probation. This is something that 
is terribly concerning to me. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. I'm going to let Mr. Smith finish his answer 
to your inquiry.
    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Chair Durbin. I just wanted to 
mention, particularly in the General Crimes Unit in the 
Southern District of New York, the sentencing recommendations 
that we make are in close consultation with our supervisors, 
considering all of the 3553(a) factors.
    And so when I appear in that forum, I'm representing the 
Office, and I do that as a prosecutor in all of my cases. I am 
not speaking on behalf of my own personal views. I try to set 
those things aside. And I try to represent the Office.
    If I were fortunate to be confirmed, I would do the same as 
a judge. I would set any personal views aside, and I would 
endeavor to apply the law faithfully and define the facts 
fairly.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Padilla.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First of all, 
congratulations to each of you for the nomination and for the 
opportunity to be here today. In preparation, I'd be shocked if 
you haven't been advised that when it comes to be Senator 
Padilla's turn, here's a question to anticipate.
    Diversity is a beautiful thing. It's one of the biggest 
strengths of our Nation--not just across the board, not just in 
communities, not just in government, but in, particularly, the 
Federal judiciary.
    I know my colleague, Senator Hirono, asked a general 
question about diversity. I always ask about diversity because 
diversity's important, not just in terms of who sits on the 
Federal bench, right? The diversity of life experience, the 
diversity of professional experience ought to be part of the 
processing considered, not just for more inclusive or 
reflective outcomes, but for public confidence in the Federal 
judiciary and its decisions.
    All that being said, what I tend to ask nominees is, what 
would you do, if you're fortunate enough to be confirmed, to 
advance diversity in your courtroom, if you agree with my value 
statement? And if you disagree, I'd love to hear it. And not 
just broadly with support staff and whatnot, but particularly 
when it comes to law clerks. I think most of you may have a 
specific example or experience where a quality clerkship 
experience can really help a career at the outset.
    Whether you pursue public service, whether you pursue 
private practice, that clerkship opportunity can be pivotal.
    So, what can we do to open the door to that experience for 
a more diverse group of young law students and law clerks than 
we have historically? And we'll start with Mr. Kasubhai.
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, I agree with your value statement, 
and with respect to the work on the court, it's absolutely 
important to bring diversity and diverse experiences from all 
backgrounds, to staff, that's important, but law clerks. Over 
the 16 years that I've served on the bench, I've worked hard to 
ensure that I have a diverse group of law clerks that have 
worked with me throughout all of these years.
    But we have to go further than that. It has to be externs. 
People from law school, students, and then reaching out into 
the community to high school, and middle school, to make sure 
that people are thinking about law school, not just at the last 
minute, but their entire lives.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you.
    Judge Kazen. Senator, I agree that diversity is important. 
Over the last 5 years as a Federal magistrate judge, I have 
hired law clerks from different geographic backgrounds, 
religions, genders, of course, law schools, and just, you know, 
national origin, and race. But, you know, all those 
experiences, I believe, are important to enrich and give 
different perspectives on backgrounds. And so it is something 
that I'll continue to do with the law clerks that I hire.
    Judge Park. I started my legal career as a law clerk to a 
magistrate judge, and I know the value that that clerkship 
provided to me and the doors that it opened. When I look to 
hire, not only law clerks but interns and externs that help and 
assist in my chambers, I do look at not only their personal 
diversity, but their professional diversity. And that is 
important to me when I make that decision on who to hire.
    Mr. Semper. Thank you, Senator. I agree with the comments 
of my colleagues. I think diversity is very important. I think 
it helps to--when you draw more people into our institutions, 
particularly institutions like the judicial system, I think 
that helps to affirm the confidence that the community must 
have in our institutions. I would also just say, I think 
academic diversity is important, as well.
    I came from a State law school, and, you know, these 
positions, they are great, and they are stocked with a lot of 
people from the top schools. But I think there's a lot of 
talent within our State schools. And so, if I were fortunate 
enough to be confirmed for this position, I would have an eye 
toward that, as well.
    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Senator. I don't think I could say it 
better than my fellow nominees. I agree that diversity is 
important in its broadest sense. And I also agree the legal 
clerkships at the beginning, especially--really at any point in 
a nominee's career--are incredibly important. They were 
certainly important experiences for me and I would be carefully 
trying to pick the best people for those positions, recognizing 
their importance.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you very much. Mr. Chair, before I 
close, I just want to clarify that there's still an 
opportunity. The deadline for letters for the record, that are 
support for these nominees, is still open.
    Chair Durbin. Yes.
    Senator Padilla. So there's still time for Mr. Semper's mom 
to weigh in here----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Padilla [continuing]. If necessary. Thank you.
    Mr. Semper. I'll do some lobbying. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Judge Kasubhai, I think your fellow nominees owe you a debt 
of gratitude, because many Biden nominees have been extreme, 
but your record is so far out of the mainstream that you have 
attracted virtually all of the questions.
    I was particularly intrigued by your statement to Senator 
Blackburn that you said you are not, in fact, a Marxist. And 
then you said, and I wrote it down, ``I have not praised 
Marxist ideas.''
    Now, as you know, in law, there is the fact of evidence. 
And so let's go to something you wrote. An article that is 
entitled, ``Sensualized Property Theory,'' in which you wrote--
it begins, it's on the front page of your law school newspaper.
    You write, quote, ``Intimate knowing, the lovers kissed, 
familiar and ever exciting, passionate transcendence beyond the 
physical exhilaration lies a burning light in our limbs, our 
hearts. Floating, flying, falling in every direction, amorphous 
and wonderful, time stretching, space curving, exquisitely 
explosive eros, and yet, I timidly tremble every time.''
    Now, somehow, this is about property, which is not 
immediately evident as to why.
    But later, in the article, you write--you say, ``Property 
is not simply a relationship between an owner and an object of 
ownership. Property is primarily a complex relationship between 
people, and secondarily regards the objects people exploit.
    ``Historically, three paradigms have dominated European 
notions of property. Locke appealed to the notion that labor 
points to who has the right to exploit property. Bentham relied 
on utility to dictate who has rights based on how the property 
is exploited. And Marx was plainly disgusted with the 
alienation that property imposed, and its establishment of an 
`us' and `them,' and `haves' and `have-nots.'
    ``Each theory alone denies important components of human 
experience. Among them are the ability to work, the need for 
personal privacy and boundaries, and uniquely diverse desires, 
which spin us all in differing life directions. However, the 
process toward integrating all three may provide a framework 
for relationships that enhances each unique self. The 
aspiration toward intimate knowing, the intimate knowing of 
oneself and others is a creative struggle toward redefining 
property.''
    What the hell does that mean?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, when I was preparing and reviewing 
my materials for this hearing and for the process, I also have 
to admit that that writing was far from clear or articulate, 
and the poetry was definitely not good. Now, Senator, I don't 
make----
    Senator Cruz. Do you believe we need to have a creative 
struggle toward redefining property, which is what you were 
advocating for?
    Judge Kasubhai. You know, that was something that I wrote 
30 years ago, Senator. And in the course of just, you know, 
exploring law school and the ideas that came with----
    Senator Cruz. Okay. So your flirtations with Marxism were 
30 years ago. So let's go more recent.
    In 2020, you gave a speech entitled, ``Reflections on 
Equity and Privilege,'' and you said, quote, ``First, the world 
is wide enough for all of us. Privilege derives its power from 
the belief in scarcity: scarcity of money, natural resources, 
food, and power itself. The desire to control it all drives 
privilege. I want to suggest to you that equity, the idea of 
equity, rejects this model of scarcity.''
    Now, that's Marxism in 2020. What did that mean?
    Judge Kasubhai. I've never considered that to be Marxist, 
Senator. It's the idea that equal access, and in the context of 
the work that I do here----
    Senator Cruz. So, there is no scarcity. There are no 
property rights. Equity gives everyone an entitlement to each 
other's property. Is that right?
    Judge Kasubhai. Not at all. And in the context of the work 
that I do on the bench, Senator, when you look at my record for 
all of these 16 years, you'll find that I have upheld the 
Constitution and our case precedent.
    Senator Cruz. Okay. Well, let's turn to something else you 
wrote in the Wisconsin Women's Law Journal--again, this is your 
writing. The name of the article is ``Destabilizing Power in 
Rape: Why Consent Theory in Rape Law Is Turned on its Head.'' 
You cited Professor Catharine MacKinnon, who argued, quote, 
``sexuality itself is a power web in which heterosexual 
relations, per se, are infused with violence and control.'' 
And, quote, ``Most intercourse is rape.''
    Now, her views are extreme. And yet--and when Senator 
Blackburn asked you about them here at the hearing, when you 
want to be confirmed, you try to distance yourself from them.
    But here's what you wrote in the article. You embrace those 
views. You wrote, quote, ``I employ the view that `rape is sex' 
in order to focus on the significance of consent in rape law. 
The sex act is a violation, per se, without consent. In order 
to properly align the consent doctrine in rape law with consent 
in other areas of the law, non-consent must be presumed.''
    Do you believe that is a mainstream view that--that 
heterosexual sex is rape?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, in that article, I was exploring 
different ideas and theories, and I was employing the 
hypothetical that you've just described to try to tease out a 
particular issue with respect to consent. With respect to your 
last question----
    Senator Cruz. So, you also quoted Professor MacKinnon, who 
wrote, quote, ``sexuality is to feminism, what work is to 
Marxism.''
    Let me ask you again, what does that mean?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator, I was summarizing different 
theories that people were presenting, so that way I could 
explain them and then employ an analysis with respect to the 
issue of what consent was, in the context of sexual assault 
back in, 30 years ago.
    Senator Cruz. I think your views are far, far out of the 
mainstream.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Welch.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. I'm going to ask Judge 
Park, you're the--I'm a public defender. I think I'm the only 
one in the Senate, and I've been delighted at the number of 
public defenders who've been nominated. And our Constitution, 
of course, provides for the right of us, all, as advocate for 
everyone charged with a crime, because it is about the process, 
not the individual.
    I just want to ask you if you agree, and I'm sure you do, 
about the necessity for zealous advocacy from the defense, as 
well as from the prosecutors. And if so, why?
    Judge Park. It is necessary in order to have a fair and 
just criminal----
    Senator Welch. Is your microphone on?
    Judge Park. It's necessary in order to have a fair and just 
criminal system that there be zealous representation on both 
sides of the aisle. Not only does our Constitution require it, 
but the caselaw requires it. It requires that Federal public 
defenders be effective, and----
    Senator Welch. Right. And that's the 1938 Supreme Court 
case, Johnson v. Zerbst, then the 1963 Supreme Court case 
Gideon v. Wainwright held that--that the Constitution requires 
appointment of counsel. Can you tell me whether, in your 
experience, we're living up to meeting that constitutional 
requirement?
    Judge Park. The Federal Public Defender's Office that I 
worked at certainly did. There was time when I was there, the 
Federal public defender made sure to train the attorneys to be 
able to do our job and to do it zealously within the bounds of 
the law. And at that Office, when I was there, I also 
participated in training other attorneys to do just that.
    Senator Welch. That's great. And my understanding, 
according to statistics, that 9 out of 10 defendants in Federal 
court, U.S. district court, have appointed counsel.
    Judge Park. I would believe that that number may be 
accurate, yes.
    Senator Welch. Well, that's why I'm definitely hoping, as 
I've said before, that we maintain the budget--we don't cut it 
for the Federal Defenders. Thank you.
    Judge Park. Thank you.
    Senator Welch. Judge Kasubhai, you know, my colleagues on 
the Republican side are asking about some of your writing and 
what you mean, and whether it's clear or it isn't, whether it's 
prose or poetry.
    But I have a lot of respect for the academic inquiry into 
issues, like, what is property? How does it affect 
relationships? That's a normal area of legal inquiry, is it 
not? Whether people agree or not with what a particular writer 
says?
    Judge Kasubhai. Senator Welch, I agree. In order for me to 
love the law and love our country, you know, looking at things 
in a critical way, just simply substantiates why our country 
and our democracy is as great as it is.
    Senator Welch. Right. But then, when you are in your role 
as an academic where it's open inquiry, which is different than 
your role as a judge, which is confined by the boundaries of 
the law--and I heard in one of your earlier answers, your 
description of the process you go through, reading the briefs, 
testing them, and the hypothesis.
    Can you just explain that and what you would be doing in 
your role as a judge as opposed to in your role as a, I would 
say, academic?
    Judge Kasubhai. It is a profound obligation and duty to 
uphold the rule of law, end-stopped.
    And in the course of the work that I do under the oath that 
I've taken as a magistrate judge in the District of Oregon, is 
to rigorously evaluate the law. If it's a jury trial, ensure 
that the rules of evidence are applied so the record can be 
complete and without question, and then to apply those facts to 
the law as necessary.
    Senator Welch. Thank you. You know, the question of 
diversity came up and everyone of you answered that you're in 
favor of diversity. But I know among some of my colleagues, 
there's apprehension that diversity means special treatment. 
And I just want each of you to have an opportunity to say 
that--to indicate whether, if you have a defendant, diversity 
is going to determine or affect your decision about what the 
law says or requires. Any--yes.
    Judge Kasubhai. No.
    Judge Kazen. No, Senator.
    Judge Park. No, Senator.
    Mr. Semper. No, Senator.
    Senator Welch. Okay.
    Mr. Smith. No, Senator.
    Senator Welch. All right. Thank you very much. And 
congratulations on your nominations. I yield back, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Welch. And I'll just make 
a couple observations. Judge Kasubhai, 16 years on the bench, 
is that right?
    Judge Kasubhai. Sixteen years on the bench and 4 additional 
years as a neutral appellate adjudicator.
    Chair Durbin. Did you ever write an opinion during that 
period of time?
    Judge Kasubhai. On the bench, no. As a neutral adjudicator 
on the Workers' Compensation Board, I was involved in panel 
decision-making and opinions that have been issued.
    Chair Durbin. When it came down to the cases that you 
considered as a State judge and a Federal magistrate, there is 
a written record.
    Judge Kasubhai. Yes, and you're right. State court, and as 
a magistrate judge, my written opinions, well over 400 of them, 
are clear for the record.
    Chair Durbin. And isn't it interesting today that when we 
considered your life's work and whether you're prepared for the 
Federal bench, the only reference made was to a case, 
Boudjerada----
    Judge Kasubhai. Boudjerada.
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Which you, I suppose, issued an 
opinion as a magistrate, which was accepted by the district 
court?
    Judge Kasubhai. Correct.
    Chair Durbin. So the only opinion, out of the hundreds that 
you have written, that higher courts said you were right on, 
your view of the law, the First Amendment and such, was 
appropriate--but they've gone back.
    If I could give counsel to any law school class, I'd say to 
them, ``If you ever aspire to be a Federal judge, hold some of 
those wild thoughts in your mind and don't sit--don't write 
them down so that some Senator 30 years from now can read them 
back to you.''
    Judge Kasubhai. Especially poetry.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. Yes. Well, your poetry has been fed back to 
you today.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. And I'll just say that they didn't spend much 
time, in fact, literally no time, on written opinions involving 
the law and the facts, and went after your poetry. So don't be 
discouraged. Poetry's still very important.
    Well, it turns out that we have questions for the record--
will be due to the nominees by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, October 
11th.
    The record will likewise remain open to that time to submit 
letters and similar materials.
    The hearing is going to stand adjourned with gratitude to 
the nominees, their families, and friends.
    [Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
    [Additional material submitted for the record follows.]
