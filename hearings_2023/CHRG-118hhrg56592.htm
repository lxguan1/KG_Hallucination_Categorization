  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF DUNCAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
           CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    And I want to thank you all for being here today for this 
oversight hearing with the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission. I appreciate all four Commissioners being here, and 
welcome to the committee.
    FERC is a critical agency that plays a significant role in 
ensuring Americans have access to affordable, reliable supplies 
of energy. First, I'd like to commend Chairman Phillips for 
resetting the priorities of the Commission to focus on 
affordability and reliability. You have moved forward some 
critical natural gas projects and are vocal about the negative 
effects of high energy prices on consumers and our 
constituents. The committee appreciates your work in this 
regard.
    The Commission, however, needs to do more to ensure the 
affordability and reliability of our energy system. It can do 
this by adhering to its core statutes governing its authorities 
under the Natural Gas Act and the Federal Power Act. We are far 
from achieving the goals set forth in these core statutes. The 
past 2 years under the Biden administration has severely 
weakened our energy security. Prices have skyrocketed and 
reliability has degraded. American consumers are paying more 
for less energy.
    I urge the Commission to return to its core mission to 
provide for the orderly development of supplies of electricity 
and natural gas at just and reasonable rates. This must be the 
Commission's primary focus. Too many on the left want the 
Commission to become an environmental regulator. The 
Commission's primary authority is as an economic regulator. The 
energy industry and the American people rely on timely issuance 
of orders from FERC to help develop our energy infrastructure 
to the benefit of secure and affordable American energy.
    Just last week, the Subcommittee on Environment, 
Manufacturing, and Critical Minerals held a hearing on the 
negative effects of the EPA's rule regulating the electric 
generation sector will have an affordability and reliability. 
The Commission must do more to resist such regulations that run 
contrary to its core mission.
    Electrical reliability has significantly degraded over the 
past few years. Blackouts and energy rationing are now 
commonplace in the wholesale electricity markets like 
California and Texas. The Nation's largest grid operator, the 
PJM Interconnection, issued a dire warning earlier this year 
that it may face significant capacity shortfalls because of, in 
large part, rules like the EPA has proposed. The Northern 
American Electric Reliability Corporation, NERC, also issued a 
stark warning last month that the vast majority of the country 
faces potential for insufficient operating reserves and above-
normal demand conditions.
    This is not happening by accident. It is not happening 
solely because of extreme weather or a lack of sufficient 
interregional transmission capacity. It is largely happening 
because too much dispatchable firm generation has retired from 
the bulk power system. These retirements are caused by 
unrealistic environmental policies like the EPA regulations and 
private-sector environmental, social, and governance goals as 
well as market frameworks that do not properly value firm 
generation. Addressing this is a top priority for this 
subcommittee, and it should be for the Commission as well.
    In February of last year under different leadership, the 
Commission issued two natural gas policy statements that had a 
chilling effect on private investment and natural gas 
infrastructure. It should come as no surprise that, according 
to the Energy Information Administration, in 2022 we added the 
least amount of interstate natural gas pipeline capacity on 
record since the EIA began tracking that metric. The Commission 
must withdraw these policy statements to grant certainty of the 
natural gas infrastructure developers.
    I would like to commend the Commission for undertaking a 
proceeding to modernize wholesale electric market design. FERC 
has encouraged the development of such markets for over two 
decades. The bulk power system has changed drastically since, 
and FERC must do more to ensure that these markets work for the 
American consumer. I encourage the Commission to take a serious 
look at how these markets have affected the development of 
natural gas-fired generation and nuclear generation. These two 
resources are critical to ensuring the reliability and 
affordability of our energy system.
    We have seen too much of this firm baseload generation 
prematurely retire from the grid over the past decade. FERC has 
the authority to act and ensure resources like these are 
appropriately compensated for the service they provide to the 
grid. So I urge the Commission to do just that, and I want to 
thank Chair Rodgers for allowing us to have this FERC oversight 
hearing. I look forward to the conversation today from each 
Commissioner and the Members here.

    Mr. Duncan. And with that, I will yield to the ranking 
member for her opening statement.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DeGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO

    Ms. DeGette. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    First, I would like to take a moment of personal privilege 
and congratulate the world champion Denver Nuggets. As a--I see 
some of my constituents in the audience cheering. But as a 
fourth-generation Denverite, we have been waiting a long, long 
time for this victory.
    I also--now turning to serious business, I want to thank 
you, Chairman Duncan, and you--and to the other Commissioners 
for being here today. The work that FERC does each and every 
day is really important to our overall energy system.
    It is the body responsible for overseeing the flow and 
transmission of oil, gas, and electricity across State lines. 
It is the body charged with greenlighting new pipelines, 
hydropower projects, and LNG terminals throughout the country. 
It is the agency that can bring our Nation's energy system into 
the 21st century, help lead our clean energy transition, and 
take on the climate crisis head on, all the while ensuring that 
Americans maintain access to the affordable, reliable 
electricity that they need. And that is why FERC is so 
important. And, Mr. Chairman, I am glad that we are having this 
hearing today.
    As our Nation's demand for energy increases in the coming 
decades, as is expected to do, so must our ability to transmit 
that energy efficiently and effectively across the country. 
Since the transmission of energy is one of the most important 
facets of our Nation's overall energy system, one of the most 
important things that FERC can do right now is to help us 
modernize the grid to facilitate the deployment of transmission 
lines as needed throughout the United States. And everybody 
here knows that.
    FERC has done the work, the research, the studies, and 
analysis. You know the regional and interregional issues that 
have to be addressed to increase our transmission capabilities 
as we make the clean energy transmission--transition. And that 
is why FERC is already taking the steps to address several 
much-needed transmission reforms that are necessary to ensure 
that all Americans continue to have access to the reliable 
electricity they need.
    It is working to create a long-term regional transportation 
planning process. It is implementing new backstop transmission 
siting reforms included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. 
And it is working to reform the interconnection process to help 
get electricity generation projects online faster and to ensure 
that financed and shovel-ready projects are no longer allowed 
to languish. And I applaud FERC for these efforts. I urge the 
speedy completion of all of the rulemaking efforts.
    But let me be clear about one other thing: The 
interregional transfer capacity--capability study that was 
required by the debt limit deal 2 weeks ago in no way prohibits 
FERC from completing any of these rules. It is not a stop to 
any of these rules or from working on interregional 
transmission or minimum transfer capabilities.
    And so delaying any potential actions by FERC or NERC was 
not the congressional intent of that study and is not the 
congressional intent of that study and should not be construed 
as such. The timelines as laid out in the debt limit deal are 
maximums, not minimums, and I hope that we get some information 
from that study, but it should not be a block to the efforts 
that we need to do to expanded transmissibility.
    I am going to encourage both FERC and NERC to comply with 
the requirements under the law in an expeditious manner, 
because if we as a nation are going to be successful in making 
the transition to clean energy, the work that FERC is doing to 
utilize grid-enhancing technologies like dynamic line ratings 
is more important than ever. We must build out our transmission 
capability in this country, and we need to take steps now to 
modernize our grid to get more electricity out of our existing 
infrastructure.
    I would encourage the Commission to continue advancing 
these important technologies. And I want to encourage it to do 
so in a way that addresses environmental justice. It is no 
secret that our energy system and the pollution it creates 
disproportionately impact low-income and disadvantaged 
communities. As we continue to develop energy infrastructure, 
we must do so in a way that fully incorporates the voice of 
those directly impacted by energy infrastructure and its 
pollution.
    Just last week, Ranking Member Pallone and I sent a letter 
to Chair Phillips urging FERC to incorporate environmental 
justice into its decision-making process. Let's bring our 
energy grid into the 21st century, and let's make sure we are 
doing so in a way that doesn't ignore the most vulnerable among 
us.
    So, again, I want to thank everybody, and particularly all 
the Commissioners, for being here, and I yield back.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. DeGette follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentlelady, and I will now--it is 
my honor to recognize the Chair of the full Committee on Energy 
and Commerce, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, for 5 minutes for an 
opening statement.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Chairman Duncan, and thank you, 
Chairman Phillips and the Commissioners from FERC, for being 
here today. This is a very important hearing, and FERC has a 
very important role to play to ensure affordable and reliable 
energy for America's economic and national security. I look 
forward to hearing from each of you today as we examine FERC's 
mission, its authorities under the Federal Power Act, the 
Natural Gas Act, and other statutes passed by Congress, and its 
performances over the past year.
    As Chairman Duncan said, energy reliability and 
affordability are two of the top pillars of your 
congressionally mandated mission. I believe that you have done 
a good job on steps to reset the priorities of FERC, but more 
is needed. Through its authorities to regulate energy, natural 
gas, and electricity, FERC touches 7 percent of our economy. 
Without affordable and reliable energy, our economic and 
national security are at risk.
    We have witnessed this over the past 2 years through 
President Biden's damaging energy policies. Recent energy 
blackouts and rationing as well as increased prices have harmed 
American families and our industrial base, and we cannot allow 
this to continue. FERC plays an important role in ensuring 
energy costs are affordable for people. And that is why the 
Commission must return to its core mission of facilitating the 
delivery of abundant, affordable energy resources like natural 
gas and electricity to Americans.
    FERC must resist calls by the radical left to circumvent 
the Commission's mandated priorities. These calls have upended 
the Nation's energy sector. E&C Republicans have sent several 
letters highlighting our concerns with FERC's current 
environmental overreach in the recent proposed rulemaking 
implementing its electric transmission siting authorities. We 
have inquired as to how FERC plans to implement the latest 
guidance from the Council on Environmental Quality, CEQ, which, 
if implemented, would significantly shift FERC's mission as an 
economic relater--regulator to an environmental regulator.
    FERC should be working to ensure that reliable, 
dispatchable supplies of energy are properly valued in 
wholesale electricity markets, issue timely decisions on 
interstate and natural gas facilities and liquefied natural gas 
terminals, and grant certainty to hydroelectric power and 
electric transmission developers. If FERC sticks to these core 
functions, energy prices will decrease and reliability will 
improve.
    Last week we heard from expert witnesses regarding how the 
Biden administration's new EPA regulations will weaken and harm 
our electric power sector, especially coal- and natural-gas-
fired generators. This new suite of environmental red tape 
comes despite significant energy cap--capacity shortfalls 
across the country. Nearly every grid operator across the 
country has warned it is facing an energy adequacy crisis which 
will continue into the near future. We can reverse this trend 
if we commit to energy expansion.
    Chairman Phillips, at a recent conference you noted that 
``building things like new energy infrastructure is something 
we can--we are all in agreement on.'' I could not agree more. 
And we are committed to building more nuclear, more natural gas 
pipelines, more wind, more electric--hydroelectric power.
    America's electrical grid keeps our hospitals, military 
bases, homes, and businesses powered. Its security and 
reliability are critical to keeping people safe and our economy 
moving. An American energy expansion will lead to a more 
reliable grid and reverse the reliability crisis that currently 
looms over our energy sector.
    In addition, FERC also has significant authority to license 
and permit hydropower infrastructure. Waterpower is vital for a 
secure, affordable energy future. It has been critical for grid 
reliability and economic development in my home State of 
Washington.
    Just yesterday, I introduced a hydropower licensing reform 
bill which includes significant reforms to the burdensome 
hydropower licensing process, which currently takes a 
considerable amount of time and investment. A recent DOE report 
found that it takes on average 5 years to obtain the original 
license, 7.6 years for relicensing, and some complex projects 
can take more than a decade. These timelines are unacceptable.
    America has been blessed with an abundance of natural 
resources, and we are the best stewards of them. It is critical 
that we foster these resources so Americans have access to 
reliable, affordable clean energy. It powers our way of life. 
It is foundational for human prosperity and flourishing.
    So welcome again to FERC, the Chairman, the Commissioners. 
I thank you for being here, and I look forward to your 
testimony.

    Mr. Duncan. I thank The Chair, and I will now recognize the 
ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 
minutes.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE 
            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank each of 
the Commissioners for being here today and for their important 
work at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
    It is unfortunate that the Commission only has four 
Commissioners right now. I believe FERC is at its best when it 
has a full complement of five Commissioners, and I was 
disappointed that the Senate was unable to confirm former Chair 
Richard Glick to another term on the Commission last year. I 
urge the White House to nominate a fifth Commissioner and for 
the Senate to confirm that nominee as soon as possible.
    FERC's work is vital in ensuring that every American has 
access to reliable and affordable energy. The Commission's 
activities also have an outsized impact in the communities that 
play host to natural gas pipelines it authorizes and hydropower 
dams that it licenses. In particular, natural gas pipeline 
projects impact both the local environments that they run 
through and the national environment with the greenhouse gas 
emissions that they emit.
    And that is why Ranking Member DeGette and I wrote to 
Chairman Phillips last week, as she mentioned, urging that FERC 
incorporate environmental justice principles into its decision 
making. Under the leadership of Chairman Phillips and former 
Chairman Glick, the Commission has already taken a number of 
vital steps on environmental justice, and the Commission has 
issued its first-ever equity action plan and finally 
established its Office of Public Participation, something I 
have long advocated. And these are important first steps, but 
additional action is necessary.
    Last year, FERC issued two important policy statements that 
would guide its authorizations of natural gas projects. The 
first statement would have created a new framework to help 
guide the Commission in determining whether or not a project is 
in the public convenience as required by the Natural Gas Act, 
and the second would have clarified how FERC access--or 
assesses the impacts of greenhouse gasses emitted as a result 
of a potential natural gas pipeline. And I was pleased by both 
of these policy statements but was disappointed when they were 
downgraded to draft status a year ago and that the Commission 
has yet to return to them.
    Now, I want to be clear: FERC must consider environmental 
justice factors when making its public convenience 
determinations under the Natural Gas Act. Furthermore, 
greenhouse gas emissions and, critically, the consequences from 
these emissions are absolutely reasonably foreseeable 
environmental effects under the National Environmental Policy 
Act. The DC Circuit made this clear 2 years ago in its decision 
in Vecinos v. FERC.
    Now, downgrading the policy statements to draft status does 
nothing to relieve FERC of its obligations under the Natural 
Gas Act or NEPA. However, the policy statements did offer much-
needed clarity on how the Commission would consider those 
issues, clarity that has now been stripped away, leaving 
communities and industry in the dark. So I urge all of you to 
act on finalizing the two policy statements as soon as 
possible.
    Now, turning to electricity markets, it has been roughly 25 
years since FERC issued Order 888 to bring competition to 
electricity markets across the country. And I was skeptical at 
first, but the developments of the last 25 years have made 
clear that power markets have promoted competition that has 
lowered prices and made the grid cleaner, all while ensuring a 
reliable bulk power sector. So to be sure, there are issues, 
especially at PJM, the electricity market that covers my State 
and several other mid-Atlantic States, but in looking at 
reforms to keep these markets viable and reliable, we should 
not throw out the progress we have made in lowering costs for 
consumers. A competitive electricity market has typically been 
a bipartisan issue in Congress and at FERC, and I hope that 
that continues.
    And, finally, I want to briefly address the three key 
proposed rulemakings on transmission that are outstanding at 
FERC. These rulemakings will be vital to electricity 
reliability over the next decade as we work to move clean 
energy generation from sunny and windy areas to population 
centers, and I urge FERC to finalize strong versions of all 
three rules promptly.
    Today we are going to hear about the reliability challenges 
our Nation is facing, largely caused by extreme weather events 
fueled by the worsening climate crisis. But if we want to be 
serious about addressing reliability issues, then we should be 
serious about having a more interconnected grid. This will 
ensure that different parts of the country not in a crisis at a 
given time can help by sending power to regions that are 
struggling. An interconnected grid will result in better 
reliability, increased affordability, and access to cleaner 
electricity.
    So that is an across-the-board win for Americans, and I 
expect that FERC will do its part to ensure that our Nation's 
grids are sufficiently connected.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Pallone follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Pallone. And with that, I look forward to this hearing 
and yield back, Mr. Chairman, the balance of my time. Thank 
you.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. We now conclude with 
the Member opening statements. The Chair would like to remind 
Members that, pursuant to the committee rules, all Members' 
opening statements will be made part of the record.
    And so now we will go to the FERC Commissioners, and we 
want to thank all of them for being here today and taking time 
to testify before the subcommittee. Each witness will have the 
opportunity to give a 5-minute opening statement followed by a 
round of questions from the Members. There's lights in front of 
you. If it goes to yellow, that means about time to wrap up. 
Red means conclude.
    And our witnesses today are Chairman Willie Phillips, 
Commissioner--he is the Chairman of the FERC--Commissioner 
James Danly, Commissioner Allison Clements, and Commissioner 
Mark Christie.
    Mr. Chairman, we appreciate you being here today. We will 
now recognize Chairman Phillips for 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.

 STATEMENTS OF WILLIE PHILLIPS, CHAIRMAN, AND JAMES P. DANLY, 
ALLISON CLEMENTS, AND MARK C. CHRISTIE, COMMISSIONERS, FEDERAL 
                     REGULATORY COMMISSION

                  STATEMENT OF WILLIE PHILLIPS

    Mr. Phillips. Chairman Duncan, Ranking Member DeGette, 
Chair Rodgers, and Ranking Member Pallone, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for inviting us to testify here today 
about the important work that we do on behalf of the American 
people.
    The Commission's jurisdiction is broad. Pursuant to the 
FPA, the NGA, and the ICA, and other statutes, it is our 
responsibility to ensure that rates for the wholesale sale and 
transmission of electricity as well as the transportation of 
oil and natural gas by pipeline are just and reasonable. In 
addition, we are responsible for ensuring that the Nation's 
bulk power system remains reliable. And last, but by no means 
least, we are also responsible for siting vital energy 
infrastructure, including natural gas pipelines as well as LNG, 
hydro, and electric transmission facilities.
    By exercising these authorities in a prudent and 
responsible manner, the Commission can help ensure that our 
country produces energy that is reliable, affordable, and 
sustainable.
    Earlier this year, President Biden designated me as 
Chairman of the Commission, and it is an honor to appear before 
you the first time in that capacity. In January, at my first 
open meeting, I laid out three principal priorities. They were 
reliability, transmission reform, and environmental justice. I 
am happy to report that in just a few months we have made 
significant progress on all three fronts.
    I will begin with reliability because it is and always must 
be job number one. We face unprecedented challenges to the 
reliability of our Nation's electric system. Foreign and 
domestic actors are testing our cyber defenses every day. 
Physical threats to the grid are on the rise, and extreme 
weather of all kinds are threatening power to customers across 
the country.
    That is why under my leadership the Commission has taken at 
least one major action to promote reliability every month since 
I became Chairman. The Commission has directed NERC to develop 
enhanced cybersecurity standards regarding internal network 
security protocols. We approved enhancements to a series of 
winter preparedness measures. We established incentives to 
reward cybersecurity investments. And just last month we issued 
an order focused on inverter-based resources, or IBRs. These 
actions represent the blocking and tackling that is absolutely 
necessary to ensure that our electric grid remains secure, 
reliable, and resilient.
    My second priority, electric transmission reform, is itself 
a reliability imperative. Transmission plays a critical role in 
ensuring the electric system remains reliable while also 
facilitating the interconnection of new resources. And 
transmission enables us to further increase our energy security 
and strengthen our Nation's grid.
    To those ends, we are working as quickly as possible on a 
number of important rulemakings. First, my highest priority in 
the near term is interconnection queue reform. We are also 
working to finalize regional transmission planning and cost 
allocation, and we are working to finalize our new backstop 
siting authority. It is my hope that collectively these 
measures will represent the Commission's most significant 
action to promote the development of needed electric 
transmission in at least a generation.
    My third priority is environmental justice, and this one is 
personal. I grew up in an environmental justice community in 
Alabama. I know well the significant impact that these heavy 
industrial communities face. But I have also seen the benefits 
that investment can provide to historically underserved 
communities in the form of jobs, tax revenue, and community 
benefits. Having seen both sides, it is my goal as Chairman to 
do all that we reasonably can to ensure that environmental 
justice communities do not bear too great a share of the 
burdens or too small a share of the benefits that new energy 
infrastructure can provide.
    Here too we have made strides. In March, we hired a new 
senior counsel for environmental justice and equity, and later 
that month we held the first-ever roundtable on environmental 
justice and equity in infrastructure permitting.
    And finally on that point, I would be remiss not to mention 
the significant strides we have made with respect to 
permitting. Our country urgently needs energy infrastructure of 
all kinds. As Russia's war in Ukraine has made clear, energy 
infrastructure is essential to any country's national security. 
What we as a nation must do is make sure that we bring abundant 
energy resources online and deliver it to our customers. I am 
proud of the steps that we have taken to streamline our 
permitting processes.
    I thank you again for the opportunity to be here, and I 
look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Phillips follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will now recognize 
Commissioner Danly for 5 minutes.

                  STATEMENT OF JAMES P. DANLY

    Mr. Danly. Chairman Duncan, Ranking Member DeGette, members 
of the subcommittee, it is a pleasure to be here.
    So the United States is heading towards a reliability 
crisis in our electric markets. This reliability crisis is 
being driven by two primary factors. The first is the effective 
subsidies, and the second is the Commission's let's call it 
abandonment of its longstanding commitment to rule of law.
    The subsidies that are both State and Federal have the 
effect of skewing market prices. The purpose of these markets 
is to ensure the least cost dispatch of the generation 
available to make sure that the rates are as low as possible 
within the physical constraints of the electric system and to 
send the price signals necessary to incentivize the investment 
to ensure that there is adequate capacity to serve load over 
the long haul. When you have the number and quantity of 
subsidies that we currently have available, the generators of 
certain types, specifically for intermittent wind and solar 
primarily, those price signals get warped.
    When FERC abandons its, as I said, longstanding commitment 
to the rule of law, primarily removing the guardrails for 
ensuring that price formation can happen absent the effects of 
the price-warping effects of those subsidies, we find that 
there is no ability to accurately price new entry to the 
market, and it--and the markets fail to retain the needed 
existing generation that have the attributes necessary to keep 
the system stable.
    So--and this, as I say, has been partially FERC's fault 
because we have approved various orders like that, getting rid 
of the minimum price rule which ensured that generators 
actually had to bid in their actual costs. This is a problem 
because in the market areas, the old system of vertically 
integrated utilities in which a public utility commission and 
the State authorities would oversee the integrated resource 
plans that ensured that there was sufficient capacity, the 
right type to meet load. Those States have, for the most part, 
seeded resource adequacy as a duty to the markets, and if the 
market's price signals aren't correct, then that sole backstop 
to ensure that there is sufficient capacity is not going to 
function as intended.
    We have seen the effects of this. Our markets have been 
warning us now for years. In the case of PJM, very recently 
they have raised the hue and cry. And to give you a clear 
indication of how we know that the markets are failing to send 
correct price signals despite the fact that PJM is right now 
warning us that there is an impending shortfall of capacity, in 
the last capacity auction, prices went down. So anybody who 
understands basic economics knows that in times of scarcity, 
prices are supposed to rise.
    There has been a--there has been this move afoot in which 
the markets have become something closer to a mechanism by 
which to harvest these subsidies rather than what they were 
intended to do, which is ensure least cost dispatch of 
available resources and to incentivize new investment. And the 
largest barrier at the moment to the harvesting of those 
subsidies is the physical interconnection of what are typically 
remotely located resources to the markets. You can't get, for 
example, the production tax credit if you aren't connected to a 
market and you don't sell.
    And so there has been this concomitant effort to either 
mandate or speed the development of transmission specifically 
for the purpose of ensuring that, let's say, the asset managers 
that have ownership stakes in these renewable resources that 
are being developed have access to their revenue stream through 
building the transmission to get access to the market so that 
they can then get the subsidies.
    The--it would be a shame if we removed and socialized the 
cost of the development of this transmission because, at the 
moment, at any rate, the cost of interconnecting to the 
electric system is one of the few disciplining factors 
remaining in the development of infrastructure. And at the 
moment, what's happening is we are sending price signals in 
which renewables bid into the capacity markets at a price of 
zero, sending the message that electricity costs zero, which, 
of course, it doesn't. And if we then socialize the cost of the 
transmission to get those resources connected to the bulk 
electric system, then we are going to send a further signal 
that the transmission costs less than it actually does.
    If we are going to set up an electric system in which the 
success or failure of a generation asset relies not upon the 
efficiency with which it is run or the cost of the fuel, let's 
say, that powers it but instead the availability of subsidies, 
then one questions whether or not we need to have markets at 
all since the markets' very premise is being undermined by all 
of these let's call them adjacent public policies.
    I would urge everybody when having these discussions about 
transmission and about reform of permitting to understand that 
the question of cost allocation for transmission and the 
question of permitting reform are completely separate and 
distinct. Permitting reform has to do with the mechanisms by 
which government makes decisions for whether or not a project 
that is proposed gets approval and the means by which that 
approval occurs. Cost allocation is something completely 
different. That has to do with who bears the cost of a 
particular asset that is being developed over the period of its 
useful life.
    So I see--I apologize, I ran over time there. Those are the 
main issues I want to press upon the subcommittee's attention 
and understand that we are headed for--toward resource adequacy 
failure in the near future. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Danly follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you. I will now go to Commissioner 
Clements for 5 minutes.

                 STATEMENT OF ALLISON CLEMENTS

    Ms. Clements. Chairman Duncan, Ranking Member DeGette, and 
members of the committee, thank you for having us here this 
morning.
    Our energy system has always been the backbone of the U.S. 
economy and continues to provide the basis for our Nation's 
global economic success and security. In the past decades, we 
have seen that system grow, change, develop to meet the needs 
and expectations of the American people and markets. And in 
this important moment, that system is again at a crossroad.
    We face new extreme weather challenges. We are also living 
with new geopolitical and economic realities: Russia's war in 
Ukraine, economywide inflation, and evolving cyber and physical 
threats to the grid. At FERC, as you all have mentioned, our 
plain responsibility is to work towards reliable and affordable 
energy for all Americans in the face of these challenges.
    Today I will take a moment to highlight some of the actions 
we have been taking to improve reliability and affordability. 
First, FERC has actively been responding to the changing needs 
of the grid in the face of extreme weather events. We must do 
all we can to avoid costly, devastating outages like those 
experienced during Winter Storm Uri and Winter Storm Elliott 
when Americans needed the system to work the most.
    Since Winter Storm Uri, FERC has made progress on several 
recommendations, including the issuance of new cold weather 
reliability standards to address one of the key issues that was 
experienced during the storms. I am also looking forward to an 
upcoming report from FERC staff about Winter Storm Elliott that 
may spur additional action.
    Second, FERC is taking a regional approach to these 
concerns. Later this week, we will be hosting a forum to 
examine reforms that are needed to PJM's wholesale markets. 
Next week, FERC will be hosting its second New England Winter 
Reliability Gas Electric Forum to address the threats the 
region may face over the next few winters and in the longer 
term.
    Third, FERC has been considering reforms that directly 
impact consumer costs, including at our cost management 
conference last year and in comments submitted in that docket. 
As we anticipate increasing levels of transmission investment 
in the next decade and beyond, which has required whatever kind 
of resources are hooking up to the grid if this country wants 
to maintain its place as an international superpower. It is 
important that somebody, FERC, is minding the store on behalf 
of consumers.
    Fourth, I want to highlight FERC's outstanding notices that 
some of you have mentioned on transmission proposed--excuse 
me--proposals on transmission and interconnection reform. A 
major regional transmission line can increase reliability and 
decrease customer cost in a whole host of ways. And it is 
equally important that new resources of any type are 
interconnected to the system in a timely and cost-efficient 
manner to reduce customer cost.
    These two bipartisan proposals that the Commission has put 
forth take important first steps to reduce customer cost and 
give them the most bang for their buck by optimizing our 
investments. Moreover, we are considering opportunities for 
establishing a minimum interregional transfer capability 
requirement and for encouraging the use of grid-enhancing 
technologies which can increase the efficiency of our existing 
system at modest cost. We continue to scrutinize rates for 
transmission and pipeline services, and we continue our 
critical work to assess the public need for and impacts of 
natural gas pipelines and LNG infrastructure.
    The work that FERC does is complex and challenging, and we 
rely on the participation of a broad variety of stakeholders. 
In particular, it is critical to engage early and effectively 
with frontline and fence-line environmental justice 
communities, both to minimize and avoid impacts on those 
communities when possible and also to avoid the time and risk 
with potential litigation challenging the Commission's 
decisions.
    I want to end with a note of praise for our new Office of 
Public Participation that Chairman Pallone mentioned. It has 
been a resource around the country by facilitating public 
involvement in our proceedings. Better participation leads to 
stronger decisions and more lasting outcomes. It remains my 
honor and privilege to serve the American people, and I am 
pleased to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Clements follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you. I will now recognize Commissioner 
Christie for 5 minutes.

                 STATEMENT OF MARK C. CHRISTIE

    Mr. Christie. Thank you, Chairman Duncan, Ranking Member 
DeGette, members of the subcommittee. I appreciate the 
opportunity to be here with my colleagues from FERC and speak 
to you.
    Your focus is reliability, and I am going to speak to 
reliability. I think we are heading for potentially very dire 
consequences, potentially catastrophic consequences, in the 
United States in terms of the reliability of our grid, and I 
think that the basic reason is we are facing a shortfall of 
power supply. You know, the term we use is resource adequacy, 
but what we are really talking about is potentially a shortfall 
in power supply.
    You have to remember about the grid, the grid has to have 
power being fed into it every second of every minute of every 
hour of every day to keep the lights on. It--you can't store it 
up and bring it out the next day. So because of that, you have 
to have a power supply that is feeding into the grid on a 
continuous basis. We can't tolerate shortages, because 
shortages means the lights go out.
    So what is going on now and what is the threat to 
reliability? In summary, what the threat is is this: We are 
facing cascading retirements of dispatchable resources, 
specifically coal and to a lesser extent gas. And the problem 
with losing that many dispatchable resources is you are losing 
the supply that is going to keep the lights on. And the problem 
is not the addition of wind and solar, really the problem is 
subtraction of coal and gas and other dispatchable resources, 
which are the ones that we need during this transition to keep 
the lights on. That is the fundamental problem.
    This is not just Mark Christie saying this. We have been 
warned repeatedly from NERC, the reliability experts for the 
country, that this is exactly what is going on. We are losing 
dispatchable resources at a pace that is unsustainable for 
keeping the lights on. NERC has been telling this--us this over 
and over and over.
    We are hearing it from the major RTOs: PJM, which is the 
largest RTO in terms of consumers serviced; MISO, which is the 
largest RTO in terms of geography, it covers the Midwest and 
parts of the Southeast. We just heard it last week from New 
York system operator, the New York ISO. All the same message: 
We are losing dispatchable resources at a pace that we can't 
keep the lights on if we continue to do this. And so that is 
the fundamental problem that we are facing that threatens 
reliability.
    So what are the two reason--I will give you two reasons why 
this is happening, because I always get asked why is this 
happening. Well, first of all, it is happening in both the RTOs 
and the non-RTOs. This is not a uniquely RTO problem. Now in 
the RTOs, it is a problem of market design. It is a problem in 
which the resources that are retiring--and a lot of them are 
retiring prematurely, and by prematurely what I mean is they 
have--these units have many years of useful life remaining that 
they are retiring. And it is a problem of market design in the 
RTOs. They are simply not getting the compensation that it 
takes to keep units open, keep units operating.
    In the non-RTOs, it is largely a problem of the IRPs of the 
utilities are taking these units out and retiring them 
prematurely. It is sort of a self-correcting problem in the 
non-RTO States because in the non-RTO States there are State 
regulators who are supposed to be looking at this and watching 
this and supervising these IRPs.
    The second reason we are seeing these premature 
retirements--and particularly we are talking gas. I'm going to 
focus on gas. Gas has become an increasingly more important 
dispatchable resource as we increase the percentage of wind and 
solar in the grid because wind and solar are intermittent, as 
everyone knows. And so you have to have, you know, a 
dispatchable backup, and gas has become the dispatchable 
resource of choice.
    But for gas to run, gas has to have supply. It has to have 
the supply of the fuel, and that takes transportation, and that 
means pipelines have to be built, and there's a lot of people 
that don't want to build pipelines. Pipelines are--there is a 
national legal campaign to try to keep pipelines from being 
built. But the only way you can have backup gas that provides 
the power when wind and solar are not generating is you have to 
have gas units that have sufficient supply. And just last 
winter in Winter Storm Elliott, at PJM we had a lot of gas 
units didn't run. One of the reason was a lot of them didn't 
have firm supply. They couldn't get the fuel. So that is the 
second big reason, I think.
    So as we move forward, I think this is a problem that is 
going to be become increasingly salient. I think that the 
warnings have been going on, we have been getting warnings from 
all the RTOs, from NERC. We have got to be aware of this. This 
problem is not just coming, I think it is already here, and it 
is coming here very quickly.
    And with that, I will be glad to answer any questions you 
have, and thank you again for the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Christie follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Well, I want to thank all of the Commissioners 
for your testimony. We will now go into the question-and-answer 
portion of the hearing, and I will begin the questioning and 
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    Commissioner Danly, in a recent dissent to a transmission 
planning and cost allocation proposed rulemaking, you noted 
that ``the majority of FERC seeks to establish policies 
designated--or designed rather--to encourage the massive 
transmission buildout that will doubtless be required to 
transition to an aspirational renewable future. To do so, they 
need to socialize the cost of this transmission across as broad 
a population of ratepayers as possible.''
    Do you believe that Congress requiring FERC to order the 
buildout of massive amounts of transmission connecting the 
different regions and integrate more renewable energy is 
consistent with the just and reasonable standard under the 
Federal Power Act?
    Mr. Danly. Thank you. The--if any action is taken pursuant 
to a congressional enactment, it is going to be for us to try 
to reconcile the two, because both have the force of law. The 
constraint for the socialization of transmission costs doesn't 
really come from the just and reasonable rate standard directly 
but rather the invariant case law that we have had for decades 
now. The original case was Illinois State Commerce Commission 
versus FERC, in which there has to be a commens--a roughly 
commensurate benefit to the amount paid. So most of the 
undertakings that FERC has now in its transmission planning in 
which it is attempting to socialize those costs will 
ultimately, I think, fail on appeal because they violate that 
case law that is basically unchanged for decades.
    To the extent to which, though, Congress changes that 
through an enactment, who is to say how that is going to shake 
out, but the sine qua non of just and reasonable rates now is 
that you cannot charge anybody for any benefit that they don't 
get, and that benefit has to be in some way articulable. Our 
recent transmission planning NOPR seemed to, by explained 
terms, expand that concept of benefits so broadly that it would 
include the public policy choices not only of other States but 
even other municipalities. That is not contemplated in the case 
law now, and I think it is not only bad policy, but it is 
illegal.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes. Thanks for that answer. I mean, if Iowa 
has surplus wind power and California wants it, the power lines 
to transmit that power are going to have to go across Colorado. 
Colorado won't pull any of the power off of that, why should 
Coloradoans pay for the cost of the transmission line they get 
no benefit from? So great answer, and I appreciate you sharing 
that.
    What about requiring ratepayers that do not benefit? We 
have covered that one, I am going to skip on.
    Chair Rodgers and I recently wrote a letter to each of you 
requesting the Commission to take a more active role in 
ensuring reliability in wholesale electricity markets. We have 
witnessed energy rationing and blackouts in many of these 
regions and others over the past few years. Two regions in 
particular are the California Independent System Operator and 
the Electric Reliability Council of Texas have experienced 
blackouts and energy rationing.
    So, Commissioner Danly, are such markets that experience 
blackouts just and reasonable for ratepayers?
    Mr. Danly. The--in a word, no. The market design requires 
ratepayers to pay money, and in return for that, they are 
supposed to get electricity and they are supposed to get it on 
a consistent basis. It has to be reliably delivered.
    In particular, if you take cases like, let's say, PJM or 
ISO New England in which they are actually capacity markets, 
there is a specific product that the ratepayer pays for, which 
is the capacity payment. And if you have a market that is 
incapable of delivering proper capacity outcomes, despite the 
fact the ratepayers are paying for it, I think that is an 
obvious case of an unjust and unreasonable rate.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you. As I noted in my opening statement, 
electric reliability across the country is deteriorating. The 
main reason for this is not a lack of transmission capacity or 
extreme weather, it is because we lack insufficient firm 
generation that can quickly respond to meet demand. And, 
Commissioner Clements and Commissioner Christie, thanks for 
recognizing that fact.
    I have a yes-or-no question for each of you, starting with 
you, Chairman Phillips. Has electric reliability worsened or 
improved over the past 3 years? Worsened or improved? Electric 
reliability, has it worsened or improved?
    Mr. Phillips. I think the response to your question is that 
we have seen a trend where electric reliability has worsened 
somewhat. We are beginning to change that trend under my 
leadership.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you. Chairman--Commissioner Danly?
    Mr. Danly. It has worsened.
    Mr. Duncan. Worsened. Commissioner Clements?
    Ms. Clements. I think it is a region-specific question. 
Given any time of year, it is a seasonal question. It is a 
question of extreme weather and what types of stressors hit our 
electricity system----
    Mr. Duncan. Worsened in some areas and improved in others. 
Thank you.
    Ms. Clements. Yes.
    Mr. Duncan. Commissioner Christie?
    Mr. Christie. I think it has generally worsened because we 
are losing the dispatchable resources that are necessary to 
keep the lights on.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes, that's perfect. Spot on. Dispatchable 
resources. Natural gas, natural gas infrastructure to get the 
resources produced in this country delivered to where it needs 
to be used, utilized by the utilities to improve the lives of 
electricity generation and for our constituents, and then 
potentially exported to improve the lives of people around the 
world.
    With that, I will go to the Ranking Member DeGette for 5 
minutes with the questions.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Phillips, one of the goals of FERC is, in fact, to 
improve and strengthen reliability, is that right?
    Mr. Phillips. That is right.
    Ms. DeGette. Now, in my opening statement I talked about 
the work that FERC is doing on transmission issues--and again, 
I want to say that this interregional transfer capability study 
that was required by the debt limit deal does not prohibit FERC 
from completing the outstanding transmission roles or any work 
on interregional transmission or minimum transfer capacity. So, 
Mr. Chairman, I want to ask you, do you believe that the 
interregional transfer capability study required by the debt 
limit deal prohibits FERC from advancing any transmission work 
while the study is pending?
    Mr. Phillips. The answer to that question is no. I believe 
that NERC is directed to do a study under the debt limit deal. 
We also have an ongoing proceeding at FERC where we have had a 
forum, we have had a technical conference, we have received 
comments. It is my belief that those two proceedings can move 
forward in parallel.
    Ms. DeGette. And do you think you could get information 
from this study that was required in the debt ceiling deal?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes. I believe it could very well be 
valuable. the information that NERC finds in its report. And 
what I would like to do is make sure that, if and when NERC 
completes its report, FERC is also ready to act on our 
proceeding so that we continue to move forward, NERC moves 
forward, and we can incorporate their findings in what we are 
doing.
    Ms. DeGette. But you are not going to delay in your 
proceeding based on this study?
    Mr. Phillips. I am not aware of any requirement that we 
wait for NERC to----
    Ms. DeGette. Is it your intention to wait?
    Mr. Phillips. It is not my intention to wait.
    Ms. DeGette. Commissioner Clements, I want to ask you if 
you can talk briefly about the importance of finalizing the 
strongest possible version of the rule along with the 
importance of getting the regional transmission planning and 
cost allocation right.
    Ms. Clements. Thank you. Finalizing a rule on interregional 
transfer capability is critical. We have seen that in real life 
through the experience in Winter Storm Uri when the mid-
Atlantic was able to help out to keep the lights on in the 
Midwest. The Midwest was able to keep the--help keep the lights 
on in the South. But the South couldn't help Texas keep the 
lights on because there was a lack of interregional transfer 
capability. The same thing happened to the Southeast during 
Winter Storm Elliott.
    And so absolutely, we need to move forward and finalize a 
strong interregional transfer capability rule. The good news is 
there has been broad consensus across the industry and across 
stakeholders that that is the case, and we are working on what 
kind of methodology might be appropriate.
    Ms. DeGette. And having a strong rule like that would go to 
what the Chairman was talking about, increasing the overall 
reliability of the grid.
    Ms. Clements. That is right. Every year--well, last year, 
EEI suggested that utilities spent $28 billion on transmission 
investment. Money is getting spent, so the question is, is it 
getting spent in the way that most cost-effectively protects 
customers, and that is what we need to be thinking about at 
FERC.
    Ms. DeGette. Now, Commissioner Clements, I wonder if you 
can talk for a minute about how FERC can better leverage grid-
enhancing technologies that can maximize the existing 
infrastructure.
    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Congresswoman. This is a really 
important question and something I spent a lot of time focusing 
on: Before we expose customers to the cost that Commissioner 
Danly has expressed concern about, how can we make lower-cost, 
modest investments on our existing grid to help squeeze more 
juice effectively out of the existing grid and bring more 
resources online without costly transmission investment? Grid-
enhancing technologies is our number-one tool, and we have put 
forward some proposals that I hope we will move forward with.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I--it is really 
persuasive to me when you talk about your own experience with 
growing up with environmental justice issues. And, of course, I 
told you when I met with you, we have an area in my district, 
an EJ area. So I'm wondering if you can briefly talk about the 
tangible steps that you plan to implement to advance 
environmental justice.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Congresswoman. We had the first-
ever--I mentioned this in my opening statement--roundtable on 
environmental justice and equity. What I am looking to do and 
we are working on right now is an outward-facing document that 
both frontline communities, utilities, stakeholders, everyone 
across the board can understand how we define environmental 
justice, what factors we are looking for as we consider 
projects going forward. This is something that I believe will 
be critical to help move forward, and not just have projects 
approved but to ultimately have them built.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you.
    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. I will now go to 
the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Griffith, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Griffith. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    It is really good to see all of you here today but 
particularly my friend Commissioner Christie. It has been a 
long time since you, me, others, including Terry Kilgore, used 
to have midnight dinner at the Third Street Diner in Richmond, 
Virginia, but it is good to see you here today.
    You talked about several things in your opening, including 
dispatchable resources. And while this is a great hearing for 
all of us to dig into the weeds, the folks watching back home 
who may be seeing it a couple days from now in the middle of 
the night may not know what that means. Can you define 
dispatchable resources for the folks back home?
    Mr. Christie. Yes. I remember being asleep most of those 
midnight dinners. But dispatchable resources are resources that 
are not weather dependent. You--they run all the time. Nuclear 
runs literally for months at a time without shutting down. Coal 
and gas can run all the time.
    Now, it doesn't mean they are not weather impacted. What we 
saw in Elliott--Winter Storm Elliott, we had a lot gas units 
that didn't perform because they were not winterized or they 
couldn't get firm supplies. So units can be certainly weather 
impacted, but a dispatchable unit is a unit that is not weather 
dependent to run. Obviously, wind and solar are weather 
dependent to run; that makes them intermittent. It doesn't mean 
they don't have a tremendous role. They certainly have no fuel 
cost, which is good.
    But we have to understand the characteristics of generating 
units, and when you are trying to keep the lights on--and 
again, you have to remember about the grid. The power that is 
coming out of these lights right now was generated nanoseconds 
ago. Power has to be generated and used within seconds, and so 
because of that, you have to have power sources feeding into 
the grid every single second of every minute, otherwise the 
lights go out. And dispatchable resources are great for that 
because they run for days, weeks, even months at a time without 
concern about what the weather forecast is going to be. So that 
is the difference.
    Mr. Griffith. And, obviously, knowing my end of the State, 
it is heavily reliant in many of the communities on the coal 
and natural gas industries, and it has just been somewhat 
bothersome to us that folks don't realize the intermittency of 
some of the renewables and that you have to have the pipelines 
and you have to have high-voltage power lines to wield that 
electricity from one part of the country to another.
    Can you go into a little bit about how long it is going to 
take to build the capacity even if we want to take wind or 
solar from an area where there is good weather to an area that 
weather may not be so good right then?
    Mr. Christie. Well, building generating capacity takes 
time, but the biggest problem we have right now is we are 
losing existing generating capacity that could be running, and 
it is shutting down, and it is shutting down prematurely, so we 
are losing assets that could be providing power right now.
    With regard to transmission, you know, you have to have 
transmission to move power from the supply source to the 
ultimate consumer, so transmission is absolutely essential. I 
would say on transmission, and based on 17 years as a--at the 
Virginia State Corporation Commission and doing transmission 
line cases, every case comes with its own unique set of facts, 
and what you are trying to do is--look, consumers are going to 
pay for transmission. Consumers are going to pay for it.
    So you want to make sure that the consumers who are going 
to be forced to pay for transmission are getting the best deal 
and are getting a line that serves their interest and not the 
interest of developers. It should be serving consumers, and it 
should be the--a solution to a reliability problem. And all 
these cases have unique sets of facts, and as a regulator, you 
sit down and determine is it needed, is it cost prudent. Those 
are the two biggest things you look at in a power line case.
    And if it is, and if it--and if you find yes on both, then 
it should be built, and that means they are extremely 
controversial. They go through--some of them go through a 
hundred miles, 200 miles, and you have to use eminent domain 
oftentimes. They become controversial.
    But once you have determined it is needed, then they 
absolutely must be built, no question about it.
    Mr. Griffith. Yes. And, you know, everybody wants to run 
from coal, and some folks want to run from natural gas, but 
they have been the most dispatchable--nuclear as well, but they 
have been the most dispatchable over time, and I don't see that 
changing. One of the things that I think we should do--and this 
is not your jurisdiction, I understand that--but we should be 
doing research to make the burning of the fossil fuels cleaner 
so that we can export it to the rest of the world. Do you have 
any thoughts on that?
    Mr. Christie. Well, I think the carbon capture is a tech--
and I am not a--I am getting off on here, but it would be 
wonderful if carbon capture technology could be mature to where 
you could run coal- or gas-generating units with carbon capture 
and actually remove all the carbon and have that benefit. I 
don't think the technology is anywhere near being mature yet, 
but time will tell.
    Mr. Griffith. Time will tell. And I think we are a lot 
closer than you might realize, but we need to put some--instead 
of putting all our eggs into the basket of renewables, we need 
to put a few of our eggs into the basket of fossil fuels so 
that we can improve it for the rest of the world because, in 
all fairness, folks, the rest of the world is going to burn 
coal. sub-Saharan Africa, India, China, they are going to 
continue to build--burn coal. If we can figure out how to do it 
cleaner in the United States, we can do it better for the 
entire world and actually help the carbon issue in the--on the 
planet.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time is expired. I will now go 
to the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to start with environmental justice. As I mentioned 
in my opening statement, Ranking Member DeGette and I wrote to 
Chairman Phillips last week about the importance of 
incorporating environmental justice into his decision making, 
and while the steps the Commission has taken over the last 2 
years have been vital, it still has a long way to go.
    So let me start with Commissioner Clements. Many 
communities have pointed to the Office of Public Participation, 
which you helped stand up, as a rare bright spot for first 
engagement with EJ communities. Can you talk briefly about what 
has made the office so successful and how it will continue to 
build on its success so far? Briefly.
    Ms. Clements. Thank you for the question, Ranking Member. 
The first reason it has been so successful is who we put in 
charge of it. The inaugural Director, Elin Katz, who has since 
left, and the current Director, Nicole Sitaraman, have taken 
their time and been deliberate and worked with not only all of 
us as Commissioners but with stakeholders to establish the kind 
of credibility that a new office like this needs to get 
results. That is the first reason.
    The second reason is that the public has been hungry for a 
way to engage with this esoteric, technical, you know, kind of 
arcane commission, and they are learning how to speak about it 
in English and inform people, neutrally, they take a neutral--
they don't get engaged in any position in any dockets, but they 
help people to understand that this agency over here makes--has 
an impact on their lives. And they have been doing that not 
only on the gas infrastructure side but also on the electricity 
side, and I think that is really important.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you. Now let me go to Chairman Phillips. 
FERC held its first-ever environmental justice roundtable in 
March. I found the perspectives directly from frontline 
communities in the second panel of the day especially 
impactful. So can you talk about what actions the Commission is 
taking in response to the input it received at that roundtable? 
Again, briefly.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you for the question. I am extremely 
proud of the work we have already done on environmental justice 
at FERC. We are looking to, as I mentioned a moment ago, put 
out a public-facing guidance document that all of our 
stakeholders can use. We are also--and this is a public-
interest determination that every Commissioner has to make when 
a project comes before us.
    I consider environmental justice, I have always considered 
environmental justice in my public-interest determinations for 
projects, and that is borne out now. Just recently, the 
Commission, sua sponte, for the first time in its history, took 
action to protect environmental justice communities for air 
pollution regarding a project. This is the type of progress 
that we are looking to make at FERC regarding EJ communities.
    Mr. Pallone. All right, thank you. Now, I--you heard me say 
earlier that, although FERC is a five-member Commission, right 
now there are only four Commissioners. So let me just go down 
the line and ask briefly each of you, do you agree, yes or no, 
that FERC is at its best and most effective when it has a full 
complement of Commissioners, yes or no?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes, absolutely.
    Mr. Pallone. Commissioner Danly?
    Mr. Danly. Not invariably.
    Mr. Pallone. Not invariably? OK.
    Ms. Clements. Yes.
    Mr. Pallone. Commissioner Clements?
    Ms. Clements. Yes.
    Mr. Pallone. And Commissioner Christie?
    Mr. Christie. Not necessarily.
    Mr. Pallone. OK. Chairman Phillips, if the Senate does not 
confirm additional Commissioners, FERC will be down to three 
Commissioners in January. Can you talk about the danger that 
poses to FERC if it was just one Commissioner away from losing 
a quorum?
    Mr. Phillips. I believe--I have been a regulator for over 
10 years. When the Commission is at a full complement, it 
absolutely functions best. There's five members for a reason. 
Having those voices, they give us better orders, they give us 
better decision making, better deliberation. If we go down to 
just three and we can lose a quorum, the Commission may not be 
able to act on important matters for the American people.
    Mr. Pallone. All right. Let me get one more question in. 
One of the five key actions identified in the Equity Action 
Plan was ensuring that natural gas project certification and 
siting policies and processes are consistent with environmental 
justice, and the document noted that reviewing FERC's 
regulations and policy statements on natural gas pipeline 
authorizations was a key component of FERC's approach to 
aligning pipeline certification with environmental justice 
principles.
    So 30 seconds left, Chairman Phillips, can you talk about 
where FERC currently is in its process of reviewing the natural 
gas policy statements that it issued last year?
    Mr. Phillips. Very quickly, we are now--those are now draft 
policy statements. We are using the 1999 policy statement. We 
are moving projects. Of course, what I am looking for--still an 
ongoing proceeding--I want a bipartisan approach to these 
policy statements, something that we can build consensus on. I 
also want something that stakeholders can embrace.
    It is extremely important that when we do this that we 
don't do it in a way that if the composition of the Commission 
changes, it can be flipped over at the snap of a finger. I want 
something that is lasting and durable for the utilities and for 
the work that we do.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you so much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time is expired. I will now--it 
is my honor to recognize the chair of the full committee, Mrs. 
McMorris Rodgers, for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    FERC's core mission is ensuring abundant, affordable 
supplies of energy at just and reasonable rates, and FERC is 
supposed to operate as an independent agency. Yet, under the 
Biden administration, we saw--we have seen a strong shift with 
FERC unnecessarily delaying natural gas permits and supporting 
a forced transition to less reliable, weather-dependent wind, 
solar, and battery resources. Last year, NERC warned that half 
of the country is at heightened risk for electricity blackout. 
This year, that has increased to two-thirds of the country at a 
heightened risk for electricity blackout, so this trend is very 
concerning.
    Yes or no, do you--do each of you believe that FERC has 
upheld its statutory obligation to ensure abundant supplies of 
energy at just and reasonable rates? And I will begin with the 
Chairman.
    Mr. Phillips. Yes.
    Mr. Danly. Sometimes, sometimes not.
    Ms. Clements. I think it is a work in progress.
    Mr. Christie. I agree.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. Commissioner Danly, can you expand 
and just discuss what you believe FERC could do to get back to 
its core mission?
    Mr. Danly. Certainly. We need to establish stable market 
rules and adhere to the rule of law. We need to make certain 
that the electric markets--we have to speak about both the NGA 
and the FPA. So under the FPA, we have to make sure that our 
electric markets have stable rules, that we do not 
retroactively change the results of auctions, as we did in a 
recent order for PJM because we didn't like the outcome of the 
system we had already put in place. We have to make certain 
that the markets actually are protected from the effects of 
subsidies and that they have proper price formation. All of 
that is necessary to ensure resource adequacy and J and R 
rates.
    Under the NGA, we have to constrain our analyses to the 
requirements of the Natural Gas Act, the purpose of which, you 
rightly point out, is to ensure abundant quantities of natural 
gas at reasonable prices. And remember that, though the public 
interest determination may have, as the Supreme Court has 
pointed out, subsidiary purposes, that is its primary purpose, 
and to the extent to which other elements enter the balancing, 
they have to be subsidiary to the main purpose of the statute.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. The district that I represent in 
eastern Washington, and the entire Pacific Northwest, is 
powered by hydroelectric power, and the licensing and 
relicensing process is entirely too burdensome. Hydropower is 
clean, reliable, and it is affordable and one of the drivers of 
economic development in eastern Washington.
    Yesterday, I introduced the Hydropower Clean Energy Future 
Act to expand the production and streamline FERC licensing and 
the relicensing process. Chairman Phillips, as you know, almost 
half of the Nation's existing hydropower dams, this investment 
that we made in this important infrastructure, is required to 
go back to FERC to be relicensed within the next several years. 
What is FERC doing to meet this challenge?
    Mr. Phillips. We are very aware that there is--some people 
call it an avalanche, some people call it a cliff--of coming, 
renew--license renewals, excuse me, regarding hydro. It is 
critically important, I believe, our hydro fleet within the 
country. I applaud you for the efforts that you are taking to 
introduce the legislation.
    FERC has made a priority to streamline our processes 
regarding hydro. We have a pilot project where we are looking 
to approve hydro facilities within 2 years. These are the types 
of steps that we are taking.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Do--so this is the largest renewable in 
America, is waterpower, it is in every State. We could double 
hydroelectricity without building a new dam. Only 3 percent of 
the dams actually produce electricity. So as a followup to the 
Chairman and all the Commissioners, do you agree that the 
United States has tremendous opportunity to expand hydropower 
production, and will you work with me on my legislation?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes, absolutely. FERC provides technical 
assistance. When asked, I would love an opportunity for our 
staff to work with your staff to make sure that we have a 
workable solution to really empower this great resource, which 
is hydropower, in the country.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. You know, part of the--it is 
really important that in this legislation it gives FERC the 
tools to hold other agencies accountable to FERC's permitting 
schedule, and that is where I really could use all of your 
help, if you agree with the goal. So maybe I will move on down 
the line.
    Mr. Danly. So the goal of improving hydro permitting?
    Mrs. Rodgers. Yes.
    Mr. Danly. Yes, of course I agree with that.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Yes. OK, thank you.
    Mr. Danly. Yes, so to the extent you need help, I am 
around.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you.
    Ms. Clements. Absolutely.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you.
    Mr. Christie. I think one of the reasons it takes so long 
to get relicensing--we get criticized a lot and are asked how 
come it takes so long to get a dam relicensed--is that FERC has 
been given so many duties that are not really related to our 
primary function as an economic regulator that when we 
relicense a dam it takes forever because there are so many 
other boxes we have to check that have really nothing to do 
with economic regulation. We even have to, like, determine 
whether relicensing affects recreational opportunities. And I 
said in the Senate committee, we are not the parks and rec 
department, shouldn't be.
    But that's why if you really want to do something about the 
length it takes us to relicense these dams, it would be nice to 
just take away a lot of the jurisdiction that we have on the--
on these noneconomic duties and give it to another agency.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you.
    Mr. Christie. Because that is why it takes so long.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Yes. Well, I thank you all, and thank you, 
Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I have got one in my district that has taken 
more than a decade. I will now go to Mr. Peters from California 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I see--I think there 
is a lot of bipartisan opportunity on that issue as well.
    A modern interconnected and reliable electric grid is 
essential to our energy and national security, and despite this 
shared reality, the current grade is--grid is vulnerable and 
outdated. Congress, the Federal Government, including FERC, 
have to act to strengthen the reliability of our grid while 
maintaining affordability for consumers. And it is not a 
partisan issue, because everybody needs access to power, and 
transmission is essential for every energy source, whether it 
is coal, nuclear, hydropower, natural gas, solar, or wind.
    And I want to look to the great State of Texas, home to 
significant energy innovation and leadership, as a perfect 
example. In 2005, the Texas legislature, including my friend, 
Mr. Veasey, at that time passed legislation to set up 
competitive renewable energy zones, and they built transmission 
lines to deliver cheap power to consumers. This plan led to 
3,600 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines, which isn't 
a lot, but it was 23 percent of all high-voltage lines added in 
the United States between 2008 and 2020.
    And while these lines largely focused on expanding vast 
wind resources in Texas, the transmission also boosted another 
sector: the booming oil and gas industry in the Permian Basin. 
During the shale boom in the 2010s, oil and gas companies used 
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to access vast oil 
and gas resources. The increased electric transmission capacity 
helped cheaply power oil and gas infrastructure in rapidly 
growing towns. Transmission is not partisan or technology-
specific.
    Mr. Chairman, I would love to work with you and Ranking 
Member DeGette and all my colleagues to find bipartisan 
compromise on transmission policy because every day we wait, 
Americans will be vulnerable to blackouts and higher prices.
    Before I proceed to questions, I just want to address the 
notion of the--that came up before about the study. I would 
like to point out that we have a lot information about this 
already, and I would ask unanimous consent for the admission to 
the record of the following documents: the February 2023 
Department of Energy's ``Natural Transmission Needs Study,'' 
the February 2023 study from Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, 
the February 2023 study from Grid Strategies, the October 2022 
GE and NRDC study, the May 2022 NREL Interconnections Seam 
Study, and the July 2021 study from Grid Strategies.
    I would like to enter all of those into the record.
    Mr. Duncan. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the 
hearing.\1\]

    Mr. Peters. OK, thank you.
    A more connected, interconnected electric grid could cut 
consumer electric bills by more than a hundred billion dollars 
cumulatively, or $300 per household annually. More 
interregional transmission can also help with reliability. As 
Commissioner Clements pointed out, Winter Storm Elliott caused 
blackouts across North Carolina and Tennessee which could have 
been avoided if available power in the Midwest was diverted to 
the region.
    Commission Clements, in your written testimony, you 
mentioned the benefits of major regional transmission lines. 
Can you please elaborate on how more regional lines can help 
reduce costs for consumers and provide reliability benefits? 
Understand that we are not all experts like you are.
    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Congressman. A robust regional 
transmission system brings a myriad of benefits. It can reduce 
congestion and therefore reduce prices. It increases resiliency 
in the face of extreme weather. It can transport zero marginal 
fuel cost resources from distant locations to customers where 
they need them. It increases the ability to do reserve sharing. 
The list goes on and on.
    And every transmission line has some component of a 
reliability benefit, some component of an economic benefit. So 
it is hard to parse them out.
    FERC has put forward a proposal to improve upon over a 
decade-old planning proposal related to regional transmission 
planning and cost allocation. That will get at the issue. That 
will start to solve the problem, and I think it is imperative 
upon this Commission to move forward with finalizing that rule.
    Mr. Peters. I was happy to work on and introduce the Power 
On Act, which became the backstop authority that Senator 
Manchin put into the infrastructure bill--the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Bill. This year I am working with Senator 
Hickenlooper on a bill to establish minimum levels of power 
capabilities, the Big Wires Act, between regions. Can you 
comment on how a minimum transfer requirement could help with 
grid reliability?
    Ms. Clements. Absolutely, I would be happy to. And I think 
that the Big Wires proposal you put forward can--is a good idea 
related to providing a clear minimum threshold for regions to 
understand how much they should be able to share between each 
other, because that is the place where, despite the fact that I 
think there is broad support across the industry and 
stakeholder groups for more interregional transfer capability, 
the question is how do we get it done.
    Mr. Peters. We need to force regions to be able to work 
together.
    Ms. Clements. We hope they will on their own. Yes, we would 
like to be able to help them and to facilitate that cost-
effectively.
    Mr. Peters. To encourage them.
    Ms. Clements. The reliability benefits are simply undoubted 
based on all those studies you demonstrate and real-life 
experience.
    Mr. Peters. Thanks. My time is expired, but I should have 
said encouraged.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank the gentleman.
    Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Clements. I will go to Mr. Latta, but before I do, I 
want to thank him for helping me out chairing something 
yesterday, and I recognize you for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Latta. Anytime for my friend. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, 
and thanks to the Commissioners for being with us today.
    Commissioner Danly, I have been concerned with high-profile 
attacks on our electric substations throughout the country and 
the possible consequences if these attacks cease being random 
occurrences and become a coordinated effort. Last year, FERC 
commissioned the North American Electric Reliability 
Commission, NERC, to study physical threats to the bulk power 
system. Would you highlight the findings of the report?
    Mr. Danly. So it was--NERC has written a lot on and talked 
a lot about the dangers to the bulk electric system both from 
cyber attacks and physical--from a physical security 
standpoint. The bottom line is, without getting into all the 
details, the--this is a distributed system and it is vulnerable 
to any number of asymmetric attacks of various types.
    Mr. Latta. So pretty much are you saying that we are 
vulnerable but didn't really give us any specifications of what 
we should be doing in the meantime or how we can protect 
ourselves?
    Mr. Danly. Well, so there are any number of means by which 
you can physically harden the infrastructure. The problem with 
that is, at a certain point, people have to pay for it. And so 
this is typically a--most of the vulnerability is in the 
distribution system, which is not the bulk electric system, 
that is the state jurisdictional distribution system. That is 
run in our system by the division of jurisdiction by the States 
and the State POCs who would offer cost recovery to the 
utilities that would put the physical security in place.
    Mr. Latta. So I guess on two questions, what can FERC do to 
help the local communities out there if something would occur 
like a--more of a mass attack instead of an individual attack. 
Is there anything that FERC can be doing to help our local 
communities?
    Mr. Danly. Well, FERC already has an Office of Energy 
Infrastructure Security, which is extremely active in engaging 
with utilities and local jurisdictions in talking about best 
practices, conducting audits, trying to figure out ways that 
they can enhance the security of their facilities. They are 
really very good at it.
    And there is, of course, FERC's bully pulpit, being able to 
talk about the issue and convene discussions, which we have 
done over the last few years.
    Mr. Latta. And here is the wild card question: What can 
Congress do to help either FERC or the local communities if 
something like this would occur?
    Mr. Danly. Well, I would caution Congress in trying to make 
FERC the locus for anything having to do with physical security 
because we are so distant and removed from the physical assets 
that are in question. That is really more a local government 
and State POC issue, I think, properly.
    But to the degree to which you want to cooperate with the 
States, I think you ought to. They are probably the ones that 
have a better view as exactly what they need.
    Mr. Latta. OK, thank you. Well, I am working on legislation 
right now, and so I think as we work on the legislation, I 
would like to work with you and FERC on that.
    If I could turn to Commissioner Christie. In addition to 
the grid security, as the co-Chair of the Grid Innovation 
Caucus, I am an advocate for the development and deployment of 
new, innovative technologies within the bulk power system. How 
is FERC working to ensure the reliability of the bulk power 
system as new technologies are deployed onto the grid?
    Mr. Christie. Well, if you are referencing grid-enhancing 
technologies, I think that is what Commissioner Clements was 
asked about earlier. Some of these technologies work really 
well, and when they are deployed, they absolutely provide a lot 
of benefit. Some work not so well--or don't work so well in 
certain places and work well in others. It is all very fact-
specific.
    FERC can encourage the use of--in fact, we did an order not 
too long ago encouraging the use of what are called dynamic 
line ratings, DLR, or adjusted ambient ratings. So FERC's role 
is--and also we put out the reliability standards through NERC, 
which is essentially transmission line standards.
    So FERC's role is to ensure that the reliability standards 
that apply to all the bulk power system, particularly 
transmission, and also to encourage the use of these 
technologies as they develop and are deployed to ensure that 
they are being developed and deployed in a--in the most cost-
effective way. I hope that answers your question.
    Mr. Latta. Thank you. Well, and back to Commissioner Danly 
real quickly in my last 40 seconds. You know, back in 2008, 
Republicans came out with an all-above energy strategy, so we 
wanted to have, you know, everything from nuclear and clean 
coal and natural gas and hydro, and then all of the other clean 
energy systems out there. But can we rely on just an 
intermittent system out there that some people sometimes 
advocate? What would happen if we had the intermittent go down, 
do we have to have that backup baseload capacity?
    Mr. Danly. There is no way, and it certainly has never been 
tested, to have a large-scale electric interconnection run 
entirely on intermittents. The spinning mass that has been the 
basis for our generation fleet for ages is what allows us to 
ride through the voltage disturbances that are inevitable in a 
dynamic system like this. And even if you have grid-forming 
inverters, the likelihood that they would have that level of 
resilience, given the fact that intermittents can turn and on 
off in a moment's notice, is very unlikely.
    There has to be some amount of backup, which is why, 
counterintuitively, the greater the penetration of 
intermittents in a region, the more natural gas transmission 
capacity you need, because when all of the intermittents do 
turn off, you have to have the entire fleet backed up with that 
quantity of capacity in natural gas, typically.
    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you very much.
    Mr. Chairman, my time is expired, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman, and now as an honorary 
Texan, it is my pleasure to recognize the gentlelady from the 
Lone Star State, Mrs. Fletcher, for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks 
to Ranking Member DeGette too, for organizing this hearing, and 
thank you, Chairman Phillips and Commissioners Danly, Christie, 
and Clements, for taking the time to testify before us today.
    I also appreciated Representative Peters' comments about 
innovation in my home State of Texas, where we really have been 
and continue to be at the forefront of all kinds of energy, 
both traditional and renewable. But we have also experienced 
the very worst of the failures that we are talking about here 
today. And so the work that you do is incredibly important to 
us, and it is really important that we are talking about these 
issues here today.
    So I do want to talk a little bit about an issue that we 
haven't covered as much in detail today, but I think it is 
really important, especially because it relates to a lot of the 
work that we are doing in my hometown of Houston. We are very 
focused on capitalizing on the great investments that were made 
in the last Congress in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, in particular, and the 
emerging technologies that we think can help us address our 
current challenges and really power our future while also 
addressing the climate challenge and reducing emissions.
    So what we are seeing in Houston is an increased demand in 
the market for hydrogen. It is something we have been very 
actively working on. Currently there are about 1,600 miles of 
hydrogen pipelines, and they are generally concentrated along 
the Gulf Coast, as I am sure that you know, and nearly all 
hydrogen shipment occurs in dedicated hydrogen infrastructure 
because of its chemical nature.
    So if we want to see the hydrogen programs that are 
included in the IIJA and the IRA succeed, we are really going 
to need to build out the necessary infrastructure to move 
hydrogen at scale. And so I really want to focus my questions 
to you all on these issues because I think there are some open 
questions right now.
    Currently, the regulation for siting, commercial service, 
security, and safety of hydrogen infrastructure is divided 
between various Federal agencies, including FERC, and the 
Surface Transportation Board, Transportation Security 
Administration, Department of Transportation. This large 
collection of jurisdictional oversight and the ambiguity 
associated with it has, I think, led to a lot of regulatory 
uncertainty in this space, and I think that that has the 
potential to hinder a lot of the projects that we are very 
interested in seeing move forward. So clear siting authority 
for unmixed hydrogen really is needed to provide the clear 
pathway for potential projects that the folks who are 
developing it really need to see.
    So I want to ask each of you this question, whether, in 
your opinion, FERC is the best-situated agency to play a lead 
role for siting interstate hydrogen infrastructure projects, 
similar to its responsibilities for natural gas and petroleum 
pipelines. And I would like to start with you, Chairman 
Phillips.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you for the question. I believe, given 
FERC's experience with natural gas pipelines--and as you 
mentioned, we currently have regulatory authority over blended 
hydrogen and natural gas--I believe FERC could absolutely take 
on the responsibility of pure hydrogen. Of course, I urge 
Congress, any new authority that they give us in this area, 
please be specific. Be specific. It helps us implement down the 
road and avoid costly litigation or delays.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you, Chairman Phillips.
    Commissioner Danly?
    Mr. Danly. I am not certain that we actually have 
jurisdiction under either the ICA or the NGA, so it would 
probably require an enactment to make that clear, but I 
generally would advise that you not subject nascent industries, 
especially those that you actually wish to promote, to the full 
panoply of Federal regulation immediately. So, even if we are 
the best, I'm not sure it should be regulated at all 
immediately at the Federal level.
    Mrs. Fletcher. You are not sure that hydrogen pipelines 
should be regulated----
    Mr. Danly. Requires----
    Mrs. Fletcher [continuing]. At all at the Federal level?
    Mr. Danly. No, no, no. By--I should have said that--by FERC 
at the Federal level, because the entire panoply of regulations 
that attend FERC jurisdiction are quite onerous, and these are 
typically borne by well-established companies that have been 
operating for the better part of a century. I just am always 
cautious when people talk about giving additional jurisdiction 
to FERC. I always suggest they slow down and think through the 
consequences because it can be difficult operating under a FERC 
paradigm.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Well, I am going to run out of time, so I am 
going to move on to the other Commissioners, but I may have 
some questions to follow up with you on the record after this 
hearing.
    Mr. Danly. Please.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Commissioner Clements?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you. I would agree with Commissioner 
Danly that we would need clarification as to this 
responsibility and support the Chairman's perspective on both 
the need for specificity and also the need for the staff to 
support something like that.
    Contrary to Commissioner Danly, I have had stakeholders 
coming in to me and saying, ``Can you let us know how you are 
going to do this. Can you please talk about this?'' So I do 
think there is a desire for some sort of regulatory certainty 
at the Federal level. Thank you.
    Mrs. Fletcher. And Commissioner Christie?
    Mr. Christie. I think it is--if you convert a natural gas 
pipeline to a hydrogen pipeline, I think it is very 
questionable whether we would have authority under the Natural 
Gas Act, so I would urge Congress, if you want us to regulate 
hydrogen pipelines that used to be natural gas pipelines or 
build new ones, that you really need to pass legislation and 
make that clear.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Well, thank you very much. I will submit 
some additional questions for the record. This is a really 
interesting topic, and I thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, for 
allowing us to have this exchange this morning, and I yield 
back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentlelady, and I will now go to 
the Chair of the Environmental Subcommittee, Mr. Johnson, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Commissioner Christie, in my subcommittee just last week we 
examined the reliability impacts of proposed EPA regulations, 
and I want to kind of build on that this morning. In your 
testimony, you discussed the threat to reliability due to the 
rapid subtraction of dispatchable resources, especially coal 
and gas, with no replacement. You further discussed that 1 
megawatt of wind or solar is simply not equal to 1 megawatt of 
gas, coal, or nuclear energy. I agree with that, by the way.
    But RTOs like PJM, which includes Ohio, have warned us 
about this. I am especially concerned about the public health 
impacts of systemwide outages. If you look at the EPA's own 
website, you look at the mission of the EPA on the White 
House's website, it is to protect public health and the 
environment. Public health is primary.
    So these outages, these potential outages resulting from 
taking dispatchable energy off the grid before anything can 
replace it, can lead to loss of life in extreme heat and cold 
scenarios when folks in places like rural Appalachia don't have 
power. And it can result in negative impacts on nutrition when 
families, especially low-income families, can't cook their food 
because they can't power their kitchen appliances. You yourself 
characterize this situation as a ``serious threat to 
reliability that is looming on the horizon.''
    So, Commissioner Christie, in your view, would you agree 
that current and proposed EPA power generation regulations are 
making this potential situation more precarious?
    Mr. Christie. Yes, because they are going to drive up the 
cost of operating a coal-generating unit, and if you drive up 
the cost, obviously that has to be paid for. Now if the unit is 
in rate-based--meaning in a vertically integrated state--well, 
then consumers ultimately would have to pay the cost because 
cost in a--for a unit that is in rate-based, they get cost 
recovery through that mechanism, so that unit could potentially 
stay open with consumers paying the additional cost.
    If the unit is in one of our RTO markets and they are 
already at a point where they are not recovering their capital 
costs or their operating costs due to the market, then, you 
know, it--you add additional cost. It just makes them even less 
financially viable, so they will close even sooner.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. And would you agree, to avoid catastrophe, 
we need to work to preserve more of our reliable dispatchable 
coal- and gas-fired power?
    Mr. Christie. That is exactly what NERC and the RTO 
management has been telling us. You can't just shut down your 
dispatchable generation overnight or within a matter of a few 
years and think that you can keep the lights on by simply 
trying to replace--my point about the megawatt versus the 
megawatt is the capacity value of a wind or solar megawatt is 
simply not equal to the capacity value of a megawatt----
    Mr. Johnson. That is right. That is science. That is fact.
    Mr. Christie. That is engineering. And it is engineering, 
and you can't keep the grid running with a one--you don't get a 
one-for-one replacement so----
    Mr. Johnson. That is right.
    Mr. Christie [continuing]. The numbers don't add up.
    Mr. Johnson. Well, what about the future? Renewables need 
to be backed up with something. Is there enough new gas-fired 
power plant to be built and integrated into our grid? Can you 
quickly touch on the current barriers to building out more gas-
fired generation?
    Mr. Christie. Well, you look at the PJM queue, what is 
called the queue, which is the line of units that want to get 
in and get interconnected. About 90 percent of it is wind, 
solar, or battery, and some other--I think some DR. And then 
the--it is only about 4 percent, I think, gas. So the problem 
is not only that we are--are we getting enough new gas 
generation to provide backup to the increased deployment of 
wind and solar. The answer is, no, we are not getting enough 
new.
    But the bigger problem is the gas units that we have 
increasingly can't get the fuel supply to run as either 
baseload units that run all the time or as peaker units that 
have to be called in on a--you know, it is really a matter of 
supply. If they can't get the fuel supply, then they can't 
provide the power supply.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Let me go quickly to Commissioner Danly. I 
want to pivot to LNG exports. You wrote in September 2021, you 
discussed, and I quote, ``lingering apprehension that the 
Commission may not actually have authority to oversee the 
safety of liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities under Section 
3 of the Natural Gas Act.'' And you noted that ``there is no 
language in the NGA that explicitly grants power to either the 
Commission or the Department of Energy to take responsibility 
for LNG safety.''
    I am concerned about duplication of efforts from multiple 
Federal agencies here. And I know my time has run out. I will 
ask this question, Commissioner Danly, and then if you would 
respond later in writing, that would be great: Can you share 
with our committee your perspective on FERC's authority for LNG 
safety and the cause of your apprehension, and are you still 
concerned about the Commission's interpretation of its 
authority? If you would get back to me on that question, I 
would appreciate it.
    Mr. Danly. Certainly. Thank you.
    Mr. Johnson. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I will now go to Ms. 
Matsui for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Matsui. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    And first of all, I want to start by thanking all of you 
for your work on transmission planning, cost allocation, and 
interconnection queues. And I want to encourage you to make the 
most of the authorities Congress has given you to take further 
administrative action.
    Now, study after study has confirmed the dire need to build 
more transmission infrastructure and to build it faster than we 
have in decades. DOA's national transmission need study had 
found that additional investments in transmission 
infrastructure would improve reliability and resilience in 
nearly every region in the United States. Meanwhile, the 
National Renewable Energy Lab found that significantly 
expanding transmission infrastructure would save more than $300 
billion in power system costs. These upgrades would not only 
make our grid more reliable, they could also pay for 
themselves.
    Long distance, high-voltage transmission between regions 
can provide the flexibility to distribute energy from a diverse 
energy portfolio to where it is needed the most.
    Commissioner Phillips, in your opinion, would more long-
distance transmission infrastructure between regions likely 
reduce wholesale electricity prices?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes.
    Ms. Matsui. Yes?
    Mr. Phillips. Absolutely.
    Ms. Matsui. OK, great. So would more long-distance 
transmission between regions likely reduce the threat of 
blackouts or brownouts?
    Mr. Phillips. [Indiscernible.]
    Ms. Matsui. OK, thank you. Now, in California there are 
times when we have more solar power than we need. In April 
alone, California curtailed more than 700 megawatts of wind and 
solar energy because there is simply no one to take it. 
Meanwhile, other areas of the country are curtailing more wind 
power, which tends to peak at different times of the day and 
different times of the year.
    Commissioner Clements, if we had a fully integrated macro 
grid allowing uncongested transmission from California to the 
Midwest and beyond, could California's abundant solar power 
potentially reduce energy prices for ratepayers elsewhere in 
the country?
    Ms. Clements. Indeed. The West in particular has a real 
opportunity for increased integration to the benefit of 
customers, but it does require transmission investment to get 
there.
    Ms. Matsui. Absolutely. So if we had uncongested 
interregional transmission, could the otherwise curtailed wind 
energy in the Plains and Texas potentially lower energy prices 
in California?
    Ms. Clements. I think we would have to get into the 
specifics, but absolutely, resources in one region can lower 
prices far from home.
    Ms. Matsui. Thank you. In my district, the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District, or as we call it, SMUD, plans to be 
zero-carbon by 2030, making SMUD one of the first utilities in 
the country to achieve this benchmark. At the same time, SMUD's 
electricity rates are some of the cheapest in California, and 
SMUD has among the highest consumer satisfaction ratings of any 
western utility.
    Commissioner Clements, your mandate is affordability and 
reliability and achieving those goals. FERC is resource-
neutral, correct?
    Ms. Clements. Correct.
    Ms. Matsui. Now, as part of SMUD's 2030 zero-carbon plan, 
SMUD plans to retire two gas-fired power plants over the next 
few years, replacing that capacity with renewables and battery 
storage. Generally speaking, from a cost and reliability 
perspective, why are we seeing so many fuel--fossil fuel 
retirements across the country right now?
    Ms. Clements. That requires a longer answer, Congresswoman. 
I think it is important to ground this conversation in the 
facts. Today in the U.S., 82 percent of our electricity supply 
is dispatchable, is what is known as dispatchable.
    Ms. Matsui. Right.
    Ms. Clements. Is that going to change over time? Yes, 
absolutely. But if basic supply-and-demand economics tell us 
anything, a good amount of thermal generation will stay online 
and be important in the reliability mix over time. So when we 
are talking about the risk and when NERC or any grid operator, 
including CAISO, stands up and says we should be concerned, it 
is FERC's job to take notice and to take that seriously.
    But let's talk specifically about what we need. Are we 
talking about resource adequacy? In that case, the answer is to 
get more steel in the ground. Are we talking about energy 
adequacy? In that case, the answer is how do we build up 
resilience against extreme weather events that the system 
wasn't designed to endure. Are we talking about reliability 
services? Then let's talk about what services the grid isn't 
getting that it needs, and let's move market rules quickly so 
that those resources we need online, whether they are new or 
those to stay online, can get the signals they need to act.
    And so to me, we have a lot of tools in the toolbox to 
address these reliability issues in the timing--in the planning 
timeframe. It is a long ballgame, right? We are only in the 
third or fourth inning. We don't know what is coming, and we 
will have some needs to prioritize higher-cost reliability 
things upfront, but over time the market constructs we have can 
provide this reliable transformation.
    Ms. Matsui. OK. Well, thank you very much.
    Ms. Clements. Thank you.
    Ms. Matsui. I ran out town--time. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Bucshon [presiding]. The gentlelady yields back. I now 
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    I want to thank the Commissioners for joining us today in 
the hearing during a crucial time as we see electricity prices 
continuing to rise. I will speak for Indiana's 8th 
Congressional District. On average, Indiana residents spend 
about $189 per month on electricity. That is 12 percent higher 
than the national average electric bill.
    I am a strong supporter of an all-above energy approach. In 
order to get reliable and affordable electricity to ratepayers, 
we must be sure that energy projects of all kinds are able to 
develop without unnecessary delays or uncertainty. This 
Commission routinely discusses the reliability of the electric 
grid, its consequences to Americans, and FERC's role in 
reliably administering it. Yet recently FERC pipeline 
certificate matters have experienced unusual delays.
    Unfortunately, one such example of the Commission failing 
to act in a timely manner relates to a project close to my 
home: a pipeline that would deliver natural gas to a southern 
Indiana power plant from Kentucky. This project could deliver 
reliable and cost-effective electricity to Hoosiers in my 
district and throughout the State.
    Commissioner Christie, how does the Commission reconcile 
these recent delays in the--in certificate proceedings with the 
Commission's critical obligation to providing for a reliable 
power grid for the Nation?
    Mr. Christie. Well, I don't want to talk about a pending 
proceeding, but we have to get certificates approved, but we 
have to get them approved in a way that they are going to be 
legally sound and address the issues that opponents of 
pipelines bring up. And one thing that is going on, I have 
mentioned it, you know, there is a national legal campaign, 
very well-funded, against every single natural gas pipeline or 
even facility from--down to the compressor station. And so it 
has driven up the cost of even processing and investing in 
these facilities.
    And yet we know that as gas becomes a much bigger portion 
of the resource mix and is absolutely essential, as you deploy 
more wind and solar, you are going to have to have gas backup. 
But they have to have supply, and that takes transportation. 
You have to transport the fuel to the generating units, and 
that is going to take natural gas pipelines. There is no way 
around it.
    And so FERC's job is we have to--when the evidence shows 
that a line is needed--and, of course, obviously we go through 
the Natural Gas Act and determine whether the evidence shows 
it--then we have to put orders out quickly, we have to put 
orders--I say quickly, I mean, within the time limits of the 
statute, and orders that hopefully address the issues that are 
raised because, if we don't address them, they are going to be 
addressed in the court anyway, because every one is going to be 
appeal----
    Mr. Bucshon. And so in a recent--for example, in a recent 
FERC proceeding, the Commission failed to issue a rehearing 
order in a case where rehearing had been pending since November 
of 2022, CP 21467-001. The record in that case has been 
transferred to the DC Circuit without a rehearing order, which 
is not the Commission's standard practice. The Commission's 
actions in this case presumably increase the likelihood of an 
appeal for a project that the Commission held to be in the 
public interest last October.
    I guess, Commissioner Danly, how can project sponsors of 
critical energy infrastructure projects required for reliable 
and resiliency of the electric grid rely on the Commission's 
process if the Commission itself fails to provide the requisite 
regulatory certainty?
    Mr. Danly. They can't. And, in fact, we have seen the 
effects of the regulatory uncertainty that FERC has created, in 
part with the issuance of the now draft certificate policy 
statements and in the changing standards that we have applied 
and in the intentional slow walking for a couple of years of 
many of those projects with unnecessary EISs, that is, the 
longer NEPA reviews.
    The result is that last year saw the least number of 
additional--the least quantity of additional transfer capacity 
added to the interstate gas system since the 1990s, and we have 
seen a chilling of investment because the companies are unable 
to rationally allocate capital and cannot assess the right risk 
premium given that regulatory uncertainty.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes, I mean, I am just going to give my 
opinion. This is purposeful in order to increase the likelihood 
of lawsuits against these projects and delay them for years, if 
not decades.
    So I guess another question for you maybe is, does FERC 
have the authority to require pipelines to mitigate downstream 
or upstream greenhouse gas emissions?
    Mr. Danly. No, not under the NGA.
    Mr. Bucshon. OK. Does FERC have the authority and 
capability to determine whether the emissions from a specific 
project are significant?
    Mr. Danly. We don't have a metric by which to do so that 
would survive the requirements of reasoned decision making, so 
it would fail on that basis.
    Mr. Bucshon. Great. Thank you. I yield back.
    Now I recognize Mr. Tonko for his line of questioning.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And to the Chair and 
Commissioners of FERC, thank you for your presence here today 
and for the service that you provide.
    Chair Phillips, FERC is consistently rated one of the top 
places to work in the Federal Government, but we know it can be 
difficult to recruit and retain the technical experts needed to 
make the Commission function effectively and have it at its--
top of its game. Can you discuss what pay scale and direct 
hiring authority changes Congress could consider to ensure FERC 
has the economic, environmental, engineering, legal personnel 
necessary to complete timely reviews?
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you for the question. First of all, I 
want to just say some nice things about our staff. I think we 
have an outstanding staff. I continue to be impressed with 
their dedication.
    What we've done, we are hiring. Everybody watching this 
right now: FERC is hiring. If you want to serve the public, 
please apply here, and I mean that in a very sincere way. We 
are looking to staff up our energy projects department, our 
division, but what we need, we have to keep pace with the 
industry. We have to compete with them for these very technical 
engineers, lawyers, professionals up and down the line. We need 
to make sure that we have every tool available.
    I would like to see our pay scale on par with other 
technical agencies like the SEC. That will help us work faster 
and get our work done better.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. I also want to express my 
appreciation for the Commission's focus on transmission policy 
in recent years. As we continue to discuss potential threats to 
reliability, it is critical that Members of Congress recognize 
the important role the--that transmission infrastructure plays 
in making our grid that more resilient.
    I want to strongly encourage the Commission to move forward 
with its open transmission proceedings as quickly as possible. 
There is no reason to wait. We know our electricity system is 
changing, and making certain that grid operators are doing 
effective, long-term regional and interregional planning is 
foundational to maintaining an affordable and a reliable grid.
    So, Chair Phillips, how does the regional planning 
proceeding require grid operators to take a longer view of 
their transmission needs, and will those plans have reliability 
in mind?
    Mr. Phillips. Absolutely. Right now, the way transmission 
works, it is very siloed. It is siloed when you talk about 
economic benefits, it is siloed when you talk about reliability 
benefits. What we are proposing to do in our regional planning 
is to have a longer view, to look at the reality on the ground 
so that we can plan for what we know is a changing resource 
mix. This is critically important.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And, Commissioner Clements, I want to 
get your thoughts on this. What is the role for better long-
term transmission planning in maintaining grid reliability?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Congressman. I think about it as 
reality-based planning. All infrastructure is hard to build, as 
we have been talking about. All types. And so, if what we need 
to do is ensure that we have a reliable grid and an affordable 
grid over time so that costs are spread out over time and in 20 
years you don't have customers in every State left holding the 
bag, what you need to do is look forward, take all the inputs 
that we have, and do--plan for various scenarios. In the face 
of uncertainty, what are the trends we are seeing? What are the 
set of no regrets or low regrets regional transmission planning 
lines that will help to ensure reliability out 10, 15, 20 years 
and beyond? And so I think it is a really important effort, and 
it is a pretty practical requirement as well.
    Mr. Tonko. Great. And, Commissioner Clements, the--I heard 
the earlier discussion you had with Ranking Member DeGette 
about the importance of grid-enhancing technologies. We know 
even if major transmission reforms are put into place, it will 
still be challenging to plan, site, permit, and build new 
infrastructure. I strongly believe we must maximize the 
efficiency of our existing infrastructure.
    So, Commissioner, what do you see as the role for grid-
enhancing technologies and reconductoring as part of an 
holistic approach to grid planning that seeks to achieve 
affordability, reliability, and certainly public policy 
requirements?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you. It is a really important 
opportunity. There has been, just like in every industry, a lot 
of innovation in transmission equipment. Now, as Commissioner 
Christie said, any given grid-enhancing technology, whether it 
is an enhance power flow control or a dynamic line rating, 
won't help the situation in every circumstance. But there are 
some set of circumstances where lots of these technologies can 
help clear up room on the grid, reduce congestion, allow for 
more use of the lines at times when the weather is good or, you 
know, not too hot, to bring on more resources.
    When we talk about these retiring resources, all of the 
grid operators say that, while there are not one-for-one-for-
one replacements, the ability to accelerate additions of new 
resources--wind and solar and other resources--to the grid is a 
critical component of maintaining reliability in the face of 
these retirements. And so if we can clear up room today and the 
next couple of years by using these relatively low-cost 
technologies, let's do that, right? Let's do that and make room 
for these new resources.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Commissioner.
    And with that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Bucshon. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize Mr. 
Walberg for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks to the 
Commission for being here.
    As Michigan acquiesces to more and more renewables, we see 
the loss of flexible generation like natural gas. Grid 
operators such as MISO have acknowledged that this transition 
may lead to reliability concerns in the loss of essential 
attributes like ramping capabilities, voltage stability as 
well. In fact, in Michigan, like the broader MISO region, it is 
fast approaching the renewable penetration inflection point of 
30 percent that a 2021 study found could result in reliability 
concerns as soon as 2027. That is close.
    We can't allow this to happen. I assume that you don't want 
it to happen either. But we have seen the impacts and loss of 
life and high prices and lack of reliability that happened to 
the EU last winter. Even a day without power in Michigan could 
be devastating.
    Commissioner Christie, does FERC share the concern 
expressed by MISO that retirement of flexible generation 
without the necessary placements could lead to decreased grid 
reliability in the next few years?
    Mr. Christie. Well, I'm not going to speak for FERC or my 
colleagues. I do. I think MISO has been very vocal about this. 
The CEO of MISO has been very vocal about the loss of 
dispatchable resources in the MISO territory. It is threatening 
reliability. That has been something MISO has been very vocal 
about.
    Mr. Walberg. Very much so. And I think there is evidences 
to prove that they do have those major concerns justified. How 
is FERC driving markets to incentivize new resources with the 
necessary attributes to ensure hour-by-hour reliability?
    Mr. Christie. I think it is important to understand that 
FERC doesn't order generating units to be built and FERC 
doesn't order generating units to be shut down. We regulate the 
markets that have a big effect on whether the--on how those 
decisions are made. In MISO and really throughout the country, 
it is States who decide what to build, and States can decide 
what to retire.
    FERC has a huge impact because of the way we regulate the 
markets, but it all interacts. And so what FERC needs to be 
doing in terms of regulation of the markets is to determine 
whether these markets are serving reliability and look at the 
rate designs and see whether these rate designs actually are 
producing just and reasonable rates and have the right 
incentives in them. So that is really our job, is regulating 
the markets.
    But I want to emphasize, States decide what units get 
built, States decide what units get shut down.
    Mr. Walberg. And, of course, when you set those rates, set 
some continuity there, that encourages or discourages States in 
some of the things they decide to do.
    Mr. Christie. Well, it absolutely--because we are 
regulating the markets, and the markets are going to send 
signals to units, you know, whether they shut down or not. That 
is why I think that really the vertical--a--it is a better 
system when--in a State when the State is doing an IRP and 
which is saying we want these units to stay open and we are 
going to put these units in the rate base if that is what it 
takes to keep these units financed and keep them open.
    That is a much bigger debate than a few minutes. And the 
country is really very different. There's a lot of different 
areas in the country which don't--no one does it all the same 
way, and that is a huge issue which really would take about a 
couple hours to go----
    Mr. Walberg. Well, I am glad to hear you say that, but that 
is crucial.
    Mr. Christie. Right.
    Mr. Walberg. The Nation is big, it is different.
    Commissioner Danly, to what extent does interregional 
transmission make up for this loss of flexible generation?
    Mr. Danly. Interregional transmission can on the margins 
help with reliability, but I think that people have a tendency 
to believe it to be a panacea. If we look at the recent 
reliability event over this Christmas, it wasn't entirely 
driven by a lack of transmission capacity. In the Southeast 
where I live, there were outages driven by the fact that 
counterparties, with whom the utilities in the Southeast had 
contracts, failed to show up, and the power wasn't there.
    So you can have plenty of interregional transfer capacity 
that could even be mandated, but if you don't have the 
electricity that is needed--the power to actually be shifted, 
then you don't have any benefit from it, right? And until we 
deal with the resource adequacy problem--which I argue is 
driven primarily by poor market design--until that issue is 
dealt with, then the marginal benefits to be gained by the 
transmission that people are contemplating, especially for the 
regional development, is really probably not worth the amount 
of money it is going to cost because it will be very, very 
expensive.
    Mr. Walberg. OK, thank you.
    Chairman Phillips, I have a question on cybersecurity, but 
in 11--10 seconds you can't answer it, so we will submit it for 
your answer later. Thanks so much.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Walberg. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan [presiding]. The gentleman yields back, and Ms. 
Kuster is recognized for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Kuster. Thank you so much for hosting this important 
hearing. I am going to jump right into my questions.
    I want to start by asking about interconnection. Before a 
developer can connect a new electricity-generating product--
project into our transmission system, the transmission system 
operator must complete an interconnection study to see how the 
new project will impact the existing transmission system. If 
there is inadequate capacity on the transmission system to 
support the new project, then upgrades must be made to the 
transmission system.
    Compared to traditional steel transmission lines, 
alternative transmission technologies like advanced conductors 
can increase capacity on the transmission system, reduce 
viewshed impacts, which are important in a State like mine in 
New Hampshire, and improve reliability. While alternative 
transmission technologies may cost more up front, there are 
dramatic cost savings for customers over the long term. Yet 
transmission system operators are hesitant to evaluate 
alternative transmission technologies in the generator 
interconnection study process.
    Commissioner Phillips, what can FERC do to ensure that 
system operators and utilities incorporate alternative 
transmission technologies, including advanced conductors, into 
their interconnection study process?
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you for the question. This is exactly 
one of the issues that we are addressing in several of the 
transmission reform NOPRs that we have ongoing right now. I 
believe that it is important that we consider grid-enhancing 
technologies that the industry considers at every phase of our 
transmission development. At the interconnection queue phase, 
as you mentioned. During transmission planning, implementation, 
and buildout.
    It is critical to--we cannot build our way to a clean and 
renewable energy system. We have to take advantage of advanced 
reconductoring, ambient line ratings, dynamic line ratings, 
issues that we have taken up here at FERC to, as Commissioner 
Clements said, squeeze as much juice as we can out of the 
current system.
    Ms. Kuster. Thank you. Next I want to turn to grid 
reliability. Commissioner Phillips, I want to ask you about an 
esoteric but important subject: ancillary services. Ancillary 
services, the performance attributes an electricity system 
needs to function reliably. I would like to focus on the market 
for two important--on the moment for two important ancillary 
services: spinning and nonspinning reserves.
    Spinning reserves and nonspinning reserves are provided by 
energy generation resources that can quickly ramp up generation 
or come online to respond to changing grid conditions. One 
resource that does this very well without carbon emissions is 
hydropower. As our electric generation system moves toward more 
variable energy resources, it is important for system operators 
to ensure resources that provide spinning and nonspinning 
reserves remain on the electric system to manage changes in 
grid conditions.
    Despite spinning and nonspinning reserves' importance for 
ensuring grid reliability, the ancillary service markets that 
compensate generators for providing these resources provide 
just a fraction of the revenue in organized markets. For 
example, ancillary services provided just .5 percent of the 
revenue in the ISO New England market in 2021. To be sure, 
resources that provide ancillary services also participate in 
energy markets, and energy markets provide the bulk of revenues 
in organized markets. But the ancillary service market should 
send a signal that ensures we preserve resources that provide 
carbon-free ancillary services.
    Again, Chairman Phillips, how can FERC ensure organized 
markets adequately compensate resources that provide carbon 
free spinning and nonspinning reserves?
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you for the question. You are right. 
When you look at hydro--and there is another nonthermal 
spinning reserve demand response. We have seen that come into 
play when there were emergencies like what we saw in California 
over Labor Day just last year.
    FERC has ongoing proceeding. We actually in 2021 and 2022 
had technical conferences on this issue to address compensation 
of ancillary services. We require regions to submit a report to 
FERC on this issue. We are now looking at that report, looking 
at those reports, studying it to see what, if anything, we need 
to do to address compensation for these services. But I do 
agree, they do play a critical role for the reliability of our 
system.
    Ms. Kuster. Great, thank you very much. I did have one more 
question on U.S. LNG exports, but given the time, we will 
submit that. And I yield back.
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back, and the Chair will 
now recognize a former Bear Bryant football player, Mr. Palmer, 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Palmer. I always have to correct the record. I 
practiced for him. Thank you for holding the hearing.
    I have a number of questions. And one of my concerns is 
about the rush to renewables and how it impacts our grid 
security. NERC put out a report back in summer of 2021 that 
listed the top threats to our power grid, and I think most 
people were surprised that it wasn't a cyber attack, it was 
changing the resource mix. And I just wonder how seriously, Mr. 
Phillips--Chairman Phillips--you guys at FERC take that.
    Mr. Phillips. We take the reliability--the reliability of 
our grid, Congressman, is job number one.
    Mr. Palmer. Now I--that is not the question. The question 
is, do you take seriously the threat to the reliability of the 
grid of changing the resource mix--in other words, shifting to 
making this major shift to renewables?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes, absolutely.
    Mr. Palmer. OK, thank you. What concerns me is that, when 
we look at what has happened in Europe and in the UK--there was 
an article in The Economist just a couple of weeks ago that 
said there are 68,000 people died, classified as excess winter 
deaths, because they couldn't afford to adequately heat their 
homes.
    Commissioner Christie, are you familiar with that?
    Mr. Christie. Are you talking about Winter Storm Uri in 
Texas? Is that what----
    Mr. Palmer. No, sir. This is what happened in--last winter 
in Europe. And it was a rather warm winter for Europeans 
standards. But they estimate that 68--are you not familiar with 
this?--that 68,000 people died because of higher energy prices? 
That's----
    Mr. Christie. I am familiar that in Europe they had a huge 
spike in energy prices following the invasion of Ukraine.
    Mr. Palmer. Well, it wasn't just that. In Germany, because 
of the massive shift to renewables, energy prices spiked up 46 
percent.
    But, Commissioner Danly, are you familiar with this, the 
threat that it creates to low-income households when energy 
prices spike?
    Mr. Danly. The specific story about the excess deaths in 
Europe, I didn't remember the specific number, but I know that 
they attributed a large number of deaths to the fact that 
people were unable to afford to pay for heating. And this 
should stand as an object lesson to anybody when we are 
considering market design. If we have markets that make it 
impossible for price formation to be adequate to incentivize 
new renewal--new arrival generation, then we are going to face 
similar problems here. The consequences of the electric system 
failure are dire.
    Mr. Palmer. Right. And it really surprises me that, 
Commissioner Phillips and Commissioner Christie, you are not 
aware of this, because it is a huge problem. I mean, in the UK, 
it has become a scandal. This has been going on since--with the 
UK shifting the way they have, I think one of the reports I 
read that residential energy consumption has declined by 10 
percent not because they have become more efficient, but 
because they can't afford it.
    Mr. Christie. I would say this: I am very familiar with 
European energy policy. I have been over there a lot and 
lectured over there. Their energy policies over the last 20 
years I think have been borderline just crazy.
    Mr. Palmer. I agree.
    Mr. Christie. And they are paying the price in increased 
prices and reduced supply. In Germany in particular--we could 
talk about that for an hour--has been pursuing policy--they 
shut down all their nukes, which I think was a terrible policy 
decision.
    Mr. Palmer. Yes.
    Mr. Christie. And what they did in Germany, they shut down 
their nukes but yet they reopened coal. So it is ironic that 
they----
    Mr. Palmer. Which is against the law in Germany, I think.
    Mr. Christie. Well, one thing I think that shuts--that is 
absolutely undeniable is energy prices, when they skyrocket, 
threatens people's--not only their comfort, but their health 
because people----
    Mr. Palmer. Well, I want to close this out because we have 
got less than a minute. My point is there's a couple of things 
here that should be very instructive to FERC and to the Biden 
administration in regard to energy policy. When prices spike, 
they have a disproportionately negative impact on low-income 
people, even to the point--and particularly people who are 
struggling with respiratory and cardiac issues.
    The other thing about it is, is that what Germany and the 
rest of Europe just learned is how devastating it can be to be 
reliant on an adversarial nation for something that is critical 
to their economy and their national security as energy. And 
that is where we are heading with renewables. We have the 
hydrocarbon resources we need to be a world superpower in 
energy, yet we want to make ourselves reliant on China for 
renewables, which will drive up cost and which are intermittent 
and which I think, Mr. Chairman, will be a threat to public 
health.
    With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time is expired, and now we go 
to the gentlelady from the Northwest, Ms. Schrier, for 5 
minutes.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Chairman and Commissioners, for appearing here today. I read 
all of your testimonies and today, again, we have heard a lot 
about uneven playing fields and criticism from some of you of 
incentives for clean energy as being disruptive to the free 
market.
    I agree that the energy market is an uneven playing field. 
It has been for quite some time. Estimates are that the U.S. 
gives $20 billion in direct subsidies to the fossil fuel 
industry every year and hundreds of billions more in indirect 
subsidies. So fossil fuels have had an unfair advantage in the 
U.S. and also with FERC, where it is my understanding much, 
much easier to get an interstate natural gas pipeline approved 
than an interstate transmission line.
    Commissioner Clements, could you walk me through the powers 
that FERC has to site interstate natural gas pipelines that it 
lacks for interstate transmission lines? And is there any 
reason in your opinion that we should be giving more favorable 
treatment to natural gas lines than transmission lines?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Congresswoman. There is different 
legislative histories of FERC's authority when it comes to 
responsibility for the siting of interstate natural gas 
pipelines, over which FERC has full authority, and the way that 
the Federal Power Act has divided responsibility between the 
Federal Government and the States. So on the transmission side, 
electric transmission, we only have authority over the planning 
of that and the paying for that, but then States have the 
ultimate authority over siting.
    And so on both the planning side and the permitting side, 
there are more regulatory hoops to jump through when it comes 
to electric transmission than interstate gas pipelines. Now, I 
am not suggesting either is easy. Both are hard and both are 
important.
    I think the one thing that we can say about transmission--
electric transmission planning is that we have robust regional 
planning processes set up, and we have a proposal out to 
improve upon those processes so that when a line comes through 
that rigorous analysis that happens at the regional level, we 
can say with confidence, the grid operators and the utilities 
can say with confidence, ``That line is going to provide 
benefits to customers that outweigh the costs, so let's move 
forward with building it.''
    That is why I think we can feel confident in these 
transmission lines that are coming out, despite the fact that 
we need to work really closely with States and with the 
utilities and the stakeholders at the State level who then have 
the ability to provide input onto the siting of electric 
transmission.
    Ms. Schrier. And are you finding that States are generally 
receptive and cooperative with that, like there is a common 
goal and interest, or are you getting pushback?
    Ms. Clements. That is a 50-part answer. But we have--one 
thing that I am proud of since we--I have been at the 
Commission is that we have worked closely with States. We have 
set up a joint task force that continues today to work with 
States on some of these harder issues to get at. But when you 
think about the interstate highway system, for example, if 
President Eisenhower and Congress hadn't decided to take 
Federal action, getting those roads built would have just been 
up to the counties and the States.
    Ms. Schrier. Right.
    Ms. Clements. And hope--we could hope that they would 
decide that those projects were beneficial.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you.
    Ms. Clements. Thanks.
    Ms. Schrier. Thanks for working with the States. I have 
another comment. I come from the Northwest. It is a unique 
region where a significant percentage of transmission is owned 
and operated by a Federal entity that is--that FERC does not 
have jurisdiction over, the Bonneville Power Assoc--
Administration, excuse me. And this fact can present challenges 
for interconnecting vast amount of new renewable generation 
that Washington State's Clean Energy Transformation Act is 
spurring.
    And FERC's recent notice of proposed rulemaking on 
generation interconnection would require significant 
coordination among agencies whose transmission systems could be 
affected by these kinds of interconnections: large wind farm, 
solar farm, for example. Again, Commissioner Clements, can you 
talk about how FERC--and you only have about 30 seconds--how 
FERC is planning to ensure that this coordination is going to 
ensure, even though you don't have jurisdiction over 
Bonneville?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you. There's regional differences akin 
to Bonneville around the country. What the Commission has done 
is put forward a proposal that gets at some of the nuts and 
bolts reforms required to fix the long interconnection lines 
for generating resources to hook up. As we have put out this 
proposal, we know that even if we past this final rule--or 
finalize a rule in some form, there will be more to do. That 
includes the impact in some cases of proposed inter--you know, 
proposed new generation hookups on affected systems around it, 
and it is one of the things that we really need to commit 
ourselves to continuing to move forward on should we finalize 
the proposal that we have before us today.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady is expired. I will now go to the 
vice chair of the committee, Mr. Curtis, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    I would like to kind of change all of our paradigms for a 
minute from a national grid and pull you down to a very local 
level: municipal power. My power that I receive in--from--my 
hometown is a municipal power city. They are part of a larger 
organization called UMPA, Utah Municipal Power Authority. I had 
the opportunity to actually chair that commission for a number 
of years, and so I am very sympathetic to these municipal 
powers and the way they operate. And I actually had the 
responsibility to, as mayor of my city, to stand in front of my 
residents and introduce a rate increase, the first one in 20 
years. I'm telling you, you talk about price sensitivity, that 
was a big deal.
    I am also very sympathetic to, let's say, a municipality 
that is a municipal power that has a new transmission line. 
Passing those rates on sometimes to a city with just a few 
thousand people in it, you can see the disproportionate impact 
that might happen in a small municipal power agency like that.
    Last fall, FERC--and by the way, the first time I heard the 
name FERC, I was in this role, and you might imagine it wasn't 
spoken with kindness. Nothing personal, I am sure all of you 
were not part of FERC at the time. But last fall you invited 
comments on fixing the current queue problems for applying to 
interconnect new generation facilities to the grid.
    The current practice to interconnect a new generation 
facility, if it is wind, solar, geothermal, or natural gas, 
requires that all the stakeholders submit an application to the 
grid operator to be studied. The interconnection request is 
placed into a study queue managed by the grid operator. The 
study process is costly and painful--painfully long an effort 
to weed out unfeasible projects. This backlog is clogging up 
the system for getting good and viable projects, generating 
projects out in a timely manner.
    Municipal utilities and cooperatives have obligations to 
serve. As we have talked about them, you know, I mean, this is 
folks you see in the grocery store, right? And if they are not 
being responsible, they feel that impact quite directly.
    However, if UMPA, Utah Municipal Power Authority, selected 
the best solar or wind project through an RFP in negotiations 
or wanted to develop the site themselves, they would be delayed 
by the current backlog for the transmission queue system.
    So, Commissioner Christie, you mentioned--I am going to 
loosely quote you, these aren't your exact words, I am going to 
paraphrase: ``We are losing dispatchable resources at a pace 
that we can't sustain.'' Given that, is there any consideration 
from FERC to filtering these applications by either quality of 
applicant or quality of project?
    So, you know, hypothetically you have got, you know, a 
hundred solar projects out here, and you have got one that is 
dispatchable that is getting clogged up with all of these, and 
the applicant might be somebody like UMPA that knows the 
process, is very good, it has got it exactly nailed down versus 
somebody who has never applied before. Is there any thought 
that you could actually build a filter in that would prioritize 
quality of applicant or quality of project?
    Mr. Christie. Well, I mean, I think that is the advantage 
in a non-RTO vertically integrated environment, where the State 
is determining what resource mix they want and what kind--and 
what type of resources they want. In the markets, no, we can't 
say, ``build this'' and ``don't build that,'' that is just not 
FERC's role. FERC regulates the markets for just and reasonable 
rates, and we have to determine--like in the interconnection 
queue regulation, again, it is all about getting just and 
reasonable rates and not being unduly discriminatory.
    So if you want to prioritize, if you want to pick certain 
resources over others, that is really much more suited for a 
vertically integrated State-regulated model than it is for an 
RTO model.
    Mr. Curtis. So, Chairman, can you--are--would you be 
willing to look specifically into this queue in Utah, take a 
look at the comments that were submitted to FERC last fall, at 
your request, and see if there is anything that FERC can do to 
move this queue along or to prioritize the better projects for 
the grid?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes, sir. In fact, we receive some comments 
on our interconnection queue reform NOPR. We are--what we are 
trying to do is get some of these speculative projects out of 
the queue so that we can move forward with projects that are 
actually ready to go. Now we are moving from a serial first-
come, first-served approach to a more clustered first-ready, 
first-served approach. That is exactly the type of policy I 
think that can help with the issue that you are talking about.
    Mr. Curtis. Yes. And as I understand it, that is what my 
folks are concerned about, is you may have a project that is 
just not viable or the builder is not viable, and that is 
getting the same priority as a--the dispatchable, reliable 
project from somebody who knows exactly what they are doing. So 
I would love you to look into that. And I am out of my time. 
Thank you all for your service.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time is expired. I now go to 
the Sunshine State, Ms. Castor, for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to 
the FERC Commissioners. You all have a very important role 
ensuring a safe, reliable, and efficient electrical grid. And 
this is an exciting time as we put all of the historic 
investments of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and 
the Inflation Reduction Act to work. Already we have seen, 
according to reports, over 140,000 jobs created, over $240 
billion of private-sector dollars invested across the country, 
with much more to come.
    But in order to fully realize the benefits and our 
potential, what you all are doing is absolutely critical on 
transmission reforms, on public participation, environmental 
justice, and more. I was very heartened to see your emphasis on 
environmental justice and what has been going on at FERC on 
this. In fact, Chair Phillips, you--I liked the way you put it. 
You--having--you say, ``We need to do all that we reasonably 
can do to ensure that environmental justice communities 
affected by the Commission's decision do not bear too great a 
share of the burdens or too small a share of the benefits that 
new energy infrastructure can provide.''
    And, Commissioner Clements, you have also emphasized this 
and worked hard on it. How does FERC consider the burdens and 
benefits as electrical transmission proceeds, and how do you 
consider it in your decisionmaking process?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Congresswoman. FERC has authority 
under the Natural Gas Act and under the Federal Power Act, and 
it is different in each case. When we are considering project 
or proposals under the Natural Gas Act, the law tells us that, 
under the Natural Gas Act and under NEPA--and the courts have 
affirmed--that the Commission has a responsibility to consider 
environmental factors. We also have SEQ guidance that speaks to 
any Executive orders that speak to specific treatment of 
environmental justice communities.
    And so when I go in to do my own public-interest 
determination, which we have to all speak to ourselves, I 
believe it is imperative that we follow the responsibilities 
and the statute and as interpreted by the courts very clearly 
to consider environmental factors.
    Ms. Castor. Thank you. And it has been heartening to hear 
so many of my colleagues talk about the traffic jams on the 
grid, the problems with interconnection queues. I learned a lot 
chairing the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, and 
we led a bicameral letter encouraging FERC to act. I filed a 
bill, the Efficient Grid Interconnection Act, to encourage FERC 
to do proactive planning on transmission to connect anticipated 
future generation. Also encourage you to consider the multiple 
benefits of a proposed project and ensure the cost allocation 
project accounts for the widespread benefits for consumers.
    You have also highlighted this, Mr. Chairman, as one of 
your priorities. What--with the rulemaking, what is the 
timeframe?
    Mr. Phillips. So we are working as fast as we can, our 
staff. In the near term, our immediate focus is on 
interconnection queue reform. I do believe that is probably the 
biggest bang for our buck, something that we can do immediately 
to help unlock the bottleneck that we see right now, getting 
new resources onto the grid.
    We continue to work on the other reforms as well. My hope 
is that within the next 12 to 24 months we will have all of 
these reforms landed and helping bring new transmission----
    Ms. Castor. Why 12 to 24 months?
    Mr. Phillips. So it takes----
    Ms. Castor. Two years is a long time.
    Mr. Phillips. It has to run its course. So everything is 
changing in our industry, and we have to make sure that we get 
this right.
    Ms. Castor. OK.
    Mr. Phillips. If we get it wrong, it will set back 
everything that we are doing.
    Ms. Castor. OK.
    Mr. Phillips. That is why it takes the time that it takes.
    Ms. Castor. Thank you very much. I am also very concerned 
with the number of scandals we have seen across the country and 
just overly concerned about--or overtly concerned about 
ratepayer money possibly being used for unauthorized purposes, 
for politics. For example, in Florida they were--FPNL was 
involved in election interference, in Ohio massive scandals, 
Illinois.
    Commissioner Clements, are utilities allowed to use 
ratepayer monies to lobby for political purposes?
    Ms. Clements. They are not. We have a uniform system of 
accounting that requires what types of expenses that utilities 
can put in what box. We have put forward a proposal to--excuse 
me, a notice of inquiry to look at this type of spending.
    Ms. Castor. Is anything happening on that notice of 
inquiry?
    Ms. Clements. I am--I would--we don't speak to internal 
timing, but it is out there----
    Ms. Castor. Is----
    Ms. Clements [continuing]. And we have a great deal of 
comments on it.
    Ms. Castor. Because, obviously, the rules that are in place 
right now aren't working. You--do you agree the guardrails can 
be improved?
    Ms. Clements. I--yes, I absolutely believe that it is an 
important duty of this Commission to protect customers, and 
part of protecting customers is ensuring that utilities are 
spending money appropriately per our system of accounts. 
Absolutely.
    Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady's time is expired, and I will go 
to another leader on energy, Dr. Burgess, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Burgess. And I thank the Chair.
    Commissioner Danly, let me just ask you a question. In 
your--and I apologize for not being here, we have got multiple 
things going on at the same time, as we typically do, all of 
them very important. And, of course, this is extremely 
important.
    But, Commissioner Danly, in your written statement dealing 
with the issue about the possibility of a looming reliability 
crisis, you make the statement, ``As an engineering matter, 
there is no substitute for reliable, dispatchable generation. 
Intermittent renewable sources like wind and solar are simply 
incapable by themselves of ensuring stability of the bulk 
electric system.''
    So I guess a lesson for us as policy makers is you can't 
legislate physics, it actually--physics is the law, we just try 
to administer it. Can you speak to the distortion of the 
wholesale electricity markets because of what has happened with 
subsidization of the less reliable renewable markets?
    Mr. Danly. Certainly. So in our--in the ISOs and RTOs, the 
FERC jurisdictional markets, the subsidies have effectively 
allowed intermittents to bid into the capacity markets at a 
price of zero. That bid of zero sends the price signal that 
that electricity, that power, is free, which of course it 
isn't, and it depresses the prices for the entire market, such 
that those units that have to bid in their actual costs are not 
going to clear the market, and they will not get a capacity 
award. The result of that is premature retirement.
    And the dispatchable resources are the ones that have 
things like fuel costs, right? Regardless what that fuel is, if 
you have a fuel cost, you have to bid in your actual cost. They 
are pushed out of the market before their useful life is over, 
and the intermittents will end up making up a larger percentage 
of the fleet going forward.
    Mr. Burgess. So the problem thereby compounds and becomes 
even more pronounced as you increase the component that is 
brought by the renewables.
    Mr. Danly. And the longer these subsidies have their 
effect, the more this happens with each successive auction. And 
I mentioned earlier but I will say it again, that we have proof 
of the effect of the--of these subsidies in the actual numbers 
from the market. PJM has recently said that we are facing 
imminent resource adequacy scarcity, or scarcity of resources, 
and yet in the last procurement auction, the capacity prices 
dropped. And during times of scarcity, if a market functions 
correctly, obviously the prices should go up. This is proof 
that the subsidies are doing--are working ill in the markets 
right now.
    Mr. Burgess. Well, and I just don't think it can be 
overstated. They can bring their product to market with 
essentially a zero cost, but that is not true. I mean, the 
dollars have been expended in the subsidies that have been 
provided in various pieces of Federal legislation that have 
come forward. Is that not correct?
    Mr. Danly. Of course it is. And, in fact, if we look at the 
system as it is developing right now based on public policy and 
FERC prom--FERC's promulgations, we have something even worse 
than that, which is the active contemplation of the sub--of the 
socialization of cost of transmission to get many of those 
subsidized renewables' power to the markets. And thus, the 
taxpayer is going to suffer a double insult and injury. They 
are taxed for the subsidies that distort the markets, and then 
if these issuances by FERC actually go forward, they are going 
to have the pleasure as ratepayers for paying so that the 
speculators and project developers, the asset managers are 
going to be able to actually realize their revenue streams.
    Mr. Burgess. But, in fact, the electricity future cannot 
exist if there is no place to plug it in, so that is going to 
have to happen, is it not? I mean, all EVs, all the charging 
stations that are contemplated, they do have to have some place 
to plug in.
    Mr. Danly. Certainly, but more importantly, there has to be 
generation of the right type to keep the system stable. Every 
theoretical future that people talk about depends upon actually 
having a stable bulk electric system, which requires 
dispatchable reliable power, and the way that we get that in 
our markets--or at least we are supposed to--is by having price 
signals that incentivize either the retention or the arrival of 
new assets as needed. And that is not happening, and it is 
eventually going to come home to roost, this problem.
    Mr. Burgess. I could not agree with you more, and I just 
frankly do not understand why we are willing to give that up.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the interest of time, I will 
yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I now go to Maryland 
to Mr. Sarbanes for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all 
for being here.
    So I am a novice on this stuff. I am trying to understand 
this balance that needs to be struck during a transition period 
between maintaining a certain capacity of dispatchable 
resources and introducing more renewable but intermittent 
resources into the mix. I do think there is some fearmongering 
going on, though, about the dispatchable resources and giving 
up through, you know, premature retirement of those resources, 
something that, you know, we have to hold onto for dear life, 
so I am trying to navigate that conversation.
    Earlier this year, PJM, which is the electricity market in 
which Maryland sits, as you know, flagged that roughly 40 
gigawatts of generation capacity was at risk of retirement by 
2030. It didn't mention in all of that that it currently has 
over 200 gigawatts of renewable generation capacity stuck in 
the interconnection queue. And obviously there is a difference 
in logistical requirements between a gigawatt of solar or wind 
capacity and a gigawatt of natural gas or coal-fired capacity.
    But PJM in theory has now excess capacity that is five 
times the capacity of projected retirements within the system. 
And, again, I know it is not an easy dynamic here. It does 
bring us back, though, to the same question line you have been 
getting now for the last few minutes since I have been here, 
which is what is going on with the interconnection queue. And I 
think you said that the timeline for this proposed reform rule 
being out and completed and implemented is 24 months, is that 
what I heard? No?
    Mr. Phillips. So for interconnection queue reform----
    Mr. Sarbanes. Yes.
    Mr. Phillips [continuing]. We are looking to move a lot of 
faster than that.
    Mr. Sarbanes. OK.
    Mr. Phillips. I can't talk about specific timelines.
    Mr. Sarbanes. OK.
    Mr. Phillips. It is my hope that within the coming months 
we will have a final rule to act on.
    Mr. Sarbanes. And in the meantime, are the RTOs effectively 
just stopped and waiting for that reform to come out, or are 
they able to proceed, and how much--I don't mean that they are 
not taking applications and processing them. I mean, in terms 
of looking for any opportunity to expedite or sort the 
applications coming in, do they have some tools at their 
disposal to do that even as this rule is pending?
    Mr. Phillips. You make an excellent point. I think just 
FERC taking action on the proposed rule, we have seen different 
regions throughout the country implement their own reforms----
    Mr. Sarbanes. OK.
    Mr. Phillips [continuing]. Regarding interconnection queue 
reform, and we have acted on some of those. And I think that we 
are going to see the benefits of this. It is a region-by-region 
issue. Flexibility is important. What works in the Southeast 
may not work in the Northeast. What works in the West may not 
work in the Midwest. We want to make sure that we recognize the 
nuances----
    Mr. Sarbanes. OK.
    Mr. Phillips [continuing]. Of the different regions as we 
move forward.
    Mr. Sarbanes. That's good. So there is kind of an iterative 
feedback loop going on in this process, which is helping to 
move the whole enterprise forward.
    I did want to touch briefly on some issues related 
specifically to PJM. I know you are having a forum coming up--I 
want to thank you for that--on PJM's capacity markets later 
this week, I believe, which is obviously an important issue 
related to reliability. I was troubled to hear, though, that 
FERC's--this forum that you are putting together doesn't have 
any representation from the clean energy industry, which, as we 
just mentioned, is dominating the majority of the 
interconnection queue right now.
    So I would love to have you commit that any decisions that 
the Commission is going to make coming out of that forum will 
adequately consider the views of the clean energy industry 
within PJM's territory, if you might.
    Mr. Phillips. We are absolutely focused on including voices 
of all stakeholders. In fact, just 2 days ago we added a new 
panelist to the PJM forum, Abigail Hopper from SEIA, who will 
represent the voices that you mentioned.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
    Mr. Phillips. So thank you for the concern.
    Mr. Sarbanes. And I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time is expired. I now go to, I 
believe, Mrs. Lesko for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for 
being here and also doing your job. I mean, it is absolutely 
important, as you know, to keep our lights on.
    On June--this first question is for Commissioners Danly and 
Christie. On June 1, 2023, the CEO of the North American Energy 
Reliability Corporation, Jim Robb, testified before the Senate 
and plainly said, I quote, ``Conventional generation is 
retiring at an unprecedented rate. North American Electric 
Reliability Corporation is concerned that the pace of change is 
overtaking the reliability needs of the system. Unless 
reliability and resilience are appropriately prioritized, 
current trends indicate the potential for more frequent and 
more serious long duration reliability disruptions, including 
the possibility of national consequence events.''
    I am actually working on legislation to address this issue, 
so your input is helpful to me. Some of you on--NERC also 
pointed out that the retirement of existing firm power 
generation and the lack of new firm generation to replace it is 
the concern.
    Commissioners Danly and Christie, besides transmission, 
what new authorities, if any, does FERC require to establish 
reliability markets for each ISO or RTO and to address grid 
reliability in general? And I guess first to you, Mr. Danly.
    Mr. Danly. I would argue that we don't need any new 
authorities, that what we need to do is not ignore the 
obligations we already have to ensure that rates are just and 
reasonable. And as long as we violate certain basic legal 
principles--like the requirements of our statute that they be J 
and R rates, or that if we ignore the Filed Rate Doctrine and 
do things like go back and retroactively change the results of 
a procurement auction because we didn't like the outcome--as 
long as we keep doing that, you are not going to have a 
reliable system and have insured resource adequacy. What we 
need to do is add fidelity to our statutes.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you. And Commissioner Christie?
    Mr. Christie. I just want to say one thing, and alluding to 
your mention about NERC speaking in the Senate energy 
committee. We just heard about there is some--there is an 
accusation there is fearmongering going on with those of us 
expressing concerns about loss of dispatchable resources. I 
don't think the head of NERC is fearmongering when he 
repeatedly says that this is a coming danger. I don't think the 
head of PJM is fearmongering when he has said we are losing 
dispatchable resources at a rate we cannot sustain. I don't 
think the head of MISO is fearmongering when he says we are 
losing dispatchable resources at a rate we can't sustain. I 
don't think it is fearmongering when the head of New York ISO 
last week said the same thing.
    I think we need to listen to the engineers, not the 
lobbyists, and I think we need to be doing what is right for 
ratepayers and not political narratives. We are losing 
dispatchable resources. All the experts are saying--who know 
how to operate a system, the people who actually know how to 
operate a system, are saying this is a huge incoming problem, 
and I think we ought to be listening to them.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you. My second question is for Chairman 
Phillips. In 20--in June 2021, FERC established a rule, I guess 
you would call it, and it allowed California basically to steal 
energy that was contractually obligated for Arizona. And so I 
sent a letter to FERC about it saying I don't think this is 
fair.
    But now there is another concern, and it is a concern 
because Arizona stakeholders felt that the law was violated in 
that respect, and so now there is a concern related to the 
current Western Area Power Administration, WAPA, negotiations 
about joining the Southwest power pool RTO. In Section 1232D of 
the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress expressly prohibited 
the Commission from exercising any authority over the electric 
generation asset's electric capacity or energy of the Federal 
utility that the Federal utility is authorized by law to 
market, or the power sales activities of the Federal utility.
    Chairman Phillips, in the event that WAPA joins a regional 
transmission organization, will the Commission refrain from 
exercising authority over WAPA as stakeholders in Arizona 
believe is required by law?
    Mr. Phillips. Thank you. I am aware of the negotiations 
that's going on in the West and the issue that you raise with 
WAPA joining the pool. I have to take a careful look at the 
facts and circumstances that you talk about to see what exactly 
our rules require, what our obligations are. But I absolutely 
commit to taking a look at that and working with you and your 
staff to get a response to that question.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you. And my time is expired, and I yield 
back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. I will now go to 
California to Mr. Cardenas for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, 
for having this important hearing. I appreciate the four 
Commissioners for being here today and sharing some time with 
us and enlightening the public about what may or may not be 
going on out there.
    Last Congress, we successfully passed three significant 
energy-related laws, and in the years to come these laws will 
transform the electricity sector of our country. In fact, the 
investments made in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the 
Inflation Reduction Act have already started to propel our 
Nation toward a cleaner energy economy. These laws also took 
long-overdue actionable steps to advance environmental justice.
    FERC has unique authority over the energy infrastructure in 
this country, and as we build out clean energy it is vital that 
the Commission similarly prioritize environmental justice in 
its decisionmaking processes. I would like to talk about the 
role of environmental justice in the making--in making 
determinations for authorizations of natural gas pipelines and 
LNG facilities under the Natural Gas Act.
    Commissioner Clements, can you speak about the role 
environmental justice considerations play when the Commission 
is making determinations about if individual applicants satisfy 
the criteria for certificates or authorizations under the 
Natural Gas Act?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Congressman. As part of our NEPA 
review for any application for certification of an interstate 
natural gas pipeline, the Commission does consider 
environmental justice impacts. We have had a difference of 
opinion sometimes about whether that consideration has been 
sufficient, but that is the place where that consideration 
comes in as part of making our determination under the Natural 
Gas Act.
    I think it is a legal requirement, and therefore, if we 
don't--if we cut corners and don't fully consider the 
communities impacted by our decisions, what we do is we add 
months if not years onto the end of those processes because of 
the litigation risk involved. It also makes our decisions 
better when we think about the impacts, our public-interest 
determinations about the impacts on the communities impacted by 
those decisions.
    Mr. Cardenas. Now when you say impacts on the communities, 
you are talking about the impacts of human beings, children, 
men, women, elderly?
    Ms. Clements. That is right. Any environmental justice 
community or otherwise disadvantaged community.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you very much. Chairman Phillips, to my 
knowledge, FERC has never withheld certification or opposition 
for a pipeline or LNG facility on environmental justice 
grounds. Can you expand upon the criteria that would have to be 
satisfied for the Commission to withhold or deny approval to a 
project on environmental justice grounds?
    Mr. Phillips. Under NEPA and with our NEPA review process, 
and also under the NGA, we are required to consider 
environmental impacts of a project. That includes environmental 
justice communities. And you are right, we are not aware of any 
circumstance where we have actually had to deny a project based 
on environmental justice concerns.
    Hypothetically, it is possible, though, that there could be 
significant enough impacts where we would have to consider 
that. That has not happened.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you. When it comes to environmental 
impacts and public comment and open hearings and things of that 
nature, have there been--are there any examples where a project 
has been improved because of this activity of open meetings and 
public comment?
    Mr. Phillips. Yes. We have a prefiling process, especially 
with our natural gas projects, hydro projects where we have a 
public comment process. And based upon those comments and 
feedback from the community, we can go back to the applicant 
and say, ``Make these adjustments, make these modifications.'' 
It absolutely helps a better applicant--a better application 
from the applicant as well as a better decision from the 
Commission.
    Mr. Cardenas. Good, thank you. In FERC's fiscal year 2024 
budget request, the Commission indicated it was interested in 
supporting intervenor funding through the Office of Public 
Participation. Can--Commissioner Clements, can you discuss the 
importance of intervenor funding, specificallyt, how will it 
allow FERC to hear from communities traditionally sometimes 
excluded from its proceedings?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Congressman. We do not currently 
have an intervenor funding program. What we have done as we 
have set up the Office of Public Participation is invited 
representatives of States that have set up intervenor funding 
programs, including California, to take lessons learned and 
figure out how we might approach this. I would certainly defer 
to the Chairman on further consideration of that opportunity at 
the Commission.
    Mr. Cardenas. When somebody is making a comment and they 
have the opportunity to hire experts in the field or--and/or 
attorneys who have tremendous experience in this, does it help 
that community have representation and involvement in the 
process?
    Ms. Clements. Absolutely. If we don't have that evidence or 
that perspective in the record, we cannot consider it in our 
decision making.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you so much. My time having expired, I 
yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I will now go to the 
Crossroads of America, Mr. Pence, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Pence. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for 
being here today.
    I really appreciate my colleague's comments just now. Our 
grid is on an unsustainable path, as a few of you have 
mentioned today. Last summer, in the State of Indiana we had to 
fire up a coal plant that had been--I call it mothballed, that 
is not a technical term. That is because we didn't have enough 
electricity. And that is not even the growth. We have lots of 
windmills and lots of solar panels. That is not even the growth 
of the electrification of the transportation industry yet.
    Unfortunately, decisions affecting electricity markets and 
their impact on our grid are not overnight decisions. These 
affect long-term investments and could take years to be fully 
realized, as you've mentioned. If we do not change our 
direction now, we could be heading towards catastrophic 
failures now. Last summer.
    Even though the entities charged with building and 
maintaining our electric grid continue sounding alarms, that 
has not slowed down the administration's top-down 
federalization approach to forced electrification. I am 
concerned that the Commission's order to implement new 
transmission backstop authority will trample States' rights and 
subject ratepayers to foot the bill for a project they did not 
ask for.
    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided limited 
authority to clarify Section 216 of the Federal Power Act. 
However, the Commission seemed to have taken matters into their 
own hands to grow their authority over transmission siting and 
inject environmental justice goals to fulfill a Green New Deal.
    Now, maybe that hasn't inhibited anything yet. But, 
Commissioner Christie, I have a question: How do you think the 
use of Section 216 authority under the proposed rule would 
impact States' ability to govern themselves, and do you 
envision a scenario where ratepayers will be required to pay 
for misguided transmission facilities that may not fit the 
unique needs of that State, that community in which their local 
government or State have already rejected?
    Mr. Christie. I think there's two questions there. The 
first question is, who should do the review of whether it is 
needed or prudent? And I absolutely believe the State 
regulators should. I think they are much more suited to 
understand whether a transmission line is going to serve 
consumers in that State. I don't think it is the question of 
States--State rights, I think it is the question of who is best 
suited to determine whether a power line, which consumers are 
going to pay for--let's never forget that, consumers are always 
going to get stuck with the bill for power lines.
    So before you can justify charging consumers, you have to 
make sure that the consumers are going to be served by the 
line. And I think that the best people in the best position to 
do that are State regulators.
    Now, RTOs are going to do planning criteria, and they are 
going to vet these lines, and they are going to determine that 
these lines have an interregional value, and that is good. But 
before you build them, it ought to have to go to a State 
regulator and do that vetting. And that is what I think is so 
important.
    Now, cost allocation is a separate issue. Cost allocation 
when you are talking about a line that--and, again, we are in 
an RTO scenario now. So RTOs do cost allocation for regional 
lines and allocate them across consumers in different States. I 
think when it is a--when you go into an RTO, you know that is 
going to happen, as I say, but you do it because you assume 
that the lines are going to either provide a reliability 
benefit or an economic benefit such as reducing congestion 
cost, and everybody sort of agrees on what the formula is going 
to be.
    When a line is built that is--as NARUC, the State regulator 
commission, put it--would not be built but for a State policy, 
then I think the State regulators have to be the ones 
determining how you allocate cost to their own consumers, 
because they shouldn't have their consumers charged for a 
policy project unless the State agrees to it. To me, that is 
just a no-brainer.
    Mr. Pence. I am going to have to--I got one more question, 
and this question is for Mr. Danly. In my view, pipeline 
modifications and upgrades that have minimal environmental 
impact should not be subject to lengthy and burdensome 
recertification requirements. If the Commission follows through 
on an environmental agenda, I am concerned this could open 
opportunities to inject environmental justice goals into these 
types of recertifications and exasperate delays in upgrading 
technology, further deterring investment.
    How should FERC refocus authorities from the Natural Gas 
Act to ensure that the Commission does not delay these types of 
technological upgrades and modifications?
    Mr. Danly. FERC should conduct its Section 7 reviews and 
the--produce the NEPA document that is the minimally invasive 
and least difficult document for that project. That means doing 
EAs where EAs are acceptable as opposed to more burdensome 
EISs. But, unfortunately, the fact of the matter is all of our 
Section 7 issuances are going to be subject to some degree of 
litigation risk, because if people choose to attack it on the 
basis of our NEPA document, they are going to be operating 
under a cloud until that is resolved in the courts.
    So absent some kind of profound permitting reform in which 
that back-end litigation risk under NEPA is changed----
    Mr. Pence. Which you had mentioned before, the last time we 
were together, so OK.
    Mr. Danly. Yes. With--in the absence of that sort of a 
reform of the back-end litigation risk----
    Mr. Pence. So we have got to take action here.
    Mr. Danly. Something has to happen, otherwise it is all 
going to be under a cloud. But----
    Mr. Pence. And I am out of time, so I yield back, Mr. 
Chair.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman, and I now go to Ohio, 
Mr. Balderson, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all 
for being here today.
    Ms. Clements, I Googled you, and you are from Dayton, Ohio, 
so it is nice to see another Ohioan here.
    This question is for Mr. Danly. And during the hearing with 
Administrator Regan last month, I expressed my concerns with 
the EPA's tailpipe emissions proposal and the increased demand 
that would bring while at the same time pushing policies aimed 
at forcing the early retirement of the existing generation. 
PJM, NERC, and others raised alarm bells on reliability well 
before the EPA's latest proposal on fossil-fuel-fired power 
plants was released.
    Just last week, New York's grid operator expressed grave 
concerns on declining reliability margins across the State. If 
these rules are finalized, can you discuss the consequences 
they could have on reliability and ultimately what this means 
for our constituents?
    Mr. Danly. So any rule that comes out that increases the 
cost for dispatchable generation to operate, when those 
dispatchable generators have to seek part of their revenue in 
our capacity markets, and those capacity markets are subject to 
the effects of subsidies that are preferably given to one type 
of generation over them, it is going to drive them into 
retirement. And I realize that was several steps through the 
chain, but the higher the cost, the harder it is to recoup 
those costs in a market that is warped by subsidies.
    So you are going to see further retirements of the 
dispatchable generation that is necessary to keep the system 
stable, and that is going to impair our reliability.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you. A followup: Mr. Danly, do you 
think this administration is seriously considering grid 
reliability and listening to concerns from grid operators and 
energy producers when developing these policies?
    Mr. Danly. I have no idea who was consulted in that 
process. I didn't participate in that docket so I would be 
reticent to say.
    Mr. Balderson. Yes, sir. Thank you. Next question: Mr. 
Danly, can you discuss the importance of natural gas and 
balancing weather-dependent resources?
    Mr. Danly. Oh, certainly. So the--as you have greater 
penetration of intermittent resources like wind and solar, 
somewhat counterintuitively you actually require a greater 
quantity of natural gas transmission--the reason being, when 
both wind and solar go offline, which they inevitably will at 
certain times of the day and during certain conditions, you 
need to back up that entire number of megawatts with something 
immediately dispatchable, and that has become natural gas.
    In fact, in the case of New England, the total quantity of 
natural gas transmission capacity they are going to need going 
forward if their State policies are implemented is going to 
have to increase drastically, just as an example of that.
    Mr. Balderson. OK, thank you. My next question is for Mr. 
Danly or Mr. Christie, but I am going to go with you, Mr. 
Christie, since I have spoken with Mr. Danly a couple of times.
    Commissioner, you have said in terms of capacity value, one 
nameplate megawatt of wind or solar is not equal to one 
nameplate megawatt of gas, coal, or nuclear. And even if every 
unit waiting in the PJM queue was interconnected, it would not 
solve the reliability problem caused by rapid loss of 
dispatchable generation. You touched on this a little with my 
colleague from Ohio, Mr. Johnson, but why is that, and can you 
expand on the inherent issues with weather-dependent resources?
    Mr. Christie. So PJM right now has told us that they are 
looking at the loss of about 40 gigawatts of generating 
capacity in the next 5 years. And I have also been told by the 
market monitors it is really closer to 50 gigawatts. So whether 
it is 40 gigawatts or whether it is even worse at 50 gigawatts, 
so you lose that generating capacity, most of which is 
dispatchable.
    So in the queue, if you clear the whole queue you don't--90 
percent of the queue is wind, solar, or battery. And so, since 
one megawatt of--in terms of capacity value, a mega--a rated 
capacity, let's say, of a hundred megawatts on a generator but 
it is wind, it is not a hundred megawatts that's going to run 
24/7/365, it is going to run intermittently. And so valuing 
capacity is one of the big challenges that RTOs do.
    Nuclear is going to run 90 percent-plus of the time. Gas--
combined cycle gas can--is--has a capacity factor north of 90 
percent as well, it runs all the time. So when you look at what 
your resources are in the future, if you lose 40 to 50 
gigawatts of a dispatchable--of dispatchable resources and you 
are putting on an equal number of megawatts of wind or solar, 
you just aren't getting the same capacity value.
    Now there are other ways to make up the gap. You have to 
make up the gap. And so how you make up that gap is the big 
challenge that the RTOs face. But that is the problem, and it 
is arithmetic. It is--you know, you are just not replacing the 
resources that you are losing.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentlemen and now go to the 
gentleman from Augusta, Georgia, home of Vogtle Nuclear Power 
Plant, Mr. Allen, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Allen. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, you 
know, this important hearing with our Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, and thank you for being here today.
    Ensuring reliable, affordable energy is critical to the 
mission of--it is critical to your mission, so I am glad to 
have this opportunity to discuss some impacts in my home State 
of Georgia. My district is home to the first new nuclear units 
being built in the U.S. in more than three decades. The Vogtle 
project has created thousands of jobs and will provide long-
term reliable and affordable power to Georgians.
    The Georgia Public Service Commission had the ability to 
approve a project like this, a project that will change the 
energy landscape in our State and country, because Georgia's 
energy regulatory structure values reliability and holds 
utilities accountable for keeping the lights on.
    Commissioner Christie, should all States and markets be 
focused on building and investing in reliable assets like 
nuclear plants?
    Mr. Christie. Well, your State is a vertically integrated, 
State-regulated State, and so those decisions are made by the 
State, the State regulator, the PSC. In RTO States, it is not 
that simple. In RTO States, especially if they what is called 
deregulated--and PJM is a good example--then they are going to 
have to seek their reliability resources in what we call the 
capacity market. And we have a lot of problems in the capacity 
markets right now, a lot of problems as to whether they are 
delivering the incentives to get the resources built that 
actually are necessary for reliability.
    So I think every State ultimately has to determine what is 
the best way for it to achieve resource adequacy. Georgia does 
it in a vertically integrated, State-regulated model where 
units are built in rate-based, and so they are not worried 
about capacity markets and the assurance of getting financing.
    Mr. Allen. Have you all looked at the impact of States that 
are vertically integrated versus those States that are dealing 
with this situation and are actually shutting down certain gas, 
coal, nuclear power? And obviously their citizens are already 
experiencing brownouts in difficult weather situations. I mean, 
so what is the impact going to be State to State if some States 
allow this to happen?
    Mr. Christie. You know, I think every State's got to decide 
how they want to serve their consumers. I think that the 
vertically integrated, State-regulated model has worked very 
well, and I think if you look at the RTO versus non-RTO States 
and the data, the rates are actually lower in non-RTO States 
than they are in RTO States.
    Mr. Allen. Right.
    Mr. Christie. Now there's outliers both places, OK? But 
overall, the rates are lower in non-RTO States than in RTO 
States. But it is really, ultimately the States have got to ask 
themselves, looking at the various--and there is a lot of 
different models around the country. There's RTOs that have 
capacity markets like PJM. There is an RTO that does not have a 
capacity market. SPP is the example.
    So States have really got to step up and ask themselves, 
``What is the best model for us?'' And I don't think FERC ought 
to be telling them what they ought to do.
    Mr. Allen. Right.
    Mr. Christie. I think the States have got to decide what is 
the best model for us. And you certainly got a whole wide array 
across the country that you can choose from. I think States 
ought to be looking at the different models. I think Georgia's 
model, frankly, is a very good one. I think they ought to stick 
with it.
    Mr. Allen. Right.
    Mr. Christie. But that is the decision for Georgia to make.
    Mr. Allen. Well, but the public needs to understand the 
repercussions of some of the--what some of these States are 
deciding is--and particularly residents in those States and--
let me ask you this, the reliability risk if we stop building 
assets like natural gas and nuclear generation, and try to 
transition too quickly to renewable energy--which is what we 
are seeing right now--if you look down the road, where are we 
going to be?
    Mr. Christie. As I said at the very beginning of this, I 
think if we continue to lose dispatchable resources, I think we 
are going to be in a catastrophic situation with loss of power 
and outages, and those are--you know, a weeklong outage such as 
we saw in Texas during Winter Storm Uri is catastrophic. There 
is no other word for it. People die. They freeze to death. And 
we don't want that in the United States of America. And I 
don't--and I think we have got to have the resources to make 
sure that we don't suffer that kind of catastrophic outcome.
    Mr. Allen. Well, thank you for that. And you did write a 
letter--or we wrote a letter. In a letter you wrote back to 
Chairwoman Rodgers and Chairman Duncan in May of 2023, ``While 
no regulatory construct is perfect, all have their flaws, I 
believe that on balance, the State-regulated integrated 
resource plan construct is the most effective in dealing with 
consumer cost'' and that sort of thing. And you obviously still 
believe that that is the best way to go, is the State-
integrated system.
    Mr. Christie. If I was in a State and somebody asked me how 
would you do it, that is how I would do it. I think that is--
that model served the United States for a long, long time to 
give us one of the best and most enviable power systems in the 
world.
    The whole RTO system--we could talk about this for hours. 
The whole RTO system really is rooted in what was called 
deregulation in the late 1990s and early 2000s. And I think 
there has been a lot of flaws that have been exposed in that, 
but even that, they are different models. I mean, my State, 
Virginia, we went into an RTO, but we kept the vertically 
integrated, State-regulated model, so we were sort of half in, 
half out, you could put it that way. But I am glad we kept the 
model we kept.
    Mr. Allen. Right.
    Mr. Christie. But, again, there is no--there are flaws in 
every system. There is no perfect system. And it is--you are 
not choosing the best model, you are choosing the tradeoffs you 
want to make.
    Mr. Allen. Right. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. I will now go to Idaho 
to Mr. Fulcher for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Fulcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
being here and--to the panelists, and for the information 
today.
    I am going to direct the first part of this to Mr. Christie 
but probably try to get some input from Mr. Danly as well as 
least here. But we have a natural gas pipeline system that runs 
through the Pacific Northwest, including my State of Idaho and 
also California. It is called the GTN Xpress. And there is some 
relatively small improvements that need to be made on the 
compressor stations for that pipeline, and they are all--and it 
is already in place. Those are on private lands.
    Last October, the Idaho delegation, the entire delegation, 
and our Idaho Governor sent FERC Commissioners a letter in 
support of this upgrade. And, Mr. Chairman, I would like to 
enter that letter into the record if I may, please.
    Mr. Duncan. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Fulcher. FERC's response to us came on November 29, and 
it simply wanted to look at the elements of the EIS that it 
received in November. And that was generally the response. But 
it has now been 8 months, and nothing has happened on that. And 
this was also not included on the June 15 open meeting agenda, 
so I have to assume that it is still outstanding and that delay 
is ongoing.
    The delay appears to have started with former Chair Glick's 
decision to have FERC staff complete a lengthier EIS rather 
than the environmental assessment under NEPA, and I just need 
to underscore this is not a new project, and so I am trying to 
contemplate why this would need to be done over again with a 
new I--EIS is difficult here, because there has been no 
significant environmental impacts.
    So I would just like to ask, Mr. Christie, if you could 
address that, bring that to bear, why the delay on this?
    Mr. Christie. Are you asking the Chairman, or are you 
asking me?
    Mr. Fulcher. Mr. Christie.
    Mr. Christie. That is me, OK.
    Mr. Fulcher. OK.
    Mr. Christie. Well, I think that is a pending proceeding, 
and so we can't talk about it anyway.
    Mr. Fulcher. So----
    Mr. Christie. I don't think we are allowed to talk about 
it.
    Mr. Fulcher [continuing]. Nothing for 8 months, and so--and 
nothing on the agenda.
    Mr. Christie. Well, if it is a pending proceeding, we can't 
talk about it. I can't answer why a letter that was sent to----
    Mr. Fulcher. OK, then we will ask the Chairman. Mr. 
Chairman?
    Mr. Christie [continuing]. The former Chairman didn't get 
answered.
    Mr. Phillips. Mr. Christie made a good point. This is a 
pending proceeding. You are right, we had--EIS was performed 
for this particular project, just talking procedurally here.
    Mr. Fulcher. So why----
    Mr. Phillips. That was----
    Mr. Fulcher [continuing]. Did we need to do a new EIS?
    Mr. Phillips. That was a decision that was made----
    Mr. Fulcher. By?
    Mr. Phillips. Not by me.
    Mr. Fulcher. Well, you are the Chairman.
    Mr. Phillips. What I have tried to focus on is moving 
forward expeditiously as we can and speeding up our reviews.
    Mr. Fulcher. Mr. Chairman, it has been 8----
    Mr. Phillips. Based upon advice from our----
    Mr. Fulcher. It is 8 months, nothing on the agenda.
    Mr. Phillips. We will act on projects when they are ready.
    Mr. Fulcher. The level of dependence on this is very 
significant, and we just don't seem to be getting any kind of a 
response.
    Mr. Phillips. We understand. We are working as diligently 
as we can. I am very proud of the progress that we have made on 
projects. This is another project that is a part of the backlog 
that we have inherited----
    Mr. Fulcher. Mr. Chairman, there appears to be a pattern, 
and it appears to be a political one. If there is anything that 
has to do with infrastructure, energy infrastructure, the 
extraction industries, there appears to be a pattern here that 
things just get delayed and all of the sudden there has got be 
a whole other set of processes done on something that is in 
existence. And so please take that as constructive as you will, 
and we are going to continue to stay on top of this.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. All right, the gentleman yields back. I'll go 
to North Dakota, Mr. Armstrong, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Armstrong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Commissioner Danly, FERC's 2022 draft policy statement 
appears to incorporate the feedback of activist groups that 
call for weighing end use when making certification 
determinations. This would seem to me to adjust FERC's economic 
regulatory goal to one of a regional planning entity. Isn't 
that inconsistent with FERC's statutory mission?
    Mr. Danly. Yes, it would be.
    Mr. Armstrong. Does FERC actually have jurisdiction over 
upstream production or downstream use?
    Mr. Danly. Not only do we not have conduc--jurisdiction 
conferred, it is specifically excepted from our jurisdiction in 
the NGA.
    Mr. Armstrong. You note in your dissent to the 2022 updated 
policy statement that the Natural Gas Policy Act, Wellhead 
Decontrol Act, and the changes to the Fuel Use Act altered the 
natural gas market. You go on to say that these deregulatory 
changes were not at play in the Transco case. Can you explain 
how the statutory and regulatory changes in the decades after 
Transco are instructive for limiting FERC's ability to consider 
end use?
    Mr. Danly. So we have two different statutes that we have--
that--in every Section 7 case. We have NEPA, which requires a 
review of the environmental consequences of a major Federal 
action, then we have the Natural Gas Act. The Natural Gas Act 
gives us clear jurisdiction over the actual facility, the 
pipeline, from beginning to end of the pipeline. And our 
obligation under the NGA is to ensure the orderly development 
of the infrastructure that gets plentiful supplies of natural 
gas to customers at reasonable prices.
    We do not have jurisdiction over the ultimate end use of 
the gas nor over the production or gathering facilities. And so 
our NGA inquiry is not--is cabined to the actual facility. And 
under NEPA, we are not obligated to consider any effects over 
which we don't have jurisdiction. That is a Supreme Court case, 
Public Citizens, unambiguous. You do not have to consider those 
effects that are outside your jurisdiction. And because we 
don't do things like license gathering facilities or the 
generators that burn the gas, it is not obligate--we are not 
obligated to consider it.
    Mr. Armstrong. So when you guys are continuing--I mean, 
doing these, are you taking into account Supreme Court cases 
from other agencies that are going on at this point in time, 
like West Virginia v. EPA or--I mean, is anybody taking those 
analyses and applying it to what I would argue is a 
nonstatutory expansion of FERC's role?
    Mr. Danly. I will speak for myself. You will find cases 
like that in my dissents when I disagree with the Commission's 
decisions. But, ultimately, even if we don't restrain 
ourselves, the hope is that ultimately the courts are going to, 
and they will chastise us and tell us to stay in our lane 
properly.
    Mr. Armstrong. I have a different viewpoint from that. I--
my position is whether we want to or not, the Supreme Court is 
going to start forcing Congress to do its job, which I think 
would be a good thing as well.
    For decades, States have cooperated in the pipeline 
approval process by responsibly acting on the requirements in 
Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. But over the last 10 years, 
certain States seem to have abused this authority to meet 
political end goals outside the intent of the law. Do you think 
States' recent misuse of Section 401 has undermined the Natural 
Gas Act?
    Mr. Danly. Yes. And, in fact, the Natural Gas Act was 
specifically amended to give the condemnation authority to the 
certificate holder because decades and decades ago States began 
refusing to use their condemnation power for projects that they 
were opposed to, and so to create a coherent statutory 
universal scheme for the country, it was amended. Section 401, 
though, is only one of the two keys to this. The other is NEPA 
reform. And in the absence of reforming both of those, we still 
have a lot of potential litigation risk to all the Section 7s 
ahead--in front of us.
    Mr. Armstrong. Well, a lot of ink has been spilled all 
across the country about the increase in the debt ceiling last 
week, but one of the positive notes I think coming through that 
has been some of that--the initial stages to NEPA reform. And 
by the way, that is going to help all energy infrastructure 
projects, not just gas, not just coal. But one agency 
permitting shot clocks and time limits are going to be a really 
huge issue.
    I am going to end with just one of these things, and this 
is kind of a statement from somebody who--you talk about power 
outages in Texas causing loss of life. I live in a different 
part of the country. Power outages in January in North Dakota 
are going to signifi-- I mean, would be absolutely 
catastrophic. And FERC needs to make sure RTOs like MISO are 
significantly more accurate in their forecasts.
    MISO's load forecast for 2023 to 2024 is 92,000 megawatts. 
MISO's load during the Winter Storm Elliott in December of 2022 
was 104,000 megawatts. And the low load forecast equal less 
resources to needed--needed to meet power needs and 
ridiculously low payments for capacity because it is not 
needed. Meaning my traditional--or my baseload power sources in 
places like North Dakota are not rewarded for providing power 
to the system when it is needed, and it disincentives baseload 
units because they are not rewarded for providing the power 
when they have to.
    And at the very least, this is going to force early 
retirements, all of this because we are not requiring RTOs to 
be more realistic in how much power they need. And just 
yesterday somebody really smart told me that you can provide 
renewable power for 360 out of 365 days a year, but you better 
have dispatchable power for the other 5 days. And until we 
figure that out, the least we could do from FERC is make sure 
that these estimates are actually rewarding the people 
providing baseload power, because the financial disincentive is 
going to be catastrophic to places like my home State of North 
Dakota.
    And with that, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I now go to Mr. 
Pfluger from Texas.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the 
witnesses for being here.
    I am very concerned about the regulatory environment that 
we have in this country as it relates to what my colleagues 
have been talking about, which is the ability to produce that 
reliable power when we need it.
    After the Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia v. The EPA, 
the EPA began issuing rulemaking on May 11, 2023, that would 
limit greenhouse gas emissions for fossil fuel-fired power 
plants, including both new and existing gas-fired plants and 
from existing coal-fired plants as part of the Clean Air Act. 
And the U.S. EIA explained that, of all the utility-scale 
electricity last year, 39.8 percent was generated by natural 
gas, 19\1/2\ by coal, 21.5 by renewables, unreliables, and the 
EPA's proposal would directly basically attack 59.3 percent of 
the electricity generation.
    So when Secretary Granholm was in front of this committee, 
I asked her the question, where is this power going to come 
from and how much will it take if we do the EV plan that the 
administration is proposing, and she said it will double. The 
electricity demand will double.
    So, Commission Danly, when you think about this, how will 
the EPA's Clean Power Plan 2.0 impact FERC's mission to deliver 
affordable and reliable energy to consumers across the country?
    Mr. Danly. Anything that raises the cost of providing 
dispatchable power in our jurisdictional markets, the RTOs and 
ISOs--anything that raises the cost of those generators is 
going to drive them into early retirement as long as those 
markets are--have their prices skewed by subsidies and do not 
compensate the preexisting generation to keep them economically 
viable.
    Mr. Pfluger. Are we--has anybody done the math on this if 
we do this EV plan by 2032 or whatever the latest year is?
    Mr. Danly. I have every confidence that somebody has done 
the math. FERC's role, of course, is simply to ensure----
    Mr. Pfluger. Sure.
    Mr. Danly [continuing]. That the rates for power and 
interstate commerce are just and reasonable. We can establish 
compensation mechanisms, but until we actually insulate our 
markets from the effects of subsidies and we compensate 
correctly to ensure solvency, we are going to see more 
premature retirements and we are going to see the reliability 
of the system jeopardized.
    Mr. Pfluger. Yes. It is a national security issue. We have 
the resources here, and we need to use these.
    Commissioner Phillips--Chairman Phillips, I want to switch 
to some issues with our LNG export terminals, and I want to ask 
you, are you aware of the additional recommendations that FERC 
staff have placed and are placing on the LNG export facilities?
    Mr. Phillips. I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?
    Mr. Pfluger. Yes. Are you aware of the additional 
recommendations that FERC and the staff has placed on LNG 
export facilities?
    Mr. Phillips. We have actually--since I have taken over in 
January, I have instructed staff to actually streamline our 
processes regarding LNG. Based upon recommendations from our 
staff, we have chosen to institute EAs as opposed to EISs where 
appropriate. This is not a categorical decision, but this is 
done on a case-by-case basis.
    Mr. Pfluger. I would like to work with you on this, because 
currently there are seven LNG export terminals in the lower 48 
that went through a multiyear review by FERC before receiving 
their authorizations to construct and operate. And it is my 
understanding that while these facilities have been in 
operation that FERC staff over the past several years have 
recommended changes and modifications to the facilities even 
after they have been reviewed and fully approved. That is my 
concern right now.
    So if you are saying that you have streamlined this 
process, we need these facilities to be up and running in order 
to get that product to market, and that--and we are having 
complaints that that is actually not happening.
    Mr. Phillips. I understand your frustration. I would love 
to work with your staff to get----
    Mr. Pfluger. We need to follow up on that. Lastly, in 
February of 2022, FERC issued two draft policy statements that 
I believe overstepped the agency's permitting authority: a 
certification of new interstate natural gas facilities and 
consideration of greenhouse gas emissions and natural gas 
infrastructure project reviews.
    My question, Chairman Phillips, is that I know that these 
were issued under your predecessor, Chairman Glick, but these 
policies hang over industry's head and are a deterrent to 
investment in reliable baseload energy production. Can you 
provide me an update as to the status of these policy 
statements?
    Mr. Phillips. Absolutely. They are now draft policy 
statements. We are using the 1999 gas policy statement right 
now to move forward projects. It is working. I think there are 
opportunities for us to improve the legal durability of our 
decisions.
    We are one of the most litigated agencies in all of 
government, so where we can improve what we do, I think we 
should try to do that. I am working with my colleagues. We 
continue to negotiate. I want a bipartisan policy statement to 
come out, something that can live beyond this composition of 
the Commission and it can give expectations to utilities as 
well as communities and every stakeholder that we have in our 
process.
    Mr. Pfluger. Chairman, my time is expired. We would love to 
have bipartisanship on this issue, but we have to get to the 
point where we could build things in this country and we can 
have sustainable, reliable, affordable energy, and we need your 
help doing it instead of stopping projects that are on their 
way to being built.
    Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. In 1984, Kevin 
Butler kicked a field goal to--for Georgia to beat my Clemson 
Tigers as time expired. The gentleman from Georgia just beat 
the clock, and he is recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Carter. And go Dawgs.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having this 
hearing, and thank all of you for being here. Thank you for the 
work that you do. It does not go unnoticed. We know it is not 
an easy job, it is a tough job, but it is a necessary job, and 
sincerely, we appreciate all of your efforts and your work.
    We all understand how abundant and affordable energy, how 
important it is. And I know that--I believe all of you agree 
with that, and I believe all of you work toward that same 
common goal that we have. And--but, unfortunately, as we have 
seen, and particularly over the past few years, that one 
essential ingredient has been taken for granted, and that is 
the reliability, and that is certainly something that we need 
to make sure that we have.
    Many of you pointed it out, in fact, saying there is a 
looming reliability crisis in our electrical market--
electricity markets. Commissioner Danly said that. And the 
United States is heading for a very catastrophic situation in 
terms of reliability. Commissioner Christie said that.
    And that is what concerns me, is that--and we talked about 
this before. It is almost as if it is going to take a 
catastrophic event in order to get our attention. And I hate to 
see that happen. I hope that we can do something about it 
before we witness that catastrophic event, and I think we would 
be better served--obviously we would be better served if that 
did happen.
    Chairman Phillips, you said we face unprecedent challenges 
through reliability of our Nation's electric system, and I 
couldn't agree more. But I have to say that these issues are 
different across the country. Now, I live in southeast Georgia, 
in the Southeastern United States. Georgia has been selected as 
the best State to do business in for, I think, 9 straight years 
now.
    And one of the reasons for that is because we have 
reliable, affordable energy. If we didn't have that, businesses 
wouldn't be coming to the State of Georgia. So that is one 
thing that we are very proud of and certainly that we have 
worked hard on.
    I want to ask you, Commissioner Clements, you submitted 
test--your submitted testimony suggests that conducting studies 
and holding conferences to try to solve the reliability issues 
and other concerns in the RTO markets. Are there lessons to be 
learned that we can learn from the success of markets that are 
already providing long-term reliable and affordable energy like 
in Georgia and in the Southeast region?
    Ms. Clements. Thank you, Congressman. As Commissioner 
Christie has discussed, the regions have different regulatory 
frameworks. There are lots of lessons to be learned from 
looking at both the regions that don't have RTO markets and the 
regions that do. In the regions that do have those markets, I 
think what we are seeing now and the reason that prices have 
stayed low in capacity markets and PJM, is that they are 
talking about resource adequacy. That is how much steel do we 
have in the ground.
    The trouble we are facing right now in the winters across 
the country is an energy adequacy problem. The problem is none 
of these resource types were designed to withstand freezing-
cold temperatures for 8 days at a time, and so they all failed. 
All types of resources had trouble. So did the production of 
gas, so did the transport of gas.
    So what we have to do is say, OK, how do we evolve these 
market rules? They are not static. They are not stuck. They are 
not an end to themselves. What we need to do is evolve them so 
that on a going-forward basis, the markets are sending signals 
that generators fix these problems, that they produce the kind 
of resources we need, and that they are will--they are able to 
perform in times of shortage such as extreme weather.
    Mr. Carter. OK. Well, thank you for that. Now, I want to 
shift kind of a little bit here and talk more about natural gas 
because natural gas is a big part of what we do in the State of 
Georgia. We don't generate energy in the State of Georgia, with 
the exception of, and I am sure my colleague to my--my 
delegation colleague mentioned the fact that we just have two 
nuclear reactors started up in the State of Georgia, which we 
are very proud of and worked hard on that.
    But we don't really generate a lot of electricity, so we 
depend on natural gas and particularly on pipelines, and we 
don't have enough pipelines, and we all understand that.
    Commissioner Christie, you have said that the U.S. is not--
is already not building enough pipelines to transport a 
sufficient amount of gas to maintain a steady and reliable 
supply of energy. What is FERC doing to ensure that we have got 
adequate pipeline capacity to meet demands?
    Mr. Christie. Well, what FERC is doing is, when 
applications are filed with us, of course, we are going to act 
on those applications. The problem is, I think last year or the 
year before, we hit the lowest number of new constructed 
pipelines in, like, the last 30, 40 years.
    Mr. Carter. Is there a reason for that? I mean, are they 
being denied and they have just not applied?
    Mr. Christie. FERC is approving pipelines in due course as 
they come into us. I think the numbers dropped, but a lot of 
the pipelines that FERC approves, they end up being appealed. 
Every single one is challenged. Every single gas facility, 
Greenfield pipeline, Brownfield pipeline where you are 
replacing an existing pipeline with an updated, better-
engineered pipeline, compressor stations, you name it, they are 
being challenged in this national legal campaign, which is 
deliberately trying to drive up the cost of even starting a 
pipeline or any kind of facility in the hope that, well, if you 
raise the cost through litigation, eventually they will just go 
away and stop, and no one will invest in them.
    And that is what is happening. And we are not getting 
nearly enough of the capacity we are going to have to have. Gas 
is the backup fuel of choice. Gas is--the head of NERC has 
described gas as the balancing fuel of the future because gas 
is what has to balance the system when the intermittent 
resources are not producing. And so you have to have them 
together. You can't have wind and solar by themselves. You have 
to have gas as the balancing fuel to run when they don't. It is 
just--you have to be an engineer to figure that out.
    Mr. Carter. Right.
    Mr. Christie. But we are not building the pipeline capacity 
to serve those gas-generating units that are critically 
important to balance the system. Again, the system has to be 
balanced every second of every minute of every hour or every 
day. You----
    Mr. Carter. Right. And I am way over time.
    Mr. Christie. OK.
    Mr. Carter. But I appreciate your response. And, again, 
thank all of you for the work that you do. It does not go 
unnoticed.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. It is not always saving 
the best for last.
    Seeing there are no further Members wishing to ask 
questions, I would like to thank all of our witnesses. Chairman 
Phillips, Commissioner Danly, Commissioner Clements, 
Commissioner Christie, great testimony. Thanks for answering 
the questions today.
    I ask unanimous consent to insert in the record documents 
included on the staff hearing documents list.
    So without objection, that will be it.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr. Duncan. And we will stand adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 1:19 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
