                                       U.S. Senate,
                               Committee on Indian Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:52 p.m. in room 
628, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Brian Schatz, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII

    The Chairman. Good afternoon. Thanks for waiting. Sorry for 
being late. We had a vote that started a bit late.
    During today's legislative hearing, we will consider four 
bills: S. 2783, Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act; S. 
3406, Technical Corrections to the Northwestern New Mexico 
Rural Water Projects Act, Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights 
Settlement Act, and Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act; S. 3857, 
Jamul Indian Village Land Transfer Act; and S. 4365, Veterinary 
Services to Improve Public Health in Rural Communities Act.
    S. 2783 was introduced by Senators Rubio and Scott. The 
bill would amend the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include a 
tribal residential area known as Osceola Camp into the 
Miccosukee Reserved Area, and authorize $14 million for 
activities to protect the camp from flooding.
    S. 3406 was introduced by Senators Lujan and Heinrich. This 
bill would authorize approximately $18.5 million in back 
interest payments into three Indian water rights settlement 
trust funds benefiting the Navajo Nation, Nambe Pueblo, 
Pojoaque Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, and Tesuque Pueblo, and 
Taos Pueblo pursuant to their ratified rights settlements.
    S. 3857 was introduced by Senators Padilla and Butler. This 
bill would transfer into trust status approximately 172 acres 
currently owned in fee simple status by the Jamul Tribe, 
clarify the applicability of Federal law and regulation to 
those lands and prohibit gaming activities under the Indian 
Gaming Regulatory Act on those lands.
    S. 4365 was introduced by Vice Chair Murkowski. This bill 
would authorize the Indian Health Service to support public 
health veterinary services to prevent and control rabies and 
other zoonotic disease transmission in IHS service areas. You 
can tell my staff wrote this, because I would never have 
written the word zoonotic.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. Before I turn to the Vice Chair for her 
opening statement, I would like to extend my appreciation and 
welcome to our witnesses for joining us today. I look forward 
to your testimony and our discussion.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?

               STATEMENT OF HON. LISA MURKOWSKI, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate 
today's hearing. You have given a good run-down on the other 
bills on the agenda, but I want to speak to S. 4365, which is 
our Veterinary Services to Improve Public Health in Rural 
Communities. It would authorize the Indian Health Srvice to 
offer public health veterinary services, including spay and 
neuter services, to tribes to help reduce the number of stray 
dogs in Native communities.
    The over-population of stray and abandoned dogs in Indian 
Country is a significant public health and safety issue. More 
than 250,000 reservation dogs, as they are often called, roam 
the Navajo Nation alone.
    I have introduced S. 4365 because Alaska Native children 
experience the highest incidences of hospitalization from dog 
attacks than any other group in the Nation, and we need to deal 
with it. According to IHS data, an average of 4,800 tribal 
members are hospitalized or receive outpatient care for dog 
bites each year. Some studies indicate that tribal areas 
experience a death rate from dog attacks that is 35 times 
higher than the rest of the Nation. Most of these cases are 
either in Alaska or on the Navajo Nation.
    Even a non-fatal dog bite comes with serious emotional, 
economic, and public health costs. Dog bites can of course 
transmit rabies, parasites and other zoonotic diseases. I am 
with you on the zoonotic diseases; I think we get rabies, 
right, parasites. But they transmit diseases to humans and 
unvaccinated animals. Medical treatments can be terrifying for 
children and elders, often involving significant time away from 
home and a series of painful rabies shots.
    Under current law, the IHS lacks sufficient legal authority 
to carry out veterinary services directly or in partnership 
with the tribe under a 638 self-governance agreement. We know 
that, because at least two tribal organizations in Alaska tried 
to add veterinary services to their multi-year funding 
agreements. They were denied by IHS.
    So my bill would address this gap in health services by 
amending the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to state 
clearly that public health veterinary services are an 
authorized service of the IHS. That way, these services can be 
included in a tribe's funding agreement under ISDEA.
    The bill would also allow the IHS to assign veterinarians 
commissioned by Public Health Service Commissioned Corps to IHS 
service areas where rabies are endemic. Note there is no 
requirement that IHS assign such officers. It only authorizes 
it as yet another tool in the tool box when we absolutely need 
it.
    Dogs have significant historic and cultural ties in Alaska 
Native communities. Individuals and families depend on their 
dogs, and when that relationship becomes distressing or 
disturbing for any reason, like a rabid dog in a village 
requiring all of the dogs in the village to be euthanized, it 
can be a source of great trauma. So we have to get some help 
here.
    My office worked with a number of tribal members and 
organizations in drafting this. I would like to recognize one 
person in particular for his efforts, and that is Donald 
Charlie. Don is a former musher and a tribal leader of the 
Nenana Native Village. He pushed for passage of three 
resolutions by the Alaska Federation of Natives, calling 
attention to the lack of veterinary care in Native communities.
    Don's leadership on this issue helped us produce a bill 
that is supported by organizations like the Alaska Federation 
of Natives, Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, as well as 
the American Veterinary Medical Association.
    This is a commonsense piece of legislation that ensures the 
Federal Government lives up to its trust obligations while 
providing a humane, non-lethal option for animal population 
control.
    I am looking forward to hearing from our witnesses today on 
not only my bill, but the others before the Committee.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Vice Chair Murkowski.
    Are there any other members who would like to make an 
opening statement? Senator Lujan.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair 
Murkowski, for your thoughtfulness and for bringing us to this 
hearing today.
    I am especially appreciative that this hearing includes my 
legislation, the Technical Corrections to the Northwestern New 
Mexico Rural Water Projects Act, the Taos Pueblo Indian Water 
Rights Settlement Act, and the Aamodt Litigation Settlement 
Act.
    Between 2009 and 2010, Congress enacted several water 
rights settlements, which included the Northwestern New Mexico 
Rural Water Projects Act, Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights 
Settlement Act, and the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, 
benefitting six tribes. These settlements are part of the 
Federal Government's trust responsibility to providing water to 
tribes and to pueblos.
    While the enactment of the settlements is vital to ensure 
that the Navajo Nation, Taos Pueblo, the Pueblos of Nambe, 
Tesuque, Pojoaque and San Ildefonso have access to water, the 
enacted settlements included an unconventional prohibition 
preventing the Department of Interior from investing the trust 
funds from the settlements before specific dates. This 
prohibition on investment resulted in tribes and pueblos 
missing out on interest earnings that other settlements enjoy.
    This legislation presented before the Committee will 
authorize $18.4 million for the three water settlement trust 
funds to collect interest that they are owed from their enacted 
settlements to create much-needed water infrastructure. This 
will help us fulfill our trust responsibility and promote water 
security for tribes and pueblos, as well as non-tribal users, 
in New Mexico.
    I appreciate the willingness of the Department of the 
Interior in working with me and my office to address 
prohibitions impacting the settlements from being able to fully 
see the potential of the funds. I look forward to hearing from 
our witnesses today and working with the Chair and Vice Chair 
on moving this legislation forward in order to bring these 
much-needed resources quickly to the communities who most need 
them.
    Thank you for the time. I yield back.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Lujan.
    I will now turn to our witnesses. We would like to 
introduce the Honorable Melanie Anne Egorin, Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation at Health and Human Services; Mr. 
Jason Freihage, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management at 
the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs at the 
Department of Interior; the Honorable Talbert Cypress, 
Chairman, Miccosukee Tribe of Indians in Miami, Florida.
    Senator Padilla, would you like to introduce your witness?

                STATEMENT OF HON. ALEX PADILLA, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA

    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Vice 
Chair Murkowski, for the hearing today.
    I am honored to introduce Erica Pinto, the Chairwoman of 
Jamul Indian Village in California, who will be testifying 
today, albeit remotely. I also welcome the several members of 
the tribal council who are in the audience.
    Ms. Pinto proudly serves as the first woman elected as 
chair of Jamul since 2015. She has been involved with the 
tribal council for over 23 years, having first become a council 
member at the age of 21.
    Her leadership extends well beyond the tribe, however. Ms. 
Pinto also serves on tribal advisory committees for the 
Departments of Health and Human Services and the Interior, 
where she advises Federal agencies on intra-governmental 
responsibilities and obligations.
    She has consistently led on efforts to improve tribal 
health care and to bring additional focus to the missing and 
murdered indigenous peoples crisis.
    As chairwoman, Ms. Pinto has led the tribes to significant 
economic progress on their path to self-reliance. She grew up 
with her three brothers on the Jamul Indian Village and 
reservations, where she witnessed firsthand the hardships her 
people faced. Her mother was also very active in tribal 
government for several decades, so her leadership and 
commitment to serve the tribe comes as no surprise.
    S. 3857, the legislation before this Committee today, would 
place approximately 172 acres of land into trust for the 
benefit of the tribe. After years of sacrifice and their 
efforts to achieve self-determination, the Jamul Indian Village 
deserves a true homeland to preserve their sacred history and 
bring together their community for generations to come.
    It has been an honor to work alongside the chairwoman and 
the entire tribe on this, as we week not just to permanently 
safeguard their home but maintain their rich history and 
traditions for future generations. I want to thank Chairwoman 
Pinto for her leadership and for her testimony today.
    Mr. Chair, before I close, I would just like to make a 
brief comment to Deputy Secretary Freihage. I want to thank you 
for your testimony today and the BIA's support for this 
legislation. We have been in touch with the Bureau also on 
several tribal gaming applications submitted by tribes in 
California.
    I would like to formally request a BIA ``in-person 
consultation'' with the impacted tribal governments who have 
weighed in on these applications but have been unable to meet 
with leadership at the Bureau or the Department, here in 
Washington, in person, to address their concerns. It is 
imperative that the department meet with these tribes and live 
up to their tribal consultation commitments.
    With that, thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for this hearing.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Padilla.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I would like to introduce a witness that is joining us 
virtually, from Alaska. Brian Lefferts is a Commander in the 
U.S. Public Health Service Commission Corps. He currently 
serves as the Director of Public Health at the Yukon Kuskokwim 
Health Corporation in Bethel, Alaska. This is a tribal non-
profit health care organization serving 58 communities in 
southwest Alaska.
    Commander Lefferts has spent 18 years with YKHC, serving 
several positions, working on a wide array of public health 
issues, including disease investigation, population health 
management, nutrition, and environmental health. I am looking 
forward to his testimony on S. 4365, and his insights into the 
real-world impact of animal overpopulation and the risks of 
rabies within our rural communities.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Vice Chair.
    We will now proceed to our testimony. We would like 
everybody to confine their remarks to five minutes or less, and 
we will start with the Honorable Melanie Anne Egorin. Please 
proceed with your testimony.

         STATEMENT OF HON. MELANIE ANNE EGORIN, Ph.D., 
   ASSISTANT SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
                            SERVICES

    Ms. Egorin. Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair 
Murkowski, and members of the Committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to provide testimony on an important legislative 
proposal before your Committee, and for your continued support 
for the Department and the Indian Health Service in its efforts 
to health and well-being of American Indians and Alaska 
Natives.
    I am Melanie Anne Egorin, the Assistant Secretary for 
Legislation at the Department of Health and Human Services. It 
is my pleasure to join the Committee again, as we work together 
to combat the public health challenges in tribal communities.
    The Department and IHS agree that the increase in injuries 
and zoonotic disease spread by animals in Indian Country 
represents a significant public health issue for tribal members 
in these rural communities. In recent years, free-roaming 
domestic animals have contributed to rabies outbreaks on tribal 
lands, human deaths due to zoonotic diseases, and severe injury 
and deaths due to mauling.
    The Department is working as a whole through diverse 
offices and mission areas to address the public health concerns 
related to zoonotic diseases, including but not limited to 
rabies. The IHS already coordinates with and assists tribes 
with animal population control efforts to the extent 
practicable but within its authorities.
    Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and the Commissioned Corps of the United States 
Public Health Service help to lead the department's efforts on 
the national surveillance of and education about rabies and 
other zoonotic diseases.
    While it recognizes the importance of this emergent threat 
in Indian Country, the IHS has to balance its limited resources 
to deliver direct services to its defined population while 
combating a number of unique public health challenges facing 
Indian Country. The Biden Harris Administration has advocated 
for additional resources to combat these growing threats in 
Indian Country and is committed to fighting to reduce health 
disparities impacting tribal members.
    The IHS has examined first-hand and heard directly from 
tribes, especially those in northern Alaska, about the real 
public health risk from the high rates of dog bite injuries in 
tribal communities. Over the past five years, there have been 
over 200 patients hospitalized from dog bite injuries or 
attacks and an additional 24,000 who received ambulatory 
services at IHS clinics. The Navajo, Alaska, Great Plains, and 
Phoenix Areas have had the highest numbers of bite-related 
hospitalizations over the last five years. We know that tribes 
are desperate for assistance in addressing the problems at its 
source.
    The IHS authorizing statute does not currently convey 
authority to carry out veterinary services. As IHS does not 
have this authority, there is no authority for a tribal health 
program to add veterinary services to its ISDEA agreement. 
Within their authority, the IHS, CDC and USPHS collaborate in 
careful coordination with other tribal, Federal, State, county 
and external partners to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease 
spread in Indian Country.
    The IHS Division of Environmental Health Services staff 
work on surveillance, training and capacity building, and have 
been involved for decades with novel vector borne and zoonotic 
diseases in Indian Country. It also coordinates with outside 
partners to facilitate the delivery of spay, neuter, and rabies 
clinics for domestic dogs and cats and has worked with Federal 
partners like USDA on zoonotic disease prevention and risk 
factor reduction projects.
    The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant 
Inspection Service has collaborated with the IHS Division of 
Environmental Health Services at the local level as needed on 
zoonotic disease prevention or risk factor reduction projects.
    The CDC has conducted several surveillance evaluations to 
characterize the risk of rabies in tribal lands in several 
high-risk communities in the southwest United States. Rabies 
testing and reporting rates are up to 15 times lower compared 
to their non-tribal adjacent communities, in part because 
tribal communities do not have their own rabies laboratories. 
The highest risk for rabies reintroduction lies in tribal lands 
where free-roaming dog populations remain a major public health 
issue. For example, as the Vice Chair noted, the Navajo Nation 
is home to approximately 250,000 free-roaming dogs with many 
remaining unvaccinated against rabies.
    The Veterinary Services for Improved Public Health in Rural 
Communities Act would work to combat this public health crisis. 
The department shares the goals of the drafters to combat 
zoonotic disease spreading in IHS areas and ensure that tribal 
members throughout Indian Country are protected with robust 
public health outbreak prevention. Like the bill's drafters, 
the department and IHS are looking to improve the response to 
zoonotic related disease and improve the safety of tribal 
communities.
    That being said, the bill in its current form does not 
include any additional resources for the department to stand up 
a new program without compromising its efforts to provide 
direct care, address other longstanding inequities or combat 
other emergent public health challenges in Indian Country.
    We look forward to continuing to work with Congress on 
improving the health of tribal populations, including the 
issues related to this bill. As always, HHS welcomes the 
opportunity to provide technical assistance as requested by the 
Committee and its members.
    Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. I am happy 
to answer your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Egorin follows:]

   Prepared Statement of Hon. Melanie Anne Egorin, Ph.D., Assistant 
        Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
    Good afternoon Chair Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, and Members of 
the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony on an 
important legislative proposal before your Committee, and for your 
continued support of the Indian Health Service (IHS) and efforts from 
the Department of Health and Human Services to improve the health and 
well-being of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Your 
consideration today of S. 4365, the Veterinary Services to Improve 
Public Health in Rural Communities Act underscores that commitment to 
improving the quality of life in Indian Country.
    I am Melanie Anne Egorin, the Assistant Secretary for Legislation 
(ASL) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or 
Department). My office serves as the primary link between the 
Department and Congress. The Office of the ASL provides technical 
assistance on legislation to Members of Congress and their staff, 
facilitates informational briefings relating to Department programs to 
support policy development by Congress, and supports implementation of 
legislation passed by Congress. It is a pleasure to join the Committee 
again, as we work together to combat the public health challenges in 
tribal communities.
Background
    The Department and the IHS agree that the increase of injuries and 
zoonotic disease spread by domesticated and wild animals in Indian 
Country represents a significant public health issue for tribal members 
in these rural communities. There are an estimated 70 million stray 
dogs and cats in the U.S., Tribal Lands, and territories, which 
contribute to traumatic events and injuries, zoonotic disease spread, 
and road traffic accidents. In recent years, free-roaming domestic 
animals have contributed to rabies outbreaks on Tribal lands, human 
deaths due to zoonotic diseases, and severe injury and death due to 
mauling.
    The Department is working as a whole through diverse offices and 
mission areas to address the public health concerns related to zoonotic 
diseases, including rabies. The IHS already coordinates with and 
assists tribes with animal population control efforts to the extent 
practicable within its authorities. Additionally, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Commissioned Corps of the 
United States Public Health Service (USPHS) help to lead Department 
efforts on the national surveillance of and education about rabies and 
other zoonotic diseases.
    The IHS operates its mission, in partnership with AI/AN tribal 
communities, through a network of over 600 federal and tribal health 
facilities and 41 Urban Indian Organizations that are located across 37 
states and provide health care services to approximately 2.87 million 
AI/AN people annually.
    As you may know, appropriated funds to the IHS are used to provide 
health care to IHS-eligible AI/ANs--the IHS' defined service 
population. The Department and the IHS have worked hard to prioritize 
resources provided by Congress to ensure that patients have access to 
accessible--and affordable--quality care. The IHS works hard every day 
to ensure that limited resources are used wisely to ensure the greatest 
impact on its defined service population--from direct care services to 
sanitation and facilities construction, and health care facilities 
construction.
    While it recognizes the importance of this emerging threat to 
Indian Country, the IHS has to balance its limited resources to deliver 
direct services to its defined population while combating a number of 
unique public health issues facing Indian Country, including the 
fentanyl and opioid crisis, the maternal mortality crisis, domestic and 
interpersonal violence, and high diabetes rates--to name a few. The 
Biden Harris Administration has advocated for additional resources to 
combat these growing threats in Indian Country and is committed to 
fighting to reduce health disparities impacting tribal members.
IHS Health Issues Related to Rabies Incidents in Rural Communities
    The IHS has examined first-hand and heard directly from tribes 
about the real public health risk from the high rates of dog bite 
injuries in AI/AN communities. Over the past five years, there have 
been over 200 patients hospitalized from dog bite injuries or attacks 
at IHS clinics. The Navajo and Alaska Areas have had the highest number 
of bites requiring hospitalizations. During that same period, there 
were over 24,000 patients receiving ambulatory care from dog bites. The 
Navajo, Alaska, Great Plains, and Phoenix Areas have had the highest 
numbers of bite-related hospitalizations over the last 5 years.
    The IHS has also heard from tribes--especially from those in 
Northern Alaska--who are desperate for assistance addressing the 
problem at its source. A multitude of challenges have created a perfect 
storm for risk of injury and disease spread from animals in especially 
rural areas. AI/ANs living on reservations often have little to no 
access to veterinary care. Gaps exist in the availability of free 
rabies vaccines to rural pets, resulting in a higher risk of rabies 
exposure in humans and animals. The lack of regular parasite control 
for pets in these areas has led to an increased risk of exposure to 
transmissible parasites to human beings. There is also a lack of access 
to veterinary spay-neuter surgery to reduce unplanned litters, which 
has led to an overpopulation of strays and abandoned dogs--thus 
increasing exposure to disease, parasite infestation, and dog bites.
    The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) 
only authorizes contracts for certain programs prescribed by Congress. 
As the Committee knows, the IHS' foundational purpose is to provide 
health care for AI/ANs. IHS' authorizing statutes do not currently 
convey authority to carry out veterinary services. As IHS does not have 
the authority, there is no authority for a tribal health program to add 
the activity to its ISDEAA agreement.
HHS Public Health Surveillance, Education, and Partnerships
    Within their authorities, the IHS, the CDC, and USPHS collaborate 
in careful coordination with other tribal, federal, state, county, and 
external partners to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spread in 
Indian Country. The IHS Division of Environmental Health Services staff 
work on surveillance, training, and capacity building, and have been 
involved for decades with novel vector borne and zoonotic diseases not 
previously identified in Indian Country. This Division has implemented 
Hantavirus and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever prevention strategies, 
conducted arbovirus surveillance and risk reduction strategies, and 
assisted tribal communities in the development of and adoption of lay 
vaccinator programs for rabies virus. It has also coordinated with 
outside partners to facilitate the delivery of spay, neuter, and rabies 
clinics for domestic dogs and cats. The U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's Animal and Plant Inspection Service has collaborated with 
the IHS Division of Environmental Health Services at the local level as 
needed on zoonotic disease prevention or risk factor reduction 
projects.
    The CDC collects data on domestic human rabies cases and conducts 
near real-time animal rabies surveillance in 54 jurisdictions, 
including Alaska, through the National Rabies Surveillance System. No 
Tribal communities have their own rabies laboratories and therefore 
they rely on relevant state laboratories for all testing. This may 
present a barrier to sample collection, testing, and reporting, which 
further obscures the burden of rabies in these communities. The CDC has 
conducted several surveillance evaluations to characterize rabies risks 
in Tribal Lands. In several high-risk Tribal communities in the 
southwestern U.S., rabies testing and reporting rates are up to 15-
times lower compared to their adjacent non-Tribal communities.
    An evaluation of the risk of rabies re-introduction into the U.S. 
found that the highest risk is in Tribal Lands where free roaming dog 
populations remain a major public health issue. It was found that the 
Navajo Nation is home to approximately 250,000 free roaming dogs, with 
many remaining unvaccinated against rabies. Rabies risk mapping 
performed by CDC, which considers road connectivity, urbanicity, and 
human-to-unvaccinated dog ratios found that up to 185,000 unvaccinated 
dogs likely reside in areas that could support and sustain dog-to-dog 
transmission of rabies. This highlights the realistic potential for 
reintroduction of dog-mediated rabies or spillover from local rabies 
reservoir wildlife in the Navajo Nation. These findings likely reflect 
similar vulnerabilities in other Tribal Lands across the United States.
S. 4365, Veterinary Services to Improve Public Health in Rural 
        Communities Act
    The Veterinary Services to Improve Public Health in Rural 
Communities Act would amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to 
combat zoonotic disease outbreaks and advance public health 
preparedness for Native communities, Alaska Native villages, or Indian 
reservations, including by providing spay and neuter services and 
vaccinations for animals.
    S. 4365 would authorize the Secretary to expend funds for public 
health veterinary services to prevent and control zoonotic disease 
infection and transmission in IHS Service areas where the risk for 
disease occurrence in humans and wildlife is endemic. The bill would 
also enable the Secretary to deploy veterinary public health officers 
from USPHS to IHS Service areas to combat, prevent and control zoonotic 
disease infection and transmission in IHS Service areas where the risk 
is endemic.
    The proposed legislation also mandates the Secretary and IHS to 
coordinate with the Director of the CDC, and the Secretary of 
Agriculture. Further, the bill would require the Secretary of HHS to 
submit to certain Committees in Congress on a biennial basis, a report 
on the use of funds, the assignment and deployment of veterinary public 
health officers from the USPHS, data related to the monitoring and 
disease surveillance of zoonotic diseases, and related services 
provided under the proposed legislation. Finally, S. 4365 would amend 
the Prepare for and Respond to Existing Viruses, Emerging New Threats, 
and Pandemics Act, to include the Director of the IHS, in the ``One 
Health framework.''
    Controlling the pet population would decrease the incidence of dog 
bites, which have caused an increase of injuries and deaths on Tribal 
Lands. This bill would potentially limit the incidence and spread of 
zoonotic diseases and also allow people to walk safely in their 
communities. The Department shares the same goal as the drafters--to 
combat zoonotic disease spreading in IHS Service areas and ensure that 
tribal members throughout Indian Country are protected with robust 
public health outbreak prevention. Like the bill's drafters, the 
Department and IHS are looking to improve response to any zoonotic 
related disease and improve safety in tribal communities.
    That being said, the bill, in its current form, does not include 
any additional resources for the Department to stand up a new program 
without compromising its efforts to provide direct care or combat other 
emergent public health challenges in Indian Country. The legislation 
could include language to authorize such sums that may be necessary to 
provide these services in Indian Country and the Appropriations 
Committees could then be able to decide whether to fund these new 
activities.
    We look forward to continuing our work with Congress on improving 
the health of AI/AN populations including the issues related to this 
bill. As always, HHS welcomes the opportunity to provide technical 
assistance as requested by the Committee or its members.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I am 
happy to answer any questions the Committee may have.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Freihage, please proceed with your testimony.

         STATEMENT OF JASON FREIHAGE, DEPUTY ASSISTANT 
         SECRETARY OF MANAGEMENT, INDIAN AFFAIRS, U.S. 
                   DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

    Mr. Freihage. Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice 
Chairman Murkowski, and members of the Committee. My name is 
Jason Freihage. I am the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Management in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian 
Affairs at the Department of the Interior. Thank you for the 
opportunity to present testimony on S. 2783, Miccosukee 
Reserved Area Amendments Act, S. 3406, Technical Corrections to 
the Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act, Taos 
Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, and Aamodt 
Litigation Settlement Act, and S. 3857, Jamul Indian Village 
Land Transfer Act. The department supports S. 2783, S. 3406, 
and S. 3857.
    S. 2783 would amend the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act by 
expanding the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include Osceola Camp, 
which is within the boundaries of Everglades National Park. The 
National Park Services currently authorizes management of the 
Camp through a Special Use Permit.
    S. 2873 would guarantee the permanence and protection of 
the Camp and eliminate the need for recurring permit approval. 
The bill would also authorize appropriations, not more than a 
total of $14 million, to safeguard Camp structures from 
flooding events. The department supports S. 2783.
    S. 3406 would amend the Omnibus Public Land Management Act 
of 2009 and the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 to authorize 
funding for the Navajo Nation Water Resources Development Trust 
Fund, the Taos Pueblo Water Development Fund, and Aamodt 
Settlement Pueblos Fund, amounts that would have accrued if the 
department had the authority to invest those funds upon 
appropriation.
    Four Indian water rights settlements, the Taos Pueblo 
Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, the Aamodt Litigation 
Settlement Act, and the Duck Valley Settlement and the Crow 
Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2010 contain provisions 
that authorize an investment of monies into settlement trust 
fund accounts after their enforceability date.
    The enforceability date is effective when the Secretary 
finds that all conditions for the full effectiveness and 
enforceability of the settlement occurred and is published in 
the Federal Register. But the Northwestern New Mexico Rural 
Water Projects Act, or Navajo Settlement, also allowed an 
investment of monies into the Navajo Nation's resource 
development trust fund only upon a specified date certain 10 
years after the enactment date. These provisions prohibited the 
department from investing trust fund monies before the 
enforceability date or a date certain.
    But the department mistakenly invested trust fund monies 
when they were appropriated and before the enforceability date. 
When the department discovered its error, the department's 
solicitor's office determined that the amounts earned prior to 
the date that the funds were authorized to be invested 
conflicted with the Anti-Deficiency Act, and those funds must 
be returned to the Treasury. Soon after, the department then 
returned all interest monies accrued prior to the authorized 
date back to Treasury.
    The provisions contained in the five water settlements that 
prohibit the investment until the enforceability date or a date 
certain is reached are not common in Indian water rights 
settlements. The department supports S. 3406, to put those 
water settlements on par with other Indian water rights 
settlements.
    S. 3857 would place approximately 172.1 acres of land 
located in San Diego, California, into trust for the benefit of 
the Jamul Indian Village. The bill makes the land that are 
owned in fee by the tribe part of the reservation for the Jamul 
Indian Village and includes a prohibition against Class II and 
Class III gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
    The parcels to be transferred into trust are Daisy Drive, 
which is the main access road into the tribe's existing trust 
land, a parcel that contains a culturally significant church 
and cemetery and two parcels that the tribe plans to use for 
housing development, a clinic and an administration building.
    The department supports S. 3857. The restoration of tribal 
homelands continues to be a priority for the department and 
Biden Administration.
    Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, and members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to provide the 
department's views.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Freihage follows:]

  Prepared Statement of Jason Freihage, Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
      Management, Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior
    Good afternoon, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairman Murkowski, and 
members of the Committee. My name is Jason Freihage, and I am the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Management for Indian Affairs at the 
Department of the Interior (Department). Thank you for the opportunity 
to present testimony on S. 2783, ``Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments 
Act,'' S. 3406, ``Technical Corrections to the Northwestern New Mexico 
Rural Water Projects Act, Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement 
Act, and Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act,'' and S. 3857, ``Jamul 
Indian Village Land Transfer Act.''
S. 2783, Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act
    S. 2783 would amend the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act by authorizing 
expansion of the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include Osceola Camp 
(Camp), which is situated within the boundary of Everglades National 
Park. The bill would uphold the sovereignty of the Miccosukee Tribe of 
Indians and ensure the Camp remains within the landscape of Everglades 
National Park in perpetuity. The NPS currently authorizes management of 
the Camp through a Special Use Permit; this bill would ensure 
permanence and protection of the Camp and eliminate the need for 
recurring permit approval. Additionally, the bill would authorize 
appropriations of such sums as necessary, but not more than a total of 
$14,000,000, to safeguard structures within the Camp from flooding 
events.

    The Department supports S. 2783.
S. 3406, Technical Corrections to the Northwestern New Mexico Rural 
        Water Projects Act, Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement 
        Act, and Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act
    S. 3406 would amend the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 
and the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 to authorize funding for deposit 
into the Navajo Nation Water Resources Development Trust Fund, the Taos 
Pueblo Water Development Fund, and the Aamodt Settlement Pueblos' Fund 
equivalent to the amounts that would have accrued to the trust funds if 
the Department had the authority to invest the funds upon 
appropriation.
    In the 111th Congress, four Indian water rights settlements (the 
Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 111-291; 
the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 111-291; the Duck 
Valley settlement, Pub. L. No. 111-11; and the Crow Tribe Water Rights 
Settlement Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-291) included provisions 
authorizing an investment of monies into the settlement trust funds 
after the enforceability date. The enforceability date is effective 
when the Secretary finds that all conditions for the full effectiveness 
and enforceability of the settlement had occurred and publishes that 
finding in the Federal Register. The Northwestern New Mexico Rural 
Water Projects Act, Pub. L. No. 111-11, (Navajo Settlement), also 
allowed for the investment of monies into the Navajo Nation Resources 
Development Trust Fund, only upon a specified date certain ten years 
after the enactment date.
    These provisions prohibited the Department from investing trust 
fund monies before the enforceability date or a date certain. However, 
the Department mistakenly started investing trust fund monies when they 
were appropriated, which was before the enforceability date. When the 
Department discovered this error, the Department's Solicitor's Office 
determined that the interest amounts earned prior to the date that the 
funds were authorized to be invested were contrary to the 
Antideficiency Act and, in accordance with 31 U.S.C.  3302, must be 
returned to Treasury. The Department then returned all interest monies 
accrued prior to the authorized date back to Treasury.
    The issue that S. 3406 addresses is a provision in certain Indian 
water rights settlements that prohibited investment until the 
enforceability date was reached. This provision is not common in Indian 
water rights settlements. Similar provisions appeared in other 
settlements enacted in 2009-2010, including the Crow Tribe Water Rights 
Settlement Act of 2010; the Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement 
Act; the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act; and the Navajo- Gallup Water 
Supply Project and Navajo Nation Water Rights. In each of these 
settlements, funds were inadvertently invested and returned to 
Treasury. The Department supported similar legislation to resolve this 
issue, and thus supports S. 3406 to correct this issue for the 
Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act, the Taos Pueblo 
Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, and the Aamodt Litigation 
Settlement Act.
S. 3857, Jamul Indian Village Land Transfer Act
    S. 3857 would place approximately 172.1 acres of land located in 
San Diego, California, and owned in fee by the Jamul Indian Village 
into trust for the benefit of the Jamul Indian Village. The bill makes 
the lands part of the reservation for the Jamul Indian Village and 
includes a prohibition against class II and class III gaming under the 
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
    The parcels to be transferred into trust are comprised of: a parcel 
with Daisy Drive, which is the main access road into the Jamul Indian 
Village's existing trust land; a parcel that contains a culturally 
significant church and cemetery; and two parcels that the Jamul Indian 
Village plans to use for housing development, a clinic, and an 
administration building.
    The Department supports S. 3857. The restoration of Tribal 
homelands is a priority for the Department and Biden Administration.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    We will now recognize the Honorable Talbert Cypress, 
Chairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians in Miami, Florida.

 STATEMENT OF HON. TALBERT CYPRESS, CHAIRMAN, MICCOSUKEE TRIBE 
                           OF INDIANS

    Mr. Cypress. Good afternoon, Chair Schatz and Vice Chair 
Murkowski and members of the Committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to appear virtually before you today.
    I am Talbert Cypress, Chairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of 
Indians of Florida, a federally recognized tribe located in the 
Greater Everglades in South Florida. The views expressed herein 
are those of the Miccosukee Tribe.
    I appreciate the opportunity to discuss S. 2783, the 
Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, which would expand the 
current boundaries of the Miccosukee Reserved Area to include 
the Osceola Camp. Thank you also to Senator Scott and Senator 
Rubio for sponsoring this legislation.
    We strongly support S. 2783, which would ensure appropriate 
governance for the Osceola Camp and authorize funding to 
elevate structures in the Camp to protect it from artificially 
engineered floodwaters from the Central Everglades Planning 
Project.
    The Miccosukee Tribe was federally recognized in 1962, and 
after that recognition, our villages within Everglades National 
Park were managed with a Special Use Permit granted by the 
National Park Service from 1964 to 1998. In 1998, Congress 
passed the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act. The concept for this 
Act was to provide a legal framework under which members of the 
tribe could live permanently and govern their own affairs in 
villages set aside for the tribe's use within the Park.
    The Miccosukee Reserved Area Act of 1998 has been a 
resounding success for the tribe and for Everglades National 
Park, our residential community has been protected and the 
right to self-government facilitated. The national park, its 
waters and visitor access have been well protected.
    However, there remains one Special Use Permit within 
Everglades National Park which still facilitates the occupancy 
of an outlying village. This is my father's village, called the 
Osceola Camp, after descendants of the war leader Osceola who 
was executed after being captured under a flag of truce during 
the Second Seminole War.
    My ancestors have lived in the Osceola Camp for 
generations, but the Camp continues to be subject to Special 
Use Permit renewal by Everglades National Park. The bill under 
consideration today would finally complete the protection of 
the tribal communities remaining within Everglades National 
Park.
    I truly appreciate the opportunity to address this 
Committee. Thank you for your support.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Cypress follows:]

Prepared Statement of Hon. Talbert Cypress, Chairman, Miccosukee Tribe 
                               of Indians
    Good morning, Chair Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, and members of 
the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you 
today. I am Talbert H. Cypress, Chairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of 
Indians of Florida, a federally-recognized tribe located in the Greater 
Everglades in South Florida. The views expressed herein are those of 
the Miccosukee Tribe, a sovereign tribe recognized pursuant to the 
Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. I appreciate the opportunity to 
discuss S. 2783, the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act, which 
would expand the current boundaries of the Miccosukee Reserved Area (or 
``MRA'') to include the Osceola Camp. Thank you also to Senators Rubio 
and Scott for sponsoring this legislation. If enacted, S. 2783 would 
make amendments to the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act of 1998, 
legislation that set aside inhabited Tribal lands within Everglades 
National Park for the benefit of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of 
Florida and our constituents. We strongly support S. 2783, which would 
ensure appropriate governance for the Osceola Camp and authorize 
funding to elevate structures in the camp to protect it from artificial 
engineered floodwaters from a Congressionally authorized project, the 
Central Everglades Planning Project.
Expansion
    The current boundaries of the Miccosukee Reserved Area were 
delineated by the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act of 1998, Public Law 105-
313. This Act brought under Tribal jurisdiction a stretch of land on 
the northern edge of Everglades National Park which has been inhabited 
by the Tribe for generations since the original villages and designated 
state reservation of 99,000 acres within Everglades National Park were 
evicted as a result of the creation of the Park and subsequent 
wilderness-style management. Following the Tribe's 1962 federal 
recognition, the villages which were established within this strip of 
land within the borders of the Park were managed as a Special Use 
Permit of the national park from 1964 until 1998.
    In 1998, Congress passed the Miccosukee Reserved Area Act, 
predicated on the finding that ``[t]he interests of both the Miccosukee 
Tribe and the United States would be enhanced by a further delineation 
of the rights and obligations of each with respect to the Special Use 
Permit Area and to the Park as a whole.'' Public Law 105-313,  2. An 
important goal of this 1998 legislation was to ``replace the special 
use permit with a legal framework under which the Tribe can live 
permanently and govern the Tribe's own affairs in a modern community 
within the Park.'' Id. at  3. The Act further provided that ``the 
Tribe shall govern its own affairs and otherwise make laws and apply 
those laws in the MRA as though the MRA were a Federal Indian 
reservation.'' Id. at  5(a)(3).
    This same Act provided for the protection of Everglades National 
Park alongside the rights of the Tribe within the Miccosukee Reserved 
Area. Section 6 of the Act provides, among other environmentally 
protective measures, that the Tribe shall be responsible for 
``compliance with all applicable laws'' and ``shall prevent and abate 
degradation of the quality of surface or groundwater that is released 
into other parts of the Park,'' and ``shall not impede public access to 
those areas of the Park outside the boundaries of the MRA,'' and that 
no gaming shall be permitted to be conducted on the MRA.
    The Miccosukee Reserved Area Act of 1998 has, by all accounts, been 
a resounding success for the Tribe and for Everglades National Park. 
Our residential community has been protected and our effective self-
government therein has been facilitated. The National Park, its waters, 
and its visitor access have been well protected and Tribal impacts kept 
within the borders of the Miccosukee Reserved Area. However, there 
remains one Special Use Permit within Everglades National Park which 
still facilitates the occupancy of an outlying village that is 
approximately six (6) miles down US-41 (the Tamiami Trail) from the 
Miccosukee Reserved Area.
    This is my father's village, called the Osceola Camp, after 
descendants of the war leader Osceola who was executed after being 
captured under a flag of truce by General Thomas Jessup in 1837 during 
the Second Seminole War. My ancestors have lived in the Osceola Camp 
for generations, but within its borders our existence continues to be 
subject to Special Use Permit renewal by Everglades National Park. The 
proposed Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act introduced here, S. 
2783, would finally complete the protection of the Tribal communities 
remaining within Everglades National Park. The area proposed to be 
included into the MRA consists of the tree island on which the Osceola 
Camp is located and a fire break extending out from the island which 
will protect the Tribal community and facilitate continued Everglades 
National Park prescribed burns.
    The incorporation of these thirty (30) acres into the MRA will 
create a much more consistent legal framework for Tribal residents and 
law enforcement personnel living and working along the northern border 
of Everglades National Park. Once the Osceola Camp becomes a part of 
the MRA, residents can be included demographically as residents of 
Tribal lands and can more effectively avail themselves of Tribal 
emergency and infrastructure services funded by the Tribal government.
Elevation
    While we strongly support S. 2783's expansion of the Miccosukee 
Reserved Area, the second component of this bill is equally, if not 
more, important. Our homelands have been significantly impacted and 
altered by drainage authorized by Congress in 1948 as the Central and 
Southern Florida Project. Our northern homelands have been flooded and 
polluted, while our southern homelands have been dehydrated. The 
Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan authorized by Congress in 
2000 includes the Central Everglades Planning Project, itself 
authorized in 2016. This project, when completed, will restore the 
natural flow to a three mile stretch of the Everglades, where a portion 
of the Levee 29 will be removed north of a bridge which has been built 
to span the stretch.
    However, the Osceola Camp is right in the flow way of the water 
which will be released when the levee is degraded. The authorization of 
appropriation included within this bill, of $14,000,000 (fourteen 
million dollars), will provide funding for the work already begun by 
the National Park Service and Florida Department of Transportation to 
elevate the camp and its traditional structures above the new 
floodplain height, in tandem with the Tamiami Trail Next Steps Project 
which is elevating the roadway to protect it from the rising water 
levels. As the village is on the border of the US-41 (Tamiami Trail) 
roadway, this approach is efficient and harmonized with the existing 
authorized projects. However, without this funding and the engineering 
support that comes with it, the Tribe will again bear the brunt of the 
environmental impacts from the manipulation of the ecosystem that we 
live within, and the village will be under substantial and untenable 
risk of frequent flooding.
    This is one of the only remaining Tribal tree islands inhabited by 
a substantial residential community. My parents and grandparents' 
generation lived on many more tree islands throughout the Greater 
Everglades. When the Army Corps of Engineers began the dredging and 
channelization of the Everglades in the 1940s, our elders remember 
federal officials promising that, should floodwaters over top our 
traditional tree islands, they would be elevated at the federal 
government's expense. They were not. To date, we have lost more than 60 
percent of the land mass of the tree islands within the Miccosukee 
Water Conservation Area 3-A. Our people mourn this loss, and we call on 
Congress to not repeat this history as further manipulations of the 
ecosystem move forward. The projects are positive ones which repair the 
harms of past drainage, dredging, and channelization, but the Tribe 
must ensure that this time, our residential communities are protected 
from floods.
Conclusion
    In conclusion, S. 2738 would elevate the village at Osceola Camp, 
and transition the Osceola Camp from the Special Use Permit model to 
inclusion within the Miccosukee Reserved Area. We strongly support S. 
2738 because this legislation will enable the United States to fulfill 
its trust obligation to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida by 
simultaneously protecting this Tribal village from flood impacts and 
ensuring its perpetual Indigenous self-governance.
    I truly appreciate the opportunity to address this Committee and 
thank you for the support you have shown to tribes and our sovereignty. 
I look forward to any questions you may have.
    Shonabisha (Thank you).

    The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We really appreciate 
it.
    We will now recognize the Honorable Erica Pinto, the 
Chairwoman of the Jamul Indian Village of California. Welcome.

STATEMENT OF HON. ERICA PINTO, CHAIRWOMAN, JAMUL INDIAN VILLAGE 
                         OF CALIFORNIA

    Ms. Pinto. Thank you, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chair 
Murkowski, and distinguished members of the Committee. My name 
is Erica Pinto, and I have the honor to serve as Chairwoman of 
the Jamul Indian Village of California. My mother is Carlene 
Chamberlain, and my father is Jessie Pinto, Sr. I would like to 
acknowledge our team in the room, the Jamul Council, also Kerry 
and Craig, and all the Jamul tribal members who are watching. I 
thank all those who came before us.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify on S. 3857, the 
Jamul Indian Village Land Transfer Act. I have submitted 
written testimony that discusses my tribe's history, our 
perseverance, and our need for additional trust lands.
    I plan to focus my remarks this afternoon on our vital need 
for trust lands to ensure access to our reservation, to protect 
our cemetery and church, and to return my people to our 
ancestral homeland. My ancestors were a band of Kumeyaay 
Indians known as the Jamul Band, where people have continuously 
resided on a portion of our aboriginal territory in southern 
California since long before the arrival of the Spanish. For 
generations, we were without an officially declared land base 
until the Catholic diocese received a grant of our ancestral 
cemetery for the purpose of an Indian graveyard. The cemetery 
is the final resting place for nearly all of our relatives and 
ancestors dating back to the 1800s.
    The diocese later built a small church on the land in the 
early 1900s and allowed us to reside together, remain close to 
each other, near our ancestors, and practice our culture and 
traditions. Our commitment to remain there despite the poor 
living conditions and attempts to move us speaks to our love, 
dedication, and connection to the cemetery and the surrounding 
lands.
    In the 1970s, the Secretary of the Interior initially took 
4.6 acres into trust to establish our reservation. Until the 
early 1980s, the people lacked basic utilities like running 
water and electricity. Living conditions for our people were 
deplorable. One shallow well supplied contaminated drinking 
water for our members. Our housing was primarily small shacks 
made up of scrap materials and dilapidated trailers.
    We did without basic amenities in order to remain on our 
ancestral lands near our cemetery, to protect our way of life. 
The Department of Interior last exercised its authority to 
accept land into trust for our tribe in 1982, when it approved 
a 1.3 acre fee-to-trust transfer.
    Over time, our ancestral lands have diminished from over 
640 acres to only six acres, which now comprises our entire 
land base, one of the smallest reservations in the Nation. 
Since the tribe's lands were accepted into trust, we have done 
our very best to maximize the use of our land.
    In 2005, we made the extremely difficult decision to move 
off the reservation with the dream of a better life of becoming 
self-sufficient and not relying on the Federal Government. We 
wanted to be able to provide much-needed services to our 
members.
    However, the relocation from our ancestral lands resulted 
in a significant loss of culture, language, community, and even 
life since we have been unable to reside together and care for 
one another.
    S. 3857 accepts these parcels of land into trust for the 
tribe's benefit. The land is located within our ancestral 
territory in rural San Diego County. Since this bill prohibits 
gaming, it is important for this Committee to know that the 
tribe cannot use these lands for gaming purposes once accepted 
into trust.
    The bill protects access to our reservation, preserves our 
ancestral cemetery and church, protects our sacred sites, and 
it allows us to bring our people home once and for all. In 
addition to tribal housing, we plan to build a health care 
facility, a tribal administration building, a cultural center, 
a park, a police station, and a commercial kitchen to serve our 
members traditional foods.
    Bringing back our members together and providing them with 
access to our cultural sites, access to our traditional foods, 
and improve services and resources is not only something our 
people have longed for; it is vital to ensure our continued 
existence, to exercise self-determination and most importantly, 
exercise our tribal sovereignty.
    Thank you again to the Committee for holding this hearing 
and for your consideration of S. 3857, the Jamul Indian Village 
Land Transfer Act. On behalf of my tribe, I would like to thank 
Senators Padilla and Butler for their sponsorship of this 
legislation and for their hard work and commitment to Indian 
Country.
    With that, I am happy to answer any questions the Committee 
may have. Thank you.

   Prepared Statement of Hon. Erica Pinto, Chairwoman, Jamul Indian 
                         Village of California
    Chairman Schatz and distinguished Members of the Senate Committee 
on Indian Affairs, my name is Erica M. Pinto, and I have the honor to 
serve as Chairwoman of the Jamul Indian Village of California (the 
``Tribe or ``JIV''). Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony 
on S. 3857, the Jamul Indian Village Land Transfer Act, and thank you 
to Senator Padilla, as the bill's sponsor, and Senator Butler, as co-
sponsor, for their dedication to represent the interests of the Native 
American tribes in the State of California, and in particular for their 
notable efforts on S. 3857.
History of the Jamul Indian Village
    JIV's 6-acre Reservation, one of the smallest in the United States, 
is located in a rural area east of downtown San Diego, California. The 
Tribe's ancestors were a band of Kumeyaay (Mission-Diegueno) Indians 
known as the Jamul Band, who historically occupied their village 
territory in the Jamul Valley northwest of the San Ysidro Mountains. 
The Jamul Band were known as Mission Indians of California because at 
one point, they were under the jurisdiction of Spanish missionaries who 
established missions throughout Southern California for the purpose of 
converting and ``reducing'' the aboriginal population and using them as 
laborers to facilitate Spanish settlement of the area. Historically 
speaking, the Jamul Band is a part of the group of Indians who referred 
to themselves as Kumeyaay people, but were also known politically as 
the Diegueno people because they were under the jurisdiction of the San 
Diego Mission de Alcala during Spanish control of the region. Spanish 
records as early as 1776 reference an Indian settlement at Jamul. 
Members of the Jamul Band have continuously resided on a portion of 
their aboriginal territory since before the arrival of the Spanish 
until present day, which included land within the Tribe's present-day 
Reservation.
    Despite the Jamul Band's legal claim to occupy lands in the Jamul 
Valley, after the United States government acquired California under 
the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States agreed to recognize 
land grants of Mexican citizens who decided to remain in California. 
One such land grant was the Jamul Rancho within the Jamul Valley, which 
was part of the Jamul Band's ancestral lands. Thereafter, members of 
the Jamul Band occupying lands located within Jamul Rancho were 
considered by white settlers to be ``squatters,'' and were at risk of 
being displaced from their lands.
    In 1891, Congress passed the Mission Indian Relief Act, creating a 
Commission that came to be known as the ``Smiley Commission,'' with the 
mandate to survey and select reservation lands for each band or village 
of Mission Indians residing within California. Two of the three 
commissioners were not present in California to fulfill the Act's 
mandate, and thus did not participate in the survey and selection 
process. A single commissioner oversaw the survey and selection of 
Indian reservations under the Act. Reports from this commissioner make 
clear that he did not visit any areas south of what is now Interstate 
8, and the closest he came to Jamul Rancho was 22 miles east at Campo.
    The Smiley Commission created under the Mission Indian Relief Act 
did not accomplish its legislative mandate to both select a reservation 
for each band or village, and to include the land and villages that had 
been in the actual occupation and possession of each band or village of 
Mission Indians. The Jamul Band was omitted from the Smiley 
Commission's work, and evidence shows that the commissioners intended 
for members of small bands of Indians to move onto other ``catch-all'' 
reservations that had been established with what was deemed sufficient 
capacity to accommodate additional Mission Indians. Although the Smiley 
Commission thought that the closest reservations would provide for 
small bands scattered throughout San Diego County, this assumption did 
not account for cultural norms among these bands to avoid entry onto 
another band's lands without a specific invitation from that band, or 
the Jamul Band's determination to protect its own culture and way of 
life.
    Therefore, despite the commissioners' intent to provide the Jamul 
Band with a home at a nearby reservation, members of the Jamul Band did 
not move. Rather, the situation for the Jamul Band remained largely 
unchanged, with its members living in abject poverty on its ancestral 
lands but without an officially declared land base, until the Coronado 
Beach Company granted the land holding the Jamul Band's ancestral 
cemetery to the Catholic Diocese ``for the purpose of an Indian 
graveyard and approach thereto.'' The cemetery is the resting place for 
nearly all of the Tribe's ancestors, dating back to the 1800s. The 
Jamul Band's ties to this ancestral cemetery and surrounding lands 
explains their resoluteness to remain there. The Diocese later built a 
small church for the Jamul Band in the early 1900s, and provided a 
modicum of legal protection for a portion of its Indian village. The 
cemetery, which is almost at full capacity, and church remain a vital 
part of the Tribe's culture and traditions, and are part of the lands 
that are the subject of S. 3857.
    Following failures of the Superintendents of the Office of Indian 
Affairs in Southern California to effectively engage with scattered 
Indians beyond reservations that had been created for larger Mission 
Indian bands prior to and in conjunction with the Mission Indian Relief 
Act, the federal government appointed a special agent in 1908 whose 
jurisdiction was over the landless Indians of Southern California, in 
order to investigate conditions and ``secure title'' for ``landless 
Indians'' like members of the Jamul Band, who did not then reside on a 
federal reservation, and whose land tenure was uncertain and at risk of 
encroachment by settlers.
    The need for action by the federal government was summarized by 
Special Agent C.E. Kelsey in a letter to the Commissioner of Indian 
Affairs, stating, ``There are no necessities in California equal to 
those of the robbed, starving, helpless people for whom [monies for 
support and civilization of California Indians] are appropriated.''
    Although the federal government was charged with securing title for 
landless Indians who had not been afforded their rightful lands under 
the Mission Indian Relief Act, the federal government's de facto policy 
eventually became to prioritize those Indians and Indian bands who were 
homeless, aggressive with respect to their land rights, or in 
significant conflict with non-Indians who claimed a right to Indian-
occupied land. As the Jamul Band was a relatively small band living on 
aboriginal lands located within the boundaries of privately held land 
at that time, the Jamul Band was largely ignored. This constituted yet 
another failure on the part of the federal government to provide land 
for the Jamul Indians who had steadfastly remained on their ancestral 
land.
Establishment of the JIV Reservation
    As a testament to the Tribe's determination, the Jamul Band's 
Indian Village was the only nonreservation village that survived up 
through the 1970s when the Secretary of the Interior took into trust 
the initial 4.66 acres of the Tribe's Reservation--land that had been 
occupied by members of the Jamul Band since before the Spanish Mission 
era, from time immemorial. Until the early 1980s, the Tribe's lands 
lacked basic utilities like running water and electricity. One shallow 
well at the low point of the cemetery property supplied drinking water 
of dubious quality for Tribal members. Members of the Jamul Band did 
without these modern amenities in order to remain on their lands, near 
their ancestral cemetery, as a way to protect their culture and way of 
life. Although their culture survived, living conditions for the Jamul 
Band were dire, and they severely lacked economic resources to improve 
their standard of living.
    Present-day members of the Tribe are descended from the Jamul Band, 
and the Tribe's lands have been diminished over time from more than 640 
acres to a small 6-acre sliver of land alongside the ancestral cemetery 
and church. The Tribe was formally organized under the Indian 
Reorganization Act (``IRA'') in 1981, when the Jamul Indians determined 
that they would pursue organization as a half-blood community under 
Section 19 of the IRA. Having established its 4.66-acre Reservation, 
the Jamul Indians held an election in May of 1981, and ratified a 
Constitution that formally established the Jamul Indian Village. The 
Department of the Interior (``Department'') approved the Tribe's 
Constitution two months later, and the Secretary of the Interior then 
included the Tribe in the next list of federally recognized tribes 
published in the Federal Register. The Department last exercised its 
authority to accept land into trust for the Tribe in 1982, when it 
approved a 1.372-acre fee-to-trust transfer under a grant deed naming 
the Jamul Indian Village as beneficiary.
    Therefore, two parcels--collectively 6.032 acres--comprise the 
Tribe's entire trust land base, one of the smallest in the United 
States. We are thankful that the federal government recognizes that 
helping tribes to reacquire lands--and the placement of those lands 
into trust--is key to tribes' future prosperity and is essential to 
maintain culturally significant areas that are central to tribal 
identity, religion, and beliefs.
S. 3857 and the Tribe's Needs for Additional Trust Lands
    As mentioned above, Tribal members endured dire economic conditions 
for over a century, in order to stay near their ancestors' resting 
place and to keep their culture strong. Since the Tribe's lands were 
accepted into trust, the Tribe has done its very best to maximize use 
of its limited trust acreage. It eventually became clear to Tribal 
members that, in order to improve living conditions for future 
generations, sacrifices would need to be made. Beginning in 2005, the 
Tribe's members voluntarily moved off of the Tribe's 6-acre 
Reservation, as a sacrifice to ensure that the Tribe would become self-
sufficient and less reliant on the federal government. Since this time, 
the Tribe's small Reservation has been fully and completely developed 
by the Tribe's economic endeavors, which include a gaming facility. 
This has helped the Tribe to realize its goals of self-sufficiency and 
limited reliance on federal resources.
    Despite this improvement in the Tribe's economic conditions, Tribal 
members' sacrifice to move off-Reservation has resulted in the adverse 
consequence of significant loss of the Tribe's culture, language, and 
community, since its members have not been able to reside together on 
Tribal lands.
    In short, the Tribe desperately needs additional trust lands so 
that it may preserve and protect its cultural sites, and develop 
housing for its members, a health clinic, a grocery store, Tribal 
administrative offices, law enforcement, educational services, and 
other community resources in service of the Tribe's members.
    Additional trust lands are essential to the Tribe's efforts to 
restore its ancestral land base, to ensure that its most culturally 
sacred sites are safeguarded, to bring its members, who are now 
dispersed throughout San Diego County and beyond, home to reside on 
Tribal trust lands, and to provide essential services to its people. 
Development of trust lands is an important piece of the Tribe's overall 
plan for restoration and protection of its culture. The Tribe believes 
that bringing its members back together, and providing those members 
with access to their cultural sites and to improved services and 
resources, is vital to ensure the Tribe's continued exercise of self-
determination.
    S. 3857 therefore accepts four parcels of land, totaling 
approximately 172.1 acres located in rural San Diego County, 
California, into trust for the benefit of the Jamul Indian Village of 
California. The Tribe purchased and holds fee simple title to these 
lands.
Fee-to-Trust Parcels
    The first of these four parcels totals 161.23 acres of land held in 
fee by the Tribe. This land is located proximate to the Tribe's 
Reservation, and is within the Tribe's ancestral territory. The Tribe 
hopes to use this property to develop housing for Tribal members, and 
for Tribal administrative offices, a health clinic, child-care center, 
educational services to Tribal members, a community center, law 
enforcement offices and other community resources in service of Tribal 
members. Placement of this land into trust will support the Tribe's 
efforts in cultural and community restoration, and will bring Tribal 
members home to a place they can occupy together.
    Parcel 2 totals approximately 6 acres, is owned in fee by the 
Tribe, and lies nearly 1,000 feet north of the Tribe's current 
Reservation within the Tribe's ancestral territory. Placement of this 
property into trust would help the Tribe to realize its goal to provide 
essential services and community resources to Tribal members, which 
also extends the Tribe's cultural preservation by ensuring the health 
and welfare of members of the Tribe for generations to come.
    The third parcel is the 4.030-acre parcel referred to by the Tribe 
as the Daisy Drive property. This property is contiguous to the Tribe's 
Reservation. Daisy Drive runs through this property and provides the 
only physical access to the Tribe's Reservation, and to the Tribe's 
church and ancestral cemetery. Placement of this property into trust 
will preserve the Tribal community's ability to access the Tribe's 
Reservation, and will preserve Tribal members' ability to access 
cultural landmarks, all via Daisy Drive.
    The fourth and final parcel listed in S. 3857 is the Tribe's 
historical church and ancestral cemetery property. This parcel totals 
0.84 acres and is contiguous to the Tribe's Reservation. This parcel 
holds the Tribe's historical church and ancestral cemetery where the 
Tribe's ancestors are laid to rest, and is part of the ancestral lands 
that the Tribe has called home since prehistoric times. The Tribe 
continues to use this property for cultural ceremonies and it remains 
an essential part of the Tribe's history. Placement of the church and 
cemetery property into trust ensures the preservation and protection of 
this culturally significant property for future generations of Tribal 
members. It should be noted that the cemetery is nearly at capacity, so 
the Tribe is working on finalizing a land swap with the state and 
federal wildlife agencies and would request an amendment during markup 
to place that land into trust upon completion of the land swap. If 
completed the land swap would add a little over an acre directly behind 
the current cemetery site. The land would provide space for the 
expansion of the ancestral cemetery and the land to be given to the 
Fish and Wildlife Service in exchange is of superior environmental 
quality and location. The Tribe looks forward to completing that action 
late this year or early next.
    Lastly, it should be noted that the Tribe will not use any of these 
parcels for gaming purposes, as S. 3857 entirely prohibits gaming on 
these parcels once they are taken into trust. The Tribe will use this 
land solely for the purposes described above, in an effort to protect 
the cultural identity, resources and history of the Tribe.
Conclusion
    JIV is excited by the opportunities that placement of these parcels 
into trust present, but restoration and protection of ancestral lands 
by trust status remains most important. The Tribe has immensely 
improved conditions for its people since its formal federal recognition 
in 1981. I have dedicated my life to service of the Jamul Indian 
Village, and I am exceedingly proud of how far we have come, but it 
remains the Tribe's primary goal to restore ancestral lands and secure 
protections for our culturally significant places. By passage of S. 
3857, the federal government would be helping the Tribe to honor its 
ancestors and their sacrifices in order to remain and prosper in the 
place that we have always called home.
    Thank you again to this Committee for holding this hearing and for 
your consideration of S. 3857, and to Senators Padilla and Butler for 
their work on behalf of the Jamul Indian Village and all of Indian 
country. I am happy to answer any questions that you may have.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Now we will recognize our final witness, Mr. Brian 
Lefferts, the Director of Public Health at the Yukon Kuskokwim 
Health Corporation in Bethel, Alaska.

 STATEMENT OF BRIAN LEFFERTS, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH, YUKON 
                  KUSKOKWIM HEALTH CORPORATION

    Mr. Lefferts. Good afternoon. My name is Commander Brian 
Lefferts with the U.S. Public Health Service and I am here 
today on behalf of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation, 
YKHC, where I have worked for the past 18 years. Thank you for 
the opportunity to testify today.
    YKHC is a tribal health organization of 58 federally 
recognized Alaska Native tribes which was formed to administer 
a comprehensive health care delivery system for the communities 
of the YK region in Southwest Alaska. For more than 30 years, 
we have provided health care services to the people of the 
region under a Self-Governance Compact with the Indian Health 
Service under Title V of the Indian Self-Determination Act.
     YKHC serves a remote, isolated service area approximately 
the size of the State of Oregon. This region is the traditional 
home to Alaska's indigenous Yup'ik, Cup'ik, and Athabascan 
people, and is not connected to the road system. As of the 2010 
Census, 89 percent of the residents are Alaska Native, and 
around half of the population speaks the Yup'ik or Cup'ik 
language at home.
    YKHC provides a variety of community, social, and 
population health services to the approximately 30,000 
residents in the region. Our health system includes 41 village 
clinics, five subregional clinics, a regional hospital, and 
other regional services and programs.
    The Alaska Native people in this region suffer dramatic 
health disparities compared to communities on the road system. 
Approximately a third of the homes in the region lack indoor 
plumbing, and we experience the highest household crowding 
rates in the United States. The life expectancy of people in 
this region is 69 years, 10 years less than the US average. 
This decreased life expectancy is driven by elevated cancer 
incidence, increased prevalence of chronic heart, lung, and 
liver diseases; high rates of infectious diseases; and high 
levels of intentional and unintentional injuries, including dog 
bites.
    The Veterinary Services to Improve Public Health in Rural 
Communities Act, which seeks to modify the Indian Health Care 
Improvement Act to include veterinary care, is vital to the 
health and well-being of Alaska Native communities. Indigenous 
people have a unique relationship with the land and animals. 
For thousands of years, this relationship was critical for 
survival, and it has become the basis of many cultural 
traditions and their identity as a people.
    This is especially true in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region where 
subsistence diets still account for a majority of the foods 
consumed, and individual and community health are linked to the 
health of wildlife in the region.
    Changes to the types of disease and illnesses affecting 
animals in the region is creating new threats to humans that 
were not historically a concern. For example, we have seen an 
emergency of brucellosis in caribou and walrus populations and 
distemper outbreaks in seal populations. These animals provide 
a critical food source for our communities.
    There has also been a recent detection of Highly Pathogenic 
Avian Influenza in wild birds, and there is evidence that these 
have jumped to some wild mammals in Alaska. As far back as 
2005, YKHC has worked with Fish and Wildlife and tribes in the 
region to provide High Path Avian Influenza surveillance and 
monitoring and hunter education as a part of a ``be prepared, 
not scared'' campaign to help ensure our people can continue to 
participate in subsistence in a safe and healthy way.
    These are only a couple of examples that show why having a 
dedicated YKHC staff to investigate zoonotic illness outbreaks 
and communicate health risks is critical to protecting human 
health in the region. Rabies is the most pressing of these 
zoonotic illnesses in the region and poses a significant threat 
to human health. Rabies is transmitted through bites or contact 
with infected animals. It is considered enzootic through 
northern and western Alaska where it is always present among 
fox in the area. Occasionally we have cases where humans are 
attacked by a rabid fox or wolf.
    But the greatest risk to humans comes from dogs who have 
been bitten by an infected fox. The risk of being bitten by a 
dog in rural Alaska is higher than in other areas, due to the 
prevalence of rabies and the large number of stray and unwanted 
pups that occur in areas without sufficient spay and neuter 
services.
    YKHC's environmental health services team works with local 
health aides and medical providers to identify cases of animal 
bite. In a typical year, there are over 100 dog bite 
investigations to ensure rabies transmission does not occur, 
and to determine if post exposure prophylaxis is necessary, 
which is recommended in about 20 percent of the cases. Not only 
are bites a risk for rabies, but the attack themselves can lead 
to serious adverse health outcomes or death. We believe this 
legislation will reduce the incidence of preventable injuries 
and illnesses among the people in the region.
    In 2008, a joint strategic framework meeting involving the 
American Medical Association, the American Veterinary Medical 
Association and other major health groups coined the term One 
Health that was adopted to refer to the interdependence of 
human, animal, and environmental health. This modern holistic 
approach aligns with longstanding indigenous understanding that 
our connectedness to the land and animals are essential to 
improving not only physical health but also mental, behavioral, 
emotional, cultural, and spiritual well-being.
    This legislation will support the One Health vision and 
improve health outcomes for our communities by enhancing our 
ability to address zoonotic diseases and by recognizing 
veterinary services are a critical function to improve the 
health status of Alaska Natives. We are excited about this 
legislative effort and believe it will significantly enhance 
our ability to ensure the well-being of our people in a 
culturally relevant way.
    Quyana for the opportunity and honor to provide testimony 
today.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Lefferts follows:]

Prepared Statement of Brian Lefferts, Director of Public Health, Yukon 
                      Kuskokwim Health Corporation
    My name is Commander Brian Lefferts with the U.S. Public Health 
Service and I am here today on behalf of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health 
Corporation (YKHC) where I have worked for the past 18 years. Thank you 
for the opportunity to testify on the Veterinary Services to Improve 
Public Health in Rural Communities Act.
    YKHC is a tribal health organization of 58 federally-recognized 
Alaska Native tribes which was formed to administer a comprehensive 
health care delivery system for the communities of the Yukon-Kuskokwim 
region in Southwest Alaska. For more than thirty years, we have 
provided health care services to the people of the region under a Self-
Governance Compact with the Indian Health Service under Title V of the 
Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.
    YKHC serves a remote, isolated service area approximately the size 
of the State of Oregon. This region is the traditional home to Alaska's 
indigenous Yup'ik, Cup'ik, and Athabascan people, and is not connected 
to the road system. As of the 2010 Census, 89 percent of the residents 
are Alaska Native, around half of the population speaks the Yup'ik or 
Cup'ik language at home.
    YKHC provides a wide variety of community, social, and population 
health services to the approximately 30,000 residents of the region. 
Our health system includes 41 village clinics, 5 subregional clinics, a 
regional hospital, skilled nursing facility and other regional services 
and programs.
    The Alaska Native people in this region suffer dramatic health 
disparities compared to communities on the road system. Approximatly, 
\1/3\ of the homes in the region lack indoor plumbing, and we 
experience the highest household crowing rates in the United States. 
The life expectancy of people in this region is 69 years--10 years less 
than the U.S. average. This decreased life expectancy is driven by 
elevated cancer incidence, increased prevalence of chronic heart, lung, 
and liver diseases; high rates of infectious diseases; and high levels 
of intentional and unintentional injuries, including dog bites.
    The Veterinary Services to Improve Public Health in Rural 
Communities Act, which seeks to modify the Indian Health Care 
Improvement Act to include veterinary care, is vital to the health and 
well-being of Alaska Native communities. Indigenous people have a 
unique relationship with the land and animals. For thousands of years, 
this relationship was critical for survival, and it has become the 
basis of many cultural traditions and their identity as a people. This 
is especially true in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region where subsistence 
diets still account for a majority of the foods consumed, and 
individual and community health are linked to the health of wildlife in 
the region.
I. Enabling dedicated YKHC staff to investigate zoonotic illness 
        outbreaks and communicate health risks is critical to 
        protecting human health in our region.
    Changes to the types of diseases and illnesses affecting the 
animals in the region is creating new threats to humans that were not 
historically a concern. For example, we have seen the emergence of 
brucellosis in caribou and walrus populations and distemper outbreaks 
in seal populations. These animals provide a critical food source for 
our communities.
    There have also been recent detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian 
Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in wild birds, and there is evidence that these 
have jumped to some wild mammals in Alaska. As far back as 2005, YKHC 
has worked with USFWS and tribes in the region to provide HPAI 
surveillance and monitoring and hunter education as a part of a ``be 
prepared, not scared campaign,'' to help ensure our people can continue 
to participate in subsistence in a safe and healthy way.
    These are only two examples which show that having dedicated YKHC 
staff to investigate zoonotic illness outbreaks and communicate health 
risks is critical to protecting human health in our region.
II. This Legislation will enable YKHC to help address the most pressing 
        zoonotic illness in the region.
    Rabies is the most pressing of zoonotic illness in the region and 
it poses a significant threat to public health. Rabies is transmitted 
through bites or contact with infected animals. It is considered 
enzootic throughout northern and western Alaska where it is always 
present among fox in the area. Occasionally, we have cases where humans 
are attacks by rabid fox or wolf, but the greatest risk to humans comes 
from dogs who have been bitten by an affected fox. The risk of being 
bitten by a dog in rural Alaska is higher than other areas due to the 
prevalence of rabies and the large number of stray and unwanted pets 
that occur in areas without sufficient spay and neuter services.
    YKHC's environmental health services team works with local health 
aides and medical providers to identify cases of animal bite. In a 
typical year, there are over 100 dog bite investigations to ensure 
rabies transmission does not occur, and to determine if post exposure 
prophylaxis is necessary, which is recommended in approximately 20 
percent of cases. Not only are bites a risk for rabies, but the attack 
themselves can lead to serious adverse health outcomes or death. We 
believe this legislation will reduce the incidence of preventable 
injuries and illnesses among the people of our region.
III. Veterinary Care is Health Care
    In 2008, at a joint strategic framework meeting involving the 
American Medical Association, the American Veterinary Medical 
Association and other major health groups, the term ``One health'' was 
adopted to refer to the interdependence of human, animal, and 
environmental health. This modern holistic approach aligns with 
longstanding indigenous understanding that our connectedness to the 
land and animals are essential to improving not only physical health 
but also mental, behavioral, emotional, cultural, and spiritual well-
being.
    This legislation will support the One Health vision and improve 
health outcomes for our communities by enhancing our ability to address 
zoonotic diseases and by recognizing veterinary services are a critical 
function to improve the health status of Alaska Natives. We are excited 
about this legislative effort and believe it will significantly enhance 
our ability to ensure the well-being of our people in a culturally 
relevant way.
    Quyana for the opportunity and honor to provide testimony today.

    The Chairman. Thanks to all our witnesses.
    I want to start with Assistant Secretary Egorin. The 
Committee submitted questions for the record for hearings we 
held last December, which was an oversight hearing, and then in 
February, which was a legislative hearing. What is the status 
for receiving responses to these questions for the record?
    Ms. Egorin. Senator, we are in the final stages of 
clearance of the questions for the record. As we noted with 
your staff yesterday, we hope to have them by the end of the 
month. I do recognize that this is a delayed timeline, and have 
personally asked to make sure they are expedited.
    The Chairman. Is there somebody we should be talking to to 
emphasize that it is pretty difficult to do oversight if it 
takes nine months to get an answer to a question?
    Ms. Egorin. Senator, I am the right person to express that, 
and as I said to my team and to many of your colleagues, please 
feel free to reach out to me if you are not getting a response. 
Please feel free to highlight this. I will shake trees and 
pound fists to move things along.
    The Chairman. Okay. What happened?
    Ms. Egorin. There is a clearance process and your Committee 
is one of multiple with questions for the record that must go 
through a process of drafting and clearance. We are a small and 
mighty team. And it is really just a process of working through 
this, along with the other functions that the Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation's Office is responsible for.
    The Chairman. Okay. I don't want to steal my Vice Chair's 
thunder on the veterinary services thing, but I want to get 
some clarity here. It seems like you are saying two things 
about veterinary services. In the beginning of your testimony 
you seemed to say essentially that there is a balance to be 
struck in terms of the deployment of resources. Am I getting 
that part right?
    Ms. Egorin. There is a balance to be struck.
    The Chairman. And the second thing is like you need an 
authorization. So I am trying to figure out whether you are 
permitted to provide these services but you just don't have the 
money, so you want an authorization and an appropriation? is 
this a legal question? Or is it just a, we can't do everything 
and we are having to triage this thing?
    Those really are two different questions.
    Ms. Egorin. They are two different questions. As I said, 
the department supports the intent of this legislation. The 
challenge is, right now we do not have the legal authority to 
provide veterinary services. Therefore, for tribes to keep 
their ISDEA agreements, we cannot authorize those services.
    But at the same time, IHS has very limited resources. So to 
add this to the list of services would then put pressure on 
other areas.
    The Chairman. Okay, so you say you have a legal impediment 
and a fiscal one?
    Ms. Egorin. Yes.
    The Chairman. Okay, got it. And could IHS offer these 
services through 638?
    Ms. Egorin. No. Right now we are prohibited from offering 
these services.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Chairwoman Pinto, besides much-needed housing for your 
tribal members, what other activities does the tribe plan on 
the land to be placed into trust and why is it so important to 
place that land into trust?
    Ms. Pinto. Thank you for the question, Chair Schatz. It is 
important for us because we have been without a community for 
the last 20-plus years. We plan on bringing, in addition to the 
homes, much-needed homes, we have a commercial space there 
where we can bring a grocery store, retail space, a museum, a 
tribal police station. I am really looking forward to a 
commercial kitchen, because without our indigenous foods, our 
traditional foods, it is hard to be a healthy person and get 
into these healthy habits. It's so easy to go to McDonald's.
    So we plan on bringing those kinds of amenities for the 
members, but also for the community at large in Jamul.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Chairman Talbert, can you describe how the Park Service's 
ecosystem restoration work being done in the Everglades has 
impacted the Camp?
    Mr. Talbert. Sure. Right now, what's going on is they are 
raising the Tamiami Trail. They are bridging it so that water 
can flow through more consistently. And it will flow into the 
southern Everglades. The Camp is situated right in the flow-
way. So the authorization of this bill would include funding to 
help raise the structures in the Camp in order to protect the 
people that live there, and also to help facilitate the 
restoration.
    The Chairman. Just so I am getting the context here, would 
you characterize your relationship with the Park Service as 
reasonably collaborative?
    Mr. Talbert. Yes, they have been reasonably collaborative. 
They meet with the members of the Camp there independently 
without the tribal government's presence. But we also meet with 
them together as well.
    So it is a very strong effort in order to see this project 
through.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Mr. Freihage, since they are not described in the bill, 
what are the ``appropriate actions'' that the Secretary of 
Interior can take to protect the Camp?
    Mr. Freihage. As the chairman noted, because the water 
levels will be raised, it is necessary to elevate the lands and 
some of the structures so they are not flooded. The work would 
also include reestablishing roadways and driveways to the Camp 
in addition to replacing the utilities across the site.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Vice Chair Murkowski?
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to 
go back to you, Assistant Secretary Egorin. You have made clear 
in response to the Chairman that currently, IHS does not have 
the authorization. So you do not have the legal authority to 
include the veterinary services, specifically spay and neuter 
services, in an ISDEA contract or compact. That is correct?
    Ms. Egorin. That is correct.
    Senator Murkowski. So that is correct. So that is why, this 
is the question. Is that why, then, IHS had previously denied 
the request by both, well, there were two tribal health 
organizations in Alaska, at YKHC and Maniilaq, when they sought 
to add veterinary spay and neuter services to their self-
governance agreements, because they lacked the authority?
    Ms. Egorin. Senator, that is correct.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. So this bill will fix that legal 
authority, is that correct?
    Ms. Egorin. That is correct.
    Senator Murkowski. And then I get what you have said about 
balancing limited resources. We understand that. But we also 
know that you have to have the legal authority first. So that 
is what we are trying to do here.
    To what extent is IHS assisting tribes right now with spay 
and neutering services? Are you doing anything at all?
    Ms. Egorin. Thank you for that question, Senator. IHS just 
really looks at this issue through the lens of public health. 
And what they do right now with tribes is working through 
community education, messaging and coordination, and providing 
support for partners including tribes.
    Senator Murkowski. So you are doing that. What is your 
funding source for that public education then?
    Ms. Egorin. That comes from, as part of our larger public 
health messaging and public health work.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. All right. Based on your extensive 
testimony, which I appreciate, it sounds like you would agree 
that an authorization to IHS to support spay and neutering 
under ISDEA agreements is going to help as we are dealing with 
these dog populations that are real problems, whether it is in 
Navajo Nation or in Alaska?
    Ms. Egorin. Senator, this legislation would allow ISDEA 
agreements to include these services, and if that is what a 
tribe would like to include in an agreement, it will allow us 
to work with them.
    Senator Murkowski. So we can talk about the funding aspect 
of it, but you have also raised another question, another 
concern in recognizing that we don't have rabies testing that 
is out in these areas. So whether it is northern Alaska or in 
parts of Indian Country, to what extent is IHS actually 
collecting data then on the dog bites and the rabies exposures? 
You have listed, you said 24,000 ambulatory cases.
    So you are obviously making some level of accounting. Where 
are the gaps in that, and the One Health framework that 
Commander Lefferts mentioned, to what extent is IHS working 
with CDC interagency on an initiative that does this kind of 
monitoring?
    Ms. Egorin. Thank you for recognizing the work that the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does. They are the 
public health surveillance operation within HHS. They work 
closely with IHS as well as with State and local partners to 
monitor not just rabies but other public health concerns. It is 
their data that showed that there was a 15 percent, or a 15 
times lower testing rate in tribal communities than communities 
around them.
    They are working with tribal partners. There are 
limitations within IHS and within the capacities of their 
facilities. We continue to work with State, local and other 
partners to make sure that we are doing surveillance the best 
we can with the current parties.
    Senator Murkowski. So let me ask, Commander Lefferts, when 
we think about the impact of a dog bite, we think, okay, trauma 
to the child, the family, it is scary. But when you are in a 
rural community and you don't have the ability to do the 
testing there, more often than not it is going to require a 
trip either from the village to Bethel or a trip into 
Anchorage. You may have hospitalization costs.
    Can you speak to just really the cost, and I hate to try to 
equate it to just dollars, but the Assistant Secretary here has 
said we are balancing resources here. But if in fact you have 
costs that could average, as I understand, around $20,000 per 
person plus lost wages plus travel costs if folks have to fly, 
then that is also a balancing factor if that individual is 
being treated through IHS facilities.
    Commander Lefferts, can you just speak to that aspect of 
what rabies treatments in rural Alaska really means?
    Mr. Lefferts. Thank you, Senator, for the question. Yes, 
each time someone is bitten by a dog, somebody from the Office 
of Environmental Health at YKHC works with people locally to 
try to identify if that dog had been vaccinated previously and 
if they can put it under quarantine. Oftentimes, we are unable 
to locate the dog or we send it off for testing and it is 
positive for rabies, in which case we will have to offer post-
exposure prophylactic treatment to anyone who had come into 
contact with that.
    Senator Murkowski. Can I interrupt you right there, 
Commander? When you send this off for testing, how long does it 
take to turn that around? I am assuming your testing lab is 
Anchorage.
    Mr. Lefferts. Yes, we send it to the virology lab in 
Fairbanks. So it could take a couple of days to get the animal 
there, and then they usually prioritize these tests and we can 
have results within another day of receiving it or so.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. So you have the cost associated 
with the actual testing, but the cost to the individual again 
for treatment is not cheap.
    Mr. Lefferts. So this is, yes, it is a series of treatments 
as well, so we have to treat the individual, the first 
treatment often comes with flying them into Bethel, which is, 
as you mentioned, very expensive. The treatment itself is 
several thousand dollars. Then it is a series of treatments 
that has to be done after that. If there is no local health 
clinic, that patient would then need to be flown back to Bethel 
for multiple treatments.
    This can be quite burdensome on the family. If it is a 
child, they will need to have an adult accompany them on the 
trip. That creates additional burdens on the family who has one 
of the caregivers away from the community the whole time they 
are accompanying the child to Bethel for treatment.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I am out of 
time.
    The Chairman. Thank you very much to our testifiers. If 
there are no more questions for our witnesses, members may also 
submit follow-up written questions for the record. The hearing 
record will remain open for two weeks, and I want to thank all 
the witnesses for their time and their testimony.
    This hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:43 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

   Prepared Statement of Richard Brannan, CEO, Wind River Family and 
                      Community Healthcare Systems
Our Service Area is Ground Zero for Dog Bites in Wyoming
    I appreciate this opportunity to share with this Committee the 
perspective of a 638 tribal health care facility about the very real 
public health emergency of dog bites for Native families. Wind River 
Family and Community Health Care Systems (WRC) was established in 2016 
to serve the Wind River Indian Reservation that is home to Wyoming's 
two tribes--the Northern Arapaho Tribe (NAT) and the Eastern Shoshone 
Tribe--and ground zero for 50 percent of all dog bites in the state of 
Wyoming. We respectfully submit this testimony to share with Congress 
the perspective of tribal medical personnel about the urgent need to 
expand the authority of the Indian Health Service to include veterinary 
health care.
Dog Bites Increased More Than 90 percent on the Wind River Reservation 
        Between 2017 and 2020
    In 2020, we compiled a report for Dog Bites on the Wind River 
Indian Reservation using data collected from multiple agencies, 
including WRC, Sage West Hospital Emergency Room, Indian Health 
Services in Fort Washakie, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs Wind River 
Agency. The data revealed that in just three years the incidence of dog 
bites increased 91 percent. At the time, we could not determine if the 
increase was linked to an increase in dog attacks, an increase in 
accessibility to services, an increase in reporting by the agencies or 
a combination of all.
    Last year, we reexamined the issue using data collected from our 
organization alone. In the last three years, our organization has seen 
a total of 183 patients for dog bites. There were a total of 232 
injuries reported and a combined total of three hundred sixty-five 365 
dog-bite related visits to the clinics. The nature of this injury is 
unique in that it affects the entire population, regardless of age or 
gender--the youngest patient seen in our clinics being one year of age 
and the oldest patient being 81.
    The rate of dog bites our patients suffer is significantly 
disproportionate to surrounding communities and the state of Wyoming 
overall. If state reports included the number of dog bites in the area, 
the Wind River Indian Reservation would account for over 50 percent of 
the total injuries reported in Wyoming during 2023.
    The number of feral dogs roaming the community has grown throughout 
the past several years correlating with increases in dog bite injuries 
throughout the same time period.
Free Roaming Dogs Take a Toll on Physical and Mental Wellness
    The local community has become increasingly wary of feral dogs. In 
a recent wellness survey conducted by our team, respondents highlighted 
presence and aggressive or feral dogs as a top reason for not partaking 
in outdoor wellness activities due to fear for personal safety. And 
with good reason.
    Dog bites pose the risk of fractures, scarring, nerve and muscle 
damage, and infection such as rabies and tetanus. Patients who suffer 
from dog bite injuries are often bitten by stray or unaccounted for 
dogs that may not have vaccinations. This vaccination uncertainty 
contributes to more care needed by patients due to rabies shots being a 
recommended addition to their injury treatment.
    Our patients who suffer from dog bite injuries suffer physical 
trauma, mental/emotional distress, in addition to feeling unsafe within 
their community.
Dog Bites are Costly to Both Tribal Families and Tribal Health Care 
        Facilities
    Dog bite injuries on the Wind River Reservation are not only 
prevalent but costly. We estimate their total treatment cost to be more 
than $28,000 for an average child and $46,000 for an average adult. 
Such costs can deter local families from seeking proper care and force 
local health care facilities like ours to redirect our limited health 
care resources. Clinically speaking, dog bites are trauma injuries that 
require immediate medical attention. The 183 dog bite patients we have 
treated in the past three years cost our facility more than $5 million.
    We cannot support taking IHS resources away from existing programs 
to fund a new veterinary health program. But neither we nor our 
patients can afford for the federal government to continue ignoring 
this problem either. WRC supports the expansion of IHS authority to 
include veterinary health care in order to protect our patients from 
traumatic injury and our tribal health care system from financial harm.
IHS Authority Limits Our Capacity to Serve Our Community
    As a 638 tribal health care facility, WRC cannot contract with the 
IHS to provide services to limit the dog population or incidence of 
zoonotic diseases on the Wind River Reservation because IHS currently 
lacks the authority to approve such contracts. We are grateful for the 
Senate Committee on Indian Affairs holding a hearing on this urgent 
public health issue. We welcome Committee Members to visit us here on 
the Wind River Reservation and see for themselves the challenges our 
patients face navigating a community full of free roaming dogs due to 
the lack of tribal veterinary care. We thank the Committee for striving 
to create sustainable, long-term solutions and stand ready to be part 
of t1e solution.
                                 ______
                                 
   Prepared Statement of James W. Crosby, M.S., Ph.D., CBCC-KA, CDBC 
                Research Associate Canine Brain Project
    Thank you, Chairperson Schatz, Vice Chairperson Murkowski, and 
Members of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, for holding this 
hearing on a critical matter of public health and safety, S. 4365.
    I am an expert in dog behavior and particularly the details and 
data behind human Dog Bite Related Fatalities. I have studied these 
cases across the U.S., within the U.K., Australia, Ireland and Canada.
    Free-roaming dogs in the desert Southwest in the U.S. are a clear 
threat to public safety. I have reviewed a number of attacks that have 
happened within the American Indigenous lands, including the Navajo 
Nation. Typically, human fatalities in these areas are from roaming, 
unmonitored and most likely reproductively intact domesticated dogs 
that have returned to a nearly feral state. The most common victim in 
this geographic area is a person alone, often walking for 
transportation, in areas of the Indigenous Nations that lack even basic 
animal control resources.
    Currently the Navajo Nation and their Tribal Police are horribly 
limited in the resources they have to address this problem. Charitable 
organizations help, but it is critical that Federal resources be 
deployed towards the issue of fatal attacks, veterinary services to 
humanely reduce the dog population, and reducing public health risks 
due to dog bites.
    According to the AVMA, reproduc??vely intact males are involved in 
70 to 76 percent of reported dog bite incidents. Unspayed females 
attract groups of free-roaming intact male dogs, increasing the bite 
risk to humans. Mother dogs are very protective of their puppies and 
may bite those who try to handle the young.
    I strongly urge you and the Committee to commit deeply important 
and needed resources to this part of our Southwestern population to 
increase safety, quality of life, and reduce what is an oft-
unrecognized threat.
                                 ______
                                 
Prepared Statement of Hon. Vince James, Chairman, Health Education and 
          Human Services Committee, 25th Navajo Nation Council
    I am pleased to acknowledge the introduction of S. 4365, the 
Veterinary Services to Improve Public Health in Rural Communities Act, 
by U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Vice Chairman of the U.S. Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs. This significant piece of legislation aims 
to prevent and control severe and life-threatening zoonotic diseases, 
which are infections that spread between people and animals, in rural 
and tribal communities.
    The health and well-being of our Navajo people are of utmost 
importance, and this bill represents a crucial step forward in ensuring 
that our communities have the necessary resources to address zoonotic 
diseases effectively. By providing enhanced veterinary services, we can 
better protect our families and livestock, ultimately improving public 
health outcomes across our Nation.
    For the Navajo Nation, this legislation would bring substantial 
benefits. Enhanced veterinary services would help safeguard our 
livestock, which are a vital part of our culture, economy, and daily 
sustenance. Improved control of zoonotic diseases would reduce health 
risks and medical costs for our people, ensuring a healthier and more 
resilient community. This initiative also aligns with our ongoing 
efforts to enhance healthcare infrastructure and services across the 
Navajo Nation.
    I commend Senator Murkowski for her leadership and commitment to 
addressing the unique challenges faced by rural and tribal communities. 
We look forward to working collaboratively to support the passage of 
this vital legislation and to furthering the health and safety of our 
people.
    Thank you.
                                 ______
                                 
 Prepared Statement of Kevin James May, Chair, Jamul-Dulzura Community 
                             Planning Group
    Dear Chairman Schatz,
    To introduce ourselves, we are the Jamul-Dulzura Community Planning 
Group in the Unincorporated County of San Diego. We are publicly 
elected to serve in the best interest of the community regarding land 
matters. We are grateful to have another opportunity to participate in 
the democratic process and share our perspective on the very unique 
circumstances and context of the Jamul Indian Village (JIV) and Jamul 
Casino in our planning area.
    Since learning of the ``Jamul Indian Land Transfer Act'' Bill H.R. 
6443 on December 5, 2023, we have written to our Congressman, Darrell 
E. Issa, and to Chair Harriet Hageman of the Indian Affairs and Insular 
Committee and cc'd a lengthy list including Senator Alex Padilla and US 
President Joseph Biden. This letter sent on January 9, 2024, is 
attached. We make the case against the ``Land Transfer Act'' as the 
means to accomplish this land to trust acquisition. There exists a 
Federally recognized process through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) 
and the Department of the Interior (DOI) for handling land to trust 
applications which will engage the local community and the County Board 
of Supervisors in resolving land use issues, jurisdictional conflicts 
and provide the planning and resources to ensure public safety as our 
community expands with commercial entertainment venues by the Jamul 
Casino.
    In contrast, the Pala Mission Band of Indians Land Transfer Act 
Bill H.R. 423, approved by the Senate on July 27, 2023, which saved the 
721-acre Gregory Canyon from a landfill operation proposal in North San 
Diego County, was opposed by everyone; local governments, conservation 
groups and the Pala Tribe itself. This was a great outcome. The tribe 
in effect saved the day by purchasing it. This Bill presented by 
Representative Darrel E. Issa and sponsored by Senator Alex Padilla was 
a grand win-win success story, although we have no doubt the DOI would 
have streamlined this through the process. However, our situation is 
very different, and this one method cannot be arbitrarily applied to 
all cases.
    In the Report accompanying Bill H.R. 6443, Chair Westerman of the 
House on Natural Resources gives a very brief background on the tribal 
history with information qualified ``as according to the Tribe'' and 
concludes the need for this legislation as the right remedy. We could 
not disagree more. This Report is very incomplete. There is no mention 
of the possible reasons for the internal conflicts between the Jamul 
Indian Village (JIV) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) alluded to 
in this Report that would impede land to trust applications. Our letter 
delineates numerous problems with the JIV's choice of land parcels, but 
one source of great concern for the BIA might be found in the history 
of the casino developers. In 2018, the JIV defaulted on a 48- million-
dollar loan and other financial obligations totaling close to 77 
million dollars.
    Simultaneously, the developer Penn National Gaming was ousted as 
manager of the Hollywood Casino yet still holds a 101acre parcel of 
land that is contiguous to the 4-acre JIV. This should be a huge red 
flag for this Committee. Afterwards, the JIV started buying up 
noncontiguous parcels for land to trust acquisitions near the middle of 
the town center.
    This Land Transfer Act is not an alternative of last resort as 
suggested in the Westerman Report. On May 5, 2021, the San Diego County 
Board of Supervisors voted to lift a County wide blanket opposition to 
``fee-to-trust'' applications, in place since 1994, and they laid the 
framework for future ``fee-to-trust'' proposals. There is a path 
forward here in San Diego County.
    Working through the Federal process approach lives up to the 
cooperative ``nation to nation ties'' ideal of the Proclamation of 
Indigenous People. Our Community Planning Group welcomes the 
opportunity to meet and discuss and answer any question you have. We 
look forward to hearing from you.

    Our Community Planning Group watched your Senate Hearing, and we 
thank you for inviting us to participate and offer our comments.
    We were especially grateful for your question to Chairwoman Pinto 
regarding what other commercial projects she was planning. This cuts to 
the heart of our biggest concern of rapidly expanding casino related 
business enterprises that will continue to overburden aging 
transportation road networks in our rural area without cooperative 
agreements negotiated with our local government to plan for and share 
the enormous costs for these infrastructure projects.
    Casinos in Southern California with close proximity to coastal 
communities thrive and become their own mini Las Vegas, like Viejas and 
Sycuan, which evolved into luxury resort entertainment and shopping 
destinations. As we mentioned in our letters, the Jamul Casino, already 
a 228,000 square foot facility completed in 2016, is in its 2nd stage 
build-out adding a 16-story hotel and expanded event and entertainment 
center. Since the opening of the casino, Jamul has experienced 
significant increases in Average Daily Trips (ADT) that peak on 
Saturdays by an additional 13,000 ADT, as reported by the Jamul Indian 
Village (JIV) in 2022. This causes major traffic congestion on SR-94, a 
2-lane state rural highway which is the main travel route for our 
community. Our roads are beyond capacity in our region of Jamul-
Dulzura. Furthermore, the entire geographic area is rated as a High or 
Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, and wildfire emergency evacuation 
remains the biggest threat to our survival in the backcountry during 
fire season.
    We believe that Senator Padilla and Representative Issa are well 
meaning in their efforts to assist in the cause to repatriate native 
lands, but following the inception of the JIV in 1978, when the Daley 
Family deeded 4.66 acres to a Trust for Native American families, the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Pacific Region and Riverside District 
Office have managed the entire history of applications and negotiations 
to establish land and tribal status. To remove the BIA from their 
traditional role without justification should be a red flag for this 
committee.
    In the late 1990's, casino developers began competing for gaming 
rights. Harrah's Casino and Stations Casino were early competitors, but 
both eventually failed. Then, Lakes Gaming Inc. tried and was 
unsuccessful as well, but did purchase two contiguous parcels of 86 and 
10 acres. Finally, in 2012 Penn National Gaming was able to create some 
legitimacy for gaming, despite the earlier conflicts with the BIA, and 
bought out Lakes Gaming's interest including the two parcels. In 2018, 
two years after the completion of the ``Hollywood Casino'', the JIV 
defaulted on massive loans arranged by Penn National Gaming, terminated 
their contract, and reestablished themselves as the ``Jamul Casino''. 
The two contiguous parcels were retained by Penn National Gaming. 
Additionally, the cemetery, parcel #4, is burdened by a ``fraudulent 
conveyance'' lawsuit against the Roman Catholic Diocese. We are 
including a Map of the Jamul Area showing significant features, 
identifying the parcels in play and giving context to the geographic 
relationships.
    A ``Land Transfer Act'' is an all or nothing strategy and is not an 
appropriate vehicle in this situation. Once ratified, the BIA will be 
removed of its traditional role in resolving jurisdictional and 
internal conflicts, and all parties, (Local, County and State 
Government representatives and agencies, and Natural Communities) will 
be shut out of the possibility to negotiate anything.

        1. For Off-Reservation issues of public safety: There will be 
        massive increases of traffic without funding for roads and 
        infrastructure improvements to accommodate emergency evacuation 
        planning.

        2. For Off-Reservation conflicts with the long-term goals of 
        our subarea land-use plans: Without negotiations to protect the 
        most biologically diverse region in the continental United 
        States from an expanding gaming industry, we will fail in our 
        stated mission to ``remain rural'' and ``to preserve natural 
        resources for future generations.''

    Unfortunately, both Senator Padilla with Bill S. 3857 and 
Representative Issa with Bill H.R. 6443 have overlooked the 
complexities of this community, our Planning Area, and the history of 
legal entanglements of the JIV.
    We have previously written extensive and detailed letters 
explaining our situation and we welcome the opportunity to appear in an 
online conference to answer any questions you may have. We are able to 
supply documentation from 1978 onward to back up our claims including 
from the BIA district office. We have been truthful and we stand by our 
testimony. Thank you for listening to us.

     Prepared Statement of Dr. Buu Nygren, President, Navajo Nation
    Ya'at'eeh, Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairwoman Murkowski and members 
of the Committee. My name is Dr. Buu Nygren and I am the President of 
the Navajo Nation. Thank you for the opportunity to submit written 
testimony in support of the Technical Corrections to the Northwestern 
New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act, Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights 
Settlement Act, and Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, S. 3406. Thank 
you also to Senator Lujan and Senator Heinrich for sponsoring this 
legislation. The Navajo Nation strongly supports this bill, which would 
fix problems with the trust fund language included in multiple Indian 
water rights settlements enacted during the 2009 and 2010 time period, 
including the three settlements addressed in S. 3406. The settlements 
to be fixed by this legislation are the Navajo Nation settlement of 
water rights in the San Juan River Basin in New Mexico, the Taos Pueblo 
settlement, and the Aamodt settlement of the water rights of the 
Pueblos of Nambe, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso and Tesuque.
    The legislation makes a technical fix to Pub. L. No. 111-11, the 
legislation that both authorized a settlement of the Navajo Nation's 
water rights in the San Juan River Basin and created a Navajo Nation 
Water Resources Development Trust Fund (Navajo Trust Fund or Trust 
Fund). The technical fix is needed because a provision in Pub. L. No. 
111-11 prohibited investment of the Navajo Trust Fund for ten years 
following enactment of the legislation, until 2019. This provision 
prohibiting investment for ten years is not typical in Indian water 
rights settlements and resulted in the Navajo Nation being deprived of 
millions of dollars of interest that otherwise should have accrued to 
the Navajo Trust Fund. The $6.3 million that S. 3406 would authorize to 
be appropriated to the Navajo Trust Fund represents the amount of money 
that would have accrued in our Trust Fund if it had been properly 
invested and allowed to remain in the Trust Fund prior to 2019. S. 3406 
also includes provisions that make a similar fix to the trust funds for 
two other New Mexico-based Indian water rights settlements originally 
authorized in the Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, Pub. 
L. No. 111-291 and the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 
111-291. These water rights settlements also had technical errors that 
resulted in the lack of appropriate investment of settlement trust 
funds.
    The Navajo Trust Fund established under section 10702 of Pub. L. 
111-11 can be used by the Navajo Nation both for construction of 
necessary water facilities and for water conservation activities needed 
for the Nation to utilize its water rights in the San Juan River Basin. 
This Trust Fund has and will continue to provide vitally important 
funding for the Nation to use in exercising the water rights recognized 
in Pub. L. 111-11 by completing the construction of facilities that are 
being built to fulfill the promises of the water rights settlement. 
Indeed, this fix to the Trust Fund language is necessary to fulfill the 
promise that the San Jan River Basin settlement represents to the 
Navajo Nation.
    Indian water settlements provide certainty concerning the 
availability of water supplies for all parties. This is good policy and 
good sense. Consistent with the federal trust responsibility, funding 
these settlements is critical to ensuring the ability of settling 
tribes to put their water to use. Enacting this bill is an important 
step towards fulfilling the economic potential created by the water 
rights settlements that Congress enacted for the Navajo Nation, the 
Taos Pueblo, and the Pueblos covered by the Aamodt settlement. I 
therefore respectfully urge the Committee to support swift passage of 
this legislation.

    Additional letter

 Re: Letter of Support for S.4365--The Veterinary Services 
          to Improve Public Health in Rural Communities Act

Dear Senator Murkowski,

    On behalf of the Navajo Nation (``Nation''), I am writing to 
express support for S. 4365--the Veterinary Services to Improve Public 
Health in Rural Communities Act. This vital piece of legislation 
addresses a critical public health issue within the Navajo Nation and 
other Indian Health Service (IHS) areas where rabies and animal attacks 
are significant threats to our communities.
    From 2001 to 2008, the rate of dog bites among Native children in 
the Southwest Region was 70 percent higher than the national average. 
Currently, the Navajo Nation is home to approximately 250,000 dogs. Our 
Animal Control Program (NNAC) reports over 3,000 annual treatments for 
animal attacks, predominantly affecting children and the elderly. 
Additionally, between 2012 and 2016, there were 68 citations issued for 
non-compliance with rabies vaccination requirements under our Rabies 
Control Code.
    Your bill focuses on providing veterinary public health services, 
including spaying and neutering, vaccination, and surveillance, is 
essential for reducing the risk of rabies and other zoonotic diseases. 
These services will significantly benefit the Navajo Nation by helping 
to control the dog population and prevent rabies outbreaks. The 
proposed addition of Veterinary Public Health Officers from the 
Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service, coordinated by the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, will enhance our capability to 
manage these public health risks effectively. I also appreciate the 
requirement for tribal consultation to determine funding distribution 
ensures that the unique needs of each tribe, including the Nation.
    I would recommend that the bill also include provisions for spaying 
and neutering feral dogs, as they constitute a significant portion of 
our dog population and contribute to the public health challenges we 
face. Additionally, leveraging the expertise and resources of the 
Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 
(APHIS) could enhance the bill's effectiveness in managing zoonotic 
diseases and supporting spay/neuter clinics.
    We are grateful for your leadership in sponsoring this legislation 
and your commitment to inproving public health in rural communities. I 
look forward to supporting the implementation of this bill and 
collaborating to ensure its success.
                                 ______
                                 
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Fred L. Romero, Governor, Pueblo of Taos
    Good afternoon Chairman Schatz, Vice Chairwoman Murkowski and 
members of the Committee. My name is Fred Romero and I am the Governor 
of Taos Pueblo.
    I am here today to discuss S. 3406, the ``Technical Corrections to 
the Northwestern New Mexico Rural Water Projects Act, Taos Pueblo 
Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, and Aamodt Litigation Settlement 
Act''. My testimony addresses Section 3, entitled ``Authorization of 
Payment of Adjusted Interest on the Taos Pueblo Water Development 
Fund,'' and Section 5(a) entitled ``Section 509 of the Claims 
Resolution Act of 2010.''
1. Taos Pueblo
    Taos Pueblo, Tau-Tah, the place of the Red Willows, is located in 
North-Central New Mexico. Our people, Tauh tah Dainah, have lived in 
the Taos Valley since time immemorial, and as the first users of the 
Valley's water resources, constructed irrigation systems still in use 
today.
    We have over 2,700 enrolled members. Our land base is approximately 
111,372 acres, including farmlands and range lands in the Taos Valley 
and mountains with peaks reaching nearly 13,000 feet. Our Pueblo lands 
include a culturally important and hydrologically unique wetland that 
supports herbs, plants, clays, bison and other wildlife, and waterfowl 
essential to our traditional and ceremonial way of life. This wetland 
is known as the Taos Pueblo Buffalo Pasture.
    Taos Pueblo is a National Historic Landmark and was designated a 
World Heritage Site in recognition of our enduring living culture.
2. The Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, Title V of the 
        Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-291)
    In 2010, Congress enacted the Claims Resolution Act (P.L. 111-291), 
including Title V, the Taos Pueblo Indian Water Rights Settlement Act 
(``Settlement Act''). The Settlement Act recognized Taos Pueblo's 
extensive water rights and authorized and approved the settlement 
negotiated among Taos Pueblo and other parties to the adjudication of 
the waters of the Taos Valley. The adjudication, entitled State of New 
Mexico ex rel. State Engineer v. Abeyta and State of New Mexico ex rel 
State Engineer v. Arrellano, was filed in the United States District 
Court for the District of New Mexico in 1969. The adjudication includes 
three tributaries of the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico, namely the 
Rio Pueblo, Rio Lucero and Rio Hondo, or in our Tiwa language, the 
Tuatah Bah-ah-nah, Bah bah til Bah ah nah, and Too-hoo Bah ah nah. Our 
Blue Lake Wilderness Area is a major part of the watershed for the 
streams in the adjudication.
    The settlement was the product of decades of litigation and 
negotiation. It ends centuries of disputes between the Pueblo and our 
non-Indian neighbors. The Settlement Act authorized $36 million in 
federal funding, with a State of New Mexico cost contribution in 
addition to this amount, for a number of ``Mutual-Benefit Projects'' 
tailored to resolve complicated disputes over specific water issues.
    Section 505(a) of the Settlement Act also established the Taos 
Pueblo Water Development Fund to pay or reimburse costs incurred by the 
the Pueblo for:

        (1) acquiring water rights;

        (2) planning, permitting, designing, engineering, constructing, 
        reconstructing, replacing, rehabilitating, operating, or 
        repairing water production, treatment or delivery 
        infrastructure, on-farm improvements, or wastewater 
        infrastructure;

        (3) restoring, preserving and protecting the Buffalo Pasture, 
        including planning, permitting, designing, engineering, 
        constructing, operating, managing and replacing the Buffalo 
        Pasture Recharge Project;

        (4) administering the Pueblo's water rights acquisition program 
        and water management and administration system; and

        (5) watershed protection and enhancement, support of 
        agriculture, water-related Pueblo community welfare and 
        economic development, and costs related to the negotiation, 
        authorization, and implementation of the Settlement Agreement.

    The Settlement Act authorized $50 million in a mandatory 
appropriation to the Taos Pueblo Water Development Fund and authorized 
appropriations of an additional $38 million, as adjusted by such 
amounts as may be required due to increases since April 1, 2007, in 
construction costs, as indicated by engineering cost indices.
    The settlement became final and enforceable on October 7, 2016 when 
the Secretary of the Interior published her finding in the Federal 
Register that all conditions precedent to enforceability had been 
fulfilled.
3. Pre-Enforcement Date Investment Prohibition
    Typically, Federal Indian water rights settlement legislation 
authorizes Tribal settlement funds to be invested during the period of 
time from when the funds are deposited until they can be utilized on 
the settlement enforcement date. Yet our Settlement Act, and other 
affected Indian water rights settlement legislation enacted in 2009 and 
2010, was unusual in that its directive to the Secretary to invest the 
Taos Pueblo Water Development Fund specified ``upon the Enforcement 
Date,'' instead of upon the deposit date. Section 505(c), Title V of 
the Claims Resolution Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-291). The result was the 
loss of millions of dollars in potential investment earning that could 
otherwise have accrued during the nearly six years between enactment 
and the Enforcement Date. But for the words ``upon the Enforcement 
Date,'' those six years worth of investment earnings could have been 
available for implementation of our settlement.
4. Sections 3 and 5(a) of S. 3406, ``Authorization of Payment of 
        Adjusted 
        Interest on the Taos Pueblo Water Development Fund''
    Section 3 of S. 3406 provides a technical correction to recover 
these lost investment earnings through an authorization to appropriate 
$7,794,297.52 to the Taos Pueblo Water Development Fund. This technical 
correction will facilitate implementation of the settlement and will 
have substantial, tangible benefits to Taos Pueblo. The appropriations 
authorized by the technical correction will be subject to the 
authorized uses specified in Section 505(a) of the Settlement Act, such 
as water rights management and administration, surface water irrigation 
infrastructure improvements, and restoration of the Taos Pueblo Buffalo 
Pasture wetland.
    Section 5(a) of S. 3406 makes clear that nothing in the legislation 
affects the previous satisfaction of the conditions precedent in 
Section 509(f)(2) of the Settlement Act, or affects the validity of the 
Secretarial finding published in the Federal Register on October 7, 
2016, pursuant to Section 509(f)(1) of the Settlement Act, that such 
conditions precedent were fully satisfied.
    Taos Pueblo is in full support of this legislation. We believe the 
Department of Interior supports Section 3 of S. 3406 based on our 
conversations with them during the development of this bill and in 
light of testimony for the Department of the Interior before the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs in support of a similar technical amendment 
for the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes' settlement legislation. In that 
testimony, Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Bryan Newland noted 
that ``prohibiting investment until an enforceability date is reached 
is not common in Indian water rights settlements,'' and ``as a matter 
of equity, [the Department] would support similar legislation to 
resolve this same issue in the four other Indian water rights 
settlements approved by Congress in 2009 and 2010.'' Our Taos Pueblo 
settlement is one of the settlements. \1\

5. Conclusion
    S. 3406 would correct an injustice in our original water settlement 
legislation and would provide funding to help put our water rights to 
use for the Taos Pueblo people. We ask that you support this technical 
correction amendment and move the bill expeditiously.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I'm happy to answer any 
questions from the Committee.

 Prepared Statement of Brandy Tomhave, JD, Interim Executive Director, 
                     Native America Humane Society
Introduction
    As the only organization in the United States dedicated to helping 
families in Indian Country live healthfully and harmoniously with 
domestic animals, the Native America Humane Society (NAHS) appreciates 
this opportunity to submit testimony for the record of the 
congressional hearing about the urgent need to expand the authority of 
the Indian Health Service to include veterinary health care. For too 
long, the federal government has failed to fulfill its trust 
responsibility to provide the basic animal welfare services that are 
integral to protecting human health and safety. Congressional action is 
needed for tribal communities to access veterinary services.
Background
    People and dogs should be able to remain healthy and live safely 
with each other, but that is nearly impossible on most of the 326 
federal Indian reservations where populations of stray and free roaming 
dogs present a public health challenge beyond the imagination of most 
Americans. For example, an estimated 250,000+ dogs roam free on the 
Navajo Nation which has only one veterinarian, yet Navajo is considered 
lucky because most tribes have no veterinarian at all. The inability of 
Indian Health Service to provide veterinary care is why American 
Indians are at greater risk of dog bites and exposure to zoonotic 
diseases than all other Americans.
Dog Bites
    Between 1991 and 1998 Indian Health Service (IHS) studied dog bite 
related injuries on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota. \1\ 
Hospital emergency room logs identified 396 total animal bite cases, of 
which 346 were dog bites. IHS calculated that rate of dog bite injury 
as being 431 per 100,000, which is nearly three times the national 
average of dog bites (129.3 per 100,000 ) that the Centers for Disease 
Control (CDC) reported in 2001.

responsive2017/display_objects/documents/2000_2009/PROV0301.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Relatedly, researchers at CDC conducted a study to examine dog 
bites among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children visiting 
IHS and tribal health facilities between 2001 and 2008. \2\ CDC found 
that the average annual dog bite hospitalization rate among Native 
children in Alaska and the Southwest was about double the rate for 
other children in the United States.

abstract.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The CDC concluded, ``Dog bites represent a significant public 
health threat in AI/AN children in the Alaska, the Southwest, and 
Northern Plains West regions of the U.S. Enhanced animal management and 
education efforts should reduce dog bite injuries and associated 
problems with pets and stray dogs, such as emerging infectious 
diseases.'' \3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, there are no studies of the total number of dog bite 
cases annually treated by facilities within the IHS system but some 
snapshots from a couple of tribes provide clues about the scope of the 
problem:

  <bullet> San Carlos Apache Tribe: The San Carlos Bylas Community 
        Health Center treats on average 50 dog bite injuries per year.

  <bullet> Navajo Nation: According to Navajo Nation Animal Management, 
        there are over 3,000 individuals treated each year at hospitals 
        and clinics for animal attacks and bites.

  <bullet> Northern Arapahoe and Eastern Shoshone Tribes: Over 250 dog 
        bite cases on the Wind River Reservation are seen each year at 
        tribal health care facilities, where just one dose of anti-
        rabies vaccination costs about $2,400. Five doses are required, 
        costing the IHS service area for the Eastern Shoshone and 
        Northern Arapahoe $600,000 annually. \4\

Zoonotic Diseases
    The interconnectedness of humans and animals includes the 
transmission of illnesses called zoonotic diseases. Dogs can carry and 
transmit several viral and bacterial diseases to humans through 
infected saliva and breath, contaminated urine or feces and direct 
contact. Though the risks of such infection are generally low 
(especially among pet dogs) feral dogs are at particular risk of 
becoming vectors for diseases. Feral dogs on Indian reservations pose 
public health risks that IHS must be able to address to save human 
lives.
    Health and Human Services has understood this for at least the past 
two decades. From 2002 to 2004, an eastern Arizona tribal community was 
hit hard by Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), a zoonotic disease 
spread by feral dogs infested by the common brown dog tick. In just two 
years RMSF caused 15 hospitalizations and 2 deaths in that one tribal 
community alone. A decade later, CDC reported that ``More than 300 
cases of RMSF and 20 deaths have occurred on Arizona Indian 
reservations between 2002 and 2014, illustrating the severity of the 
epidemic.'' \5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, rabies is another zoonotic disease for which tribal 
communities are especially at risk, particularly Alaska Native Villages 
where rabies is endemic in certain wildlife that are threats to 
domesticated dogs who have limited, if any, access to veterinary care. 
In Northern and Southwest Alaska, between 2002 and 2011, the dog bite 
rate was 8.5 and 7.0 respectively, compared to 3.1 per 100,000 
nationally. Untreated exposure to the rabies virus is nearly always 
deadly. \6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cost of Congress Doing Nothing
    Dog bite costs within the IHS system are well known and 
significant. In 2001, IHS reported that between 1991 and 1998 there 
were 346 dog bite cases identified on the Rosebud Reservation at a cost 
of about $21,000 each, or $7,266,000 total. \7\ Inflation alone has 
roughly doubled the cost of medical care since then. In 2024 those same 
346 dog bite cases would cost the IHS Rosebud Service Unit about 
$43,000 each or $15 million total. Dog bite treatment diverts limited 
IHS funding from much needed primary care.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dividend of Congress Doing Something
    Native Americans currently comprise only 0.3 percent of 
veterinarians in the United States. This is in part due to Native 
children's lack of exposure to veterinarians. As the kids say, ``You 
have to see it to be it.''
    Dr. Mienna Ludka, DVM, a member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of 
Chippewa Indians and the 2023 graduating class of the Michigan State 
University College of Veterinary Medicine says, ``I think a major 
barrier for Native Americans joining our profession is the lack of 
exposure to the veterinary profession in their communities. Most native 
communities are in under-served rural areas, where poverty and 
geographic isolation make regular veterinary care inaccessible. Due to 
this, the younger generations growing up in our Native communities have 
limited opportunities to interact with veterinarians who could 
potentially serve as a role model for them to one day join the 
profession.'' \8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Veterinary medicine at IHS facilities could forge pathways from 
tribal schools to veterinary schools. Such pathways to other graduate 
schools are already turning out tribal doctors, lawyers, nurses, social 
workers and engineers whose impact on their tribal communities is 
transformative.
Conclusion
    The United States has long embraced its trust responsibility to 
provide for the health and welfare of American Indian tribes and Alaska 
Native Villages but has not yet addressed the dynamic relationship 
between the health and safety and of people and dogs. The incidence of 
dogs spreading fatal zoonotic diseases and mauling to death tribal 
members should prompt Congress and the Executive Branch to recognize 
that this is a public health emergency in Indian Country.

 Prepared Statement of Ledy VanKavage, Sr. Legislative Attorney, Best 
                         Friends Animal Society
    Thank you, Chair Schatz, Vice Chair Murkowski, and Members of the 
Committee, for holding a hearing on an important public health and 
safety measure, S 4365. We appreciate Vice Chair Murkowski sponsoring 
this long over-due legislation.
    Best Friends Animal Society is a national non-profit located in 
Kanab Utah. The Navajo Nation is our neighbor, and we collaborate with 
Navajo leaders and animal control officers on trying to humanely reduce 
the dog population. Most of our Best Friends Navajo Team members live 
on the reservation and have witnessed hundreds of free roaming puppies 
and dogs on the Nation. Although data regarding the number of free 
roaming dogs on Navajo is lacking, the estimates that have been 
reported are anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000 stray dogs.
    Currently the Navajo Nation only has one veterinarian on staff, and 
two full-time private veterinarians practicing on a reservation as 
large as West Virginia. Our Best Friends Navajo Team works closely with 
the Navajo Nation Animal Control officers to transport puppies and dogs 
from animal control to rescue organizations. Best Friends also holds 
and funds multiple spay/neuter events on the Nation, but it is simply a 
drop in the bucket. Federal resources are desperately needed for 
veterinary services to humanely reduce the dog population and decrease 
the public health costs due to dog bites. Dr. Jim Crosby, an expert in 
dog bites has stated that the most dog bite related fatalities occur in 
the Southwest, where the Navajo Nation is located. This is not a 
coincidence.
    According to the AVMA, unneutered male dogs represent 90 percent of 
dogs presented to veterinary behaviorists for dominance aggression, the 
most commonly diagnosed type of aggression. Intact males are also 
involved in 70 to 76 percent of reported dog bite incidents. Unspayed 
females that attract packs of free-roaming male dogs, increase the bite 
risk to people through exposure to many unfamiliar dogs. Mother dogs 
are very protective of their puppies and may bite those who try to 
handle the young.
    Best Friends urges you to support this bill that gives the 
necessary authorization to the Indian Health Service to carryout 
veterinary services. This is a measure that is crucial to public 
safety, and consistent with the One Health initiative. Thank you for 
your consideration for safe and humane communities.

  Prepared Statement of Dr. Michael Watson, Administrator, Animal and 
                    Plant Health Inspection Service
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide writen testimony to 
discuss our rabies management program and S. 4365, the Veterinary 
Services to Improve Public Health in Rural Communities Act.
    Rabies is a serious disease of wildlife in the United States that 
can have a significant impact on human and animal health. If left 
untreated, it has a 100 percent fatality rate in humans and kills 
almost 60,000 people around the world each year. Thankfully, compulsory 
pet vaccination laws and mass vaccination campaigns have eliminated the 
canine variant of rabies from wild and domestic animals in the United 
States. However, there are several other variants in wildlife, 
including raccoon rabies in the east and Arctic fox rabies in Alaska.
    Since 1997, acting through its Wildlife Services program, the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and its National 
Rabies Management Program have led Federal efforts to control the virus 
in wildlife, thereby protecting domestic animals and the public. APHIS 
activities include:

  <bullet> Conducting enhanced rabies surveillance as a complement to 
        public health surveillance to beter understand where the 
        disease is, allowing us to beter focus our control and 
        elimination efforts.

  <bullet> Distribution of oral rabies vaccines to create a zone free 
        of disease and moving these rabies-free zones appropriately.

  <bullet> Conducting research to increase scientific knowledge and to 
        beter inform rabies management strategies.

  <bullet> Coordinating on effective strategies for rabies elimination 
        with all partners, collaborators, and stakeholders in the U.S. 
        and with partner agencies in Canada and Mexico.

    The oral rabies vaccination program is the key to expanding U.S. 
rabies-free zones. Each year, APHIS drops approximately 8 million oral 
rabies vaccination baits in 13 eastern states, from Maine to Alabama, 
creating a rabies-free zone that prevents the spread of raccoon rabies 
further westward.
    In urban and suburban areas, APHIS and cooperators distribute 
vaccine bait by helicopter or vehicles. In rural areas, APHIS typically 
distributes vaccine bait from a plane. When a raccoon bites into the 
vaccine bait, the packet ruptures, allowing the vaccine to coat the 
animal's mouth and throat. Animals that receive an adequate dose of the 
vaccine develop antibodies against rabies. As the number of vaccinated 
animals in a population increases, disease transmission decreases, 
creating an ``immunity barrier'' to stop the further spread of rabies.
    Although raccoon vaccination is our largest rabies prevention 
effort, APHIS helped the Texas Department of State Health Services 
successfully eliminate canine rabies in coyotes in 2004. Our efforts 
using oral rabies vaccination also reduced the spread and eventually 
eliminated a unique variant of the disease in gray foxes. In Arizona, 
APHIS works on a variety of collaborative rabies research and 
management projects focused on gray foxes, skunks, and bats, as well as 
free-ranging dogs on tribal lands.
    Alaska has a unique variant of rabies in Artic foxes. It has a 
broad circumpolar distribution throughout North America, Europe, and 
Asia. In Alaska, rabies outbreaks routinely occur during winter and the 
number of red foxes with this variant has increased over the past 
decade. This observation, along with modeling, suggests regional 
warming trends may be associated with increased contact rates and 
transmission between Arctic and red foxes. We currently do not have a 
rabies vaccination program targeting Arctic foxes due in part to the 
remote geographic area this variant encompasses. There are also 
challenges with Arctic fox behavior, including their large home ranges, 
distance they travel, and varying behavior in summer and winter.
    But the bill before us today understands these challenges and would 
accordingly direct APHIS to conduct a more in-depth study of the 
viability of a wildlife rabies control program in Arctic regions. This 
would allow us to work with our state, tribal, and other partners to 
identify the potential barriers for a successful program and possible 
mitigations for those impediments.
    Ontario, Canada, successfully eliminated Arctic fox rabies in red 
foxes in southern Ontario, but the situation in Alaska will be 
different. Beter understanding the unique challenges of Alaska, the 
different species involved and their ecology, will be important. In 
Alaska, we would most likely need to use selective intervention with 
oral rabies vaccine in and around remote communities. This will not 
eliminate arctic fox rabies in red foxes or Arctic foxes, but instead 
would likely be part of an integrated rabies prevention and control 
strategy carried out in cooperation with the Indian Health Service and 
other partners.
    A few thoughts and concerns for consideration:

  <bullet> The study focuses on potential management strategies to 
        reduce the risk of transmission to Tribal members in Arctic 
        regions, which would only include the northernmost parts of the 
        state, and probably excluding fox populations in other areas of 
        the state.

  <bullet> The study targets fox species, but we know that the disease 
        is also transmited through domestic animals, such as unowned or 
        difficult to capture dogs. We have had success with orally 
        vaccinating dogs in other areas including free ranging dogs. 
        Implementation of similar strategies could strengthen rabies 
        prevention and control efforts in remote communities.

  <bullet> While we appreciate the study, it is very likely to identify 
        the need for a valuable program to protect the health and 
        safety of native Alaskans. However, without resources for a 
        program, it is highly unlikely that APHIS will be able to 
        implement a program that stands any chance of success. Further, 
        diverting resources from other regions could potentially erase 
        years of success with virus control and local elimination 
        elsewhere.

  <bullet> Under the sections authorizing the use of public health 
        officers, it may be helpful to include mention of USDA or APHIS 
        such that future control activities could be coordinated or 
        conducted with assistance from our Wildlife Services program.

    Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss this important 
program.

                      RE: ANTHC Support of Senate Bill 4365
To Whom It May Concern:
    On behalf of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC), I 
write this letter in support of Senate Bill 4365, the Veterinary 
Services to Improve Public Health in Rural Communities Act.
    ANTHC is a statewide tribal health organization serving all 229 
tribes and all Alaska Native and American Indian (AN/AI) people in 
Alaska. ANTHC provides a wide range of statewide public health, 
community health, environmental health, and other programs and services 
for Alaska Native people and their communities. ANTHC and Southcentral 
Foundation operate programs at the Alaska Native Medical Center, the 
statewide tertiary care hospital for all AN/AI people in Alaska, under 
the terms of Public Law 105-83.
    Alaska Native communities do not have regular access to veterinary 
care. This has led to a consistent threat to both human and animal 
health and welfare. This lack of access was recognized by the Alaska 
Federation of Natives in 2022 as an ``unmet public health crisis''. The 
downstream impacts of this disparity is clearly exemplified by the fact 
that Alaska Native children have the highest rate of hospitalization 
for dog bites in the Indian Health Service system and are hospitalized 
for dog bites at double the rate of children in the general US 
population.
    Dogs are a known risk for zoonotic illness transmission amongst 
livestock, wildlife and humans. Zoonotic illness is any disease that 
can spread between animals and humans. Rabies transmission between fox, 
dogs and humans is a constant concern in the entire western and 
northern regions of Alaska. As part of their compact with Alaska Native 
Tribes, the Indian Health Service supports Environmental Health 
programs at regional Tribal Health Organizations across our state. A 
significant portion of the workload for these programs concerns rabies 
prevention activities. This includes vaccinating companion animals 
against rabies, conducting dog bite investigations and coordinating 
with local and state officials in response to public health emergencies 
resulting from rabies transmission between wild fox and local dog 
populations. As red fox expands their range northward, the frequency of 
these situations have increased and ``near miss'' public health 
emergencies have become commonplace. These events often require 
expensive and painful post exposure prophylaxis treatment for humans 
and large scale culling of companion animals. Rabies is always fatal to 
humans and this is not a theoretical risk. In 2023, 29.9 percent of the 
67 foxes tested for rabies in the Norton Sound region were positive.
    While Tribal Health Rabies Prevention Programs reduce some of the 
risk associated with rabies transmission in rural Alaskan communities, 
they cannot begin to address the root cause of the issue. Without 
access to basic spay and neuter services, there is no humane or 
effective way to control animal populations in rural Alaska. Because of 
this, vaccination alone is not a sufficient method of rabies 
prevention. Veterinary care became common in the lower 48 states as 
healthcare practitioners began to understand that the health of 
companion animal populations has a direct impact on the health of a 
human population. The same is true in Alaska.
    Senate Bill 4365 acknowledges this disparity in service and the 
connection between human and animal health that is so well understood 
by the communities that the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium 
serves. Alaskan Native people share a profoundly deep and 
interdependent relationship with dogs. The inability to access basic 
veterinary care has implications beyond the physical, impacting the 
emotional and spiritual health of Alaska Native people. The Tribal 
Health System in Alaska has developed novel, effective and sustainable 
solutions in order to address shortfalls in access to medical, dental 
and behavioral healthcare in the past and with the ratification of 
Senate Bill 4365, can similarly work towards remedying another unmet 
public health need. This bill is an important step in achieving the 
intent of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.

                      RE: ANTHC Support of Senate Bill 4365
To Whom It May Concern:
    Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation (BBAHC) is a tribal health 
organization representing 28 villages in Southwest Alaska. For fifty 
years, we have provided comprehensive healthcare services to the people 
of Bristol Bay.
    As a healthcare organization that encompasses a One Health 
framework, having the backing of the IHS as a co-coordinating agency in 
the National One Health Framework would help to further our mission to 
provide quality healthcare with competence, compassion and sensitivity 
to our region. At the core of our values, the promotion of health and 
prevention of disease cannot be fully carried out without the addition 
of veterinary care as part of the IHS healthcare model.
    Rabies is the most pressing and prevalent zoonotic disease we are 
faced with in the region, and it creates a constant public health 
threat to our population. It is enzootic among the fox population in 
western and northern Alaska. There is an occasional threat to humans 
directly through the wildlife population, but the biggest threat comes 
from dogs that have been bitten by an infected fox.
    Due to the current and historic lack of veterinary care, including 
access to spay and neuter surgery, there is a large number of unwanted 
and stray dogs. These are significant contributing factors to the 
health disparities seen in Alaska Native children, who face the highest 
rate of hospitalizations due to dog bites in the country.
    Our Environmental Health department spends a significant portion of 
time each year carrying out public health rabies prevention activities 
through vaccination of pets and rabies investigation and response. In 
2021, over a span of 5 months, our staff sent 8 animals to the State of 
Alaska virology lab, where 6 of those tested positive for rabies, 
including one unvaccinated, domestic dog involved in a bite incident.
    Our prevention program helps to reduce the risk of rabies 
transmission, but it is unable to treat the root cause of the problem, 
which is a lack of basic veterinary care services in the region. The 
only humane way to control the population of dogs and significantly 
reduce the risk of rabies transmission is through stable and consistent 
veterinary care.
    When post exposure prophylaxis is warranted after a bite, it is 
costly to the mental health and wellbeing of the patient and family 
involved, and the cost oftime, travel and treatment can add up to 1Os 
of thousands of dollars per incident.
    Since time immemorial, Alaska Native People have shared an 
unspeakable bond with dogs. Veterinary care is not just animal health 
care, it also serves our human population's physical, mental, emotional 
and spiritual health.
    BBAHC recognizes that veterinary care is public health care. The 
provisions of SB 4365 will help to bring critical healthcare services 
that are virtually non-existent to rural Alaska. Thereby improving 
basic public health services while also improving health equity and 
decreasing disparities among Alaska's Indigenous population.

Dear Senator Murkowski and Indian Affairs Committee,
    Thank you for your willingness to out forth the S. 4365, the 
Veterinary Services to Improves Public Health in Rural Communities Act. 
I am a veterinarian from North Carolina who fell in love with the 
Native people of Alaska, Navajo, and Cherokee and lead trips with 
veterinary students each year (twice a year to the Yup'ik villages in 
Alaska) to help serve the veterinary needs in the villages. The task we 
face is daunting. While there are many small groups of veterinary teams 
that go into the villages and vaccinate dogs for rabies and provide 
services for spaying/neutering, after 15 years, we have only put a dent 
in the population. It isn't that the people don't want to have their 
dogs cared for medically, they just do not have access to it. And 
funding the trips into the villages can be very expensive. But, each 
group does what they can to help serve these communities.
    The result is that many Village Police Officers (VPO) have to shoot 
any dogs that are not tied up to prevent bites within the villages. 
Rabies is endemic in the area, carried mostly by the fox, which is then 
spread quickly to the dogs, and thus the humans. Unfortunately, it is 
usually the children that are bit. With little access to healthcare, 
rabies causes deaths to the humans. The numbers of rabies cases in the 
Alaskan Native villages is astounding. The VPO's do not like to shoot 
the dogs, and many suffer mental illnesses from having to kill them. 
Others leave their posts after a season because they do not want to be 
a part of it. The children tell stories of their dogs being shot while 
walking with them to school. Mentally and emotionally this is not a 
sustainable solution.
    My hope is that S. 4365 will pass and allow the Indian Health 
Services to be able to provide this much needed service to the 
communities more readily. The cost of the preventative care for the 
dogs is significantly less than the treatments for the humans affected 
by the dog bites and the metal rehabilitation of those in positions 
requiring them to kill the stray dogs. Thank you for your time and for 
helping find a cure to this terrible predicament.

        Sincerely,

Dear Senator Murkowski and Indian Affairs Committee,
    Thank you so much for introducing S. 4365. My name is Angie Fitch, 
I am the executive director and founder of Alaska Native Rural 
Veterinary, Inc. (ANRV)
    Since our inception in 2011, ANRV has provided veterinary care to 
over 90 villages, across several regions of rural Alaska. I am in favor 
of this bill because it will work as a preventative measure, which has 
its advantages over the consequence of not having it. It will be much 
safer and more cost effective than the way things are now.
    During our travels, I have learned that there are many layers to 
the lack of veterinary care in rural tribal communities. Loose dogs 
pack up and become aggressive, they bite, defecate in parks where 
children play, carry parasites and spread diseases such as distemper 
and rabies. Dogs are the known carrier of rabies from wildlife to 
humans. They are also the transmitter of deadly tick disease to people, 
which is now a growing concern in Alaska.
    There is also a mental health correlation to the lack of veterinary 
care. Witnessing suffering and death of pets or the shooting of 
dangerous or rabid dogs, is mentally traumatizing to the entire 
community, especially the children. And oftentimes the shooter, I am 
told will have nightmares long after the incident takes place. One 
village police officer told me that it wounds his soul to have to put 
dogs down. People deserve better than this, and hopefully this bill is 
just that.
    Over the years of providing care in rural Alaska, ANRV has noticed 
a direct correlation between controlling the numbers of stray dogs with 
sterilizations and a reduction in dog bites to people. The communities 
that we provide consistent veterinary care have visibly fewer to no 
strays and less people are being bitten or injured by dogs.
    The safest and most reasonable solution to this public health 
disparity is accessible veterinary care, vaccinations and spay/neuter 
service.
    Prevention makes the most sense. It provides safer communities, 
prevents costly medical care to people who are attacked or contract a 
transmissional disease. It also greatly reduces the chance of 
individuals having to go through rabies prophylaxis treatment due to 
dog bites.
    Thank you again, Sen Murkowski for introducing this bill that will 
address this important issue, improve public health and the quality of 
life for so many tribal communities.

   Re: Support of the Pueblo of Nambe, Pueblo of Pojoaque, 
  Pueblo de San Ildefonso and Pueblo of Tesuque for S. 3406

Dear Senator Schatz and members of the Senate Committee on Indian 
Affairs:

    The Pueblo of Nambe, the Pueblo of Pojoaque, the Pueblo de San 
Ildefonso, and the Pueblo of Tesuque (collectively ``Pueblos''), as the 
four members of the Northern Pueblos Tributary Water Rights 
Association, write this letter in support of the bill sponsored and 
introduced by Senator Lujan of the New Mexico delegation, S. 3406, to 
restore interest on the Aamodt Settlement Pueblos' Fund established by 
section 617(c)(l)(B) of the Aamodt Settlement Act, Pub. L. No. 111-291. 
The Pueblos herein state their support for the bill.
    Section 617(c)(l )(B) of the Aamodt Settlement Pueblos' Fund 
authorized the appropriation of $37.5 million ``to assist the Pueblos 
in paying the Pueblos' share of the cost of operating, maintaining, and 
replacing the Pueblo Water Facilities and Regional Water System.'' The 
Aamodt Settlement Act appropriated an additional $15 million for the 
Pueblos, for a total of fund amount of $52.5 million. The authorized 
funds are for the Pueblos only, for operation and maintenance expenses 
related to the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System, the critical 
infrastructure necessary to effectuate the Aamodt settlement. Unlike 
other Indian water rights settlements, the Aamodt Settlement Act did 
not provide that the funds authorized in section 617 could be invested 
between the authorization date and the settlement enforcement date, 
which was September 15, 2017. As a result, the Pueblos' funds sat for a 
period of 81 months, uninvested, without earning any interest.
    S. 3406 will restore interest for that 81-month period so that the 
Pueblos' settlement will be treated equally to other Indian water 
rights settlements whose funds Congress allowed to be invested. The 
Pueblos will, as a result of the bill, receive approximately $4.3 
million which will be added to the operation, maintenance and 
replacement fund shared by the Pueblos. The restored funds will bring 
the Pueblos into parity with other Indian tribes who have settled their 
water rights and invested the funds appropriated to them by Congress. 
Given the expectation of increasing costs to the Pueblos relating to 
operation, maintenance and replacement of the Regional Water System, 
the addition of $4.3 million in forgone earned interest will be 
critically important.
    The Pueblos wish to express their appreciation for the Committee's 
actions to ensure that the Pueblos are treated on equal footing with 
other Indian tribes in this country. We thank you for undertaking this 
important rectification of the Aamodt Settlement Act.

        Sincerely,

    Thank you for the opportunity to comment on S. 4365, the Veterinary 
Services to Improve Public Health in Rural Communities Act. This bill 
will not only enhance public health in rural tribal communities across 
the United States, but it will also save Indian Health Service a 
tremendous amount of money. Just here in Alaska, we estimate that the 
preventative veterinary services supported by this bill will be far 
less expensive than post exposure prophylaxis treatments for rabies 
alone. Many of our rural communities experience seven times the 
national average for reported dog bites to humans. Dogs are the known 
common transmitter of rabies from wildlife to people.
    There are also a large mental and behavioral health implication 
associated with dog culling and fear of outdoor activities, as a result 
of dog overpopulation. At the present time, rural communities suffer 
these public health challenges, and their only recourse is to 
periodically shoot loose and dangerous dogs. This does not solve the 
problem as the remaining dogs quickly reproduce and replace those 
killed. This activity is also traumatizing to those who witness the 
culling, especially children. Many village public safety and police 
officers have reported that dog culling was the main reason for leaving 
their job; several have required therapy to manage the effect of dog 
culling on their mental health.
    S. 4365 will support preventive veterinary public health care which 
will address the problem at the root cause, through access to canine 
sterilization and vaccination procedures. This is the safest and most 
effective way to manage these issues. It is also less expensive than 
what IHS currently spends on hospitalizations for dog bite injuries, 
rabies post exposure prophylaxis treatment and the mental and 
behavioral impacts of living with dog overpopulation.
    Dogs have always been a central part of Indigenous culture in North 
America. When an aspect of life that has, for millennia, been 
beneficial becomes a threat it has terrible impacts on cultural, 
mental, and behavioral health. This bill will provide a solution that 
will return the relationship between people and dogs in rural 
communities back to a mutually beneficial situation and save the health 
care providing organizations associated with IHS millions of dollars by 
improving public health and quality of life for the residents.

To Whom It May Concern:

    I have been a clinical psychologist in Alaska for more than 40 
years and I've been the director of four rural mental health centers. 
I've consulted on psychological issues throughout the state and have 
frequently testified about trauma and related psychological issues.
    I am well aware that there has been a long-standing issue of stray 
dogs in the villages, including problems with frequent dog bites and 
rabies. I also am aware that someone has to take responsibility for 
euthanizing these stray dogs when it becomes necessary to protect the 
public. In my experience this is almost always psychologically 
difficult and generates substantial trauma and grief for those who have 
to perform the euthanization, as well as for those who witness it.
    There is already far too much grief in the villages, and the 
accumulation of grief is one of the factors behind the high rate of 
suicides in the villages.
    I particularly remember working with a client whose job was to 
euthanize the animals and at the local animal shelter; she had 
repetitive nightmares about her tongue being cut off and not being able 
to speak. We came to realize that these nightmares had to do with 
inability to speak about her feelings and grief about euthanizing the 
animals. When she finally was able to verbalize this, she understood 
that she had absolutely had to quit her job, that it was costing her 
too much even though she needed the work.
    It makes much more sense to have a program that neuters and spays 
dogs to control these dangerous overpopulations, than to continue with 
the current lack of support for such an important program related to 
public health and quality of life.

        Please contact me if further information is needed.

Dear Senate Indian Affairs Committee member,

    I'm writing to you to voice my opinion concerning the bill H.R. 
6443, S. 3857 that incorporates 172 acres in San Diego's East County 
region into the Jamul Indian Village trust. As a resident of Jamul I 
will be directly impacted by what Senator, Darryl Issa is calling 
``economic development.'' It will bring increased traffic to an already 
impacted fire zone area that only has access for evacuation on one 
road. This is unacceptable and threatens the entire community of Jamul. 
The Jamul Indian Village has already increased traffic exponentially by 
building a casino and now a 16 story hotel on this same and only 
thoroughfare. There have been increased traffic collisions on Highway 
94E since the Jamul tribe received the initial 6 acre parcel into 
trust. Please consider this, I encourage you to vote NO on H.R. 6643, 
S. 3857 and keep Jamul rural.
        Sincerely,
                                             Tricia Stewart
                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to 
                        Hon. Melanie Anne Egorin
    Question 1. Your written testimony states that the Indian Health 
Service (IHS) does not have the legal authority to offer veterinary 
services directly, or to allow tribes to add these services to their 
Indian Self Determination Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA) self-
determination compacts or contracts. However, if IHS were able to offer 
these services, does IHS have an estimate of the cost?
    Answer. At this time, IHS does not have an estimate of the cost for 
providing veterinary services if IHS were authorized to offer such 
services. Currently, there is not enough information to inform the IHS 
as to whether each of the twelve IHS Areas need such veterinary 
services, or any number less than the twelve IHS Areas. However, the 
IHS is willing to work with the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs' 
staff, and the bill sponsor's staff to provide an estimate based on the 
bill's intent. For example, is the intent to have veterinarian and 
program staff for each of the twelve IHS Areas, or to have only 
veterinarians and program staff in only those IHS Areas with a defined 
and demonstrated need for veterinarian services as described in the 
drafter's legislation, or to have only veterinarians and programs in 
only those IHS Areas that have Tribes and Villages located in rural 
areas? Again, IHS is willing to work with the Committee and staff on a 
cost estimate based on the drafter's intent in the legislation.

    Question 2. If Tribes with 638 contracts could add veterinary 
services to their ISDEAA agreements, how many Tribes would be 
interested in taking these services over?
    Answer. The Indian Health Service was only recently made aware by 
drafters of the legislation that several Tribes and Villages in the 
Alaska Area expressed interest in adding, by contracting or compacting, 
veterinary services to existing ISDEAA agreements. The IHS would need 
to further research whether tribal consultation would be helpful in 
evaluating the veterinary services need in all twelve IHS Areas.

    Question 3. Your written testimony states that IHS, the Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Commissioned Corps of the 
United States Public Health Service (USPHS) collaborate with Tribes and 
other partners to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. 
Does IHS currently work with the USPHS, or any other partners, to offer 
any veterinary services, such as rabies clinics?
    Answer. Currently, the IHS does not offer any veterinary services, 
nor rabies clinics, in any of our IHS Areas. However, IHS routinely 
collaborates with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
tribes, and other entities to reduce transmission of zoonotic diseases. 
One example of this collaboration is that the IHS provides reports to 
animal control, such as tribal and other government agencies, federal, 
state, and county, about high-risk animal encounters such as dog-bites, 
and where indicated, public health entities (tribal and other 
government agencies, federal, state, county) regarding suspected or 
confirmed cases of reportable zoonotic diseases. Such reports inform 
decisions by those authorities to support prevention activities like 
rabies vaccination efforts.
    IHS utilizes the One Health approach to fulfill its 
responsibilities for investigating outbreaks of zoonotic diseases and 
coordinating with other federal and state agencies, partners, and 
stakeholders across the public health, agriculture, wildlife, and 
environmental sectors at the national and subnational levels.
    IHS prioritizes zoonosis efforts through surveillance for vector-
borne diseases, such as plague, hantavirus, tularemia, tick-borne 
relapsing fever, WNV, Lyme Disease, and other zoonoses, including 
rabies. Surveillance tools--such as sentinel chicken flocks and 
mosquito trapping--are maintained with state, county, and tribal 
partners. The HHS IHS Division of Environmental Health Services 
conducts indicator-based surveillance using the IHS Notifiable Disease 
and External Cause of Injury system.
    IHS has developed strong partnerships with U.S. Department of 
Agriculture veterinarians, the U.S. Army, Tribal Indian Health Boards, 
and NGOs, and collaborates on interventions, including fogging 
operations, flights to identify standing water, dusting, lay rabies 
vaccinator programs, and partnerships to reduce the free-roaming pet 
population. For example, the Billings Area Indian Health Board 
implemented a lay vaccinator program, influenza-like illness 
surveillance, and Hantavirus outreach and education. On the Navajo 
Nation, multiple NGOs are partnering with tribal and federal programs 
and colleges and universities to provide a comprehensive approach to 
address the stray animal population, including raising awareness and 
knowledge about the risks associated with pet overpopulation and 
reduced cost or free veterinary services which may reduce risk for 
zoonotic disease and bite injuries.
    Lastly, upon request from IHS, the USPHS is available to assist IHS 
with veterinarian services. There is one USPHS veterinarian officer 
currently assigned to IHS working in an administrative role at IHS 
headquarters. In addition, there are over 1,200 USPHS officers working 
across Federal IHS facilities and Tribal facilities, across multiple 
disciplines.
