    Mr. Duncan. All right. The Subcommittee on Energy, Climate, 
and Grid Security will now come to order. We are going to 
address today the ``American Nuclear Energy Expansion: Powering 
a Clean and Secure Future.''
    The Chair will now recognize himself for 5 minutes for an 
opening statement.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF DUNCAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
           CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    Mr. Duncan. I want to thank all of you for being here. I 
called this hearing to set the table for what I hope will be 
bipartisan, durable policymaking this Congress to expand 
American nuclear energy and its many benefits for the Nation.
    I think we are off to a good start. Just last week, Chair 
Rodgers, Ranking Member Pallone, Subcommittee Ranking Member 
DeGette, and I wrote a number of key nuclear associations and 
stakeholders to assist our efforts.
    We asked for comments and recommendations for what may be 
needed to update nuclear licensing and regulatory activities to 
provide for a robust and growing industry.
    The stakeholder information we seek will inform our work to 
deploy more nuclear energy.
    Just yesterday, several of my colleagues on this committee 
and I returned from a trip to Europe. We met with several 
groups excited about the promise of deploying more nuclear, 
especially advanced reactors like SMRs. And I believe the 
chairwoman will probably talk a little bit more about that.
    While many European countries are expanding nuclear power, 
Germany is actively shutting it down--just on Sunday stopping 
and closing three nuclear reactors. We cannot let this be the 
reality in the United States. Nuclear energy must be a part of 
our energy matrix.
    To expand the industry, it is vital we encourage regulatory 
certainty and make sure our reactor licensing processes enable 
the safe and broad deployment of nuclear technologies. This is 
especially important for advanced reactor technologies.
    The Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission play important roles to advance a new era of nuclear 
innovation.
    DOE and its national labs provide critical support to 
developing, demonstrating, and promoting advanced nuclear. The 
NRC, of course, is important to assuring the public of adequate 
protection of health and safety of our nuclear operations.
    I am from South Carolina. My State is a leader in nuclear 
energy. Nuclear power is responsible for 54 to 58 percent of 
electricity in the State and over 90 percent of our carbon-free 
electricity.
    We also are home to the Savannah River Site, a DOE Nuclear 
Security Enterprise site, which supports our Nation's nuclear 
weapons and environmental management missions
    South Carolina also witnessed the failure of V.C. Summer. 
This project has created perceived risks of uncontrolled cost 
overrun and project abandonment, which has limited commitment 
to new reactor development in this country.
    We cannot let this concern inhibit nuclear deployment. 
Nuclear energy is by far our Nation's leading source of carbon-
free electricity. It is also among the most reliable sources of 
power, with a capacity factor surpassing 90 percent, more than 
any other generating source.
    Being a leader in nuclear technology provides the United 
States significant geopolitical advantage and leverage. A 
robust nuclear energy export market gives America credibility 
to set global nuclear norms, the guidelines that ensure safe 
nuclear energy generation and exports.
    Despite this, growth in the U.S. nuclear industry has 
stagnated over the past decade. China and Russia are seizing 
this opportunity and doubling down on their nuclear 
investments.
    We cannot cede our global leadership to adversaries. We 
must prioritize modernizing our regulatory structure in the 
United States and do what is needed to encourage growth 
throughout the industry.
    We also look at what is standing in the way of 
demonstrating and deploying advanced reactors. Our engineers 
are developing new reactor designs that promise less expensive, 
more efficient, widely deployable, and walkway safe technology.
    We must modernize our licensing structure and establish an 
advanced fuel supply to bring these technologies online. The 
U.S. nuclear fleet is operating at the highest levels of 
performance and safety in history. If you visit a nuclear 
plant, you will see the commitment to safety in their 
procedures.
    Let's talk about that experience today and how it should 
inform our policies.
    Our witnesses today provide testimony from different 
perches in the stakeholder community, from a leading DOE 
National Laboratory to utilities and industry, to policy think 
tanks. They can help guide us through some of the promises and 
challenges to expanding nuclear energy here in the United 
States.

    Mr. Duncan. I want to thank all of you for being here, and 
I want to yield the remainder of my time to Mr. Fulcher from 
Idaho to introduce one of our panelists.
    Mr. Fulcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    It's an honor for me to introduce Dr. Jess Gehin today, 
associate laboratory director at the Idaho National Lab, the 
Nation's nuclear laboratory in Idaho, the Gem State.
    Dr. Gehin is responsible for research, development, and 
demonstration of advanced reactors at INL through such programs 
as the National Reactor Innovation Center.
    He has 30 years of experience in our National Laboratory 
system with a career focused on nuclear energy. Dr. Gehin has 
served as the National Technical Director for the Department of 
Energy's Microreactor Program. Currently, he is working on INL 
small modular reactors that range from 220 to 300 megawatts of 
power.
    Dr. Gehin has advanced degrees in nuclear energy, including 
a doctorate degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
He was an associate professor at University of Tennessee, is a 
fellow of the American Nuclear Society.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I welcome Dr. Gehin and thank 
you. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. Well, I thank the gentleman for his 
introduction. I am excited about today's hearing. We are going 
to delve into it. Jump into it with all fours, and with that I 
will recognize the Ranking Member DeGette for 5 minutes.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DeGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO

    Ms. DeGette. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.
    As we look to transition our Nation to zero-carbon-emitting 
forms of energy to stave off the worst effects of the climate 
crisis, it is important to know the role that nuclear energy 
can play in that fight.
    Nuclear energy is responsible for generating nearly 20 
percent of all of our Nation's electricity. And it is now 
responsible for almost half of the carbon-free electricity that 
we create here in the United States.
    So we know that to combat the climate crisis, we must 
reduce our emissions. And the only way to do that is to reduce 
our reliance on fossil fuels while electrifying every part of 
our lives.
    If done with rigorous, science-based regulations, nuclear 
energy can help us manage that load. It has the ability to help 
us move towards a zero-carbon energy future without sacrificing 
Americans' access to the electricity that they need.
    Because here is the thing: If we are going to reach our 
climate goals, we are going to need a diverse mix of energy 
sources, and nuclear can be one of those sources. However, that 
is not to say that nuclear energy is the single, perfect 
solution to our country's energy needs.
    In fact, if nuclear energy is to play a role in our energy 
transition, we must address two things. First, the United 
States must develop a comprehensive, science-based strategy to 
dispose of spent fuel--a strategy that does not cause harm to 
public health or our environment.
    If we do not have a long-term, permanent solution for 
disposing of nuclear waste, then we will struggle to be able to 
use this source of carbon-free electricity. We must also figure 
out how to handle the aging of our nuclear plants.
    Since I have been in Congress, we have only had one new 
nuclear power plant come online. And during that same time, we 
have shut down and decommissioned many reactors across the 
country, including the one reactor we had in my State of 
Colorado.
    Because of advancements in technology that have been made 
over the years, the U.S. nuclear industry has been able to 
maintain its noncarbon-emitting electricity generation 
capability for more than three decades now.
    But with several more nuclear plants scheduled to close in 
the coming years, and as the impacts of the climate crisis 
become more apparent, we have to find ways to avoid any 
reductions in the noncarbon-emitting portfolio of our energy 
sector.
    As the chairman said, he, and I, and the chairs of the full 
committee sent a series of letters yesterday to key 
stakeholders in the nuclear industry asking for their input and 
recommendations on how we can improve the licensing process 
without sacrificing the health and safety of our constituents.
    So as we continue to invest in and expand our use of 
nuclear energy in this country, it must be done in a way that 
continues to protect the health and the safety of the American 
people.
    I am sure all of the witnesses here today will agree with 
that foundational statement. We need rigorous, science-based 
regulations, and we need strict oversight. So I look forward to 
hearing from the witnesses today about potential improvements 
to the application and licensing process.
    I also believe, however, it's important that we hear from 
the body overseeing this work, the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. And so, Mr. Chairman, I would ask that as a follow-
up to this hearing, we should have another hearing with 
Commissioners from the NRC to discuss, from their point of 
view, where we can make improvements without sacrificing public 
health and safety.
    Thank you for having this hearing. I think this is a great 
bipartisan step towards our energy policy, and I yield back.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. DeGette follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. And we plan on having that hearing with NRC 
coming up this summer.
    It is now my honor to recognize the Chair of the full 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, for 5 
minutes for an opening statement.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    American leadership in nuclear energy and nuclear 
technology is critical to our economic security and our 
national security.
    It must be part of a strong energy mix. It is how we win 
the future with clean, reliable, and affordable energy to power 
our way of life, keep the lights on, build stronger 
communities, and keep our economies going.
    Many of us just returned from Europe where we heard a lot 
about the scary realities of shutting down nuclear energy. 
Putin is weaponizing Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas. 
As he shuts down gas pipelines, countries have been forced to 
scramble to secure their energy supplies, keep their economies 
running and energy affordable.
    Germany, which just completed its phaseout of its nuclear 
power plants this weekend, is especially in crisis. Since Putin 
began cutting supplies, electricity prices have skyrocketed. 
The government has asked citizens to ration energy, and, as 
reported by NPR, Germany is even stocking up on candles to 
prepare for blackouts.
    Without reliable sources of energy, like nuclear, Germany's 
security is weakened and is returning to the Dark Ages. Just 
yesterday--yesterday morning when we were in Warsaw, we 
participated in a signing ceremony for an agreement between the 
United States and Poland in conjunction with GE-Hitachi's small 
modular reactor deployment.
    It was inspiring to see all the excitement in Poland for 
this nuclear deal and another one for the three large nuclear 
reactors and potentially three more.
    Poland's leaders, like so many of us in Congress, 
understand and appreciate the reliable and secure energy that 
comes from nuclear. They are looking at other American nuclear 
technologies like NuScale's VOYGR reactors. Not only is this an 
indication of a strong U.S.-Poland relationship, it shows that 
nuclear energy must be a key part of our future.
    America, not Russia or China, must lead to restore and 
expand our leadership in nuclear energy. And we do it by 
unleashing our unmatched genius for innovation by assuring a 
predictable regulatory landscape to help attract investment and 
support decisions to expand nuclear deployment and by 
encouraging new technologies that will provide exciting new 
nuclear applications, such as providing power and heat for 
industrial uses.
    Our central question today is, What does it take to ensure 
a healthy exiting nuclear fleet and deploy the promising new 
innovations? What does it take to be sure that we have the 
nuclear infrastructure and fuels for our fleet and advanced new 
reactors? And what does it take to assure America can lead the 
world and our allies and partners on nuclear and nuclear 
innovation?
    Sixtnine years ago, Congress enacted the essential policies 
that can guide safe nuclear development in the United States 
and export abroad. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 encouraged the 
widespread use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, 
consistent with ensuring our common defense and public health 
and safety.
    With that policy, we led the world for several decades in 
developing civilian nuclear technologies and set the standard 
for safety. We must continue to build on this leadership to 
bolster our long-term nuclear competitive edge and strategic 
interests.
    If we don't lead, China and Russia will. China and Russia 
combined have already announced plans to construct an estimated 
66 reactors in multiple nations. They are working more closely 
on nuclear technologies, which raises more serious security 
concerns.
    America has also witnessed a weakening of our nuclear fuel 
infrastructure, building an unhealthy reliance on Russian-
sourced nuclear fuels, a security problem intensified by the 
Ukraine invasion.
    What does it take to increase our own secure supplies? What 
does it take to enjoy the economic benefits of a domestic 
nuclear infrastructure?
    Despite Germany's poor decisions, other European nations, 
like as I mentioned in Poland, are looking at American 
technologies.
    Closer to home, I have been following the work of Energy 
Northwest with innovative companies like X-energy. This work 
holds great promise for eastern Washington, one of the early 
leaders in deploying nuclear technology, to once again lead in 
advanced nuclear generation.
    This is encouraging for a brighter and stronger future. 
This hearing is a solid first step for the committee, in a 
strong bipartisan way, to update the Nation's regulatory 
policies that are necessary to restore American nuclear energy 
and to advance clean and secure energy here and around the 
world.
    I look forward to the suggestions from all our witnesses 
today, your suggestions, and I also want to just say I 
appreciate the bipartisan approach to this hearing and working 
with Ranking Member DeGette of the subcommittee and the full 
committee, Frank Pallone.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    [The prepared statement of Mrs. Rodgers follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    I now recognize the full committee ranking member, Mr. 
Pallone, for 5 minutes for opening.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE 
            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Chairman Duncan, for holding 
today's hearing, and I hope that today is a sign that we can 
work in a bipartisan matter on energy issues.
    Last Congress, this subcommittee spent a lot of time 
studying the power sector and our Nation's electricity grid and 
how they impact the worsening climate crisis.
    And while the power sector has made significant progress in 
reducing carbon emissions over the last two decades, thanks in 
large part to the growth of renewable energy, it still 
accounted for 28 percent of total carbon pollution in the 
United States in 2022.
    So decarbonizing the power plants that keep the lights on 
in our homes and businesses is crucial to addressing the 
climate crisis.
    Now, nuclear power plays an important role in producing 
carbon-free power for the electric grid. Last year, nuclear 
power accounted for nearly half of all carbon-free power 
generated in the United States.
    In my home State of New Jersey, it supplies nearly 90 
percent of the State's carbon-free power. Committee Democrats 
have long been committed to decarbonizing the power sector to 
combat the climate crisis and to lead the world in a clean 
energy transition.
    In order to achieve 100 percent decarbonization in the 
power sector while keeping prices low for consumers, we need 
reliable carbon-free resources that can sustain output for long 
periods of time, and nuclear power can meet this test.
    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has done an admirable job 
over the years ensuring nuclear power is safe and secure. The 
nuclear industry often touts its safety successes over the past 
decades, but that success is partly due to the efforts of 
Federal regulators to stay on top of inspections and safety 
protocols of plants around the country.
    Last week, I joined Chairs Rodgers and Duncan and Ranking 
Member DeGette in a request for information asking nuclear 
power stakeholders for comments and recommendations on the 
NRC's licensing and regulatory process.
    It is important the committee hear from all interested 
stakeholders about any possible regulatory improvements that 
could make the process more efficient or to improve safety and 
security.
    Now, as we explore any possible changes, first and 
foremost, it is critical that they do not undermine the safety 
and security of our Nation's nuclear fleet.
    Now, as we look at the licensing and regulatory process, I 
also want to take a moment to highlight investments Democrats 
and President Biden have made over the last 2 years in our 
Nation's nuclear power industry.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law authorizes Civil Nuclear 
Credit Program, a $6 billion fund to the Department of Energy 
to support our existing nuclear fleet. And these investments 
will help support continued operation of nuclear facilities to 
prevent increases in carbon pollution from the power sector.
    Then, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, we created a 
tax credit for zero-emission nuclear power and invested 700 
million in a program, originally established by this committee 
in the Energy Act of 2020, to support next-generation nuclear 
fuel.
    The Inflation Reduction Act was the single largest 
investment in climate action in American history. It is going 
to finally allow us to begin to protect our communities from 
the impact of worsening climate crisis while also creating 
nuclear energy jobs and lowering energy costs for American 
families.
    So I would like to see this committee work together to 
build on the progress we made during the last Congress. That is 
why I appreciate the bipartisan nature of this hearing today 
and hope that we will see more hearings where both sides of the 
aisle can work together.
    And with that, Chairman Duncan, I yield back the balance of 
my time.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Pallone follows:]

   DIRECTOR, NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, IDAHO NATIONAL 
LABORATORY; REGIS REPKO, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, GENERATION AND 
  TRANSMISSION STRATEGY, DUKE ENERGY; ARMOND COHEN, EXECUTIVE 
   DIRECTOR, CLEAN AIR TASK FORCE, INC.; AND JEREMY HARRELL, 
 CHAIR, BOARD OF DIRECTORS, U.S. NUCLEAR INDUSTRY COUNCIL, AND 
               CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, CLEARPATH

               STATEMENT OF JESS C. GEHIN, Ph.D.

    Dr. Gehin. All right. Thank you very much, Chairman Duncan, 
Vice Chairman Curtis, Ranking Member DeGette, and members of 
the committee.
    It is an honor to be here and a privilege to be here today. 
I have already been introduced. I'm Jess Gehin, associate 
laboratory director for nuclear science and technology.
    I appreciate Representative Fulcher's introduction. So will 
just proceed with my comments.
    As we look to the future of nuclear energy in the United 
States, I would encourage members of this committee to consider 
the following questions to enable America's nuclear expansion.
    First, how do we leverage our existing nuclear industry to 
ensure domestic energy security?
    Our current fleet of 92 reactors, soon to be 94 operating 
reactors, provide a tremendous resource for us, a key 
imperative to ensure that these reactors continue to provide 
clean and reliable power.
    To do this, we need to ensure our plants are not subject to 
economic variations that can result in them being shut down 
prematurely, which we have had several that have been in that 
situation.
    We also need to extend their operating lifetimes to 
continue to get the value in clean energy from these 
investments.
    Second, our reactors require a reliable supply of uranium 
and enrichment services. We already heard some of that in the 
opening statements.
    Currently, our Nation imports 90 percent of our uranium 
needed for our reactor fleet. This includes imports fromRussia. 
Eliminating these imports from Russia requires us to establish 
an expanded uranium enrichment capability domestically and with 
our close allies.
    The second question is, How do we ensure successful 
deployment of nuclear energy--of new nuclear energy that is 
critical to our energy security, global leadership, and climate 
objectives?
    The recent DOE report on ``Pathways to Commercial Liftoff'' 
for an Advanced Nuclear states that the domestic nuclear 
capacity has the potential to triple by 2050 and is key to 
meeting our clean-energy goals.
    This ambitious goal requires us to aggressively develop, 
demonstrate, and most important, deploy nuclear reactors. To 
enable this, we must support the near-term reactor 
demonstrations.
    This starts with INL's plans to start up the first new 
reactor on the INL site in 50 years, a reactor called MARVEL, 
by the end of next year. It's a small reactor, but an important 
step as it gives us the experience and shows that we can move 
reactors forward relatively quickly.
    This will be followed by several other reactor projects, 
first-of-a-kind commercial projects. This includes the carbon-
free power project being developed by UAMPS, which is a NuScale 
SMR, and other reactor demonstrations, including TerraPower's 
Natrium reactor in Wyoming, and X-energy's Xe-100 reactors 
planned for deployment on the Gulf Coast. And there are others 
in the next decade.
    We must ensure a domestic supply of high-assay low-enriched 
uranium. This high-assay low-enriched uranium has a higher 
enrichment than is used in our current fleets, and we do not 
currently domestically produce that uranium.
    Expanding the deployments to meet this goal that I outlined 
of tripling our nuclear generation will require us to even 
expand much more our uranium supply and enrichment.
    And we should encourage the deployment of nuclear energy 
such that it is on a level playing field of generation. The 
Inflation Reduction Act provided technology-neutral credits 
that stimulate early deployments and will also likely improve 
access to finances, which is important for expanded deployment.
    Third question: How does nuclear energy support our 
national security interests? There have already been good 
comments on this. American ingenuity created the nuclear 
industry. It was invented in the U.S.
    The majority of the reactors around the world are based on 
U.S. technology. As a result, our safety in nonproliferation 
standards are the world's standards. But as the nuclear 
industry in the U.S. has been stuck in neutral for decades, 
other nations have moved forward, notably China and Russia.
    Given the momentum that I just talked about, with the 
demonstrations and the deployment, we have an opportunity to 
lead again and establish our world leadership in nuclear 
energy.
    And recent announcements, such as those in Poland for 
international deployments, are very encouraging, and we should 
increase our support for export of our technologies.
    Fourth question: How can regulatory processes be improved 
to accelerate deployment in nuclear plants? The United States 
benefits from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is 
viewed as the world leader. However, one of the most 
significant time- and resource-intensive activities for new 
reactor developers is the NRC licensing process.
    The NRC is undertaking a new regulatory approach called 
Part 53, but what else can be done? There's other efficiencies 
that can be gained: reducing regulator timeframes by looking at 
mandatory hearings; approaches to expedite environmental 
reviews; roles of bodies within the NRC, including the Advisory 
Committee on Reactor Safeguards; NRC licensing processes that 
include more scheduled certainty; and fee structures to reduce 
the burden.
    Finally, I would like to close with some comments on the 
backend. We need to address our near-term/long-term spent fuel 
management responsibilities. We have the capability and 
knowledge to responsibly and safely manage spent fuel.
    Congress has directed DOE to use a consent-based siting 
approach, in pursuit of a Federal consolidated interim storage 
for the Nation's spent fuel inventory. However, the interim 
storage facilities of sufficient capacity cannot be constructed 
without revising the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to remove the 
prerequisite for the repository construction authorization.
    I will also mention quickly, and then I will close: 
Recycling remains a potential option for the industry and 
policymakers to consider. INL and other laboratories conduct 
research, more research is needed to improve the economics of 
recycling while addressing proliferation risks.
    So I will stop there. Thank you, and I appreciate----
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Gehin follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you. There will be a lot of questions 
as--the witnesses, just try to stay in 5 minutes, as we have 
got a lot to cover.
    Mr. Repko, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

                    STATEMENT OF REGIS REPKO

    Mr. Repko. Thank you. Chairman Duncan, Ranking Member 
DeGette, members of the committee. Good afternoon.
    My name is Regis Repko. I appreciate the opportunity to be 
with you here today representing Duke Energy, where I serve as 
the senior vice president of generation and transmission 
strategy.
    I have 38 years in the energy industry experience, 31 in 
nuclear generation in a variety of roles, including having held 
a Senior Reactor Operator License at the Oconee Nuclear Station 
in Seneca, South Carolina.
    Duke Energy is one of the largest energy holding companies 
in the United States. We serve 8.2 million electric customers 
and 1.6 million natural gas customers across the Southeast and 
Midwest.
    We own 50,000 megawatts of energy capacity, including the 
largest regulated nuclear fleet in the country. Duke Energy is 
currently overseeing the largest clean-energy transition in the 
industry, and I'm proud to represent the 28,000 Duke Energy 
employees that are leading this effort.
    As we continue lowering carbon emissions from electric 
generation, maintaining affordability and reliability for 
customers is critical. We plan to add unprecedented numbers in 
amounts of solar, energy storage, wind power to the grid, as we 
continue to retire our aging coal fleet.
    However, we must have firm, dispatchable resources, such as 
nuclear and natural gas, to support renewable energy resources. 
Our customers depend on us, and we must not jeopardize 
reliability or affordability in this transition.
    Our nuclear generation is a vital part of Duke Energy's 
generation portfolio. Our nuclear fleet delivers more than 80 
percent of our company's carbon-free energy today. While 
generation from renewables is increasing, the existing nuclear 
fleet continues providing baseload, carbon-free capacity that 
our customers need.
    We cannot achieve our Nation's carbon-reduction goals 
without nuclear power. Our 11 nuclear power units provide about 
50 percent of the electricity in the Carolinas and remain 
economic drivers for their communities, providing thousands of 
well-paying jobs, significant tax revenues, and partnership 
opportunities and benefits.
    To advance new nuclear, we see a need for certainty in 
three areas, in the area of licensing, fuel, and financing.
    In terms of licensing, it's both for the existing fleet and 
advanced reactor designs. Our licenses of our current nuclear 
fleet will expire between 2030 and 2046. Renewing our nuclear 
plant licenses for an additional 20 years will help ensure a 
reliable, carbon-free, cost-competitive power for our customers 
for decades to come.
    Duke Energy is closely monitoring the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission's rulemaking on the Generic Environmental Impact 
Statement guidance as we will rely on that guidance for future 
applications for our existing fleet.
    The NRC's adherence to this rulemaking schedule will be an 
important predictor of the needed regulatory stability. And 
congressional oversight of these matters is appreciated.
    In terms of looking forward to new nuclear, Duke Energy 
intends to build eight gigawatts of new nuclear generation to 
meet our energy goals. We are working with industry groups, 
reactor technology companies, and leading research universities 
studying the deployment of advanced nuclear technology.
    Regulatory clarity is important in any utilities decision 
to move forward. Duke Energy looks forward to continuing to 
work with the nuclear generation industry and the NRC to 
develop the Part 53 licensing process so that it is effective 
and efficient and commensurate to the safety of the new reactor 
designs.
    Fuel certainty is an issue. Russia's the largest supplier 
of nuclear fuel worldwide. As the U.S. and its allies pivot 
from Russian nuclear fuel, there is not enough production 
capacity to satisfy long-term demand.
    And although Duke Energy has a diverse set of suppliers, 
both domestic and from ally nations, there's still a need to do 
more.
    And then financial certainty. First, I would like to thank 
Congress for funding the Advanced Reactor Demonstration 
Program, supporting reactor vendors to accelerate deployment 
and develop under their designs.
    I would also like to thank Congress for the IRA, which 
includes the production tax credits that support our existing 
nuclear fleet, as our customers will see the values of these 
credits flow right back to them.
    The IRA also supplies the clean energy PTC, a tax-neutral 
credit, the technology-neutral credit. So out of both of these, 
our bottom line, our customers will see lower electric bills 
because of the IRA production tax credits.
    So we see the potential for costs and scheduled 
uncertainties with current estimates for reactor technologies. 
And we anticipate these cost reductions for successive projects 
will lessen as learnings are passed around from one project to 
the next.
    The Federal Government has an opportunity to accelerate 
deployments of new designs by reducing the risk of these first 
and early projects. This can be done through options, such as 
Federal insurance, if projects were to exceed cost caps.
    We anticipate these types of programs would only be needed 
for the first several projects, but their availability to 
support decisions by utilities to commit to new projects is 
vital.
    Mr. Duncan. May I ask you to conclude?
    Mr. Repko. Yes. In closing, thank you very much for being 
here, I appreciate the opportunity to be here with you today, 
and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Repko follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. I get that the subject of nuclear energy is 
very complex and I understand going over a little bit, but 
let's try to stay within 5 minutes.
    Mr. Cohen.

                   STATEMENT OF ARMOND COHEN

    Mr. Cohen. Thank you very much, Chairman Duncan, Ranking 
Member DeGette, and honorable members of the subcommittee.
    I am going to jump right in. It is the best of times for 
nuclear energy, and it is the worst of times, to borrow a 
phrase. On the one hand, this very hearing, the bipartisan 
nature of it, the experience that some Members have had in 
Europe, my recent experience even in California working on the 
Diablo Canyon Plant suggest that there's actually very broad 
support for nuclear energy as a climate and energy security 
tool.
    That is great news. We are in a different place than we 
were a few years ago on that issue. The problem is that we are 
just not moving at any scale and pace that is relevant to 
climate.
    To be relevant to climate, nuclear is going to have to be 
churning out something like 100 gigawatts per year globally. 
That is about in the range of where we were with coal and gas 
in a sustained way for a few years.
    We have to be really running at that scale. We are about 10 
gigawatts a year. So we need to be 10X where we are, and we are 
just not there. We are nowhere near there, and so the thesis of 
my testimony is that we are going to need a very radical 
rethink of this sector.
    That is a radical rethink of the business model, of the way 
we regulate, the way we finance, and our international 
institutions because, after all, the U.S. is only 15 percent of 
global energy consumption and about the same amount of 
CO<INF>2</INF>. So what we do in the U.S. really isn't going to 
matter to global climate or much anything else unless what we 
build and create is exportable and readily diffusible.
    So the key, we think, to this revolution moving from 10 
gigawatts a year to 100 gigawatts is a very different ecosystem 
that could basically produce a commoditized standardized 
product.
    Think about Boeings, not cathedrals, or Timexes, not 
handmade Swiss watches, is what we are building right now. If 
we look in Georgia, for example, our $12,000 Vogtle unit.
    Now, not only do we need to be cost competitive, we also 
need to be able to deliver on time. We can't take a decade or 
two to deliver these units. We need to be out there in 3 to 5 
years with very low risk.
    These things need to be financeable on near commercial 
terms and suitable for deployment in the developing world, as I 
said, where most of the energy growth is going to be.
    So how do we get there from where we are today, which is 
basically nowhere? We--in the testimony, we lay out a number of 
things that we think the U.S. can do to drive the innovation, 
not just the technical innovation, which we are really, really 
good at--not so great at regulatory innovation, not so great at 
financial innovation, at least in this sector.
    So we kind of have a laundry list in the testimony. I will 
just hit a couple points that I think some of my fellow 
panelists are not going to hit or haven't hit.
    The first is that we need some sort of private-public 
collaboration to really build this commoditized product 
ecosystem, those Boeings. We don't have that right now. There 
has to be a rethink of standardization and commodity, and 
that's not an easy thing to do. It is going to take some big 
brains, but we need to do it.
    We need public policies that drive large orders enabling 
repeat deployment of standardized designs. That is how you get 
the cost down. We can't continue to build one offs that end up 
being last of kind.
    We need a comprehensive program to drive nuclear CAPEX 
costs down below $4,000 per kilowatt. As I said, the Vogtle are 
12. That is not going to work. We need to be in a very low-cost 
range.
    We need also global initiatives because, as I said, what we 
do in the U.S. isn't really going to matter to climate over the 
long run unless we can do this for the rest of the world.
    So we list a number of reforms that are needed. We think 
there needs to be an international bank for nuclear 
infrastructure finance. We believe there needs to be some sort 
of international licensing authority or platform by which 
licenses can transfer from one region to another and some 
mechanism for helping newcomer countries adopt this technology.
    We need a sandbox or an innovative licensed live testing 
environment in the U.S., which we don't have now. Importantly, 
we also need to look at how we regulate, and the question of 
low-dose radiation standards is at the heart of some of the 
dysfunction in regulation, in our opinion.
    The U.S. DOE was given authority and money to do this, and 
unfortunately it has not moved that forward, and Congress 
should be encouraging them to do so.
    Finally, the few other items that we mentioned. If we are 
going to scale up uranium mining at the scale that 100 
gigawatts a year, we are going to need to ensure socially and 
environmentally responsible mining practices.
    And there's several other opportunities we highlight that I 
look forward to engaging on. Thank you for your attention. \1\

    Mr. Duncan. Thank you for that.
    Mr. Harrell, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

                  STATEMENT OF JEREMY HARRELL

    Mr. Harrell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    My name is Jeremy Harrell, and I am the chair of the U.S. 
Nuclear Industry Council's board of directors. The Council 
represents more than 80 companies engaged in nuclear innovation 
and supply chain development. I am also the chief strategy 
officer at ClearPath. Thank you for the opportunity to testify 
today.
    American nuclear energy can power a clean and secure future 
if the U.S. seizes this moment. Global energy markets are 
demanding a carbon-free, reliable, secure energy source more 
than ever, and the U.S. nuclear supply chain is ready to 
deliver.
    This increase in demand has coincided with unprecedented 
private-sector momentum. For example, American electricity 
providers are calling for 90 gigawatts of new nuclear power by 
2050, doubling current capacity.
    The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission anticipates at least 
13 applicants for new nuclear by 2027. And at least eight U.S.-
based companies have announced international partnerships in 
more than 10 countries.
    These data points underscore the U.S. is entering the era 
of deployment. Now, we must show the world that we can bring 
projects in on time and on budget, at scale.
    Thanks to Congress's support, particularly this committee, 
we have seen bipartisan nuclear policy wins, like NEIMA, NEICA, 
and the Energy Act of 2020. The resulting tax incentives, NRS 
modernization, and public-private partnerships like the 
Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program are bolstering the 
interest of new investors and new customers--not just 
utilities, but chemical facilities, steel producers, and data 
centers.
    There are three challenges this committee could tackle to 
further accelerate American nuclear expansion. First, secure 
the nuclear supply chain and end global reliance on Russia. 
Second, enhance the U.S.'s offerings for new American nuclear 
abroad. And third, improve regulatory predictability here at 
home.
    I will start with the supply chain. From mining to 
enrichment, our Nation is too reliant on Russia. About 95 
percent of our uranium used in the U.S. today is imported. 
Nearly 50 percent of that comes from Russia and Kazakhstan. 
Russia is the only source of large volumes of high-assay low-
enriched uranium, the fuel needed for many of our advanced 
designs, and Russia has been supplying more than 20 percent of 
our low-enriched uranium for our current fleet.
    Russia's invasion of Ukraine has made it even more clear 
that the U.S. and its allies must end the global reliance on 
the Russian nuclear sector now.
    To enable a private-industry-led HALEU supply, the Biden 
administration must immediately launch the Advanced Nuclear 
Fuel Availability Program already authorized by this committee.
    Second, the U.S. must enhance its offerings for American 
technology deployment abroad. Demand in Europe, Africa, the 
Middle East, and South Asia has never been higher. Nations want 
affordable, cmlean, reliable, and secure energy, and 
unfortunately China and Russia are filing that desire, building 
dozens of new reactors both within their borders and 
internationally.
    The United States and its allies should be the ones who 
establish these new 100-year partnerships, not China and 
Russia. New policies like the Bipartisan International Energy 
Act send a strong signal that the U.S. will reestablish itself 
as a leader in the global marketplace, but Team America must do 
more with the tools available.
    For instance, in 2020 the Development Finance Corporation 
removed its restrictions on supporting nuclear power projects 
but has been slow to promote American technologies.
    Similarly, XM's bank--the XM Banks China program provides 
financial support for wind and solar but excludes nuclear. This 
week's U.S.-Poland deal to support roughly 20 SMRs with $4 
billion in loans, the agreement that the full committee 
chairwoman mentioned earlier, is a great first step, but the 
U.S. must pursue this aggressive whole-of-government strategy 
to compete.
    Third, neither of these goals work if we do not modernize 
regulations here at home. To lead the NRC must be structured 
and incentivized to license the next generation of new 
reactors.
    While the NRC is working to modernize, attract new talent 
and further its technical understanding of new technologies--
efforts that I commend them for--the Commission admits it will 
still struggle to review these new applications--understandably 
so: Thirteen new applications in the next 5 years is 
unprecedented.
    To rise to that challenge, the Commission should do three 
things. One, realign the NRC's processes for new technologies 
around their safety benefits and new applications, like clean 
heat and disaster relief.
    Two, increase review efficiencies so it doesn't take years 
to come to a decision.
    And finally, be proactive. That means asking Congress for 
support in preparing to be a regulator that not only meets its 
safety mission but also enables nuclear's role in our clean 
energy future.
    USNIC also applauds early House action with the Lower 
Energy Cost Act and stands ready to support a bipartisan deal 
that overhauls our Nation's antiquated permitting system. 
Meaningful permit reform is essential to growing new American 
clean energy.
    In conclusion, this committee has an incredible record of 
bipartisanship in nuclear energy and is positioning the U.S. to 
lead the world in the deployment of affordable, reliable clean 
energy.
    The challenge before us today is to double down on those 
efforts and further increase U.S. supply chain security and 
international competitiveness. USNIC and ClearPath greatly 
appreciates what this committee has accomplished and stand 
ready to support your efforts in the months ahead.
    Thank you.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. I thank all the witnesses. That concludes the 
witness testimony, and I will move into the question portion, 
and I will recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    I and several of my colleagues, as the Chair mentioned, on 
this committee just returned from Europe, where several of our 
meetings focused on nuclear.
    I am optimistic about the partnerships we can make to 
advance the safe deployment of civilian nuclear globally. To 
foster these partnerships, the United States must work to 
advance our domestic industry.
    For a variety of reasons, it is important that we continue 
to advance nuclear energy in the United States and, as 
Assistant Secretary Huff recently said at an Atlantic Council 
announcement on the Poland project, ``deploy, deploy, deploy.''
    Now, we need to determine how to achieve that deployment of 
nuclear here at home, nuclear and technology across the globe. 
So I would like to ask Mr. Repko: Duke is responsible for 
providing affordable and reliable energy to many of my 
constituents and many more throughout the country. What will it 
take for utilities to put orders in for new reactors?
    Mr. Repko. Thank you for that question, Chairman Duncan.
    I laid out the three priorities for us, right? The 
licensing, certainly. Certainly, the fuel certainty for the 
entire fleet. But for Duke Energy it really comes down to that 
financial certainty.
    We have introduced nuclear, in terms of our generation of 
resource planning to our regulators in North Carolina, and they 
are supportive of it--so much so as they have approved for us 
to be getting costs around early site development. But as you 
pointed out, everybody wants to be second, a fast second 
follower to save that risk.
    As a matter of fact, the North Carolina Commission 
recognized and endorsed us being a second follower, relative to 
managing the risk to the customer.
    So I think it is those kind of financial constructs that 
are laid out well in the ``Pathways to Commercial Liftoff'' 
that the DOE issued last month.
    There's a number of different avenues or programs that 
could be put in place, whether it be direct grants that would 
lower that cost of energy or more of the cost share, relative 
to these first few projects, that would have some kind of 
Federal insurance above a certain cap and cost share between 
customers or investors alike.
    If we were to have that in place, it would put new nuclear 
not even at an equitable cost but a competitive cost relative 
to the value that it adds in other aspects. We would have the 
support of our regulators, relative to moving faster as well.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you for that.
    I would ask unanimous consent to insert in the record a 
report from the Department of Energy, ``Pathways to Commercial 
Liftoff: Advanced Nuclear.'' It is a really chock-full paper. 
And so without objection, and so ordered. \1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It mentions SMRs, advanced reactors, in this report. So Mr. 
Harrell, advanced reactors will be critical for the future of 
energy in the United States. We need to modernize our 
regulatory framework.
    NRC's putting effort into preparing for the initial 
advanced reactor applications, but how will they need to 
rethink their licensing and oversight roles to accommodate 
these new technologies?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes, Mr. Chairman, it's a great question, and 
thank you for your leadership on these issues. And I think 
having and really pressuring them to really rethink how we do 
this is going to be important.
    Advanced reactors have a lot of different attributes than 
our traditional gigawatt-scale reactors. They are more 
flexible, they are smaller, they can be paired to provide heat 
to industrial facilities, just like it could be used for 
electricity generation. And there are a lot of different 
dynamics that the NRC needs to consider in that vein, right?
    We don't need the significant security zones, for example, 
like a gigawatt-scale reactor does, and so changing and making 
the emergency preparedness zones small for a small modular 
reactor makes a lot of sense and actually would reduce costs 
without any loss in safety or security.
    The ability to streamline a deployment of more reactors 
because we are going to build multiple of them in a package, 
right? The new scale package, in many cases, are eight to 12 
small modular reactors to have a power facility. X-energy is 
four reactors, things along those lines. We need to be able to 
site those more quickly. That way we can scale these 
technologies abroad.
    So really they need to rethink and really put forth a 
process that accommodates the natural attributes that these new 
reactors have.
    Mr. Duncan. Mr. Gehin, what are the regulatory costs a new 
reactor applicant faces when they are going through the 
licensing process at NRC?
    Dr. Gehin. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?
    Mr. Duncan. So what are the regulatory costs a new reactor 
applicant faces when going through the licensing process at the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
    Dr. Gehin. Regulatory costs? Is that what you said? Yes, so 
there are fees. When you go to license a reactor, you usually 
go through a prelicensing phase, you go through the typical 
submissions. Those all are costs borne by the applicant that 
the NRC charges.
    In addition to that, the reactor design has to be of 
sufficient mature level to go through that. So there's a lot of 
costs on design. That's indirect. that needs to be done, but 
has to be done in advance before the licensing.
    Those costs----
    Mr. Duncan. What would you say is the percentage and the 
overall cost of a reactor project? What's their percentage of 
regulator application fees and compliance versus construction 
costs?
    Dr. Gehin. For a large--and maybe Mr. Repko can comment on 
that for large plants. Of course large plants cost more money, 
so that percentage is pretty small, but as you get to these 
small reactors like we are advocating for, microreactors and 
smaller reactors, you can get to----
    Mr. Duncan. The economies of scale will kick in at that 
point, once you get the first one approved, right?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes.
    Mr. Duncan. They will be cheaper as they go.
    Dr. Gehin. But for the first one, there is significant 
cost. So you have to get past this first one. I don't have an 
exact percentage number, but it can be quite high, and it can 
be a barrier to get through.
    That is why some regulatory reform, such as eliminating 
costs for prelicensing application, would remove barriers to 
get those small--particularly those smaller ones moving and 
into the regulatory process.
    Mr. Duncan. I'm out of time. So we will now go to the 
Ranking Member DeGette for 5 minutes.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to 
the panel for your excellent testimony.
    As the chairman referenced, all the leadership of this 
subcommittee sent a letter actually to the U.S. Nuclear 
Industry Council on April 14th asking for comments on how we 
could improve the regulatory process.
    And so Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent to put 
that letter in the record.
    Mr. Duncan. Without objection, so ordered.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you. And I am assured by counsel that we 
would like to--even though this is directed at Mr. Harrell's 
group, we would like to have comments from everybody, because 
we don't have time to get into all the specific 
recommendations.
    But, Mr. Repko, you said that you have worked through the 
renewal process, you are working through that right now with 
some of your facilities. And so I just want to ask you, Do you 
see unnecessary approval processes that could be streamlined 
without sacrificing safety standards that are needed to protect 
public health and safety?
    Mr. Repko. Well, thank you for that question.
    Ms. DeGette. Yes or no will work.
    Mr. Repko. Yes, we do. We absolutely do.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you. And Mr. Harrell, the same question 
for you. For your industry.
    Mr. Harrell. Could you repeat the question again?
    Ms. DeGette. Yes. Do you see unnecessary approval processes 
that could be streamlined without sacrificing the safety 
standards that are needed to protect public health and safety?
    Mr. Harrell. Absolutely.
    Ms. DeGette. So what I would ask of you and everybody else, 
it is all well and good to sit here in this hearing and talk in 
general about that. And we all agree, in a bipartisan way, but 
where the rubber hits the road is when you look at the specific 
proposals.
    So I would ask everyone if they could please submit 
specific recommendations, so as Mr. Duncan and I sit and think 
about how to do this, we can see exactly what can be done.
    And that goes to my next point, which is about the waste. 
So I have been on this committee since 1997--and you don't have 
to do the math, that is fine--but I will say, we have been 
talking about what we are going to do about nuclear waste ever 
since well before I got here, and I think one of the issues 
that we have, in the whole nuclear industry, but also 
particularly with waste, is we don't have any clear sense of 
what to do that we can give to the industry.
    And therefore, it makes it really hard to make business 
decisions. As Mr. Repko said in his written testimony, 
regulatory clarity is important in any utility's decision to 
move forward.
    And so one time I went down to Yucca Mountain with Joe 
Barton, when he was the chairman of this committee. We are all 
looking around and it looked pretty remote to me, but we were 
still going through the scientific process.
    And then with whichever party took over Congress, then it 
was either certified or decertified and it was based on 
politics, not on science. We need to get beyond that. And so 
what I want to do is help develop some certainty about what we 
do around this waste.
    Because for public health and safety reasons, we need to 
figure out what we are going to do. And right now, Dr. Kathryn 
Huff of the Department of Energy, Assistant Secretary for 
Nuclear Energy, said there are only 76 interim storage sites in 
the United States. That's clearly not going to work if we are 
going to actually include nuclear energy as part of our 
portfolio.
    So I want to just ask you all a very brief question about 
this. And I will start with you, Mr. Harrell. In your work, in 
your industry's work, has the lack of a comprehensive strategy 
to store spent fuel impacted your members in the industry?
    Mr. Harrell. Absolutely has. And it's an opportunity that I 
think we can turn on a dime and ultimately deal with this issue 
and grow the industry as a whole.
    Ms. DeGette. And what about you, Mr. Repko? Same question 
to you. Has that impacted your company's ability to do this?
    Mr. Repko. It has. There are operational resources 
necessary to store the fuel onsite.
    Ms. DeGette. And Mr. Gehin, what have you seen to this 
effect?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, so we, being a DOE research lab, we 
primarily look at the future research, and I can support your 
statements here on the scientific basis. That is what we do. We 
do science and want to have that strong basis.
    I think we can achieve that. I agree that it is the 
policy--policy issues need to be resolved. DOE is also working 
on this consent-based siting approach for consolidated interim 
storage that will address the 76 or 77 sites.
    Ms. DeGette. Your participation in this, your agencies 
participation is going to be critical----
    Dr. Gehin. Yes.
    Ms. DeGette [continuing]. As we move forward. And finally, 
Mr. Cohen, I don't want to leave you out. What are your 
thoughts on this?
    Mr. Cohen. We are not from the industry, but it definitely 
is a public perception----
    Ms. DeGette. No, I know.
    Mr. Cohen [continuing]. Barrier. That's the argument that I 
oddly enough get most common when I advocate for nuclear 
energy, is what about the waste? We know it's a manageable 
problem, it's not rocket science. Sweden and Finland are moving 
forward. In fact, Finland is starting to put things in the 
ground.
    It's a question of public perception and politics, and the 
consent-based siting approach is the way you do it. It's the 
way Sweden and Finland have been able to move as far as they 
have.
    So we need to reboot----
    Mr. Duncan. Yes.
    Mr. Cohen. We have to reboot the process.
    Ms. DeGette. I have been to Sweden, and I have seen what 
they are doing there. It's incredible.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working on this 
further.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes. Those are great questions, and we plan to 
have a hearing on reprocessing nuclear waste that sits at 121 
sites in 39 States around the country. So commercial waste and 
there is defense waste included, so we are going to have a 
hearing on that. That is my plan.
    I will now go to the chairwoman, Mrs. Rodgers, 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    To restore America's nuclear leadership, we also must have 
strong and secure supply chains, especially for nuclear fuels, 
to meet the needs of American industry and innovators.
    We must confront current nuclear fuel security and 
vulnerabilities, which have been caused by outdated policies 
that allowed our nuclear fuel infrastructure to atrophy to 
unacceptable levels.
    And certainly this has become clear in wake of the Ukraine 
war. This exposed the risk of reliance on Russia for a large 
portion of America's enriched nuclear fuels.
    Three years ago, in the Energy Act of 2020, Congress took 
steps to limit Russia's imports to 15 percent of American 
supplies by the end of the decade, but the invasion shows that 
more must be done so we don't fall into the same trap as 
Germany did, for natural gas supplies, and so that U.S. 
taxpayers no longer support Russia's malign regime.
    So my question, Mr. Harrell and Mr. Repko, you both 
acknowledge the need to enable enhanced domestic supplies and 
diverse supplies. Beyond the Federal investments you mentioned, 
how important is it to send a clear signal that a date certain, 
America's nuclear industry can no longer rely on Russian-
sourced low enriched uranium?
    Mr. Harrell. Thank you, Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers, and 
it's a great question and I think it is an extremely important 
piece of the puzzle to provide some certainty and ensure that 
companies can make multihundred-million-dollar investments to 
ramp up enrichment capabilities here in the United States and 
with our allies.
    I think it's telling, we saw out of the G7 just yesterday, 
our allies the UK, Canada, the French, and the Japanese all 
coming together and say, ``We need to ween all of our reliance 
off of Russia together.''
    And so we should work together, as like-minded countries 
and kind of take a stand and say we are going to end this 
reliance moving forward.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Well, would you speak to what it would mean 
for supply contracts and investments into new facilities too?
    Mr. Harrell. I would say, probably Mr. Repko, as an 
operator of the existing fleet, is probably suited to answer 
that question.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK. OK. Thank you.
    Mr. Repko. I would be glad to. Thank you for the question.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK.
    Mr. Repko. So first off, it's absolutely a risk. As we take 
a look at our portfolio, in terms of fuel, currently our 
production is around 5 percent domestic, growing to 14 percent 
next year, but that's really at the upper end of the 
availability domestically.
    The conversion process is--this is Duke Energy I am 
speaking to--is roughly 50 percent domestic, again, due to 
limitations. Now, all of our fabrication is domestic. So that's 
kind of the portfolio that we are in.
    But to the point being made, the domestic capacity around 
the production and conversion is limited. So the perspective I 
would give, though, the 2028 goal, 2028 relative to permitting, 
constructing, and getting these kind of facilities operational, 
it's right around the corner.
    I mean, action needs to happen immediately in order to 
progress to that goal.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK. Thank you. Mr. Gehin, I wanted to turn to 
you also. We just returned from Europe, and we saw the 
excitement for deploying not only large conventional reactors 
but also advanced small modular reactors.
    To assure that American technology continues to lead, can 
you describe the importance of licensing and deploying advanced 
nuclear here in the United States, and how does that strengthen 
our ability to compete globally against Russia and China?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, great question. By constructing the 
reactors in the United States, we demonstrate our trust and 
confidence. We get the first one, as it was mentioned, the 
first one is always a hard one.
    I can give you a good example with NuScale and the carbon-
free power project. They announced their project out in Idaho 
several years ago. When we talked to Romania, Ghana, Poland, 
and other countries that are interested in that technology, 
they point to that reactor as a showpiece and come to Idaho 
specifically, because that reactor is going to be there.
    So it is a huge boost in confidence, attraction. Give us 
the ability to demonstrate to other countries that we are 
leading. And that's just the first one. These other 
demonstrations I mentioned will do the exactly the same thing.
    So it is vitally important. It is also important because we 
develop the supply chains, we develop the talent, the 
expertise, the capability that then will support all these 
broad international deployments, we will develop that here in 
the U.S. rather than internationally.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Would you also speak to the current time 
lines for some of these projects that you are working on?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. And how an improved regulatory process 
would----
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, well, the current timeframes we are looking 
at for various reactors, there's some, the smaller 
microreactors, that will happen in the next 3 to 5 years. The 
larger reactors, the SMRs, we are looking 2027, 2028, 2029, 
2030.
    Those will be licensed under current regulatory processes, 
mostly by taking exceptions and other aspects. It is going to 
be heard to impact their licensing timeframes. I think we need 
to look at the licensing that is going to really blossom to get 
to the ``deploy, deploy, deploy'' and get us to where we are 
getting 10 to 20 gigawatts per year deployed of the U.S. maybe 
in the 2030s, late 2030s timeframes.
    So we need to be looking for that deployment stage.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you. Thank you, all. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Madam Chair. I now recognize the 
gentleman from New Jersey, the ranking member, Mr. Pallone, for 
5 minutes.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Chairman Duncan, and let me thank 
our witnesses.
    In my opening statement I discussed the need for carbon-
free generationt, resources that can sustain output for long 
periods of time.
    So let me ask, Mr. Cohen, you spent a lot of time 
discussing this concept in your written testimony. Could you 
elaborate on the importance of these long-duration power 
generation assets, particularly as to why they are important to 
make decarbonization of the power sector more affordable for 
consumers?
    Mr. Cohen. Yes, thank you, Member Pallone. So as I detail 
in the testimony, wind and solar are great resources. They are 
cheap, they have gotten a lot cheaper. The problem is, it is 
not just a daily fluctuation problem, it is a seasonal problem. 
Anywhere in the northern hemisphere we are talking about months 
where we have solar or wind output at about half peak. So you 
can see the problem.
    If it were a daily fluctuation problem--and, you know, just 
the wind doesn't blow all the time and, obviously, the sun goes 
down--we could manage that with battery storage pretty easily, 
you know, 4- or 8-hour storage.
    The problem is when you have December, where you have got a 
January, February where you have got no solar energy, something 
needs to fill that gap.
    And so that's--all the modeling that's done, typically, 
combines the variable sources, wind and solar, because when 
they are there, they are cheap, but usually building on a 
baseload of nuclear or something else, carbon capture or 
something else that's zero carbon to offset that variability.
    It is a solvable problem, but again the basics physics are 
it's not a daily issue we are dealing with. It's seasonal, and 
that's why you need something that is steady, 24/7/365 at the 
base of the system.
    Mr. Pallone. Well, thank you. Now, last week, I mentioned 
in my opening, I sent out a request for information letter with 
Chairs Rodgers and Duncan and Ranking Member DeGette, and we 
asked for comments and recommendations on the NRC licensing and 
regulatory process. And I know our witnesses haven't had enough 
time to develop a formal response to this letter, but I wanted 
to get some initial feedback.
    So, again with Mr. Cohen, I know that Ms. DeGette mentioned 
this, but if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit. And 
that's the industry's desire to make the licensing process 
simpler, but the concern that we have: Can that be done without 
jeopardizing public health and safety?
    Can you just maybe give me a couple examples? I know she 
asked the question, but if you could just elaborate and maybe 
give me some examples?
    Mr. Cohen. Sure. Well, in the testimony and in comments we 
filed with the NRC, we think there is an approach, and it is an 
approach actually taken by other countries like South Korea, 
Canada, the UK.
    We call it kind of the less-is-more approach in which you 
are not requiring, you don't have a rulebook that's 1,400 pages 
with a bunch of box ticking. You are basically requiring the 
applicant to come forward and make a safety case.
    And what we have recommended to the NRC is that they 
rethink what they are doing and say, basically, let's strip it 
down and say what are the essential output issues, what are the 
essential metrics that we are going to judge safety by, and 
then let the applicant say how they are going to fit in with 
that.
    Don't require them to tell you about some valve that has no 
relevance to safety because it happens to be some vestige in a 
rulebook.
    So it's a flexible approach, but it's tied to actual safety 
metrics rather than a laundry list of things. That's as simple 
as I can make it, but there is a lot of detail in the testimony 
and in our comments that we would be happy to supply, but 
that's how you thread the needle: You hold very firm on safety, 
but you allow flexibility in how those metrics are met.
    Mr. Pallone. All right. Then last question. I mentioned, 
again in my opening, about the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
and the Inflation Reduction Act, grants, tax credits for the 
existing nuclear fleet, and also funding for developing next-
generation fuel.
    Could you just discuss the impact of these new programs and 
where there are maybe additional Federal funding needs?
    Again, you, Mr. Cohen.
    Mr. Cohen. So we think there are a couple of areas. One 
would be the potential for the U.S. Government to become a 
purchaser at scale. I mentioned the need to get scale and build 
many versions of the same unit over and over again, which is 
how we get the cost down.
    So having the Federal Government step in as a purchaser, 
whether through DoD or other agencies, would be a good first 
step--providing, it was alluded to, some kind of insurance 
against market risk.
    So, for example, if something like a contract for 
difference could be an interesting mechanism, which is what the 
UK used to get offshore wind costs down. And then in addition, 
Mr. Pallone, there are a variety of things we think we can do 
on the innovation front that I wouldn't describe as large 
expenditure items, but things like we should have a program 
that drives costs down, that examines where are we getting 
stuck in the process that drives the reactor costs up and what 
can we do, by way of innovation, to drive those costs down.
    So those would be three examples of, I think, where 
additional Federal money could help.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Ranking Member. I will now go to Dr. 
Burgess from Texas for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Cohen, let me just stay with you in the line of 
questioning that Ranking Member Pallone was just pursuing.
    So Texas has Comanche Peak, which is not in my district but 
not very far away. I have been fortunate enough to visit there. 
They are very impressive, and the operations are very 
impressive.
    So I think the phrase used was, ``You don't want to have a 
vestige in a rulebook.'' So the question I would have is about 
the evolving of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations 
to evolve to reflect the actual safety performance that's been 
historically exhibited.
    Is that something that you had in mind with your reference 
to the ``vestige in a rulebook''?
    Mr. Cohen. Yes, in a way. I think the reality is, we have 
got a bunch of new advanced designs coming forward, so it 
probably wouldn't be the right thing to do today because the 
large light-water reactors have proven safe, we can assume that 
all these other reactors are safe.
    It does suggest, though, that you could have a much more 
outcomes-based process. It would be a lot simpler. So the idea, 
again, is set a boundary, you know, exposure limit or whatever 
the right metric is--we detail some of those things in our 
testimony--and have a back-and-forth and allow several pathways 
for the applicant to meet that requirement.
    Mr. Burgess. It just seems like it should be a learning 
exercise, and, I mean, the country has a long history with 
nuclear Navy and long history of safety of a lot of data and 
experience to go on.
    It just seems like the learning from a regulatory agency 
should be part and parcel of what they do. You build on what 
your experience was.
    Mr. Cohen. Absolutely. And we make, in the testimony, we 
make two specific recommendations on that line. One is that the 
rule itself should be evolving. So as applicants come forward 
with novel solutions, those should be explicitly kind of built 
in as pathways that the regulators may not have thought of.
    And the second idea is license by testing, that there 
should be more ability of--and we don't have the details in the 
testimony, but that if we could be testing things in situ and 
having the regulator involved and looking at things being 
dispatched or built in real time and looking at the 
performance, that could really speed things along.
    Mr. Burgess. Now, as a practical matter, do you envision 
that that's possible to do that in real time?
    Mr. Cohen. Absolutely. There is nothing preventing us from 
that. And in fact, you know, in the early days of the nuclear 
program, as I think my fellow witness will attest to, we did 
much more of that at Idaho.
    We had several dozen, I think, reactors being demonstrated. 
What would be different about our proposal is that you would 
have the regulator quite involved with an eye towards 
commercial licensing on site and actually thinking about it as, 
OK, it's not just does the thing work, it's like how are the 
safety metrics performing.
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, if I could comment?
    Mr. Burgess. Sure.
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, we tested 52 reactors on the INL site over 
a 25-year period. Many of these were specifically doing tests 
to support the light-water reactor fleet and enabled that.
    I think as we I talked about these demonstrations we are 
considering and the test facilities we have, we can do testing 
in our nuclear facilities. We can do demonstrations on DOE 
sites. Maybe that's a good place to do those demonstrations and 
get that experience.
    So I agree with your comments. We have decades and decades 
of operational experience--civilian, government--and that 
should be factored in for sure.
    Mr. Burgess. Right. It seems like there should be a 
continuous learning and updating exercise.
    Let me just ask you a question, probably Mr. Repko, and you 
too, Dr. Gehin. This committee 20 years ago did the Energy 
Policy Act of 2005, and the idea was that we were going to help 
with the funding. In the case with Comanche Peak, they have two 
reactors onsite, but they have got a footprint that would 
permit two more, so the idea was to help them with the funding.
    Now, I get it, the world changed with fracking and 
inexpensive natural gas, and suddenly the electrons could not--
the performance was not quite the same as what the pricing had 
indicated that it might be, but again, as a practical matter 
going forward, is that something we can relook at? And is that 
something that you are doing, Mr. Repko, with your energy?
    Mr. Repko. Yes, Congressman. That's absolutely something we 
can look at. You know, as we see it right now, as I said, just 
to meet our clean energy goals right now we will have to build 
to 8 gigawatts from new nuclear.
    So even beyond that, mandates around, relative to the risk 
of other resources, we can certainly do that, in terms of just 
additional goals, right? Mandates relative to new nuclear, in 
terms of energy security, other type of aspects like that.
    Mr. Burgess. Sure. What happens to those licenses when they 
didn't build? Do they still exist?
    Mr. Repko. The licenses can be maintained, in terms of 
construction licenses, but generally they are surrendered. They 
expire.
    Mr. Burgess. I see. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired. Now I will go 
to Ms. Matsui for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Matsui. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I really 
appreciate this hearing, and thank you for the witnesses.
    When done right, I support nuclear energy as a clean energy 
source that has the potential to play a very significant role 
in decarbonizing our power grid.
    However, we cannot build a new fleet of advanced nuclear 
reactors and continue to dodge the question, What we do with 
spent fuel and other radioactive materials? Eighty-eight 
thousand tons of spent nuclear fuel is currently stranded at 
reactor sites around the country, including the decommissioned 
Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station in my district.
    Rancho Seco closed in 1989, and the spent fuel is still 
awaiting transport to a consolidated storage facility. That is 
why I have led appropriations letter in support of DOE's 
interim storage program and why I lead the Store Nuclear Fuel 
Act. We need a solution to this problem, especially if we are 
going to be starting to build more nuclear power plants.
    And believe me, I know we have been having this 
conversation here, but we hear about it all the time and, if 
there is this type of hurdle, we need to really address it.
    The cost. Mr. Repko, according to the latest nuclear waste 
fund audit report, the temporary storage of spent nuclear waste 
at decommissioned reactors sites has already cost taxpayers 
$10.1 billion, and the remaining additional liabilities will 
total $31 billion.
    Mr. Repko, how much does it cost Duke Energy to store spent 
nuclear fuel and other radioactive material from your operating 
and decommissioned nuclear power plants?
    Mr. Repko. To date, we have received $780 million from the 
DOE due to the Government not meeting its obligation, willing 
to take up a national storage of used nuclear fuel.
    So that is across all of our sites, starting in 1995, to 
date.
    Ms. Matsui. OK.
    Mr. Repko. Seven hundred eighty million dollars.
    Ms. Matsui. OK. Thank you.
    I will be concerned about waste. Mr. Harrell, nuclear power 
is and will likely continue to be a key part of the solution to 
climate change, but public questions about safety remain an 
important concern.
    Those questions include, What should we do about nuclear 
waste? Mr. Harrell, nuclear power has faced strong public 
opposition for a variety of reasons, which has led to plant 
closures in my district and around the world.
    If the nuclear industry hopes to see a renaissance, are you 
concerned that public opposition, including concerns about 
nuclear waste, could derail that renaissance?
    Mr. Harrell. Thank you, Congresswoman for the question. And 
I agree with what Mr. Cohen said earlier.
    It is a question that we hear very frequently on the ground 
in the public, and it is a very solvable problem. I think, no 
doubt, we need a spent fuel storage strategy. It will be 
multipronged. Consolidating storage--at least a repository and 
most likely multiple repositories--across the country is going 
to be necessary, but also there's opportunities here as well.
    Some advanced reactors burn existing spent fuel, so they 
can contribute to the solution. Our Nation should be exploring 
recycling. Ninety-five percent of the products--of those 
products' energy potential is not being utilized. So existing 
spent fuel stockpiles could actually be used proactively to 
improve fuel security.
    Ms. Matsui. OK. You mentioned advanced nuclear storage 
designs. Dr. Gehin, advanced nuclear reactor designs and small 
nuclear reactors have the potential to address many of the 
challenges facing today's nuclear fleet. However, I understand 
these reactors will continue to produce hazardous waste.
    Dr. Gehin, can you briefly explain how spent fuel and other 
radioactive waste products produced by advanced nuclear 
reactors would differ from the current generation of reactors?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. Thank you for the question.
    You know, as we have been talking about the supply of 
enriched uranium, advanced reactors generally use higher 
enrichment uranium, higher assay LEU. So the enrichment will be 
higher. It will be higher as you feed it in, it will also 
retain more residual uranium, enriched uranium, as you 
discharge it.
    It will also be a different form. Our current fuel form, 
our ceramic pellets, we are looking at a variety of fuel forms 
for these advanced rectors, whether they are ceramic-coated 
particles, metallic fuel is a good example.
    So they will have a different form as well. The geometries 
would be different. Rather than the large array of pens, they 
could be smaller, it could pebbles. So there's some variety in 
that, as I just mentioned.
    Ms. Matsui. OK. Fine, thank you and I have already reached 
my limit here in the time.
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentlelady. And now I will go to 
Mr. Latta, who is having a birthday today. Happy birthday, and 
you are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Latta. You are too kind, Mr. Chairman, but thanks very 
much for holding today's hearing and thanks for our witnesses 
for being here, because this is a really important subject, and 
as you can tell, this committee is very concerned with.
    Mr. Harrell, you cite in your testimony our nuclear fuel 
supply chain and our overreliance on Russia for fuel that 
powers our current advanced reactors.
    I have longed believed that nuclear energy can be a game 
changer, and for the United States it is unfortunate we have 
surrendered our leadership and competitive edge in the nuclear 
fuel space.
    Now, alarmingly, 90 percent of the uranium purchased for 
the U.S. used in the United States reactors today is produced 
by foreign countries, including Russia.
    I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman, to include an 
article from Nuclear Newswire that highlights these issues 
entitled, `` `On the verge of a crisis: The U.S. nuclear fuel 
Gordian knot.' ''
    And, Mr. Harrell, what are the implications if we don't do 
anything to address this problem and the U.S. continues to be 
reliant on Russia and Russia-aligned nations for nuclear fuel?
    Mr. Harrell. Thank you, Congressman, and a happy birthday, 
and I appreciate the question.
    We, potentially, if we fail to invest in the U.S. supply 
chain, we could reach this catch-22, where we have really 
exciting commercial technologies that both can improve 
affordability, reliability, and our national security in this 
country and can allow us to reassert ourselves with global 
leadership and really push to compete with Russia and China in 
the global marketplace and deploy in countries like in Africa 
and the regions like Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.
    And so, frankly, our failure to do so has the likelihood of 
both threatening our national security and threatening global 
energy security, and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has only 
further accentuated that point.
    Mr. Latta. OK. Let me follow up on something you said. You 
know, this ``we failed to invest in our United States supply 
chain.'' What is holding us back?
    Mr. Harrell. Ourselves.
    Mr. Latta. No, again, but why?
    Mr. Harrell. We need to make some smart long-term 
investments that take matters into our own hands so that we and 
our allies can both mine, can produce and enrich our resources 
here at home or within our kind of like-minded allied 
countries.
    And then, ultimately, I do think the regulatory barriers 
are going to be a problem here in the U.S. We need to modernize 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I am worried that we are 
going to have cutting-edge technologies that aren't able to get 
through an antiquated regulatory system.
    We need to lead by doing. As I mentioned in my testimony, 
it's the era of deployment, and we need a regulator that's 
nimble and ready to deploy these exciting tech.
    Mr. Latta. Well, you know, I introduced the H.R. 1086, 
which is the Nuclear Fuel Security Act, and this legislation is 
the House companion to the bipartisan bill introduced by the 
senior Senators from West Virginia and Wyoming, and that bill 
would establish the Nuclear Fuel Security Program, increase the 
quantity of low-enriched uranium and high-assay low-enriched 
uranium produced by U.S. and nuclear energy companies, expand 
the American assured fuel supply program, ensure the 
availability of domestically produced, converted, and enriched 
uranium in the event of a supply disruption--you never know 
when that might happen--and then also establish that HALEU for 
advanced nuclear reactor demonstration projects program.
    You know, again, Mr. Harrell, how important is it for 
Congress now to act and pass this legislation, like this bill 
that I have that sends signals needed for the industry to 
respond and build up our domestic capacity? And I hate to say 
it this way: in a timely manner?
    Mr. Harrell. It's an urgent priority, Congressman. And I 
should give you kudos. I know you've been talking about this 
issue for many years, and I think the Ukraine issue has brought 
it even more to the forefront.
    As mentioned, 13 new reactor companies to come before the 
NRC by 2027. We need to start ramping up our enrichment 
capacity, our HALEU domestic production capacity now so we have 
time to license those facilities, to build them, and then 
provide the fuel needed for this new wave of reactors.
    There are a bunch of exciting companies that are all 
looking at deploying here in the U.S. by the late 2020s and 
early 2030s. If we don't make the investments now, we may have 
this catch-22 fuel situation, which would be really 
catastrophic for both our security interests, our economic 
interests, and ultimately our mission's goals as well.
    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you.
    Mr. Repko, how important is it for Duke to have certainty 
over fuel sourcing as you look to implement your carbon plan 
and meet your customers' needs?
    Mr. Repko. It's absolutely critical. As I talked about 8 
gigawatts. So if you think about that, that's over 20 SMRs or 
the small advanced reactors, and you typically put those in 
sites of four to five at a site just for economies of scale.
    But to sustain that operations for that energy output, it 
would be absolutely critical to have that sustained supply.
    Mr. Latta. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, my time has expired, 
and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I will now go to Mr. 
Tonko for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I do thank you for 
holding this hearing.
    I want to associate myself with many others' comments on 
the importance of nuclear as part of our energy mix, and we 
especially should recognize and support nuclear energy for 
being such a large zero-emission resource contributing to our 
climate and clean-energy goals.
    So Mr. Cohen, your testimony mentions there have been 
several studies that found achieving a net-zero electricity 
system will be much more difficult and expensive without 
nuclear as part of that mix.
    How can nuclear reduce systemwide costs in the clean grid 
of the future, even if individual projects look expensive 
today?
    Mr. Cohen. Right. Well, as I explained earlier, the 
fundamental way that nuclear reduces system costs of a zero-
carbon system is by not requiring a massive overbuild of 
renewables.
    If you rely, for example, only on wind and solar, you would 
have to build enough wind and sun to meet your peak demand, 
which might be four or five times the average demand, in some 
cases.
    So by having an always available source, you reduce the 
need to have that massive overbuild plus storage, and that's 
just a cost savings. Every study, almost, that's out there will 
prove that, and we put a couple in the testimony. That's the 
fundamental driver. It's the ability to have 24/7/365 without a 
massive amount of capital expense to meet the most stringent 
day.
    Mr. Tonko. You have also discussed an ambitious vision for 
the U.S. nuclear industry of mass producing and deploying 
advanced reactors. Why is that level of ambition necessary?
    Mr. Cohen. Because if we don't really get to a mass-
produced model, we're going to continue to build these one-
offs, and the costs are going to be very, very high.
    Every time that--and to be fair, there's no country that's 
done this. We are not building Boeings anywhere in the world, 
using that analogy. So this is difficult. We need to think 
about how do we sort of incentivize that kind of mass-produced, 
factory-built kind of model? And I think we can do that with 
Federal incentives to say that the kinds of things that the 
Federal Government is going to support are going to be things 
that look like the Boeings, not the cathedrals.
    That's the key on the policy side.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And there have been several major 
incentives enacted recently in the Infrastructure, Investments 
and Jobs Act, and certainly the Inflation Reduction Act, to 
support both new and existing nuclear projects. This builds 
upon existing programs like DOE's Title 17 Loan Program, which 
was critical to the development of the Vogtle Project.
    So Mr. Cohen, would the vision you have outlined be 
possible without a fully committed U.S. Government offering its 
support to project developers, and just how important are these 
Federal incentives?
    Mr. Cohen. Well, these are great steps forward and nothing 
in my testimony should detract from the fact that the IAJA and 
the IRA have made a huge difference in terms of the interest in 
the investment community, among other things.
    What I would say is that you would need to build on that 
because to build a multigiga factory, if you will, for nuclear 
is going to take a lot more than just a job production tax 
credit or investment tax credit.
    So there needs to be a strategic approach to actually 
building that supply chain and that capability. And that is 
something that really hasn't been addressed in current 
legislation.
    Mr. Tonko. OK. And Mr. Harrell, I believe ClearPath has 
also worked on and supported several of these incentives, 
including support to protect and expand the Loan Programs 
Office.
    What do you see as the Federal Government's role in 
supporting the growth of our domestic nuclear industry?
    Mr. Harrell. Absolutely. I think the Loan Program Office, 
cost share programs like the Advanced Reactor Demonstration 
Program that do a 50/50 cost share to employ the very first-of-
a-kind technology and tax incentives, like an investment tax 
credit, are important tools in the toolbelt to offset the 
original cost.
    Mr. Repko was mentioning no one wants to be the first to 
build these, right? They want to be second, third, or fourth. 
Programs like the ARDP or the LPO Program are really important 
to derisking that first build so that we can show that we can 
build it and then ultimately be able to then get the learnings 
from that and drive down the cost. I think that's going to be 
really important for the future of nuclear.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you. And over the years this committee has 
taken a lot of time to examine nuclear waste issues, which 
given the long-term uncertainty for disposal of waste remains a 
significant economic and social risk to future growth of the 
industry.
    I heard Representative Matsui quizzing about this, but can 
anyone provide more context on how these new advanced reactor 
designs may help limit or address waste challenges?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, maybe I'll make a few comments on that. So 
the advanced reactors, many of these advanced reactor types 
can, while you feed them with high-assay LEU or higher 
enrichment, they can actually burn the fuel more in situ, so 
you generate less used fuel per unit energy produced.
    Maybe longer term, especially, some of what we call fast 
reactors have the capability to actually burn waste. So if we 
do the research on recycle or in situ burning, we can actually 
burn the fuel deeper.
    If you go far enough to continuous recycle, you can reduce 
the waste burn by maybe up to an order of magnitude, but 
there's a lot of research that would need to be done to get to 
that point.
    Mr. Tonko. OK. Thank you very much. I went over my time, so 
I thank you for being generous, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired. I will now go 
to Mr. Griffith from Virginia for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Griffith. Thank you very much. First, let me make a 
slight correction to Mr. Harrell. I come from Virginia. 
Governor Youngkin wants to be first. You were just saying 
nobody wants to be first, Governor Youngkin wants us to be 
first, and we've been debating all those issues and, 
interestingly, today in the Cardinal News, an online news 
service, Dwayne Yancy does a report where he talks to the head 
of the Virginia Tech Nuclear Engineering Department and he 
says, even though Virginia's well positioned, we have North 
Anna, we have Surry Nuclear, we have Newport News shipbuilding, 
which does all the nuclear submarines, we have BWX 
Technologies, about 6 or 7 miles outside of my district, maybe 
10. They also have got a facility in Erwin, Tennessee, also 
just outside of my district, and my district is only about a 
little less than 2 hours from Oak Ridge, Tennessee.
    So we think we are well positioned, and the professor comes 
out today and says, yes, all the issues you all have been 
discussing are not the major one. The major one is the 
workforce. Finding the people who know how to build it and know 
how to manage it is going to be the real issue.
    So can you all talk about that and how we are going to be 
prepared? Because we have been thinking that with all the 
skilled folks that we have coming out of natural gas and coal 
production in the district, that we would have people that were 
used to energy and comfortable with it, but he says we don't 
have the workforce ready.
    So can you all discuss that a little bit? The workforce to 
manage a small--and we are looking at a small modular reactor.
    Mr. Harrell. Sure. Yes, absolutely.
    Mr. Griffith. I'll start with you, but I am happy to get 
everybody's opinion.
    Mr. Harrell. Appreciate the question, and yes, very 
exciting what's happening in Virginia now, and I think Virginia 
is very well positioned to be a leader in new nuclear. Your 
universities have robust nuclear energy programs, they are 
trying to get at some of that training. Obviously BWXT, big 
employer there in the State and really the driver, and it's one 
of the big upsides for nuclear, right? The nuclear energy jobs 
pay significantly higher relative to other energy industries, 
and they're long-term high-paying jobs.
    And you mentioned the nexus with the national security 
side. Civilian nuclear is a great spot for our servicemembers 
who have been involved in Navy nukes, things like that.
    So once they leave the service to land in a high-paying 
industry that still has significant impact on our national 
security. And so I do think we need to be thoughtful about 
those types of investments.
    And so I think these universities are doing the right 
thing. The VNEC has made a lot of big moves, kind of in advance 
of this military----
    Mr. Griffith. Hold on. The V-what?
    Mr. Harrell. The VNEC, the Virginia Nuclear Energy 
Commission.
    Mr. Griffith. Gotcha.
    Mr. Harrell. It's kind of the coalition in the State that 
over the last couple of years have really wanted to make some 
of these investments to position the State well.
    And so I think those are going to be really important. The 
crux of it is we need projects. This is the era of deployment. 
Like, we need to attract new young people who are excited about 
this.
    Mr. Griffith. But if we build it, will there be people to 
build it, operate it, run it, and make sure that it's doing 
what it's supposed to? That's the question.
    Mr. Harrell. Not yet. Not yet, but I think all this 
excitement in the industry is giving us that moment.
    Mr. Griffith. How long will it take to gear up? Because we 
are ready to, I mean, a lot of us are ready to go forward. I 
understand that not everybody in the State feels that way, but 
a lot of us do.
    Mr. Harrell. It's why some of these programs, so that we 
have more than just one project, or big manufacturing 
facilities are so important, because it gives long-term 
certainty to folks to come into this field. And so----
    Mr. Griffith. So what you are saying is, is that we, as the 
Federal Government, should incentive a couple of projects in my 
district on this level?
    Mr. Harrell. And the State should as well. I think this 
Virginia Nuclear Energy Hub is a really great idea by Governor 
Youngkin and I think will drive more investment in the State.
    Mr. Griffith. All right. My clock is running, but I did 
promise that I would let all of you weigh in. Anybody got 
anything to add on workforce?
    Mr. Repko. I would echo much of what has been said but 
thinking even beyond the operation, just the constructability, 
the workforce relative to those skills, that's an area I think 
Europe is ahead of us, with their strong apprentice-type 
programs.
    But I do think the answer that Mr. Harrell said, creating 
the market first, the urgency with creating that market will 
subsequently develop those kind of programs, either through 
community colleges, apprenticeship programs, and that. We have 
some of those in place right now at Duke around transmissions 
skill sets, right? Linemen skillsets, that can expand.
    Mr. Griffith. We are not that far from Duke territory 
either.
    Mr. Repko. And I understand.
    Mr. Griffith. I'm in southwest Virginia. Go ahead, yes, 
sir?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, I was just going to make one point. I agree 
with all this, projects, everything, the demo projects, but, 
you know, we're finishing two large plants in Georgia. It would 
be great if they were actually moving right on to the next 
plant. There are a lot of people that have a lot of experience 
that could just continue constructing plants, moving from one 
to one----
    Mr. Griffith. All right. So we might be able to----
    Dr. Gehin [continuing]. A lot of them----
    Mr. Griffith [continuing]. Pick up some workers out of 
Georgia short term. We want them to come live and spend their 
money in our area.
    Dr. Gehin. Yes.
    Mr. Griffith. Mr. Harrell, a lot of folks are concerned 
about just being used by the nuclear industry as the next 
stop--what kind of investments do they make? Besides the good-
paying jobs, what else can the community look for if we get a 
small modular reactor in the area?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes, absolutely. I would say nuclear is the 
exact opposite. We've got a track record across the country and 
in your State and in South Carolina as well, that nuclear is 
there to stay. These are 50-, 60-, 70-year projects. They 
invest in communities. They're contributing significant local 
tax resources.
    It's not an industry that comes in and out. The 
construction, obviously, there's a big uptick, but unlike the 
solar industry, the wind industry----
    Mr. Griffith. And the safety record is pretty good.
    Mr. Harrell [continuing]. Most people are on----
    Mr. Griffith. My time is up. I'm going to have to yield 
back. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. I now go to Mr. Veasey 
from Texas for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Veasey. Mr. Chairman, I thank you very much and I thank 
the witnesses for being here as well.
    Last year the power sector accounted for 28 percent of the 
total U.S. carbon dioxide pollution. If we are going to slash 
that figure, we need reliable, carbon-free energy sources like 
nuclear that can sustain output for long periods of time, 
particularly while we work on things like battery storage, 
which we are making great progress on in Texas.
    According to the Energy Information Administration, nuclear 
power accounts for about 46 percent of the zero-carbon 
electricity generated here at home. And the Inflation Reduction 
Act, Democrats created a tax credit of up to 1.8 cents per 
kilowatt hour for zero-emissions nuclear energy and provided 
the DOE with $700 million to invest in increasing the 
availability of next-generation nuclear fuel for advanced 
reactors. And all of you have mentioned in your testimony a 
significant priority must be enhancing the domestic supply 
chain for uranium and boosting the U.S. enrichment and 
conversion industry.
    What we have learned since the Russia/Ukraine conflict is 
that geopolitical events have complicated the supply chain for 
these materials even further, as a substantial portion of the 
supply comes from Russia and the Eastern European region. And I 
wanted to ask, for anyone to answer this, Russian and Chinese 
nuclear companies, as we know, receive the full backing of 
their government when competing for export bids and projects in 
overseas markets.
    This integrated government support has made them very 
competitive in global markets and dominant in the nuclear 
energy supply chain, despite this influence, recent research 
shows that the U.S. industry is well positioned to become a 
global leader in key parts of the value chain for nuclear fuel 
and the manufacturing of small modular reactors worth $180 
billion-plus in market value.
    What are we doing to ensure that we have the necessary 
technology and infrastructure to compete globally, and how can 
Congress best support such efforts so that the U.S. can lead 
the development of new nuclear reactors with the highest 
standards of safety, security, and nonproliferation in the 
world?
    Anybody jump in.
    Mr. Harrell. I'm happy to start. As I mentioned, I think we 
need a whole-of-government approach. You're exactly right. 
China and Russia are willing to do 100-year partnerships with 
these countries. They're willing to build, they're willing to 
staff, they are essentially owner operators. We're never going 
to get at that model, right? That's not the American way, and 
there's a lot of other inherent advantages to working with a 
country like the United States, but we do need to put in 
competitive financing packages.
    So things like this Poland announcement that happened 
yesterday, where we're putting loans from XM and Development 
Finance Corporation, that we're willing to make fuel deals so 
that we ramp up our enrichment capacity and we can be a fuel 
provider to these countries as well.
    It's a really important piece of the puzzle, and if we 
don't do that, we're not going to compete with the Russias and 
Chinas, because when we're talking about a country like Ghana, 
for example, they want a partner that's going to ensure that 
they can deliver electricity to their people now to meet their 
needs.
    The U.S. can win those contracts. Ghana has every advantage 
to do it with the U.S., but we've got to be competitive with 
our offerings.
    Mr. Veasey. Yes.
    Mr. Cohen. Mr. Veasey, we also suggest, in our testimony, 
that maybe the U.S. doesn't have to carry the only--is not the 
only party bearing the financial derisking burden. So we 
recommend a creation of something called an International Bank 
for Nuclear Infrastructure.
    The World Bank won't touch nuclear right now for a variety 
of reasons, but it's a world imperative. And so the proposal 
really here is that a coalition of the willing--not just the 
U.S. but other countries and other investors that want to see 
this technology go--should be providing derisking financing for 
global expansion, and American reactors could compete in that 
environment.
    So I don't know that we necessarily have to go at it alone. 
We detail--there actually is a proposal out there, quite a 
concrete proposal, to create this multilateral bank that would 
do some of that work.
    Mr. Veasey. Yes. Let me also ask Jeremy Harrell. I like to 
inquire about the synergy between DoD and DOE. I know that 
there has been some growing interest with the U.S. military to 
explore the use of advanced nuclear technologies to help power 
land bases at home or reliable energy assets in forward areas.
    As the interest increases and DoD-led projects move 
forward, what are the synergies between these efforts and those 
occurring within the commercial sector and how can defense-led 
programs benefit the advancement of new nuclear technologies in 
the civilian sector?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes, it's a great question, Congressman. So 
there has actually been a study that shows that there is 
roughly a $3 billion benefit of the civilian nuclear industry 
to our defense apparatus, and vice versa. It's an 
interchangeable supportive organization.
    And so this program you mentioned, Project Pele, which gets 
at one critical issue that affects our servicemembers abroad. 
So many deaths are related to diesel resources getting brought 
to troops on the ground and for deployments.
    This Pele project, for example, would use transportable 
reactors to take that diesel dynamic out and get at one of the 
single largest casualty risks that servicemembers have in 
forward deployments.
    Mr. Veasey. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman?
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired. I will now go 
to the Bluegrass State, Mr. Guthrie, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. Thanks, gentlemen, for yielding the 
time--the Chair for the time--and I thank all of our witnesses 
for being here.
    Mr. Repko, this is kind of going to be directed at you, 
questions for you. In 2017, Kentucky actually, during the 7-
month Three Mile Island and all that other stuff, put in a 
nuclear ban where you couldn't do atomic energy in Kentucky.
    Finally, in 2017, effort of people I was in the general 
assembly with and others finally got it across the line when 
Governor Bevin was in office and rolled back our background.
    And there's been a really strong interest, particularly in 
Western Kentucky, in bringing nuclear power, including small 
modular reactors. And, you know, Kentucky's obviously 
historically been an energy-producing State, particularly coal, 
and State and community leaders see nuclear energy as a way to 
continue Kentucky's leadership as an energy-producing State and 
also improving reliability of our grid, which we've struggled 
with. We actually had rolling blackouts in Kentucky in 
December, because of some--I don't know, it's debatable--but I 
think some decisions on taking out coal-fire plants left us 
below our baseload.
    So the question is nuclear, and my question for you is, is 
Duke Energy looking at converting old coal-fire plants into 
nuclear power plants, and what would be your considerations? 
And what are some performance features of new technologies that 
make it appropriate for you to invest in this type of thing?
    Mr. Repko. So we are looking at siting new technologies, 
new nuclear at existing sites. There are some technologies 
around retrofit of coal plants. Those would typically involve, 
like, storage-type technologies, molten salts, but for where 
we're at right now, the existing retiring sites provide the 
best opportunities for deployment of new nuclear.
    So if you think about it, the water infrastructure is 
already there. The transmission interconnection and 
infrastructure is there. They're already paid for by the 
customer, and there are very generous incentives for 
replacement of generation and things.
    So that's how we are approaching, in terms of utilizing 
existing or retiring facilities.
    Mr. Guthrie. OK. Anybody else want to comment on that? Mr. 
Cohen?
    Mr. Cohen. Yes, if I may.
    Mr. Guthrie. Yes.
    Mr. Cohen. There's an easy layup here, which is the 
Government already has a lot of authorities, as well as money, 
through the IRA, to move forward these coal-to-nuclear 
conversions.
    What we've yet to see from DOE--and I know they have a lot 
on their plate--is a kind of whole-of-government approach where 
you're kind of made into a one-stop shop, to kind of, like, 
knit together the regulation, the funding, the planning, 
support, all of that to make these things happen.
    It really is a great opportunity, as Mr. Repko said, and 
we've looked at this in detail. And you typically have good 
political support at the local community level.
    So again, there's really gold to be mined there, and we 
just need to do it.
    Mr. Guthrie. Appreciate that. Mr. Harrell, you seem like 
you want to answer something?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes, just one quick thing I'll flag: It's low-
hanging fruit for regulatory reform.
    Mr. Guthrie. I'll end, and Mr. Gehin next. Yes, go ahead.
    Mr. Harrell. It's low-hanging fruit for regulatory reform. 
Like, if we're building at brownfield sites, a lot of the 
dynamics of building a nuclear power plant, the coal plant, 
similar dynamics there.
    The NRC should make it a lot easier to----
    Mr. Guthrie. The transmission lines are already there, 
right?
    Mr. Harrell. The transmission lines is already there. A lot 
of synergies that make this--and it's great for the workforce 
too. A lot of these new designs, like TerraPower, for example, 
that's building their first project in Wyoming, they separate 
the nuclear power unit and the power plant operations.
    And so many of those coal workers could work at that power 
plant operations with pretty minimal training.
    Mr. Guthrie. Yes. I was just sending out TBAs, plant in 
Paradise--in Muhlenberg County, if you know the song--but it 
was at Paradise, but they went from a coal plant that had 400 
employees to a combined gas plant that has about 32, I think.
    So I think it's just all automated. So sometimes that 
doesn't translate. Is that--Mr. Gehin, Doctor?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. And what I wanted to add is certainly 
Kentucky is a great location for this. DOE did a study that 
identified about 80 percent of the coal sites could be 
converted to nuclear, and it would result in a 15 to 35 percent 
cost reduction in deploying nuclear plants by reusing some of 
the things that Mr. Repko talked about here.
    So there's huge opportunities in this space.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thanks for adding that. And then one more, Mr. 
Repko, and for 30 seconds that I have, you mentioned in your 
testimony that Duke Energy's applied for license renewals for 
expiring license for one station that plans to do for other 
expiring licenses.
    Can you explain how these expiring licenses will be safely 
extended and continue to improve reliable and affordable 
energy, and what are your regulatory challenges? Twenty 
seconds.
    Mr. Repko. Yes, very quickly. I will tell you that the age 
of these plants do not reflect their actual physical condition. 
There are constant replacements of valves, pipings, and things 
like--very few of the physical assets there, the reactor vessel 
being one of which undergoes very extensive monitoring of that, 
but these are not ages, the equipment there is not the age of 
the plants.
    So, you know, in terms of that, we're really looking for 
the regulatory certainty around the GEIS to enable the future 
applications.
    Mr. Duncan. Ms. Kuster is recognized for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Kuster. Thank you very much for hosting this hearing, 
Chairman Duncan.
    Until recent emergence of cheap solar and wind energy, 
there were two energy generation resources that provided the 
United States with the bulk of our carbon-free energy: nuclear 
and hydropower.
    These two energy resources are often thought of in the same 
breath. When the United States built out our nuclear energy 
fleet during the 1960s and '70s, we also built hydropower pump 
storage projects around the country to capture excess nuclear 
energy when there was not sufficient demand on the grid for the 
energy.
    I am glad we are talking about nuclear energy today, 
Chairman Duncan, and I encourage you to hold a similar hearing 
on hydropower in the near future.
    Turning to the issue at hand, the Seabrook Nuclear Power 
Plant in New Hampshire is responsible for nearly three-fifths 
of the electricity generated in my State. The facility is a 
source of reliable power and provides high-paying, high-skilled 
jobs.
    While nuclear energy plays an important role in keeping the 
lights on, our Nation is sadly too reliant on nuclear fuel 
imports from Russia. Russia provides nearly 14 percent of 
America's low-enriched uranium, which is the key component for 
nuclear fuel. And, unconscionably, the proceeds from Russian 
fuel sales to the United States may be supporting Russia's 
aggression in Ukraine.
    Last year, Congress acted in an overwhelming bipartisan way 
and banned the importation of Russian oil and natural gas.
    Mr. Harrell, my first question is to you. Should Congress 
also ban low-enriched uranium imports from Russia?
    Mr. Harrell. I think it needs to be a piece of the puzzle 
as we provide some certainty for U.S. and allied providers and 
enrichers to move forward.
    We need the financial--or the assurance that the Russians 
aren't going to flood the market and drive those investments 
out of business. So I think it's a piece of that long-term 
picture.
    Ms. Kuster. And to Mr. Harrell and Mr. Cohen: In both of 
your testimonies, you touted the benefits of new advanced 
nuclear reactors. These new electricity-generating technologies 
have the potential to reliably produce power with fewer 
environmental externalities and safety concerns than existing 
nuclear technology.
    But I also understand that high-assay low-enriched uranium, 
or HALEU, which is a critical fuel source for advanced nuclear 
reactors, also largely comes from Russia.
    Again, would banning the importation of Russian uranium 
help America and our allies win the future by creating an 
incentive to move this HALEU production to friendlier nations?
    Mr. Cohen. Yes.
    Mr. Harrell. Sure. I think the biggest thing that we can do 
for HALEU production here is to get the Biden administration to 
launch the Advanced Fuel Availability Program that this 
committee authorized in the Energy Act before.
    Launching that program, providing the initial certainty for 
companies to ramp up production of HALEU, can immediately 
challenge Russian dominance in this space. And so I think it's 
the biggest thing that we can do on that front, and we can 
ensure that the HALEU problem isn't just like the LEU problem 
that we've got here.
    Ms. Kuster. Great. Would you like to add, Mr. Cohen?
    Mr. Cohen. Yes. I just was going to say, I think it's a 
supply-side answer as well as managing demand side. It might 
provide us additional incentives to do our domestic program, 
but we're still--we still need a lot of effort there.
    We've supported appropriations for the domestic HALEU 
program.
    Ms. Kuster. All right. Thank you. And I have a followup 
question for you, Mr. Cohen: Can you describe one safety 
benefit of advanced nuclear reactors and how having a secure 
fuel supply for advanced nuclear reactors would help the U.S. 
realize those benefits?
    Mr. Cohen. Sure. Well, obviously, if we don't have the 
advance fuels, we're not going to have the advanced reactors, 
but probably the most significant safety feature of many, not 
all, of the advanced reactor designs is that they're not 
relying on water as a coolant or as a reaction moderator.
    The major accidents we've had--Chernobyl, Three-Mile 
Island, and Fukushima--were all driven by loss of coolant. 
Water boiling off, essentially. And many, not all, of the 
designs have moderators or coolants that have much higher 
temperature thresholds. You know, they can withstand a lot of 
runaway heat.
    So that's probably the single most significant safety 
attribute, which is the inability to have a runaway reaction 
that, you know, essentially melts through the core and the 
containment vessel.
    Ms. Kuster. All right. Well, thank you very much. Mr. 
Chairman, there's bipartisan interest in banning imports of 
Russian uranium. It will make our energy supply chains more 
secure now and into the future, and I look forward to working 
with you to get this done. Thank you very much. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. Agreed. And the Chair will now go to the chair 
of the Environment, Climate, and Critical Minerals 
Subcommittee, Mr. Johnson, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Johnson. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me say 
thanks to our panelists for being here with us today. Let me 
start by saying I'm very encouraged today. We disagree on a lot 
of things on this committee, but I do believe that bipartisan 
support for nuclear power hasn't been this strong since I have 
been in Congress for the last 13 years.
    And it's not a mystery why. The fact is that nuclear is the 
only--and I mean only--large-scale, reliable baseload, carbon-
free electricity source available to us. It's not going away, 
and the world needs more of it.
    The only question now is, Will America lead in this 
critical energy sector, or will we cede our leadership to our 
adversaries like Russia and China?
    When Russia and China export their civilian nuclear 
technology to other nations, it gives them a near century-long 
foothold. I don't have to tell you guys this, you know it. A 
geostrategic advantage.
    So how do we respond to that? Back in the mid-20th century, 
America took the global lead in the Atomic Age, but 
unfortunately for our 21st-century nuclear entrepreneurs and 
innovators, our regulatory framework is, in many ways, quite 
literally stuck in the 1950s. That's got to change.
    Mr. Harrell, it's good to see you here again. I plan on 
reintroducing my Strengthening American Nuclear Competitiveness 
Act this year, and a key aspect of my legislation is requiring 
DOE to provide a report on U.S. civilian nuclear commerce.
    With China and Russia currently dominating the 
international market, we have got to make sure we have a robust 
supply chain.
    So, Mr. Harrell, why is it so important to understand the 
gaps in our supply chain, particularly as it relates to 
nuclear?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes, thank you, Congressman, for the question, 
and it's good to see you as well.
    You get at the very crux of this issue, right? This is not 
a zero-sum game. If the U.S. doesn't meet the demand that 
Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South Asia have, it doesn't 
mean that they're not going to build nuclear, it just means 
they're going to build it with someone else, most likely Russia 
or China.
    And so it's a national security imperative for us to 
compete on that front. And so your focus on technology exports 
and ensuring that we invest in our supply chain here to ensure 
project delivery is really a critical piece of global energy 
security as a whole.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Thanks. Another provision in my 
legislation directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to look 
at unique industrial and manufacturing uses as well as 
innovative advanced reactors that can be safely located closer 
to cities and businesses.
    So Dr. Gehin and Mr. Harrell, you can chime in too if you'd 
like. If we can get this right, what would this mean for U.S. 
nuclear leadership?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, great question. It was talked about--mostly 
the discussion today has been about electricity, where 28 
percent of our, you know, talk about carbon from 28 percent. 
What about the other 62 percent?
    Well, reactors, particularly advanced reactors, produce a 
lot of energy, but they produce at a higher temperatures that 
can be directly used for industrial processes, whether it's 
hydrogen, steel, chemicals, you know, X-energy is working with 
Dow Chemical, oil refining, you know, to reduce the carbon for 
that.
    So it really opens the door to address all these other 
areas that we need a lot of energy, and those can be deployed 
worldwide. We can establish them here. They can be deployed 
worldwide.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Mr. Harrell, any comments?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes, I would completely agree there. There are 
immense opportunities here: chemical production, steel 
production, hydrogen production, especially if we're going to 
use that for a variety of different applications.
    But that's going to force the regulator here in the United 
States, in particular, to think about these things differently. 
We need to be able to put a microreactor right pretty close to 
that Dow Chemical facility to use both the heat and the 
electricity for that process.
    If we had the same emergency preparedness zone of the 
plant, like, Davis-Besse in Ohio, you know, you've got a mile 
security zone around that.
    Mr. Johnson. No.
    Mr. Harrell. That doesn't quite make sense in Louisiana and 
chemical country.
    Mr. Johnson. One final point in question, I want to address 
fuel. You know, it's a chicken-or-egg problem. You need the 
fuel, you need the new reactors as a market for the fuel, but 
you need a reliable fuel supply in order to build a reactor.
    The future of advanced reactors depends on HALEU, that's 
already been mentioned. Mr. Harrell, why is having a domestic 
supply of HALEU so important, and what happens if we do not 
have a sufficient supply of it for our nuclear innovators?
    Mr. Harrell. The Russians are the only entity that are 
capable of large supplies of HALEU. We don't want to be relying 
on Russia, so we absolutely need our own domestic supply. It's 
why the administration moving on this fuel program is 
critically important.
    Mr. Johnson. Basically, it comes down to whether or not we 
are going to lead or we are going to cede leadership to Russia 
and China, right?
    Mr. Harrell. One hundred percent, sir.
    Mr. Johnson. OK. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. Great questions. I will now go to Florida, Ms. 
Castor for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to 
all our witnesses for your testimony today.
    I was privileged to lead the House Select Committee on the 
Climate Crisis for 4 years as we took a fresh look at 
electricity generation from nuclear power and the role it can 
play in fighting climate change, and we also issued a broad 
request for information.
    A lot of your folks responded to us, and you all provided 
very important input. So we developed very specific 
recommendations for ambitious reductions in carbon pollution 
through a cleaner, more resilient electricity sector. And then 
we successfully passed these important new laws boosting 
carbon-free nuclear power in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 
the $6 billion for the civil nuclear credit initiative, to keep 
the existing nuclear power plants online and save thousands of 
jobs.
    In the CHIPS and Science Act, we authorized the historic 
research, development, demonstration, and deployment, including 
on both nuclear, fusion, and fission technologies. and then, of 
course, the Inflation Reduction Act that you all have all 
highlighted today for the generational investments in clean 
energy production, the production tax credit, clean energy 
production tax credit, the investments tax credits for new 
nuclear power plants that go into service at 2025.
    We are here to work with you to make that happen, but I 
would like to go back to the how do we extend licenses and the 
safety considerations.
    Mr. Gehin, you said we have 92 reactors today, going to 94. 
As you look out across all of the reactors, what do you want us 
to know going in as we have invested money to safely look at 
extending these licenses, but what should we be anticipating? 
What should we know?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. So let me comment on it. Maybe Mr. Repko 
might want to comment as well.
    Ms. Castor. Yes.
    Dr. Gehin. So many of the reactors--in fact, I think most 
of the reactors currently operating--will go from 40 to 60 
years. They go through a regulatory process that's very 
rigorous on safety, safety of those reactors to ensure they can 
operate safely.
    As Mr. Repko mentioned, those reactors are maintained 
impeccably. You know, new components, new parts looked at 
rigorously. There's been a few plants, including I believe 
Turkey Point, you know, going to 80 years.
    It goes through the same rigorous process, from a safety 
point of view, to get to those 80 years. I think the biggest 
threat, at least in the past several years, for these reactors 
has been less to do with the technology and more to do with the 
economics as they've been competing with low-price natural gas 
as well as incentivized renewable energy.
    So the Inflation Reduction Act and other activities have 
helped that. So I think the vision here would be all of our 
existing plants operating 80 years, as we bring on, you know, 
new reactors, whether SMRs, advanced reactors, to get to 
perhaps this 300-gigawatt goal that I mentioned from this DOE 
report.
    Ms. Castor. Mr. Repko, anything you want to add?
    Mr. Repko. Thank you, Congresswoman. As I said, we've 
already committed to the relicensing of our entire existing 
fleet, all 11 reactors. We have submitted that for the Oconee 
Station and making plans for the Robinson Station next.
    You know, in terms of our resource planning? These assets 
are proving valuable and necessary in terms of meeting our 
requirement goals, and they have the regulatory support for 
that.
    And a lot of that is contributable, not just for the clean, 
reliable power that they serve--our entire fleet has served 24 
consecutive years at capacity factors greater than 90 percent. 
Twenty-four years consecutive.
    So impressive reliability, impeccable safety, and then in 
terms of the community support----
    Ms. Castor. Can I move on, because I just have 1 more 
minute?
    Mr. Repko. Sure. I'm sorry.
    Ms. Castor. I was so happy to hear you say that our 
customers will see lower electric bills thanks to the Inflation 
Reduction Act.
    Mr. Repko. They will.
    Ms. Castor. That is music to my ears because Florida 
families are really being squeezed right now with high electric 
bills, and a lot of the reason for that is--Florida, you would 
think the Sunshine State, we would be a leader in solar power, 
but we generate electricity 75 percent based on gas.
    So they put all the eggs in one basket, so you have these 
price spikes like we had at the pump, and then our electricity 
bills go out of sight.
    So I really hope that Duke Energy, in addition to what you 
are going to do across your service areas in all States--you 
know, expanding, making sure carbon-free nuclear power is 
there--that you are also just as enthusiastic about using these 
tax credits for solar power and wind power, where it makes 
sense. But in Florida, we have such great potential for solar 
power to lower electric bills and to power our communities.
    I trust that you are just as enthused about that?
    Mr. Repko. Absolutely. Eight hundred megawatts of solar in 
Florida, planning on 300 megawatts a year in our future plans. 
All the incentives going back to the customers.
    Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady's time has expired. We will now 
go to Mr. Bucshon from Indiana.
    Mr. Bucshon. Thank you, Chairman Duncan. When it comes to 
the energy policy of the United States, Congress must act in an 
all-the-above energy strategy, in my view, in order to maintain 
grid reliability, lower emissions, and ensure affordable energy 
prices using all sources of available energy is crucial.
    There is no doubt that nuclear energy plays an important 
part, if not critical part, of this diverse energy mix. So I 
appreciate the opportunity to discuss it here today.
    Chairman Duncan and maybe Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers might 
have discussed, we were recently in Europe, in Poland, Czech 
Republic, and in Belgium, and what we heard on the nuclear side 
in Poland is dramatic.
    A lot of opportunity. In fact, American companies--right 
now, American companies are competing for that business as 
Poland has completely taken themselves off of Russian natural 
gas and oil, for that matter.
    So there's a lot of opportunity for us here in the U.S. if 
we do this, not only to deploy nuclear power sources in the 
United States but around the world in our allies, and also in 
high-emissions countries like India, for example.
    I mean, how are we going to get the worldwide emissions 
down if we don't have the opportunity to help deploy nuclear 
around the world?
    And so this is really important. And somebody may have 
touched on this earlier, but 4 years ago in the Nuclear Energy 
Innovation and Modernization Act, which came out of this 
committee, Congress directed the NRC to establish a risk-
informed, technology-neutral framework suitable for licensing 
advanced nuclear.
    Mr. Harrell, can you tell us, has NRC met those objectives 
under Congress's direction?
    Mr. Harrell. Thank you for the question, sir. The answer is 
no. The initial draft for the Part 53 Rule does not meet those 
objectives, and effectively, the NRC needs to go back to the 
drawing board.
    And to his credit, Chairman Hanson said at the RIC 
Conference a couple of weeks ago that they are going to send it 
back and they need this to get moving, because the key is going 
to be to get this right.
    All these designs that are about to move forward in this 
kind of 2025-to-2027 time period are going to use Part 50 and 
Part 52. It's an imperfect process, but they've got a strategy 
to go through the process and get their first reactors built.
    We need Part 53 for the future, the scaleup of these 
technologies, and what the Commission put forth publicly a 
couple of weeks ago simple doesn't meet that goal.
    Mr. Bucshon. Great. Anyone else want to comment on that?
    Mr. Cohen?
    Mr. Cohen. Yes, we agree with that position. The current 
draft just doesn't do it. It just compiles more complexity on 
an existing system. As I said earlier in the hearing, there's a 
way to do this in which less is more.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes.
    Mr. Cohen. And it's other countries that have demonstrated 
the ability to do that.
    Mr. Bucshon. Anybody else want to?
    Mr. Repko. And I might offer, for this committee, is that 
NEI and the United States Nuclear Industry Council did a survey 
of 21--or a survey of components we might use in the new 
rulemaking, and 18 of 21 responded back they would not use the 
rule in its current draft.
    So that alone tells you there's opportunity.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes. Sounds like we have a consensus for the 
most part here.
    And Mr. Johnson touched on this, using nuclear for other 
things, other than electricity, right? I mean--and specifically 
hydrogen power, for example, has a lot of potential in the 
near-zero greenhouse gas emissions and certainly a source of 
growth in both the stationary and transportation energy 
sectors.
    Mr. Harrell, can you discuss some of the barriers to 
building reactors that can produce other end products like 
directly using processed heat or hydrogen?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes. We need to take on a few key issues 
there. For example, how do we site a microreactor close to a 
chemical facility or to a steel production facility? How do we 
put those resources next to critical infrastructure to 
distribute hydrogen, for example?
    The existing regulator framework really isn't conducive to 
that. To the NRC's credit, that is one area post-NEMA that they 
are starting to advance. They've done a proposed rule on 
emergency preparedness zones. They've done a proposed rule on a 
generic environmental impact statement, but they haven't voted 
it and moved it forward.
    And so it would be great to see the Commission advance 
those things forward, because it's looking at these issues 
differently.
    Mr. Bucshon. Great. I appreciate that. And I just want to 
say, I know the comments were made that if you had a lot more 
renewables, like solar, for example, that the cost of energy 
would be lower. And the actual fact is that the data shows that 
energy costs would be slightly higher in the short run with 
that situation.
    So I support on an all-of-the-above energy approach, but I 
think the record needs to show that the data is inconclusive 
about if you go all the way to renewables that you are going to 
have lower-cost energy.
    That's just not true. And the other thing is, then you have 
some potential for a grid unreliability and instability, as 
some people have mentioned. But that's why I think this nuclear 
discussion is really critical going forward.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. I will now go to 
Maryland and Mr. Sarbanes, 5 minutes.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to 
thank you and the ranking member for collaborating on this 
hearing today, and I haven't been here as long as some and 
therefore not as focused on this issue as long as some have 
been. But I have been in a kind of listening/learning mode the 
entire time I have been here, which is a little over 16 years 
now, and certainly appreciate the important role in our energy 
portfolio that nuclear power can play.
    There's all kinds of concerns about it. You know what those 
are. Some of those are squarely within the jurisdiction of this 
committee, others are not. But we recognize that this an 
important part of the conversation.
    So I want to thank the members of the panel for being here 
today.
    Dr. Gehin, I am interested in these advanced nuclear 
reactors because whatever little understanding I have of their 
potential encourages me to think that they may solve for some 
of the challenges that we have seen with kind of the larger, 
more traditional fleet of reactors, both in terms of what it 
means for siting, for waste, for cost, et cetera.
    So I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about 
what that potential is?
    Dr. Gehin. Sure.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Maybe point to current examples of where it's 
begun to be deployed, and can one argue that it could change 
the landscape on this or not?
    Dr. Gehin. Sure. Thank you for the question. Yes, one of 
the features that you mentioned, the advanced reactors, they 
tend to be smaller. You know, we're completing these large 
light-water reactors at Vogtle, these are massive construction 
projects.
    As we can shift, for the advanced reactors, from 
construction to manufacturing--we have already mentioned a 
little bit about factory, making more of these in the factory 
where it's more cost effective to do so where you can use all 
of our improvements in manufacturing technology to produce a 
large number of smaller reactors versus a few large reactors. 
There will be benefits.
    It also puts less capital at risk if you're an investor, 
that you're not investing in one giant thing, you're investing 
in a few smaller things, and you can deploy them as you're 
generating revenue from them.
    In terms of the technology itself, higher temperatures 
gives other applications that may generate higher revenue, 
higher-efficiency reactors get more energy out of your reactor 
because it's a higher temperature. You can transfer heat better 
and produce more efficient electricity as well.
    And then the designs tend to have--one of the key safety 
features is they tend to be passively safe, so you have fewer 
systems in these reactors, which will lower their cost.
    Admittedly, the first ones will probably be more expensive, 
but you need to go down that learning curve. So one of the 
objectives there is to build, you know, build several of these. 
get an order book, get committed to building, build more of 
them.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Right. Could you hazard a guess as to, like, 
could you quantify what you think the ultimate allocation of 
the nuclear part of our portfolio might be between the 
traditional larger reactors and these--I mean, could we live in 
a world one day where it's all advanced nuclear reactors or no?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, I mean, I hope we continue to operate our 
current fleet for a long time. So we keep our existing large 
reactors.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Yes. OK.
    Dr. Gehin. There is interest internationally in large 
reactors. Poland's a great example, as they really need to do 
major deployments. I think in the U.S., we'll be deploying 
small modular reactors----
    So you can scale those, those can be larger----
    Mr. Sarbanes. Yes.
    Dr. Gehin [continuing]. Reactors just by scaling the number 
of modules as we build those out. That seems to be where most 
of the interest in--and maybe Mr. Repko can talk about Duke 
specifically and the type of reactors.
    The large reactors, you build them, build them on schedule, 
they operate very well, generating a lot of power, very cost 
effective, but right now we're in a situation where it's 
challenging for us to build those things.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Yes, it's interesting to think about whether 
this sort of time that's passed in terms of making any more 
progress on the legacy kinds of reactors has brought us 
technologically to a place where this new opportunity is more 
available to us.
    Mr. Cohen, can you talk about the climate impact dimension 
of advanced reactors versus--?
    Mr. Cohen. It's a pretty straightforward connection, in my 
mind, which is that if we can deploy these things faster and 
cheaper, we're just going to have a bigger climate impact more 
quickly.
    There's nothing, I mean, it's zero-carbon kilowatt hours--
--
    Mr. Sarbanes. Either way.
    Mr. Cohen. Yes. That's the major issue.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Yes. OK. All right. I think I have run out of 
time. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Appreciate it.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. Now go to Michigan, Mr. 
Walberg for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the 
panel for being here.
    Last week I had the pleasure of touring the Cook Nuclear 
Facility at the west edge of my district on Lake Michigan. I 
also have the Fermi II facility on the other side of my 
district, on Lake Erie, and sadly, we are losing the Palisades 
nuclear facility just north of my district, on Lake Michigan.
    The two plants that are still operating certainly are 
producing enough clean, reliable energy to power millions of 
homes, and they do. At both plants that I have toured, both 
Fermi and Cook, I have seen the incredible safety measures, the 
redundancies, the planning, and the experienced workforce that 
makes those things operate, including having the what Cook 
calls the Fukushima building, where they have all the 
preparations made to handle anything that would come on--not 
expecting it, but prepared nonetheless.
    Instead of being spooked by problems of the past and doing 
away with nuclear power, like our friends in the EU, U.S. 
companies invested time, money, energy, expertise to make this 
essential baseload power source even safer and more effective, 
and we have seen that.
    The energy crisis you see in Europe right now proves which 
decision was right. I am excited about the future of nuclear 
energy with the challenges as well that are there, but I think 
we are also missing an opportunity to preserve and expand our 
existing fleet that we have in place, and so I am glad this 
panel is here today.
    Mr. Gehin and Mr. Repko, you both discussed how to support 
our existing nuclear fleet. Some plants have looked into 
uprating and increased power generation, something we 
significantly need as more and more coal and gas plants are 
forced--I say that clearly--forced to shut down.
    What are the challenges to uprating existing facilities?
    Mr. Repko. I'll go first. I will say--so thank you for the 
question, Congressman. So actually, half of our fleet has 
already been uprated. We've gone through that process already, 
and we are currently evaluating the opportunities for the 
remaining fleet.
    We think collectively we could gain another over 300 
megawatts again of clean, reliable energy. So the process is 
established relative to doing that. It comes off of the 
economics, and as we see it, it's viable and supported by our 
regulators as well.
    Mr. Walberg. Mr. Gehin, what are the challenges?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, let me again add to that. You know, as you 
uprate the power, you need to look at the safety parameters, 
the evaluation of those things. Mr. Repko talked about that. 
That process has been established. You've uprated the plants.
    Occasionally, some plants need upgraded equipment. None of 
those, I would consider, are challenges. The challenge is 
whether the economics makes sense. Fortunately, uprated plants 
probably offer some of the cheapest additional generation that 
you can get because you've already invested in the plant. 
You're getting more out of the existing plant.
    So it's making the economics work. Production tax credits 
could be a benefit there, as well as driving those decisions. 
The technical aspects are similar to what's done in operating 
the plants already in making the safety case.
    Mr. Walberg. Well, let me move on, Mr. Gehin. Flowing from 
that, what should Congress look at to ensure timely licensing 
decisions from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission? Because 
that's part of the big cost, isn't it?
    Dr. Gehin. It is. It definitely is part of the cost, and so 
some of the things I, you know, I outline in my testimony are 
looking at some of the processes of the NRC regarding timelines 
for mandatory hearings. If there are environmental reviews, 
those can be time consumingy, and there's been a number of 
discussion, broadly, on trying to streamline environmental 
reviews for energy deployment.
    You know, some of the processes: internally specifically 
setting timelines at the NRC and trying to enforce those to try 
to move things on efficiently and effectively and to meet the 
expectations of being able to deploy these improvements when 
needed, rather than there being delays in those processes.
    So some of these aspects of how the NRC does business could 
be looked at, and there could be improvement there.
    Mr. Walberg. My final 25 seconds. Any of you could answer 
this if you would like to hop in. Fermi has a license that they 
spent a lot of time, money, and effort to get, but they don't 
think they probably will ever use it.
    Is there a scenario where building one becomes financially 
viable at a site like Fermi?
    Mr. Repko. So are you asking in terms of new nuclear, or 
extending Fermi?
    Mr. Walberg. This is new. This is a third license, and it 
appears that my time has expired. So I will have to yield 
back----
    Mr. Repko. So we certainly see it for our fleet. So I think 
there could be lessons learned.
    Mr. Walberg. OK. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. And we are hoping those licenses get renewed, I 
can tell you, because one of those is Oconee Nuclear Station.
    I will go to California, Mr. Cardenas for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
the book.
    I commend this committee for convening this discussion, 
which should be happening far more often than it does, but at 
least we are here today.
    I am hopeful this is something we can continue to make 
progress on in a bipartisan manner going forward. Nuclear 
currently accounts for nearly half of the zero-carbon 
electricity generated in the United States and, if done safely, 
could play a role in our efforts to address the climate crisis 
that we are in today.
    However, I have serious concerns about the effects nuclear 
waste has on the health and safety of the communities living in 
proximity within it. Inequities and exposure to pollution are 
already persistent across our great country, and as we consider 
nuclear we need to consider and address the legacy of toxic 
waste associated with this source of energy so as not to 
recreate, reinforce, or worsen environmental injustices upon 
communities in our country.
    Mr. Repko, of the nuclear plants that operate in the United 
States, how has low-level and high-level waste been dealt with 
and managed, and how has the safety, health, and security of 
nearby communities been impacted?
    Mr. Repko. Yes, Mr. Gehin might be better to answer that 
one.
    Mr. Cardenas. Sure. Absolutely.
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, I mean, currently, when you look at the 
used nuclear fuel, that's stored in the spent fuel pool moved 
to dry storage, which I think is the preferred longer-term 
storage, until we work on this consolidated interim storage, 
you know, I think to your point, trying to move to a central 
location. Those storage containers are incredibly robust. I 
don't know if you happen to visit a nuclear plant and see them, 
but that's pretty well established.
    The low-level waste? I think there are standard commercial 
processes that handle that. I'm not as familiar in that aspect 
of an operation of a plant, but those are usually processed out 
pretty quickly, the way I understand it, and moved to a low-
level waste disposal facility.
    And so the longer the material stays at the site, and in 
many of these sites, after operation, tends to be the used fuel 
that we're looking at this consolidated storage.
    Mr. Cardenas. So if you can continue on high-level waste. 
How long would that waste need to be in that dry-level storage? 
How many years?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, I mean, it will need to stay in that high-
level storage until there's a geologic repository developed, 
and this is the discussion today.
    Mr. Cardenas. So today, how long have they been in storage, 
of the facilities that have been active in the United States to 
this day?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. Since we don't have a geologic repository, 
we've been storing that since, you know, the original fuel is 
being stored in those. For some plants that are 40 years old--
maybe Mr. Repko can comment--but for 40 years, these canisters 
have been designed, I think, for in excess of 100 years, maybe 
even longer than that.
    And so they're designed for very long-term storage, even 
though that's not the ultimate solution.
    Mr. Cardenas. Got it. Yes?
    Mr. Repko. Yes, I would say the same. I mean, the casts are 
very robust. They have very extensive design basis relative to 
the Transportation Acts that's in vehicle, rail, fire, all 
those kind of aspects, but to the point made, all of the 
original fuel is still maintained.
    We have even had to go so far as to ship used fuel to our 
other nuclear locations to maintain room in our spent fuel 
pools for some of our sites. So it's a problem that needs to be 
addressed.
    Mr. Cardenas. Yes. So my point is this: Looking at nuclear 
facilities as a whole, 360 degrees as a whole, yes, it's a 
cleaner fuel on the front end, but at the same time there's a 
byproduct that we still need to solve long term to make sure 
that the safety and the efficacy of the facility and also the 
people potentially being affected long term is actually solved.
    So we are still working on solving those issues, right?
    Mr. Repko. I completely agree. Those issues need to be 
addressed. I will say there are radiological controls relative 
to this high-level waste. The design of the cask is built to 
attenuate those kind of aspects of it as well.
    I think there's perhaps a valuable perspective. You take 
all of the high-level nuclear waste that's been generated for 
operating our reactors in the U.S.
    Mr. Cardenas. OK.
    Mr. Repko. This is back to the '50s, it would be a volume 
of roughly a football field 30 feet high. That is the total 
volume of nuclear high-level used fuel waste that we're looking 
at.
    So in terms of solving this problem, it should give a 
perspective. It's quite solvable.
    Mr. Cardenas. It is quite solvable, but you actually put it 
in the perspective of how much volume there is so far, but if 
we are going to have nuclear facilities going forward, we are 
going to have more than that one football field size. But so my 
point is, I think that we need to have longer discussion about 
how will we make sure that long term, 360 degrees, how we can 
actually make sure that this is not only a cleaner fuel but 
also a safer fuel.
    Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. And now I will go to 
Alabama to Mr. Palmer, 5 minutes.
    Mr. Palmer. Thanks, Chairman. I want to get a little deeper 
into the whole issue of the nuclear fuel issue and the safety, 
particularly the next-generation nuclear.
    I have been looking at what France has done, and they have 
very tight legislation and a very strong regulatory body, which 
I think you have to have, but I think the real key to the 
safety and efficiency of the French nuclear fleet is the 
standardization of their design.
    It's almost cookie cutter. And the interesting thing about 
this--and this is what I would like to talk to my colleagues 
across the aisle about--is France recycles what we have always 
considered spent fuel rods. I think that they are able to 
recover up to 96 percent of reusable material, and what is 
left, I think, can be used for other purposes.
    So it largely solves our issue of spent fuel, and I would 
like for your comment on this, Mr. Harrell?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes. Thank you for the question, Congressman.
    There is an opportunity in spent fuel management, right? We 
can use the spent fuel repositories for productive use. You 
underscore a really key point. Ninety-five percent of the 
energy in that spent fuel is being wasted. It's just sitting 
onsite, and so advanced reactors (1) could burn some of that 
resource as their fuel, and recycling is a huge opportunity.
    We see it abroad. We should invest in that. There are a lot 
of exciting companies that are USNIC members who are working in 
that space, like Oklo and Curio, for example, and so it's 
something we should explore moving forward.
    RPE has recently done a program to explore recycling as 
well. I really think it is an opportunity. I wish Mr. Cardenas 
had stuck around, because new nuclear could actually reduce our 
spent fuel----
    Mr. Palmer. Well, I promise you that when they are back in 
here, I will remind him of it repeatedly.
    Mr. Gehin, I just wonder, with the amount of spent nuclear 
fuel that we have right now that we are trying to deal with, 
how many--I know this is a crazy question--but how many units 
do you think that would fuel and for how long if we wanted to 
use all of that? Because it doesn't take a lot.
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, it's a--thank you for the very good 
question. I actually did that calculation. If you just look at 
the spent fuel, which is not all the material I have--I'll 
comment on that in a minute--use that in a particular type of 
reactor such as we're developing, you could provide all the 
electricity for the U.S. for well over 100 years.
    That's a lot of power.
    Mr. Palmer. Just using up what we have?
    Dr. Gehin. That's using the used fuel.
    Mr. Palmer. Yes
    Dr. Gehin. Now, in making that rich uranium, we also have 
depleted uranium that we produce, and there's a lot of that as 
well. That could also be fuel if we choose to use it.
    So in terms of fuel supply, if we choose to go that 
direction, we do the research and develop that technology, 
there's a lot of fuel available. Now, that's a longer-term 
endeavor to get to that point, but----
    Mr. Palmer. Yes, but it largely takes care of the issue of 
what we are having to do, in terms of storage and sending 
billions of dollars----
    Dr. Gehin. We would still have disposal of radioactive 
waste or fission products----
    Mr. Palmer. Right.
    Dr. Gehin [continuing]. And other things. So you still 
would need disposal, but the scale would be lower.
    Mr. Palmer. And Mr. Cohen, I really appreciate your answers 
to the questions, and particularly in regard to renewables. And 
I'm one of these all-of-the-above, but I also understand that 
variability issue, but I also understand the physics. And you 
touched on the physics a little bit, and we are not going to 
have an order of magnitude leap forward in terms of power 
generation from renewables, because we are pretty close to 
their maximum efficiency.
    But when you compare it to next-generation nuclear, as I 
understand it, there are a couple of advantages that Next Gen 
nuclear would have over renewables. One would be the physical 
land use. I think you can put one nuclear facility on 640 
acres, 1 square mile, and it would take about--it would 
generate the same amount of power, from a turbine farm, it 
would take about 77,000 acres.
    But the other thing that I want to address--and you other 
guys can answer this; I've only got a few seconds left--is that 
a Next Gen nuclear facility would probably operate 24/7 except 
when it's shut down for maintenance. And it would operate for 
80 years plus, which Lord knows what the technology will be by 
then.
    Whereas the turbine, the average turbine, I think, starts 
losing generating capacity after 10 years, and it's pretty much 
done after 25 to 30, and right now we are not able to recycle 
the blades.
    I would just--for you guys, all four of you, in the little 
bit of time left to respond to that.
    Mr. Harrell. In my testimony, there is a comparison, and it 
doesn't even take into account the longevity of nuclear, it 
just says head-to-head nuclear is, in terms of material 
consumption--cement, steel, all of the critical minerals, you 
know--many orders of magnitude smaller than--it's very compact, 
and that's one of the great advantages.
    So resource efficiency, hands down.
    Mr. Palmer. Mr. Chairman, I think this has been a very 
constructive hearing. I am very grateful that we have held it, 
and I appreciate the comments from my colleagues across the 
aisle. I think we are at a place where we can have agreement 
and work together and get some things done.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. And I 
recognize the gentlewoman from the State of Washington, Ms. 
Schrier, for her 5 minutes.
    Mr. Schrier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, let me just 
thank all of the witnesses today and say how refreshing it is 
to have such a bipartisan committee hearing where everybody in 
this room is looking at how we can employ nuclear in a safe way 
to give us the baseload that we need to power our communities.
    I also want to say that it was really pretty exciting to 
hear my Republican colleague talk about recycling. So I am 
eager to get started.
    Let me first say, also, that I am very supportive of 
integrating nuclear energy into our energy portfolio. That 
includes bringing advanced nuclear to Washington State.
    Washington only has one nuclear plant right now, the 
Columbia generating station. It produces about 12 percent of 
our State's electricity with only a 1.7-square-mile footprint, 
which meets, in addition to hydropower, our baseload needs and 
avoids a tremendous amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
    So by expanding our nuclear portfolio in addition to the 
hydropower we have--but in many States that don't have that, 
this is baseload--we can really better integrate other 
renewables and wean ourselves off of fossil fuels.
    According to the Pacific Northwest, its National Lab 
benefits of small modular reactors and other advanced reactors 
are expected to help reduce economic, security, technical, 
perceived safety, and regulatory barriers associated with 
nuclear power, which could then help establish new nuclear 
power throughout the country.
    Mr. Harrell, I am going to direct this first question to 
you. You know, whenever we talk about a change in energy 
portfolio, there is anxiety about what will happen to people 
working in a different part of that industry at any given time, 
for example, coal that is on the decline.
    But according to the 2023 Department of Energy ``Pathways 
to Commercial Liftoff: Advanced Nuclear'' report, advanced 
small modular reactors can create about 230 permanent onsite 
jobs per gigawatt.
    The report--and I will need some translation of how that 
breaks down, what kind of jobs those are, but the report also 
found that the median nuclear industry wage is the highest in 
the energy industry.
    So coupled with the possibility of transitioning existing 
coal plant sites to advanced nuclear, this could be a boom, in 
terms of employment opportunities. I was wondering how we can 
work with industry and labor to improve nuclear workforce 
development, where those jobs are, and how we can expand.
    Mr. Harrell. Yes. That's a great question. Thank you, 
Congresswoman. And a lot of exciting things happening in 
Washington State in the advanced nuclear space, and so you're 
exactly right: The U.S. supply chain already employs half a 
million Americans. They are good, high-paying jobs. And you 
know, I think we see, in advanced nuclear, some major 
opportunities.
    I'll just give you the example, the TerraPower Natrium 
project. They are headquartered there in Bellevue, Washington, 
but building their first project in Wyoming. It's going to 
create 2,000 construction jobs and then support 250 full-time 
employees.
    And a lot of those employees are going to transition from 
the coal plant that had retired there. I was talking a little 
bit earlierr, they're separating the nuclear island verse the 
powerplant functions. That way there's kind of a direct 
translation between the people who are working at the coal 
plant who could then work in that powerplant function with 
minimal training.
    I think assets like the National Labs and some of the 
universities who are making a big push here--we're seeing 
universities, like Abilene Christian, for example, is a USNIC 
member, that are building a research reactor on their campus 
and then really ramping up their nuclear energy program.
    And so things like that, I think, are really forward-
leaning policies. And some of the universities in Washington 
State have done the same.
    Mr. Schrier. Thank you. I think that provides a great 
degree of comfort when these anxieties about transitions come 
up. I just wanted to thank you and in the remaining moments 
wanted to underscore this bipartisan support.
    I am excited to work with my colleagues. I also look 
forward to engaging with my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle and in the Senate, with the recent introduction of the 
Bipartisan Advance Act.
    So thank you very much, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentlelady. And now I will go to 
Mr. Curtis for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ms. Ranking Member.
    You know, I just have to think that anybody that cares 
about affordable, reliable, clean energy has to be very excited 
about today's hearing.
    This is, I think, a big deal for us and Mr. Chairman and 
Ranking Member, please, my appreciation for pulling this 
together and having this productive conversation. And I am so 
pleased that it is fair to have questions about nuclear. I 
think that is great that questions are coming out.
    I personally believe there is not a single one of these 
obstacles that the industry can't overcome and tackle, and I 
regret that it seems like we have taken almost a couple decades 
out of innovation of this for a number of reasons we won't go 
in today, but I have no doubt had we had our head in the game 
for a long time, all of these things would have been resolved.
    A couple of thoughts quickly. I am from Utah. We have a 
UAMPS. It's an organization--you are nodding your heads, you 
are probably familiar with them. They have been engaged in 
trying to license a small nuclear reactor for a decade. They 
have spent about $100 million, and they are halfway through the 
process.
    Almost overwhelming, particularly if nuclear is really 
going to be part of our energy mix going forward. How can this 
be, right? This is clearly not acceptable if we are going to 
make nuclear a major part of what we are doing.
    I am also fortunate, PacifiCorp, Rocky Mountain Power in my 
district is working with Mr. Buffett on a very unique concept 
to put a nuclear plant that would actually be positioned in 
Wyoming; ironically, both of these would be in Wyoming.
    But, Ms. Schrier, I am really pleased that part of their 
process is to look at previous coal plants where they have 
closed down, that are perfect homes for these small nuclear 
reactors. They have the transmission lines, and it is a really 
good answer.
    Most answers for these towns haven't really worked. This is 
an answer that I think would be very helpful and would work 
and, quite frankly, they would welcome this facility into their 
neighborhood.
    A couple questions, like, how do we help these early 
adopters, these early movers, right? How do we encourage this? 
I actually had a bill that would authorize the Secretary of 
Energy to make targeted awards to cover the regulatory costs of 
first technologies.
    Jeremy, you are nodding your head. Do you want to weigh in 
on this? How do we start this thing?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes. It's a great question, Congressman. It's 
great to see you,and you underscore this kind of crazy 
scenario, right?
    NuScale, NuScale itself, beyond UAMPS, had to spend $500 
million in 5 years to get their design certification. The 
customer, UAMPS, is then spending another insane amount of 
resources. That's not feasible for a municipal co-op or 
organization along----
    Mr. Curtis. Or anybody.
    Mr. Harrell [continuing]. Or anyone, frankly, right? And so 
that is why it's important to have prizes, for example, to help 
early movers go through the process.
    The entire industry is benefiting from what NuScale did to 
go through the process first. They should get support, and they 
did from the Federal Government going through it. It's why tax 
incentives and having those be refundable, so municipals or co-
ops can use it to deploy their first project in programs like 
the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, because, as we 
mentioned, folks want to be project two, three, or four, but we 
need those pioneers, the folks like UAMPS, to be successful so 
that we unlock the scaleup of these technologies.
    Mr. Curtis. Yes. Big shout out to them, right, for trying?
    Mr. Harrell. One hundred percent.
    Mr. Curtis. I wish I had time to hear from all of you. Let 
me kind of switch gears just a little bit. Where does uranium 
come from to do this? My district has a uranium mill that is 
constantly under attack. We are dependent on China, right, for 
this and other places outside the United States.
    How do we change that dynamic to where we are not dependent 
for uranium? Anybody want to--and I need a short answer.
    Yes, Mr. Gehin, please.
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, I'll talk a little bit about that. One of 
the things that was talked about a little bit earlier, you 
know, about there being enough demand to make this economically 
feasible to mine uranium.
    Uranium has been very cheap for a while, internationally 
selling at low prices. So we need this demand signal for this.
    Mr. Curtis. And I'm so out of time. So let me just push it 
along a little bit.
    Dr. Gehin. OK.
    Mr. Curtis. Like processing too, right? We got to talk 
about not just mining it.
    Dr. Gehin. It's the whole supply chain.
    Mr. Curtis. Processing it.
    Dr. Gehin. Mining, processing, conversion.
    Mr. Curtis. Yes. Now, also this PacifiCorp project is going 
to produce hydrogen. Jeremy, will you talk about real quick 
about how important it is to not forget hydrogen as part of 
this, and are we offering the right incentives for that?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes, absolutely. I think it's why permitting 
reform is really important. We're going to need to build out a 
hydrogen distribution infrastructure because of the production 
that's going to be happening at exciting sites, like our 
nuclear facilities.
    Mr. Curtis. I'm out of time. Thank you all for coming. 
Thank you for having this hearing. I would just end with: I 
have heard--and nod your head if you think it's true--that 
nuclear is actually one of our safest forms of energy, all 
things said?
    The big incidences we all hear about, right, but we forget 
how many people's lives have been lost in other forms of 
energy. So despite its reputation, this is actually very safe.
    And Mr. Chairman, I regrettably yield my time.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman.
    Members votes are going to be called at 5. We are going to 
continue and just work right through it. We will swap the Chair 
out here, but when votes are called, if you feel like going to 
vote, come straight back. It's one vote, so we are just going 
to move through.
    The Chair will now go to Arizona, Ms. Lesko, who has the 
largest nuclear power facility in her district, and for 5 
minutes.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Yes, just outside of my district is Palo Verde Nuclear 
Plant. So I am very proud about that.
    We have talked a lot about needing new sources for uranium 
and nuclear fuel, especially if we are going to expand and have 
more modular nuclear reactors, and that we are too reliant on 
Russia for nuclear fuel and crucial isotopes.
    And so, Mr. Harrell, what are your thoughts on recycling 
nuclear waste?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes. Thank you, Congresswoman, for the 
question, and Palo Verde was the very first nuclear facility I 
ever visited.
    Mrs. Lesko. Good.
    Mr. Harrell. So it really is a gem in the fleet.
    Recycling is a huge opportunity, right? We should 
absolutely be investing in research and development and 
exploring it as an option. It can both reduce our spent fuel 
reserves and increase our own fuel security by turning that 
spent fuel into product that we can use.
    Mrs. Lesko. And what do you think the obstacles are to 
recycling waste?
    Mr. Harrell. Some of it is just political gumption. You 
know, I think the DOE is not restricted on exploring that 
option. We heard Rita Baranwal, the Assistant Secretary of 
Nuclear Energy in the Trump administration, talk about it 
regularly.
    RPE is doing some public/private partnerships with 
companies at the moment. I think we need to explore. There's 
absolutely nonproliferation concerns that need to be taken into 
account, but Japan has solved for those issues with the IAEA, 
as have the French and others. It's absolutely a manageable 
situation and, frankly, an opportunity that we're squandering 
at the moment.
    Mrs. Lesko. And how about the cost? Is it too costly?
    Mr. Harrell. The fuel that would be produced from a 
recycling would be more costly than, for the lack of a better 
way of putting it, green fuel production, but what you do need 
to factor in is the cost liability of spent fuel that we have, 
right?
    Mrs. Lesko. Right.
    Mr. Harrell. Someone earlier was talking about the millions 
of Federal taxpayer dollars that have been used because we 
don't have a long-term repository. The offset of that cost to 
the Federal Government needs to be considered in the price as 
well.
    Mrs. Lesko. All right. My next question is to any of the 
witnesses. Today I just met with electric cooperatives from 
Arizona, and they were very concerned about making sure they 
have reliable electricity on the grid.
    One of the electric co-ops said they were now down to one 
coal plant and that they were having a really hard time getting 
batteries for energy storage for the solar, that they were 
waiting now for 2 years. They haven't been able to get it. The 
supply chains are terrible, costs are going up.
    And we are spending, in the United States, billions of 
dollars on subsidies for solar and wind energy. And I was 
wondering what your thoughts are and if we should divert some 
of those subsidies to nuclear. That's my question.
    Mr. Cohen?
    Mr. Cohen. We're going to need it all. I mean, we'll be 
lucky if we have a lot of nuclear and a lot of solar and get to 
where we need to go.
    I just don't think we can do this as a zero sum. It's 
certainly true that nuclear is not being rewarded in the 
marketplace for its characteristics. So you often get this 
false comparison and people say, ``Well, solar is 3 or 4 cents 
and nuclear is 7 or 8,'' you know. Well, that's just on a 
straight kilowatt-hour basis, it doesn't account for 
reliability.
    So there's some things that can be fixed in State 
regulation to make that happen. I don't know that you'd call 
that a subsidy. I'd call that recognizing the value, and if we 
could sort that out I think we'd get a long way towards, we 
certainly wouldn't be seeing plants shut down like they are 
right now.
    But I don't think there's a silver bullet here, honestly. I 
think tripling the electric supply in the U.S. all zero-carbon 
is going to need everything we've got and more.
    Mrs. Lesko. Anyone else?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. Maybe I would totally agree with that. I 
also think making sure nuclear is included as part of the 
option set. You know, in some places I suspect it's not yet 
because of the, you know, the concerns about risks, actually 
completing projects.
    So as we see these advanced reactors develop, that create 
more opportunities to include it in integrated resource plans 
and things like that.
    Mrs. Lesko. All right. Thank you. And I yield back--oh.
    Mr. Harrell. The last thing I'll add is I'm confident that 
new nuclear is going to compete in the commercial marketplace 
without these types of incentives, eventually. I think they are 
critical for these first movers, to do their first-of-a-kind 
deployment, but as we scale these, mass produce them and 
deploy, I think we're going to see a very similar situation to 
what we saw with U.S. natural gas that's going to be really 
attractive in U.S. electricity markets and globally from a 
price affordability and security standpoint.
    Mrs. Lesko. Well, great. I am looking forward to seeing 
what happens at the Idaho National Laboratories on the modular 
reactor and see if we can replicate it and use it.
    It's exciting, and thank you all for being here for now 3 
hours without leaving the table. I really appreciate all of 
your expertise. And I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. I will now go to 
Mr. Pence from Indiana.
    Mr. Pence. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member 
DeGette, for holding this meeting, bipartisan meeting. And 
thank you to the witnesses being here today.
    And I echo my peers. I don't know how you sit there for 
that many hours. I could never do that.
    You know, in the Hoosier State, innovators are leading the 
way to power the next generation of nuclear energy. Purdue 
University is a national leader in nuclear engineering programs 
and home to the country's first and only fully digitized 
nuclear reactor used to train students in research, cyber-
physical protection.
    Purdue has also undergone extensive collaboration with Duke 
Energy to study opportunities to use next-generation small 
modular reactors to power their campus. Rolls-Royce, in 
Indianapolis, is advancing their reactor designs for 
transportable small modular reactor design to provide 470 
megawatts of baseload power.
    While Indiana currently does not have nuclear assets 
powering our grid, the State legislature has begun paving the 
way for utilities to deploy advanced nuclear reactors across 
our State. We are looking forward to it.
    Mr. Repko, earlier this year I had the opportunity to meet 
with DOE Assistant Secretary Dr. Huff and Duke Energy at Purdue 
University as you collaborate with the school on a joint 
feasibility study to bring nuclear power to their campus.
    The joint effort from Purdue and Duke made several 
important policy recommendations to accelerate commercial 
deployment of advanced reactor technologies. In particular, one 
recommendation focused on a university-led consortium of 
industry leaders and researches for advanced nuclear convergent 
manufacturing, qualification of manufacturing components, and 
workforce development.
    In order to bridge the gap of commercialization for small 
modular reactors, research universities are well positioned to 
utilize advanced technologies and expertise in material science 
to assist the deployment and operation of small modular 
reactors.
    Can you speak, sir, about the importance of your company's 
collaboration with Purdue University and the potential benefits 
for implementing a public/private consortium, including the 
universities, for convergent manufacturing and workforce 
development?
    Mr. Repko. Yes, Congressman. And thank you, thank you for 
the opportunity to comment.
    So we have been working with Purdue, as you said, and we 
very much valued those interactions. Purdue is an engineering 
leader, and we very much appreciate their interest in small 
modular reactor technologies.
    So, you know, I would offer that, you know, the 
recommendation around the consortium is really at the heart of 
what we've been talking about collectively here, right?
    All of the different aspects of risk, some of the technical 
challenges, the environmental considerations, the workforce and 
supply chain--it's going to take more than just a one singular-
type solution set around that.
    Granted, it's going to be necessary, in terms of that 
market signal, to get the rest moving, but that's only going to 
be the start. So I think that framework gives us the 
opportunity to look broader around all of the aspects that will 
enable small modular reactors for Purdue University and beyond.
    Mr. Pence. Yes. I think as Mr. Harrell said, you know, 
being able to deliver projects on time, you know, you need the 
workforce, educated workforce in this space. And I know that 
Purdue is dedicated to that.
    Dr. Gehin, in your testimony you mentioned Project Pele, an 
innovative microreactor that holds tremendous potential to 
advance military and civil capabilities. Rolls-Royce, who has 
facilities in Indianapolis, has partnered with the DoD for 
microreactor development through Project Pele.
    Can you take a moment to speak to the importance of this 
project and the steps you are taking to bring this innovation 
to the commercial market?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Yes. 
Project Pele is the Department of Defense project to develop a 
mobile microreactor. It's a pilot project.
    The reactor is being designed and developed by BWXT with 
Rolls-Royce and other partners, as you mentioned. It will be 
tested at Idaho National Laboratory. We have a large site able 
to do tests, so the plans are to test it there. The fuel that's 
used for that was technology developed through DOE R&D 
programs, TRISO Fuel as well.
    So the research is being led, the technologies that will go 
into that reactor. And then as that reactor is developed and 
tested, it will be authorized by the Department of Energy.
    So with all the discussion on regulation, it's taking a 
little different path, because----
    Mr. Pence. So that's the timeline in----
    Dr. Gehin [continuing]. It's very appropriate to----
    Mr. Pence [continuing]. In innovation?
    Dr. Gehin [continuing]. Do that and, in a quick timeline, 
get that demonstrated with the goal of this is the first, you 
know, we talked about the first mover. This should lead to 
further developments in this space.
    Mr. Pence. OK. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. I 
yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Mr. Pence. I will now go to Mr. 
Weber from Texas.
    Mr. Weber. Thank you. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman.
    For those of you who don't know when I was in the Texas 
legislature, I had the South Texas nuclear project in my 
district, and it's about 35 so miles from my district now, from 
the county line.
    We were there in 2010 and watched them change out spent 
fuel rods with their own isotopes. It's a fascinating--they 
could do it cleanly, they could do it safely.
    I was encouraged to see that you were having a discussion 
with Congresswoman DeGette and Congressman Cardenas about 
nuclear waste. Are any of you all aware of any waste control 
specialists in West Texas, at Andrews, Texas? Dr. Gehin is, and 
you are, Mr. Harrell?
    But the other two are not. Have either of you all been 
there? I have been there. I was on the environmental reg 
committee in the Texas legislature. It's a fascinating 
facility. It's so huge and so big and so intense. Of course, I 
get that that's low level.
    So we ought to be focused on their concerns that they 
legitimately raised. What do we do with some of that waste? 
First of all, reprocessing and using as much of it as we could 
is what I think the best alternative.
    Mr. Cohen, I am going to go to you. Can you talk more about 
how nuclear waste recycling can be a solution to the problem? 
Storing waste and a way to produce valuable fuel and isotopes?
    Mr. Cohen. I don't consider myself an expert on that, 
Congressman Weber, to be fair. I'd like to get back----
    Mr. Weber. You know, an expert's just someone who is 50 
miles from home.
    Mr. Cohen. OK. Fair enough. You know, I think clearly 
there's the opportunity to harvest the remaining energy value 
in the fuel, for sure. I do think that it's sometimes--we had 
an earlier back-and-forth about whether you're really reducing 
a lot of the volume, and that's debatable. You can certainly 
reduce the total amount, but whether it's an order of magnitude 
or not is another question.
    I really think I ought to defer to the scientists on the 
platform regarding the harvesting of the other----
    Mr. Weber. Is it ``Jee-in''? How do you say your last name?
    Dr. Gehin. ``Jee-in.''
    Mr. Weber. Mr. Gehin, to you.
    Dr. Gehin. Thank you. Yes, we've been doing research on 
recycling for a long time. In fact, we are recycling fuel at 
Idaho National Laboratory from the EBR 2 reactor to produce 
HALEU, so there's real value to that. So we have a lot of 
expertise.
    The question is, I think the questions around this have 
been, right, is it economic to do so? And it hasn't been, 
because uranium has been very inexpensive and then, you know, 
can you factor in the benefits addressing the back end?
    So the studies that we've done, if you do full continuous 
recycle, which you keep recycling through the reactors, you 
potentially get to an order of magnitude less spent fuel and 
high-level waste, because you're burning things and turning it 
into shorter-lived things.
    That's a long-term endeavor. You can do limited 
intermediate recycle. There's some benefits to that. So there's 
a range of options. I think the real need is to do research to 
improve the economics as well as research on ensuring we can 
deploy it confidently, in terms of proliferation risk, if we 
deploy this broadly.
    So those are the types of areas that need to be looked at.
    Mr. Weber. So you said you had been, are you are of waste 
control specialists out in----
    Dr. Gehin. Yes.
    Mr. Weber [continuing]. In Andrews County, Texas?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes.
    Mr. Weber. Have you been there?
    Dr. Gehin. I haven't been there, unfortunately. I would 
love to visit there.
    Mr. Weber. You have not been there? Well, just for the 
benefit of our friends across the aisle and our team here too, 
South Texas nuclear project basically took and sent, showed 
videos of how they store--some of you all are talking about 
waste in a canister. I forget, was that you, Dr. Gehin?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes.
    Mr. Weber. OK.
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. It's moved from the spent fuel, dried, put 
in canisters, and what you'll see is a concrete pad with these 
cylinders on it----
    Mr. Weber. Right. Well, back then in 2010, what we saw was 
they would take that canister, they didn't put waste in it. 
This was testing of the canisters to show how viable they were 
and how strong. They put it on a flatbed railcar, and they ran 
that railcar into a solid concrete wall, and it just--railcar 
just went to pieces, wheels came off it, and it rolled, the 
chains holding the canister broke, canister goes out spinning, 
you know, on the ground wherever it was. Canister stayed 
intact. We can store this stuff safely.
    Thoughts on the Yucca Mountain? I will stay with you, Dr. 
G., for my last 40 seconds.
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. So, obviously, Yucca Mountain is I'll call 
it a political issue. It's been investigated extensively for 
spent fuel storage. It hasn't gone through the full regulatory 
process. There could be value in doing that, of course, to 
understand if it could be a viable place
    But from a--the way I understand it, I'm a scientist. I 
think this is in the political space.
    Mr. Weber. So it's a political science, but you don't want 
to get in that realm? I got it. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Curtis [presiding]. Thank you. The gentleman yields. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Allen.
    Mr. Allen. Thank you, Chairman, and I appreciate Chair 
Duncan holding this important hearing to discuss the critical 
needs, which we talked about, in expanding nuclear energy and 
really an all-out energy program for this country.
    We know that our energy needs are going to increase 
dramatically, and I think nuclear energy is going to play and 
it will play a big part of that, because it's clean, 
affordable, safe, and we got to work towards solutions to 
expand the use of commercial nuclear energy to be energy 
dominant, as we were just a few years ago.
    In my district, we have plant Vogtle, where Units 3 and 4 
are currently under construction. It's well known that these 
are the first nuclear reactors under construction in the United 
States in more than 30 years.
    Currently in operation are Units 1 and 2, which power more 
than 500,000 homes and businesses. Unit 3 is expected to come 
online in the next few months, and Unit 4 is expected to come 
online towards the beginning of next year.
    Unit 3 actually hit a milestone in April, as Unit 3 
recently generated electricity on the grid, and it's connected 
to the grid. Once both Units 3 and 4 come online, Plant Vogtle 
will be the largest single generator of clean energy in the 
United States.
    This is a huge accomplishment for nuclear energy in 
America, and I'm proud that it is being done in my home 
district. I am hopeful that we can use what we have learned in 
constructing Plant Vogtle to further expand our nuclear energy.
    I also want to shout out a big thanks to Southern Company 
and their perseverance through multiple challenges to finish 
the construction of these important facilities.
    Mr. Gehin, we have learned a lot about what it takes to 
build large-scale nuclear reactors from Plant Vogtle. Units 3 
and 4 cost more than anticipated, and when seeing projects of 
this size and cost, companies may be wary, and we have talked 
about the investment risk in building large-scale nuclear 
reactors.
    So how can we use lessons of Plant Vogtle to help build 
future facilities to better predict investment cost and capital 
risk?
    Dr. Gehin. Right. Thank you for the question, and 
congratulations on these plants.
    Mr. Allen. Thank you.
    Dr. Gehin. A lot of times you learn the most from things 
that maybe don't go well, and you take those lessons learned. 
So there's plenty here to take from this regarding construction 
planning, finalization to design, probably input there on 
regulatory processes. So this will be a case study on those and 
taking that to future nuclear plants.
    I also think, in addition to the Vogtle plants, there are 
other plants that are being built in the world and are being 
done well, and we can take lessons learned from them.
    One of the lessons learned is you really want to build a 
pipeline of these reactors. So you take the lessons from Vogtle 
3 and 4, carry those on to the next one. So it's kind of 
unfortunate that we're not continuing to build more of these.
    The experience has been in United Arab Emirates, for 
example, where they built four units that the labor 
productivity on Units 3 and 4 was double that on Units 1 and 2. 
And so there was sort of the cost of doing business in Vogtle 3 
and 4 that could have benefited the next units, and 
unfortunately we're not going to be doing that.
    So we'll have to take that to other reactors that are being 
designed and built.
    Mr. Weber. And I agree with that, because it's almost like 
over that 30 years, we had a few people around that had 
actually built reactors and could understand exactly the unique 
construction application there.
    Will any of these issues that we have seen, as far as labor 
force and training and that sort of thing and inefficiency in 
module fabrication that caused the challenges at Vogtle 3, be 
issues for these small modular reactor generation reactors, Mr. 
Gehin?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. And so if we don't learn the lessons, they 
could be. Fortunately, we are learning the lessons. The other 
aspect is on the smaller reactors, as I mentioned earlier, 
we're shifting more to factory fabrication, which has also 
reduced those risks.
    Also the fact that they're smaller, puts less at risk at 
any one time. So it's maybe more tolerable.
    Mr. Allen. Well, I am out of time. Thank you all for being 
here, and with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Curtis. The gentleman yields. The Chair recognizes Mr. 
Balderson.
    Mr. Balderson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That was quick.
    Thank you all for being here today and for your patience. 
My first question is for Dr. Gehin. In your testimony you 
mentioned the schedule and fees structures should be reflective 
of the scale and complexity of the reactor designs.
    How could the fee structure be improved to encourage 
reactor demonstrations and investments?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. So some thoughts on that. First of all--and 
the question I got from the chairman related to the fraction of 
cost for a plant--obviously, if you're building a large plant, 
that's different than if you're building, say, a 10-megawatt 
microreactor, where you really need to minimize those for fees 
and costs.
    This should be right-sized to the risk, it should be a 
risk-informed approach based on the size of the reactor. There 
are also costs and fees of just entering into the regulatory 
process through preapplication meetings, things like that.
    That could also be the offset to lower a barrier to 
entering that regulatory process.
    Mr. Balderson. I'm somewhat caught off guard here, so hold 
on. You're next.
    And Mr. Bucshon asked part of my question on the 53 issue, 
that's why I am kind of jumping around here. But Mr. Harrell, 
thank you.
    There is a significant market for nuclear energy abroad, 
obviously, and we have talked about that all afternoon. We have 
talked about the trip. I was part of the CODEL that we went 
with my colleague and friend Mr. Pfluger. China, Russia, 
Poland, they all are at a pretty good place. We do know about 
the issue that just happened with Germany being shut down.
    How imperative is it that the United States continues to 
lead the way in developing these new, innovative technologies?
    Mr. Harrell. It's an imperative, as I discussed a little 
bit, it's not a zero-sum game here. The countries who are 
interested in nuclear here, if the U.S. doesn't partner with 
them, it doesn't mean they're not going to pursue nuclear, it 
just means they're going to do with China or Russia, most 
likely, or maybe other international competitors, but the U.S. 
really has the position to seize this opportunity.
    Some of our friends at Third Way and Energy for Growth Hub 
did an analysis that by 2050 the global nuclear market could be 
$360 billion annually. That's a market that we want to seize 
economically here, right? And we have cutting-edge designs. Our 
entrepreneurs are ready to come to the commercial market space.
    And so let's get the economic benefits, let's get the 
energy security benefits and ultimately forge these centurylong 
partnerships with some of these allies rather than China and 
Russia.
    Mr. Balderson. OK. Thank you. I have spoken at previous 
hearings about the global environment benefits of exporting our 
clean natural gas, especially to these developing nations.
    Can you discuss the possible environmental benefits that 
nuclear energy exports could provide? It's an easy one for you.
    Mr. Harrell. Yes. It's a great question. IEAs, the 
expectation is that we need to double nuclear globally by 2050 
to have any shot of meeting deep emissions reduction goals.
    So it's a huge, huge opportunity, a huge economic 
opportunity for the U.S. and so we should be exporting clean 
U.S. natural gas, and we should be exporting these exciting 
zero-emission nuclear technologies.
    Mr. Balderson. All right. Thank you very much. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you. The gentleman yields. The Chair 
recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Pfluger.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I would like to thank you for holding this hearing. I think 
it's critical. As has been mentioned that there was travel by 
this committee abroad and really one of the things that came 
out of the trip, and we know this, but it was highlighted 
especially by the Polish Government, the Prime Minister, the 
President of the Czech Republic on just how important energy 
security is.
    Very happy to see Eastern Europe that literally has been 
the victim of the weaponization of Putin and Putin's energy 
plays moving towards a realistic view.
    I kind of want to get into some numbers here. Mr. Cohen, I 
think you mentioned some of the numbers with regards to actual 
the wattage that nuclear power can provide. Let's just look at 
estimates in the United States of the electricity demand that 
we are going to have.
    Concerned about the Biden administration's move to mandate 
some of the electric vehicles and not have enough electricity 
for this. So what can nuclear do in providing the supply that 
this country needs?
    Mr. Cohen. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. So in 
the testimony we cite at least one study that suggests that 
between vehicle electrification, industrial electrification, 
and just underlying growth, we'll probably need to do something 
like double to triple kilowatt hours produced in America in the 
next three decades, just an absolute hyperleap.
    So--and if we are to meet climate goals, all that is going 
to have to be zero carbon, and we're going to have to replace 
all the unabated fossils, like, if you want to meet that 
objective.
    So you're really talking about a massive amount of stuff, 
and the question is, you know, what can nuclear contribute to 
that?
    We do know that France was able to decarbonize its grid in 
15 or 17 years with repeat builds, standardized designs. If we 
can get to that, I would guess that we could meet 30, 35 
percent, 40 percent of that total build with nuclear, but we're 
going to have to get busy.
    Mr. Pfluger. Which is double or triple what we are 
currently seeing right now?
    Mr. Cohen. Yes. So we're probably--what that means is we're 
probably something like quadrupling our current----
    Mr. Pfluger. So is nuclear power baseload capable?
    Mr. Cohen. It has proven to be.
    Mr. Pfluger. The softball question. I think, of course, we 
all know that it does provide reliable, affordable, and also 
securitywise is a great option.
    Mr. Harrell, I love your comments on--and Mr. Cohen, yours 
too--on how if we don't do this here, and this question was 
just posed, and it's going to be export. Somebody else is going 
to do it.
    So both for security reasons, to remain competitive, and 
also for climate reasons, we have to export what we're doing 
here. And can you expand on, if we don't, just how vulnerable 
that makes us on a demand issue but also on a security issue?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes. I'll give you a perfect example. There's 
been increased partnership with Romania over the last couple of 
years. We're going to build some small modular reactors in 
Romania.
    They directly canceled partnerships with China because they 
saw the direct impact of that type of relationship with China. 
China was going to control their reactor builds, have a 
significant influence over their grids. They thought the U.S. 
is a better partner. It's a perfect model.
    It's why countries like Poland are real excited and cutting 
one of the single largest clean energy deals in the history of 
this country to build 5, 6 gigawatts of the beautiful AP 100 
reactors that are being completed in Georgia right now.
    And so it's a huge opportunity for us as we drive forward, 
and we should use our technological prowess and those inherent 
advantages to kind of spread affordable, clean, reliable, 
secure energy across the globe.
    Mr. Pfluger. I'm actually not an advocate for all of the 
above. I am an advocate for the best of the above. And when you 
have the ability and the technology and it makes sense, then we 
should use it.
    One of the concerns I have is about storage, and for either 
of you gentlemen, in West Texas we have a tremendous amount of 
energy. All types of energy. There's an interim storage 
facility that has caused quite a commotion. I don't know that 
it's gone through procedurally, at least for our community, the 
right steps.
    I am interested, when it comes to storage, in finding a 
permanent solution or a permanent facility, what your thoughts 
are. I know we have 25 seconds left.
    Dr. Gehin. Yes. As I've talked about it, you know, as far 
as interim, the approach that's being pursued is a consent-
based approach to put interim storage where it's welcome type 
of thing.
    Long term, you know, again, I think you'd use a consent-
based approach, but we're going to need a repository----
    Mr. Pfluger. Permanent site.
    Dr. Gehin. A permanent repository at some part, regardless 
of what we do.
    Mr. Pfluger. OK.
    Dr. Gehin. So we'll have to get there.
    Mr. Pfluger. I will have to take yours for the record in a 
written form. I am out of time, but thank you so much.
    With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan [presiding]. I thank the gentleman. I now go to 
Georgia to Mr. Carter for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you 
letting me waive on this committee. This is extremely important 
to me and I have a high interest in it, and that's why I asked, 
as a member of the full committee, to waive on this 
subcommittee.
    And I am, like you, Mr. Chairman, I am very excited about 
the future of nuclear. Very excited, and it's going to provide 
our country with reliable, clean, secure baseload power. And as 
you just mentioned, we in the State of Georgia are very proud 
of the fact that we have the first two nuclear reactors that 
are going to be going online, and one of them is already online 
and connected to the grid, producing electricity.
    So we are very, very excited about that, the first time in 
decades that we have had one in this country. And there have 
been 31 reactors that have commenced construction since the 
beginning of 2017, and 27 are either Russian or Chinese.
    We have got to get past this and we have got to, not only 
in this country, but we have got to convince our allies that 
this is the way to go. I am convinced of it, and then we hear 
the exciting news that the NRC approved the first advanced SMR 
nuclear design and the breakthroughs in fusion.
    So exciting times in energy, and thank my colleague from 
Texas, because he's right. I want the best of the above. Yes, 
all of the above is important, but I want the best of the 
above, and I am convinced that nuclear is part of that.
    Venture capitalists have been putting money into this, we 
know that as well. And that is very important, and we are 
encouraged to hear that, but we are missing the boat and we 
have been missing the boat for quite a while now with not 
investing in nuclear.
    And the nuclear reactor market is valued at $500 to $750 
billion over the next 10 years. We need to be part of that here 
in the United States. That is why, along with my colleague, 
Representative Scott Peters, we have introduced legislation, 
the Global Nuclear Energy Assessment and Cooperation Act.
    This is a multipronged approach to what we are trying to 
do. First of all, it will prohibit us from importing the fuels 
from hostile foreign nations like Russia and China. That will 
encourage energy independence and to prevent our country from 
becoming reliant on other countries, on our enemies for our 
nuclear energy needs.
    Secondly, it will introduce a program, the International 
Nuclear Reactor Export and Innovation Branch. It will introduce 
that program at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to focus our 
international nuclear efforts, including training and sharing 
expertise with our allies.
    That's something I hope that you will agree--and I think 
you will--that we need to be doing. We don't have to do this by 
ourself, but we need to encourage our allies to be in this with 
us.
    So with this growing appetite for nuclear power around the 
world--and clearly, we would much rather help provide that than 
Russia and China, who will only use it for leverage.
    Mr. Harrell, let me ask you, do we have a comprehensive 
idea of all the countries that want to pursue nuclear energy 
and would be happy to work with us to get what it would take to 
make it happen?
    Mr. Harrell. Yes. There's roughly 50 countries and a little 
more that have expressed interest in either starting nuclear 
programs or growing their nuclear programs in the last couple 
of years. And so it's an immense global market opportunity.
    Mr. Carter. So how would having a strategy such as I 
mentioned here--and I am self-serving. This is our legislation. 
It's bipartisan legislation, by the way. Representative Peters 
is on the other side of the aisle, but we both believe in it 
strongly.
    So what would having a strategy and a full picture of the 
potential nuclear market benefit the U.S.? How would it benefit 
us?
    Mr. Harrell. I think there's license harmonization that you 
mentioned is a really key piece. Armond actually mentioned this 
a little bit as well. We need to be able to use the NRC 
standard and then ultimately have that translate over to 
building in Poland, into Romania, and to Ghana or wherever it 
may be.
    And so this direct partnership among the regulators and 
literally opening up global markets. If there's an easy 
translation there, of course the country is going to be more 
excited about partnering with the U.S., because they can build 
off our expertise and then ladder it up.
    It's exactly what we're seeing with Canada, U.S., and 
Poland with the GE Hitachi, but----
    Mr. Carter. And that's what we need to do. There's no need 
to reinvent the wheel. We need to be sharing our knowledge and 
sharing our expertise here, and we need to be gaining as well.
    I will go to the rest of the panel. I know that we are at 
the end, and I am probably the last one, I am not sure. But 
anyway, how does the U.S. nuclear energy--or excuse me, the 
U.S. nuclear industry standards compare to China and Russia's? 
Anyone want to take a stab at that?
    Dr. Gehin. Yes, maybe others can comment. I don't have deep 
knowledge of China and Russia. I know we have the--if you just 
look at the operations of our plant, Mr. Repko can talk about 
are our plants highest capacity factors. We get the most energy 
out of them. They are most economically run.
    Just based on what we know about ourselves, I think we are 
world leaders with the existing fleet.
    Mr. Cohen. The cheeky answer would be, how would we know? 
But I'll just share one data point. We asked an experienced MIT 
nuclear engineer who had actually helped build some of the 
China plants to go back and see if they were being operated 
safely.
    And his conclusion was, basically, Western standards are 
being applied in the safety--he did an audit. You couldn't go 
much farther than that. They don't do much publicly, but----
    Mr. Carter. Right.
    Mr. Cohen [continuing]. He said, ``I don't lose a lot of 
sleep over that.'' For whatever that's worth.
    Mr. Carter. Good. I'm glad to hear that. Well, again, I'm 
excited.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you for letting me waive on this 
committee, and thank you all for being here.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. Seeing there are no 
further Members wishing to ask questions. I would like to thank 
all of the witnesses for being here. Your testimony was 
phenomenal, and I think you saw the bipartisan nature.
    I wish more of the Democrats would have shown up and 
engaged in this, but they are going to have some opportunity 
because I have asked staff to put together a summary of the key 
takeaways so that we can start crafting a legislative package, 
have a markup, and push some legislation through Congress to 
really expedite and propagate nuclear power in this country and 
get us back on track.
    So I want to thank you.
    I ask unanimous consent to insert in the record the 
documents included on the staff hearing documents list. Without 
objection, that will be the order.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    And pursuant to committee rules, I remind Members that they 
have 10 legislative business days to submit additional 
questions for the record, and I ask witnesses to submit their 
response within 10 business days upon receipt of the questions.
    And so that will conclude the ``American Nuclear Energy 
Expansion: Powering a Clean and Secure Future'' hearing. And 
without objection, the subcommittee will stand adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 5:30 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
    [Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]
