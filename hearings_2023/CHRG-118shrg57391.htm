           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. We will now turn to the hearing before us. And I 
would like to call up the witnesses to the table, if I could. 
We are going to welcome Paul Hudson, President of Flyers' 
Rights; Captain Casey Murray, President of Southwest Airlines 
Pilots Association; Andrew Watterson, Chief Operating Officer 
for Southwest Airlines; Sharon Pinkerton, Senior Vice 
President, Legislative Regulatory Policy for Airlines for 
America; and Dr. Clifford Winston, Senior Fellow, the Brookings 
Institute, who will be joining us remotely today.
    So, we are looking forward to hearing your testimony and 
the ability to interact with you on questions. So, if the 
witnesses could come to the table, please. OK, thank you all 
for being here. When winter storm Elliott hit, U.S. travelers 
experienced an airline debacle of enormous proportions.
    While bad weather can happen and is expected, and many 
airlines recovered quickly, Southwest stood out on its scope of 
the problems it faced. Over 2 million Southwest passengers 
suffered consequences, separated from family and friends, not 
to mention their luggage, and hundreds of thousands of people 
stranded at airports across the country.
    We know that many of them had no clear instructions about 
what to do next. For example, I heard from many of my 
constituents in the State of Washington about these issues. I 
heard from a coach of Rainier High School basketball team in 
Seattle. He and his wife went through a tremendous ordeal.
    It is very important that we understand that consumers do 
like Southwest Airlines' point to point service. They like that 
the airline does have many benefits and they like the friendly 
flight that they get from their pilots and many of their 
workers. But Coach Bethea and his wife and traveling party of 
more than two dozen players and parents, traveled to Las Vegas 
on Southwest for a holiday basketball tournament.
    They were scheduled to fly back to Seattle on December 
23rd, but Southwest canceled the flight. When Coach Bethea and 
his wife contacted Southwest, they were basically told, you are 
on your own, and they were on their own, all of them, all of 
those kids and parents stuck in Las Vegas trying to figure out 
what to do next. They needed hotel rooms. They needed meals. 
They wanted to try to figure out, if they could, to salvage 
their Christmas holiday.
    They ended up stranded in Las Vegas for 5 days, spending 
more than $10,000 on hotels and food, and with no idea how they 
might get back home. Mercifully, a friend offered to front the 
cost of a charter bus, and finally, 18 hours later, through the 
snow, they made it back to Seattle.
    Here's what really struck me, though, when I talked to the 
coach and his wife and many other people I have talked to, they 
wanted to know after their flight was canceled, what were the 
alternatives? What could they do to get back home? Particularly 
because it was the holiday season.
    And even though they were missing time with family and 
friends at Christmas, they also wanted to know about those out-
of-pocket expenses, thousands of dollars that they wanted to 
make sure that they received some information about on how they 
might get reimbursed. When I spoke to Coach Bethea and his wife 
recently, they wanted to ask one question.
    Mr. Watterson, they wanted me to ask you, and I know you 
are a busy guy, but what they really wanted was for you to call 
them. Like many of our consumers, they felt like they were 
getting the short end of the stick. They didn't know how to 
communicate to anyone to answer their questions on how long 
they were stuck.
    I know that many of these issues Mr. Hudson is going to 
talk about, and we will have some ideas, I know we are going to 
hear about how we can move consumers around more effectively, 
but doing better also means that making sure that we are not 
going to give consumers the short end of the stick.
    We need to make sure we are investing in technology and the 
surge capacity that I am sure we are going to hear about. And I 
am sure we are going to hear about what could have been done 
before this that would have helped. We are always going to have 
these weather events, and some of us believe they are going to 
become more severe.
    But what we want is to have a system that is ready to 
address that and to talk about the alternatives. Captain 
Murray, President of the Southwest Airline Pilots Association, 
will tell us for years there was warnings of the need to 
modernize the outdated--the IT system that was dated. I hope 
Mr. Watterson can explain why those warnings went unheard.
    For mandatory oversight--oh, I am sorry, mandatory overtime 
shifts, there was a stretch into all these conditions, and I do 
want to thank all the workers that worked those many hours to 
try to help this recover. I know many of my constituents said 
how grateful they were for the individual workers who showed 
compassion and tried to help them.
    But I do believe this sector needs a more effective 
policeman on the beat. They need someone over at the Department 
of Transportation who is going to get the job done when we need 
to make sure that consumers are consulted, that their 
reimbursement fees aren't continuing to be held up, or as the 
President said the other night, making sure that children get 
the access to the seat next to their parents.
    I know that these things seem like very basic consumer 
issues, but somehow, they have been taken for granted, and I 
think that this incident shows us that we have to get serious 
about this. Our Committee has the opportunity to implement 
change, resiliency in an air transportation system that every 
member of this committee values.
    We value it and we want to grow it, but we can't do it on 
the backs of consumers. So, Mr. Watterson, if you will call my 
constituent, I will feel better that you will be hearing the 
real voices of consumers directly.
    Thank you. Senator Cruz.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. And welcome to each 
of the witnesses at this hearing. A few moments ago, I 
referenced the bipartisan and pro-jobs legislation that this 
committee will be moving forward over the next 2 years.
    Right at the top of that list is going to be reauthorizing 
the Federal Aviation Administration. And it is a real 
opportunity for this committee to focus on aviation safety, and 
also innovation, and ensuring that we have a competitive 
aviation sector that gives consumers what they want, which is 
low prices and the ability to get where they want to go for 
work or for play, inexpensively and conveniently.
    Safety, quite rightly, is the top priority of the FAA, and 
we should not be compromising on safety with too many recent 
near misses. We have to consider how to keep our air space safe 
and efficient. Just this past weekend in Austin, Texas, there 
was a near disaster that was averted thanks to the quick 
reaction of the pilots.
    But it could have been a horrific day had those two planes 
collided on that runway in Austin. And it is my hope that we 
use the reauthorization opportunity to push the FAA safety and 
technology into the 21st century, to protect competition, and 
to resist the temptation to get into the business of regulating 
prices, which will only make air traffic--air travel 
unaffordable. We all know why we are here today, which is in 
the middle of the holiday travel rush, tens of thousands of 
families, including many Texans, missed Christmases at home, 
missed weddings, medical procedures, and more.
    Due initially to an unavoidable weather event, but 
prolonged for days because of the very serious failures at 
Southwest Airlines. Now I am a big fan of Southwest Airlines. I 
spend a lot of time flying Southwest. In fact, I jokingly refer 
to Southwest as the company plane. It feels like I am on a 
Southwest plane once or twice or more a week. And I think 
Southwest most days does a fantastic job.
    I think Southwest employees consistently greet you with a 
smile, with a laugh. Southwest flight attendants will sing over 
the intercom. Southwest has done an amazing job inculcating 
customer service throughout a very large institutions. All of 
those are commendable. But, when all was said and done, over 
the Christmas holiday, Southwest had canceled more than 16,000 
flights. We will hear more of an explanation today on what 
happened.
    And many people, understandably, were deeply frustrated at 
not being able to get where they wanted to go, not being able 
to be with their family. And I have had multiple conversations 
with senior leadership at Southwest. I am confident they 
understand it was an epic screw up, and that they are committed 
to doing everything possible to prevent its recurrence.
    The airline has already paid out hundreds of millions of 
dollars in refunds, free future flights, and reimbursements for 
stranded travelers' out-of-pocket expenses, and the airline is 
working hard to win back travelers' trust. What I hope to hear 
today are the specific concrete steps taken by Southwest 
Management to ensure that a similar operations meltdown never 
happens again.
    Now, as frustrating as those several days were, the 
question of whether Southwest has sufficiently made things 
right will ultimately be answered by the flying public. It will 
be answered by customers choosing whether or not to book a 
flight on Southwest.
    Because Southwest was issuing refunds and returning 
baggage, while they were doing so, some Democrats on this 
committee were proposing the Government step in with overly 
complex, anti-competitive, and frankly, unnecessary regulations 
that would collectively have the result of making flying 
unaffordable for many Americans.
    One of the great changes in our lifetime to commercial 
aviation is the prices of flights have gone way down so that 
more and more Americans can afford to travel to see a loved 
one, to travel to go on vacation with the kids. That is 
valuable.
    And instead of rushing to regulate prices and how many 
drink coupons you get, the Biden Department of Transportation 
should instead let the flying public vote with their feet. We 
need to be--as a customer, if I am not confident of an 
airline's ability to get me from point A to point B on time, I 
will choose a different airline. Southwest knows this, and it 
is how they have earned so many customers over and over again.
    And the Biden Department of Transportation doesn't seem to 
have quite the same faith in consumers. Last month, the 
Department of Transportation announced that it is investigating 
whether Southwest engaged in ``unrealistic scheduling for the 
holiday season.'' This provision of law permits the Department 
of Transportation to decide if a singular route is chronically 
delayed, which means it is delayed by more than 30 minutes more 
than 50 percent of the time.
    Never one to let longstanding and well-reasoned precedent 
stand in the way, Department of Transportation now plans to 
investigate the sensibility of the entire schedule, armchair 
quarterbacking the scheduling and operations of an entire 
industry. That's just foolish.
    Regulatory overreach as egregious as that would undermine 
decades of progress in air travel, harming the very consumers 
that the DOT claims it is trying to protect. To avoid arbitrary 
fines, airlines would reduce service to pad their schedules. A 
world in which the Department of Transportation can deem an 
entire airline's schedule ``unrealistic,'' is a world with 
fewer flights to smaller airports, in Texas, in Montana, in 
Nevada, in Arizona, and less flexibility and competition for 
airlines, and ultimately, higher prices.
    Notably absent from today's meeting is Secretary Buttigieg. 
Just a few weeks ago, the FAA had its own epic screw up with 
the meltdown of the NOTAM system. Under Secretary Buttigieg's 
watch, the FAA issued the first nationwide ground stop since 9/
11, leading to thousands of canceled flights.
    Now, the Department of Transportation didn't give any mia 
culpa to impacted travelers. The Biden DOT didn't issue 
refunds. It didn't issue reimbursements. It just screwed up 
their flights, and then proceeded to say, we want to be in 
charge of how the airlines behave.
    Even though the FAA has been modernizing their NOTAM system 
since 2012, and Congress has fully funded the NOTAM budget, the 
FAA predicts they won't finish the modernization until 2030. We 
need to be defending consumers. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Cruz. We will now turn to our 
witness, starting with Mr. Hudson. Thank you. Welcome.

       STATEMENT OF PAUL HUDSON, PRESIDENT, FLYERSRIGHTS

    [Technical problems.]
    The Chair. Yes, if you can push your microphone button, 
please. Thank you.
    Mr. Hudson. Can you hear me now?
    The Chair. Yes. Thank you.
    Mr. Hudson. Good morning and thank you, Chair Cantwell, 
Ranking Member Cruz, and Committee members, for including the 
passenger perspective in this important hearing on airline 
operations and consumer protections. My name is Paul Hudson. I 
am here today as President of FlyersRights, the largest airline 
passenger advocacy organization.
    The Southwest Airlines Christmas meltdown, as you know, 
resulted in 16,700 canceled flights. It impacted directly over 
2 million passengers and many more indirectly. It was 
unprecedented, but not unexpected.
    Southwest, as well as other airlines, have had past 
meltdowns due to obsolete technology, lack of reserves of 
personnel and equipment, lack of stress testing, and 
unrealistic and deceptive scheduling.
    The Southwest debacle caused many tens of thousands to be 
stranded overnight or even for days. They missed important 
events such as weddings, funerals, holiday gatherings, and 
vacations, work obligations, and even needed medical care, not 
to mention the mountains of luggage delayed or lost.
    Southwest shut down its customer service and could not even 
communicate with its own employees. The loss to passengers and 
the economy, which depends on air travel, is well into the 
billions. Some examples.
    Dianne Martinez needed her epilepsy medicine and had to 
drive 10 hours from Charleston to Nashville because Southwest 
had no available flights for days and did not accommodate her 
on another airline. She had to pay $600 for rental car and 
hotel stays because of Southwest.
    There are many more examples. Kate D. missed her own 
wedding despite booking a flight scheduled to land more than 2 
days before her wedding. She estimated that she and her wedding 
party lost more than $70,000 in hotel rooms alone.
    Many passengers endured what Christopher Rosales has 
endured, multiple canceled flights, a night at the airport, and 
spending Christmas Eve in a hotel. Passengers were unable to 
talk to any airport representative in person, on the phone or 
online. All this occurred while other airlines had empty seats.
    Because U.S. airlines are not required to pay delay 
compensation for domestic flights, unlike for international air 
travel, Southwest avoided over half a billion dollars in delay 
expenses. Under the current system, airlines are actually 
incentivized to provide bad service. Good service costs money, 
and bad service saves money. And that money can be used for 
dividends, stock buybacks, and executive compensation.
    Southwest proudly chose to be the first airline to restore 
dividends, paying $428 million in dividends to shareholders in 
December. Bad press, investigations, low to no fines has not 
caused it to update its operations. Southwest canceled or 
delayed half its flights over a few days in June of 21. 1,800 
flights in 1 weekend in October of 21. Most airline operational 
problems are predictable and preventable.
    In June, Flyers' Rights sent an urgent letter to Secretary 
Buttigieg with 17 policy proposals, but to our knowledge, 
nearly none has been acted on. I would like to emphasize three 
measures this committee could initiate. First, is EU style 
delay compensation. The second necessary measure is the pre-
deregulation reciprocity rule.
    This rule match empty seats on other airlines with 
passengers whose flights were canceled or significantly delayed 
at no extra charge. This mitigates delays and consumer harm, is 
self-executing, and rewards airlines with reliable service 
while penalizing those without. Flyers' Rights previously filed 
a formal rulemaking petition with the DOT, but this was denied 
as unnecessary by Secretary Chao.
    The mantra at the time was airline competition will solve 
all problems. Finally, I would urge this committee to take 
decisive action to revisit the Airline Deregulation Act of 
1978. The current airline, and I know also current airline 
antitrust practices, unintended consequences lie behind most 
current air travel dysfunction.
    This can be done by establishment of a bipartisan 
commission or select committee to study the current state of 
air travel and propose needed reforms in the next 6 to 12 
months. I last recall testifying before this committee shortly 
after 9/11. This committee then forged a bipartisan consensus 
in a matter of weeks. It persuaded a reluctant House Majority 
and President to enact structural reform in aviation security.
    There has not been a successful aviation bombing or 
hijacking since. You have the power, and you should have the 
motivation, to take decisive action to overcome the present 
crisis in air travel operations and consumer protection.
    Thank you again for the opportunity, and look forward to 
your questions, and to hear the ideas of members and other 
witnesses.

Introduction
    Thank you for including the passenger perspective in this very

The Southwest Meltdown's Effects
    The December Southwest Airlines Meltdown is the most recent 
meltdown in a long string of airline meltdowns over the past decade. 
This recent meltdown alone resulted in over two million stranded 
passengers, families sleeping at airports, mountains of delayed or lost 
passenger luggage, and passengers missing important events such as 
weddings, funerals, holiday family gatherings, cruise ship vacations, 
and business meetings.
    Dianne Martinez, needing her epilepsy medicine, had to drive 10 
hours from Charleston to Nashville because Southwest had no available 
flights for days and did not re-accommodate her on another airline.\1\ 
She had to pay $600 for a rental car and hotel stay because of 
Southwest.

Southwest's Incentives
    This all occurred while other airlines had empty seats on their 
flights. But under the current system, U.S. airlines are not required 
to pay any delay compensation for domestic flights and have no legal 
obligation to mitigate hours-or even days-long delays by rebooking a 
passenger on the next available flight regardless of airline. All that 
the airline has to do for any canceled flight is to give the passenger 
a refund. But as we saw during the pandemic, airlines are not quick to 
return passenger money. In November 2022, the DOT fined six airlines, 
including just one U.S. airline for withholding $600 million of 
passenger refunds for up to two years. Those airlines were fined 
pennies for this willful misbehavior, and nine of the ten largest U.S. 
airlines escaped without punishment.
    The airlines are incentivized to deliver poor service. Southwest 
has been incentivized to ignore calls over the past few years by its 
own employees to update its grossly-outdated technology \4\ and instead 
became the first airline to deliver a post-pandemic dividend amounting 
to $428 million on December 7, 2022.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Whether it is missing important family events, missing work, having 
to pay for an expensive walk-up ticket, or being stranded for days-it 
is passengers who end up paying for Southwest's mistakes.
    In the European Union, airlines are required to compensate 
passengers between 250 and 600 euros for certain delays and 
cancellations that are within the airline's control. The airlines must 
also provide appropriate meal vouchers, hotel vouchers, and 
transportation to and from the hotel. Had Southwest Airlines been 
subject to EU passenger protection regulations, it would have had to 
pay between $532 million and $851 million \6\ in compensation for its 
16,700 canceled flights.\7\ This figure does not include the amounts 
owed as refunds for canceled flights or delays of over 5 hours, as well 
as hotel and meal vouchers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ These figures estimate the number of passengers on the 16,700 
canceled Southwest flights by taking a weighted average of Southwest's 
passenger capacity on its 737-700s, 737-800s, and 737 MAX 8's at the 
most recent available load factor of 86.7 percent. This yields over 2.2 
million passengers, and the two figures are based on the 250 euro and 
400 euro compensation amount respectively.

investigation-losses-holiday-travel-cancellations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    That is a large figure, but it puts into perspective how much 
damage flight cancellations and delays actually harm passengers. In 
comparison, just weeks before the Southwest Christmas Meltdown, 
Southwest Airlines announced a $428 million dividend for its 
shareholders.
    Bad press, low fines, and little-to-no formal enforcement action 
will not incentivize Southwest to update its systems. It hasn't in the 
past. Southwest canceled or delayed half of its flights due to 
technological problems in June 2021 \8\ and canceled 1,800 flights in 
just one weekend in October 2021.\9\ And after the industry received 
$58 billion in covid bailouts intended to keep staffing at a pre-
pandemic level, the airlines avoided the ``no layoffs or furloughs'' 
provisions by offering buyouts and early retirements to pocket even 
more money. And then the airlines held on to over a billion dollars in 
money owed to passengers as refunds. Meanwhile, the airlines are not 
subject to minimum reserve requirements for equipment or staff or any 
form of stress testing. Bad weather and other disruptions should result 
in only graceful degradation of air service, not complete breakdowns 
that take a week to recover from.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Airlines Enjoy Unique Legal Privileges
    Let's state the obvious: no other industry is allowed to be this 
bad to its customers and still operate as business as usual. No other 
industry is allowed to expand stock buybacks, dividends, and executive 
compensation, and then cry poor, with its outstretched hand asking for 
bailouts. We traded a system of government dictation of prices, routes, 
and frequency for the free market. But this is not a free market with 
reasonable regulation. This is passengers and the government ruled by 
the airlines.
    What's a clearer example than airlines having to consent to be 
fined by the DOT, and then only paying half of that fine? Airlines 
taking bailouts with few strings attached and then violating the spirit 
of the bailout? Airlines raising prices through drip pricing, junk 
fees, gotcha fees, and fees that bear no relation to the cost of the 
ancillary service provided? Fees to sit next to your 8-year-old child? 
Fees to sit in a seat they can, kind of, safely fit into, as the 
airlines respond to growing passenger size with ever-shrinking seats.
    The airlines are exempt from state consumer protection enforcement. 
Meanwhile, private litigation by passengers is limited in scope and in 
practice. The airlines can remove any small claims lawsuit to Federal 
court, where the expenses and fees are cost-prohibitive. Competition is 
only decreasing as the government approves, but never denies, mergers, 
alliances, and joint ventures.
    This means only the DOT can currently police the airline's bad 
behavior. And there's a lot of it: system meltdowns, passenger 
strandings, unpaid refunds, denied boardings, tarmac confinements, 
broken wheelchairs, drip pricing. The DOT's authority, outside of a few 
narrow statutory commands, is limited to its authority to prevent 
unfair and deceptive practices. The problem is that the airlines have 
never seen a DOT proposal they didn't oppose and that they didn't think 
exceeded the DOT's unfair and deceptive practices authority. This 
includes the bipartisan reforms people may take for granted today: the 
tarmac delay rule and the 24-hour refund rule. The DOT is forced to 
police the airlines through phone calls, through requests, through 
consent decrees, where the only fines against airlines are fines that 
the airlines agree to. How does this make sense? The airlines held on 
to hundreds of millions of dollars of passenger money for almost two 
years. The DOT brought enforcement against only one U.S. airline for 
illegally withholding refunds, Frontier. Frontier was ordered to return 
$222M in passenger money wrongly held by the airlines for up to two 
years. Frontier was also fined $2.2M in what amounts to a low interest 
loan for the airline. This fine is unlikely to have much of a deterrent 
effect on future bad behavior by the airlines.
Looking Back to Go Forward
    The measures that Congress takes can no longer be band aids, or 
else we will be back here, knowing that the airlines egregiously 
misbehaved or broke the law, but still struggling to find a solution. 
To find the path forward, we must first look back to how we got here.
    The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, with bipartisan support, 
brought an end to the Civil Aeronautics Board's determination of price, 
routes, and scheduling. The commercial airline system was born as a 
subsidized industry. In its infancy, the government subsidized the 
airlines through the flying of mail. One of the biggest complaints of 
CAB regulation was that the government blocked new entrants. Today, it 
is the airlines doing the blocking, through mergers, alliances, joint 
ventures, and anticompetitive practices such as predatory pricing, 
sitting on unused or underused slots, and ``capacity discipline,'' 
where the airlines limited the number of flights in order to boost 
prices.
    Again, the government is unable to enforce the law and restore the 
free market from the now privatized airline oligopoly. Deregulation was 
supposed to deliver lower prices and better customer service. Instead, 
fares are increasing and service is clearly worsening.
    In the immediate aftermath of deregulation, airfares continued 
their decline, as expected. Continued technological advancement should 
yield benefits for airlines and passengers alike. But now, fares, when 
factoring in dozens of ancillary fees, are increasing. And when you 
consider what passengers got in the 70s versus now, prices aren't that 
much lower 45 years later.
    Alfred Kahn, former Chairman of the CAB and ``Father of Airline 
Deregulation'', explained how what we have now is not what was 
intended. Kahn stated, ``These problems drive home the lesson that the 
dismantling of comprehensive regulation should not be understood as 
synonymous with total government laissez-faire. The principal policy 
failures over the last fifteen years have been failures on the part of 
government to vigorously and imaginatively fulfill responsibilities 
that we, in deregulating the industry, never intended to abdicate.'' 
\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/AirlineDeregulation.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Congress must revisit the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 and 
antitrust law and policies to fix the obvious dysfunctions that enable 
and cause the present problems. I recall the time I testified before 
this committee shortly after September 11th. The committee forged a 
bipartisan consensus, and in a matter of weeks, persuaded a reluctant 
President and House of Representatives to remove aviation security 
regulation from the FAA, remove the operation of aviation security from 
the airlines and airports, and transfer operation to a new agency, the 
Transportation Security Administration. There has not been a successful 
airline hijacking or bombing since.
    Today, I urge this committee to act in a similar, decisive fashion: 
create a bipartisan commission to review the current state of air 
travel and enact much needed reforms in the next 6 to 12 months. Such 
reforms may include structural changes in government agencies.
Fundamental Reforms
    Congress shouldn't feel bad about pursuing fundamental reforms for 
aviation, reforms that feel ambitious only because of the airlines' 
decades of unfair and anticompetitive actions. The airlines just 
received $58 billion in bailouts in 2020, and along with that, broken 
promises to keep its employees paid and its operations ready for the 
eventual return to increased traffic. Instead we got the summer of 
cancellations in 2022, and the staff and equipment shortages persist.
    Although this committee is currently investigating the misuse of 
bailout funds, without fundamental reforms, Congress and the DOT will 
always be reacting to the next air travel crisis. The solution can be 
meaningful regulation, the ones that come with meaningful punishments 
and incentives and that do not require constant monitoring and 
investigations. The type of regulations that already exist in other 
parts of the world.
This Crisis Was Foreseeable
    In June 2022, Flyers Rights sent a letter to Secretary Buttigieg 
with 17 policy proposals to help prevent air travel meltdowns, like the 
Southwest one we would see just six months later.\11\ I want to 
highlight two of the most fundamental reforms needed: delay 
compensation and the reciprocity rule.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ See Attachment 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delay Compensation
    U.S. airlines are no strangers to paying flight delay compensation. 
However, this compensation largely goes to foreign passengers, as 
passengers in U.S. domestic air travel are not entitled to ANY flight 
delay compensation.
    Passengers are entitled to European flight delay compensation when 
they fly on a European airline or when they depart from Europe on any 
airline. The Montreal Convention also guarantees passengers actual 
damages arising from flight delays and cancellations in international 
travel.
    Bringing this compensation home to the U.S. would provide the 
airlines with the incentive to finally stop its practice of deceptive 
scheduling currently under investigation by the DOT. As we saw in the 
covid refund heist of 2020, where the airlines held onto passenger 
money for years with little or no penalty, the airlines can schedule 
flights it has no intention of or no ability to actually operate. The 
airline takes the passenger's money, and in a worst-case scenario, 
simply has to refund the money a few months later if it cannot operate 
the flight. Meanwhile, the passenger is forced to pay higher fares, 
known as the walk-up rate, to secure another flight.
    Not only is this wildly unfair and deceptive, it leads to 
disruptions and the widespread sentiment that the airlines are 
unreliable and untrustworthy. Andy Lalwani, a passenger whose flight 
was canceled during the most recent Southwest meltdown and had to pay 
more than double the original price for another ticket, stated ``This 
outdated tech and outdated operations they've been using has just been 
funneling and trickling down to this moment. It makes you have a 
distrust in the future to ever fly with Southwest.'' \12\ I had a 
similar experience last year when I was stranded overnight in Atlanta 
by a Southwest canceled flight and had to pay 3x the booked fare to 
avoid a 40-hour delay. It appears that bad service is actually now good 
business. Flight delay compensation, hotel vouchers, meal vouchers, and 
the reciprocity rule are how we solve this problem.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ https://abcnews.go.com/Business/stranded-southwest-customers-
details-exhaustive-efforts-home-amid/story?id=95848764
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reciprocity Rule
    The Reciprocity Rule was a de facto rule prior to deregulation that 
required an airline to accommodate a passenger whose flight was 
canceled or significantly delayed on the next available flight, 
regardless of the operating airline, at no additional cost. The 
reciprocity rule matched stranded passengers with empty seats on other 
airlines, thereby increasing the efficiency of operations and limiting 
the harm inflicted on passengers.
    The Southwest Christmas Meltdown demonstrates that we need to 
return to the Reciprocity Rule. The rule would incentivize reliability 
and accurate scheduling. Airlines have deceptively scheduled flights 
that they have little to no intention or ability of operating. The 
airline collects passenger money up front and simply has to refund that 
money a few months later or place the passenger on its next available 
flight, even if that results in a delay of many hours or days.
    The reciprocity rule, just like flight delay compensation, would 
reward airlines that keep their promises and incentivize airlines to 
perform better and schedule more accurately.
Conclusion
    Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. I look forward to 
your questions and the air travel reforms that this Committee can 
initiate and that Congress must enact.

    The Chair. Before I turn to Captain Murray, I forgot to 
call on my colleagues for the Subcommittee Chair and Ranking 
Member. I know Senator Moran isn't here, but we will allow him 
to put a statement in the record. But Senator Duckworth, if you 
wanted to give a statement.

              STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY DUCKWORTH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS

    Senator Duckworth. Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking 
Member Cruz for holding today's hearing. Next month actually 
marks my 30th year as a pilot from when I first showed up at 
flight school at Fort Rucker, Alabama.
    So, I am incredibly excited to serve as chair of the 
subcommittee on Aviation Safety, Operations and Innovation. 
Having flown as a military pilot, as a civilian pilot, as a 
general aviation aircraft owner, I have flown from civilian 
airfields, military airfields, civil military airfields. I 
commanded the Black Hawk unit out of Midway Airport, flying in 
between Southwest Airlines, on the pad between the force, 
taking off from there.
    Those of you who know, I know Midway real well. It is my 
personal mission to make sure that we craft an FAA 
reauthorization that will strengthen safety, that will bolster 
the aviation work force, that will hold the FAA accountable for 
finally modernizing its air traffic control technology.
    And consistent with today's hearing, we must also crack 
down on carriers that have gotten away with predatory practices 
that treat customers like suckers and view passengers with 
disabilities as disposable. Every commercial airline, American 
airline, has broken one of my wheelchairs. Every one of them.
    We need to end that practice. Now is a critical time for 
our Nation's commercial aviation industry, from the deadly 
Boeing 737 MAX crashes to the FAA self-inflicted meltdown of 
its NOTAM system, to the utter collapse of Southwest Airlines 
operations blamed on the same weather that every other carrier 
managed to navigate. Americans' confidence in every facet of 
our civil aviation ecosystem has plummeted.
    Today's hearing is hopefully a first step toward rebuilding 
a foundation that will begin to restore trust and confidence in 
a civil aviation system that has made great leaps and bounds in 
safety over recent decades, but in recent years has suffered 
from complacency and a desperate drive for profits that has 
placed the needs of Wall Street and the balance sheet above all 
else.
    I yield back, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Thank you. Thank you for that. And again, we 
will have Senator Moran, if he wants to put a statement in the 
record. Now, Captain Murray, welcome. Thank you for being here.

    STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN CASEY MURRAY, PRESIDENT, SOUTHWEST 
              AIRLINES PILOTS ASSOCIATION (SWAPA)

    Mr. Murray. Good morning, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Cruz. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you 
today. I ask that my written and oral testimony to be submitted 
for the record.
    My name is Captain Casey Murray, the President of the 
Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. I am a Boeing 737 
Captain at Southwest, and I am proud to represent 10,235 of the 
best pilots in the world. For years, our pilots have been 
sounding the alarm about Southwest's inadequate crew scheduling 
technology and outdated operational processes.
    Unfortunately, those warnings have been summarily ignored 
by Southwest leaders. Our pilots were right, but SWAPA's goal 
in today's hearing is not to say we told you so, but right 
doesn't make our pilots feel any more secure. Our hearts are 
broken. The December 2022 meltdown was as tragic as it was 
historic.
    SWAPA's singular goal in participating in today's hearing 
is to help ensure it never happens again. We want to be an 
integral part of its rise once again to lead the industry. 
While it would be easy to kick our company when it is down, 
this is our company, and consequently our careers and our 
livelihoods.
    SWAPA pilots desire with the American public deserves, a 
healthy company with happy employees who have the tools they 
need to deliver a safe, reliable product to consumers. Those 
who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it, and 
Southwest has a history of repetition.
    Unfortunately, despite many opportunities, Southwest 
Airlines management did not listen to its pilots and frontline 
employees who saw this meltdown coming. Pilots have a unique 
perspective to the airline's operation. From the flight deck, 
we coordinate with nearly every employee group from the front 
line to the airline headquarters.
    In order to leave a safe operation, you must be present, 
and willing to listen and collaborate with everyone on your 
team. What our pilots saw and have known for years is that 
Southwest struggles to manage nearly any disruption regardless 
of the cause.
    Our recent history, and the data shows, a pattern of 
increasingly disruptive operational failures, missed 
prioritization of resources, and worst of all, a hollow 
leveraging of our culture to cover up poor management 
decisions. As we detailed in our written testimony, there were 
three main causes of the December 2022 meltdown.
    First, Southwest leadership failed to properly prepare for 
winter storm Elliott. Second, Southwest managers failed to 
modernize true management processes and related IT systems. 
Finally, Southwest failed to listen to the warnings of its 
front-line employees.
    Much has been made of Southwest shortcomings in IT and 
technology, and while that is a causal factor in this failure, 
that explanation alone misses the underlying issue, that the 
conditions were set years ago when Southwest leaders allowed 
the airline to drift away from an employee centered culture.
    Instead, Southwest leaders focused on making the airline 
the darling of the investment community while building an 
insulated and strictly vertical structure where decisionmaking 
authority was slowly stripped away from front line experts with 
the most situational awareness. Warning signs were ignored, 
poor performance was condoned, excuses were made, processes 
atrophied, core values were forgotten.
    The management pitfall is called ``normalization of 
drift,'' and it was coined after studying the space shuttle 
Challenger disaster. As a result of this normalized drift, our 
once great company went from Herb's legacy of personality and 
agility, to becoming a technicat's dream with stove-piped 
fiefdoms that communicated vertically with little to no 
horizontal integration.
    Thankfully, the accountants who got us here are no longer 
in charge, at least not officially. Perhaps that is a silver 
lining, but only if Southwest new leaders take bold action 
immediately. There must be clear actions, not words, and that 
is what is expected from us. Our hope is that SWAPA's data 
driven testimony provides value to the airline industry, the 
committee, and to the public.
    We all want to understand how this happened and what must 
be done together to ensure that it never happens again. As Herb 
Kelleher famously said, ``never rest on your laurels or you 
will get a thorn in your backside.''
    Somehow, Southwest forgot this lesson along the way, and as 
a result, Southwest failed 2 million customers. We hope the 
committee will use this opportunity to ensure that Southwest 
delivers a timeline for upgrading its crew scheduling 
technology, improving its crew management processes, and a 
commitment to collaborate with frontline employees and labor to 
earn back their trust.
    Southwest used to be an airline that supported its 
employees. It has become an airline that is supported by its 
employees. I am proud to represent the pilots of SWAPA. I thank 
you for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to 
answering the committee's questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Murray follows:]

        Prepared Statement of Captain Casey Murray, President, 
             Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA)
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Southwest 
Airlines Pilots Association (``SWAPA'') about the Southwest Airlines 
(``SWA'') operational meltdown in December 2022.
I. General Overview
    On a podcast on November 7, 2022, SWAPA President Captain Casey 
Murray said, ``I fear that we are one thunderstorm, one air traffic 
control event, one IT router failure away from a complete meltdown. 
Whether that's Thanksgiving or Christmas or New Year, that's the 
precarious situation we are in.'' <SUP>i</SUP>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Captain Murray and our Pilots have been sounding the alarm about 
SWA's inadequate crew scheduling technology and outdated operational 
processes for years. Unfortunately, those warnings were summarily 
ignored. Our Pilots' hearts were broken when those alarms proved 
accurate in December 2022.
    SWAPA's singular goal in participating in today's hearing is to do 
our part to make sure a meltdown like this never happens again. This is 
our Company, our careers, and our families' livelihoods. SWAPA pilots 
and the American public have a common goal; to ensure that Southwest 
remains healthy and has the tools to deliver a reliable travel 
experience to the flying public.
    Pilots have a unique perspective on the Airline's operation. First 
and foremost, Pilots are the final authority on safety. To conduct a 
safe flight, Pilots must interact with nearly every employee group from 
the frontline to the Airline's nerve center in Dallas. From baggage 
handlers to customer service agents, flight attendants to fuelers, 
mechanics to managers, and dispatchers to schedulers, SWAPA Pilots saw 
the operation unravel from the inside out.
    What SWAPA Pilots saw--and have known for years--is that SWA 
struggles to manage nearly any disruption, regardless of the cause. Our 
recent history--and the data shows--a pattern of increasingly 
disruptive operational failures, misprioritization of resources, and 
hollow leveraging of our culture to cover up poor management decisions.
    As we will detail in our data-driven testimony, there were three 
leading causes of the December 2022 meltdown:

  <bullet> Failure to adequately prepare for Winter Storm Elliott

  <bullet> Failure to modernize crew management processes & related 
        I.T. systems

  <bullet> Failure of Leadership & the Normalization of Drift
II. Background
Years in the Making/Lack of investment in crew management technology 
        and processes
    SWA's latest meltdown is far from its first. <SUP>ii</SUP> Over the 
past 15 years, the Airline has experienced nearly a dozen smaller-scale 
breakdowns with increasing frequency and magnitude. In addition, since 
2014, SWAPA has warned the Company that technology and crew scheduling 
processes were failing.
------------------------------------------------

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The December 2022 disaster was preceded by multiple meltdowns in 
Chicago, an I.T. failure in 2016, and a crew scheduling technology 
breakdown in October 2021. Since 2011, SWA has averaged one major 
operational failure every 18 months.
    A SWA meltdown in October 2021 closely resembles the one we are 
discussing today. A weather event -thunderstorms in Florida--left the 
Airline unable to manage its crew network, which caused significant 
disruptions. <SUP>iii</SUP> That meltdown cost Southwest $75M and 
resulted in over 2,200 canceled flights during a short holiday weekend 
simply because the crew scheduling processes were inadequate. That 
event should have been a wake-up call to the Company that I.T. and crew 
scheduling practice changes were long overdue.

    During the COVID-19 pandemic, SWA added 18 new cities over 16 
months to capture new market share while receiving over $7 billion in 
government funding. <SUP>iv</SUP> <SUP>v</SUP> But, as demand rebounded 
in 2021, the Airline's network became increasingly fragile. SWAPA 
warned leadership in June 2021 that there was no margin for 
error.<SUP>vi</SUP> It took over a year for Southwest to admit the 
network was spread too thin. ``I do think the scale and the growth of 
the airline got ahead of the tools that we have,'' Southwest CEO Bob 
Jordan told reporters in November 2022.<SUP>vii</SUP> Mr. Jordan was 
correct, but it was far too late, and they had other priorities.

would eventually represent nearly half of SWA's estimated financial 
loss from the December meltdown.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    SkySolver (officially called ``Crew Optimization'') is a G.E. 
Aerospace crew scheduling tool used by multiple airlines. It is 
important to note that other airlines used this product during Winter 
Storm Elliott without issue. That is because SWA's scheduling practices 
are outdated and its patchwork use of multiple technology systems lacks 
the capacity to provide crew solutions for massive, close-in flight 
cancellations.
III. Timeline of Events--The Southwest Flightmare
Tuesday, December 20: Overconfidence
    On Tuesday, December 20, SWA management met with SWAPA at a 
regularly scheduled operations meeting. SWA noted that Chicago Midway 
airport might be fully closed, and Denver International would see some 
cancellations. The Airline believed there was ample time to process 
these cancellations and mitigate any irregular operations.
    SWA admitted it did not have enough engine covers to protect 
aircraft engines from the elements before the storm.<SUP>x</SUP> 
Managers did not issue guidance to run aircraft auxiliary power units 
overnight to keep aircraft from freezing. There was no system-wide 
guidance on cold-weather preparation of ground equipment like baggage 
loaders and push-back tugs. Extra schedulers were not on reserve. 
Overtime incentives were not offered in time.

    Managers' overconfidence in their planning and a systemic failure 
to provide modern tools to employees doomed SWA's recovery before the 
first snowflake hit the ground.
Wednesday, December 21: The Initial Reaction
    The Airline started Wednesday believing that no bases would be shut 
down. However, they announced that Denver and Chicago would continue to 
see some advance cancellations for the following days.
    On Wednesday night, Denver's weather deteriorated. The airport 
experienced freezing whiteout conditions with heavy snow, quarter-mile 
visibility with winds gusting to 32 knots, and a temperature of -8 
degrees Fahrenheit.
    As a result, departures and arrivals were significantly delayed. 
The delays significantly strained Ground Operations and caused Pilot 
duty day and flight connection issues.
    As the storm hit Denver's airport, SWA's Vice President of Ground 
Operations declared an operational emergency, forcing mandatory 
overtime and threatening ground personnel with insubordination and 
termination for not coming to work.<SUP>xi</SUP> SWA management's 
draconian initial reaction to its poor planning reflects a deeper 
cultural failure.

Thursday, December 22: The Operation Convulses
    As dawn broke on Thursday, close-in cancellations started to 
increase rapidly, indicating the network was struggling to recover from 
the previous night's events.
    When these close-in cancellations hit, scheduling had already built 
plans to deal with delays, crew duty limitations, and rest issues for 
the next day. However, these unexpected close-in cancellations meant 
they had to start over from scratch. This started the chain of events 
causing internal technology and process failures that eventually 
collapsed the network.

Friday, December 23: User Error
    Dispatch's Baker passenger and flight optimizer has minimal crew 
programming. As a result, Baker produced an ineffective recovery plan 
because it didn't align with crew availability. SkySolver runs 
independent pilot and flight attendant solutions that can contradict 
Baker's strategy, especially during a disruption.
    Meanwhile, the Vice President of Flight Operations sent a memo on 
the 23rd detailing system-wide problems. The vice president blamed 
pilot sick calls, fatigue rates, and overtime flying participation in 
the memo. SWA managers initial response and communication blamed 
employees even while internal processes crumbled.
    While managers blamed pilot staffing early on, SWA chose to use 
reserve pilots before overtime volunteers to save money. In addition, 
the Airline's managers failed to communicate effectively with each 
other and with the employees, showing they didn't even grasp the 
problem the airline faced.
    SWA Flight Operations leadership finally announced they would award 
overtime premium flying before using reserves, but it was too little 
too late. Southwest had failed to incentivize overtime flying early 
enough to make a difference. Due to the severity of the breakdown, it 
might not have mattered anyhow.
Saturday, December 24--December 25: Chaos
    SWA Crew Scheduling was utterly overwhelmed and informed dispatch 
that they couldn't handle any further inquiries. The situation had 
become chaotic in the Network Operations Center.
    The Airline could not track crews stuck at airports without hotels, 
and due to increasing cancellations, they could not recover crews into 
actual flying because the system had become so thin.
    This breakdown in communication between the SWA Network Operation 
Center and Crew Scheduling resulted from institutional silos made worse 
by technology limitations.
    As the Airline struggled to connect airplanes with crews, another 
glaring IT inadequacy became apparent: Southwest's crew hotel system 
could not handle large, short-notice reassignments.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    With the enormous number of close-in cancellations and 
reassignments, SWA's Crew Hotel Accommodation Team could not keep up 
with the number of short-notice requirements. As a result, stranded 
crews and passengers competed for hotels, quickly overwhelming the 
Airline's system to get crews rested and ready to fly.
    Phone lines to scheduling were jammed, and crews spent hours on 
hold if they could get through at all. As a result, many crews had no 
hotels, just like their passengers. This led to more reassignments and 
uncovered flying, putting recovery farther out of reach.
    Over 350 pilots had their assignments terminate somewhere other 
than their home base, leaving them on their own to get home. SWAPA 
estimates that over 1,000 Pilots were on duty for more than 15 hours 
during the meltdown, with many on continuous duty overnights awaiting 
schedule changes.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Meanwhile, communication between scheduling and operations began to 
break down. For example, pilots reported that crew lists were 
inaccurate because the scheduling systems misassigned crewmembers or 
lost track of them outright.<SUP>xii</SUP> As a result, tracking 
crewmembers became a manual process for scheduling, adding to call 
volume and hours-long hold times, making delays worse.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    SWA began using position ferry flights to re-align crew and 
aircraft. These ferry flights operated empty--with no passengers. Many 
were operated on routes that had been canceled between the same cities, 
leaving stranded passengers to watch empty aircraft depart for their 
intended destination. During the meltdown, the Airline operated more 
than 500 empty flights.

Monday, December 26: The Post-Christmas Hangover
    SWA decided to reduce the entire network by more than 50 percent 
through Thursday, December 29, to ``reset'' the airline. Southwest 
chose to ``cut with an axe'' and cancel anything they considered ``un-
crewed'' rather than force Dispatch to consider crew availability in 
their cancellation assessments.
    This decision caused even more misconnections from crews to 
airplanes as it blew up the schedule for crews assigned to that 
aircraft flow. This created more deadhead duty (often later than 
originally scheduled), taking seats from passengers and reducing 
recovery effectiveness.
    SWA could not even promote some deadheading pilots to work the same 
flight they were deadheading on, which would have saved flights from 
cancellation. Very few canceled flights didn't have a Captain and a 
First Officer assigned at cancellation.

Tuesday, December 27: The Ugly Truth About SWA's Operational Processes
    SWA COO Andrew Watterson released a message the night of the 26th, 
stating that Crew Scheduling was forced to manually route crews with 
pencil and paper because of technology limitations.
    Mr. Watterson said, ``We had aircraft that were available, but the 
process of matching those Crew Members with the aircraft could not be 
handled by our technology. In our desired state, we have a solver that 
would be able to do that very quickly and accurately. Our system today 
cannot do that.'' <SUP>xiii</SUP> This is the first time Southwest 
leaders acknowledged an underlying technology issue.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    **Note: In an interview with Axios on February 2, 2023, CEO Bob 
Jordan stated: ``I think the biggest misconception right away was that 
it was a technology issue. We tried to be really clear that while the 
technology got overwhelmed, it is not what caused this.''
    ``It was a weather event that turned into a crew and aircraft 
routing network event, that then pushed the technology to a point that 
it couldn't help us because it was having to solve problems that were 
already in the past_but it wasn't a technology event.'' <SUP>xiv</SUP>

    The number of Pilots not operating flights spiked, given the large 
number of cancellations versus how many Pilots were scheduled to fly. 
Deadheading Pilots ranged between 1,000 to more than 2,500 daily, 
refuting any notion that there weren't enough pilots available.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    The Pilots were there; the airline couldn't use them efficiently. 
This Crew Scheduling inefficiency must change if the airline is to 
offer reliable customer service in the future.

  <bullet> Unknown--the amount of profit-sharing compensation SWA 
        employees lost due to poor management decisions
V. Leadership & Collaboration
    SWAPA hopes that Southwest's new leadership team will collaborate 
with us. Our pilots want nothing more than to work together to return 
Southwest Airlines to success.
    Mr. Jordan and Mr. Watterson inherited a massive, complex operation 
held together by duct tape and baling wire. It will take time to tear 
down and rebuild. But it can happen if Southwest's new leaders re-
dedicate to Herb Kelleher's leadership principles.
    To start, SWA employees need to trust their leadership again. Herb 
famously said, ``Your employees come first. And if you treat your 
employees right, guess what? Your customers come back, and that makes 
your shareholders happy. Start with employees and the rest follows from 
that.''
    However, rewarding SWA executives who oversaw the meltdown with 
more stock options--after employees are set to miss out on significant 
compensation from lost profit sharing--is not a promising sign for 
``Living the Southwest Way.'' <SUP>xviii</SUP> On Friday, February 3, 
2023, the Airline announced $8.8M in stock options for seven senior 
executives, including Gary Kelly, Bob Jordan, and Andrew 
Watterson.<SUP>xix</SUP>

people-first-301566969.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mr. Jordan must make clear that SWA employees are valued by making 
them financially whole and giving them the tools, they need to do their 
jobs. Sending Pilots and Flight Attendants around the country on 
airplane rides for four days instead of taking passengers home is a 
blatant waste of resources.
    It's also not enough to tell someone you love them after ignoring 
their concerns for over a decade. Mr. Jordan must show all of us--
customers, employees, and regulators--through actions, not words, that 
SWA is serious about change.
    There are some positive signs. SWAPA commends Mr. Jordan and his 
team for the expeditious way they managed the return of tens of 
thousands of articles of lost luggage and their willingness to refund 
and reimburse customers for every reasonable expense related to their 
travel nightmare.
    It is also encouraging that SWA is currently conducting another 
postmortem with the aviation consulting firm Oliver Wyman. But our 
Pilots are right to demand that SWAPA Subject Matter Experts be invited 
to participate in a meaningful way. A one-hour debrief with the SWAPA 
President will not be enough. If the airline is genuinely committed to 
finding solutions, it must utilize and collaborate with its frontline 
experts to find solutions.
    SWAPA stands ready and willing to work with SWA leaders to solve 
these fixable problems.
VI. What Congress Can Do
    To be clear--no legislative or regulatory solution is necessary to 
solve this problem. Furthermore, SWA's point-to-point business model is 
not to blame. Passengers enjoy the convenience that a point-to-point 
network provides, eliminating the need to fly to a connecting city to 
reach their destination. In addition, the point-to-point network is a 
unique offering that gives Southwest Airlines a competitive advantage--
when well-managed.
    The December meltdown resulted from poor planning, systemic under-
investment in crew scheduling technology and processes, and a failure 
to collaborate with frontline employees. To that end, SWAPA 
respectfully asks Congress to recommend the following fixes to prevent 
future meltdowns:

1.  Fix Dates. SWA should provide Congress with a firm timeline for 
        when crew scheduling technology and associated crew management 
        processes will be fixed.

2.  Postmortem. SWAPA Subject Matter Experts should be invited to 
        participate in the Company's postmortem meaningfully. In 
        addition, the Company should tell Congress why they've failed 
        to implement the recommendations of past postmortems.

3.  Employee Collaboration. Congress should ask SWA to include 
        frontline labor groups in implementing realistic and effective 
        contingency plans, including full-scale simulations and 
        exercises.

4.  Full Accounting. The Airline should provide Congress with a precise 
        plan on how SWA plans to invest the $1 billion in IT upgrades 
        it claims to be developing and how those plans will effectively 
        mitigate potential future meltdowns.

    The American people deserve a safe, reliable air transportation 
system. In aviation, admitting mistakes and learning from them is the 
single most effective method for producing meaningful change that 
benefits consumers, businesses, and employees. By learning from SWA's 
mistakes, the commercial aviation industry can do its part to minimize 
future disruptions and provide safe, efficient air service for American 
consumers.
VII. Conclusion
    By now, it should be clear what conditions led our country's most 
stable and profitable airline--SWA--to a historic meltdown like holiday 
travelers suffered in December of 2022. But, like most disasters, it 
didn't happen overnight. Warning signs were ignored. Poor performance 
was condoned. Excuses were made. Processes atrophied. Core values were 
forgotten.
    The phrase ``Normalization of Drift'' was coined after studying the 
Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. It describes common underlying 
conditions within an organization preceding a preventable catastrophic 
event. These management pitfalls include ignored warning signs, 
condoned poor performance, repeated excuses, atrophied processes, and 
forgotten core values. Normalized drift was the root cause of the SWA 
meltdown.
    Much has been made of the Airline's shortcomings in I.T. and 
technology, and while that is a causal factor in this mess, that 
explanation alone misses the underlying issue. The conditions were set 
years ago when SWA's leaders allowed Drift Normalization. As a result, 
the Airline got away from an employee-centered culture that empowered 
and listened to frontline workers. SWA leaders failed to provide 
employees the necessary tools to do their job.
    We hope that SWAPA's data-driven testimony provides value to the 
Airline industry, the Committee, and the public. We all want to 
understand how this happened and what must be done--together--to ensure 
it never happens again.
    SWAPA thanks Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, Chair Duckworth, 
and all the Committee Members for the opportunity to testify on this 
critical issue.
    SWAPA would like to recognize all the Members of the Committee who 
supported the Payroll Support Program. Without that critical support, 
many Southwest Pilots may have lost their jobs during the pandemic, 
making recovery even more difficult and labored. We also sincerely 
thank the Committee's professional and member office staff for their 
efforts.

    The Chair. Thank you, Captain Murray. Now, we will welcome 
Mr. Watterson. Thank you so much for being here.

    STATEMENT OF ANDREW WATTERSON, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, 
                     SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.

    Mr. Watterson. Good morning, Madam Chair Cantwell, Ranking 
Member Cruz, and members of the Committee. I am Andrew 
Watterson and I am privileged to serve as the Chief Operating 
Officer of Southwest Airlines. I know that Southwest's 
operational disruption during the last week of December has 
garnered a tremendous amount of attention, so I appreciate your 
opportunity to testify on behalf of the company regarding 
airline operations and consumer protections.
    I want to sincerely and humbly apologize to those impacted 
by the disruption. It caused a tremendous amount of anguish, 
inconvenience, and missed opportunities for our customers and 
our employees during a time of year when people want to gather 
with their families and avoid stressful situations.
    We understand that for many, this is perhaps the most 
important trip they take all year. Again, on behalf of 
Southwest Airlines, I am deeply sorry. Still, we have been 
mindful that an apology alone, no matter how heartfelt or how 
often stated, would not suffice. We immediately recognized we 
had to take care of our customers.
    And with regard to disruption, we did so, in a variety of 
ways, allowing customers to rebook their travel at no cost, 
effectively doubling our normal time for rebooking, granting 
all reasonable reimbursement requests for our customers' out-
of-pocket expenses, including hotels, rental cars, meals, 
tickets in other airlines, and other necessary expenses like 
replacement car seats and strollers and pet sitting services.
    We promptly processed refunds requested by customers for 
unused airfare for any Southwest flight canceled or severely 
disrupted during this period. We prioritized returning the bags 
to the proper owners. I am pleased to report that except for a 
small percentage of recent requests, we have completed all 
those steps.
    And it has truly been an all-hands-on deck effort, and our 
people will not let up until the requests are completed. We 
also made an additional gesture of goodwill, 25,000 Rapid 
Reward points, roughly a $300 value, to every customer 
significantly impacted by the disruption. So, why did this 
happen? Let me be clear, we messed up, and I would like to 
explain to you how we messed up. In hindsight, we did not have 
enough winter operations resiliency, from where and how we de-
ice aircraft, to the cold resistancy of our ground support 
equipment and infrastructure.
    Our high rates of cancellation in Denver and Chicago, where 
25 percent of our flight crews are based, caused our crews to 
be displaced. At this point, the disruption changed from a 
weather event that all airlines experienced to a crew event 
that was unique to us. And once again, when I say crew event, 
it has nothing to do with the behavior of our employees, it has 
to do with how we manage the crew network.
    As the storm moved East, other Southwest airports of all 
sizes in the Central and Eastern part of the country began 
experiencing similar operational disruptions, and the cascade 
of challenges led to ways of cancellations within 2 hours of 
departure. This overwhelmed our crews scheduling processes and 
technology. We had upgraded this system earlier in the year, 
but we are taking a fresh look at it and other systems of how 
we should improve. Ultimately, none of this is an excuse.
    We need to make sure our operational resiliency and 
technology are strengthened for future extreme weather events, 
no matter how unprecedented. We owe that to our customers and 
to our employees. To that end, we have moved swiftly to make 
our systems more resilient and reduce the risk of further 
disruptions.
    We prioritized enhancements to our cruise scheduling 
software, we strengthened our early indicators dashboard to 
escalate operational issues earlier, and we established 
supplemental operational staffing that can quickly mobilize to 
support crew recovery efforts. And we implemented 
organizational changes designed to improve coordination among 
key divisions. We also are already several weeks underway on 
improving our structural capabilities around our winter 
operations.
    Finally, Southwest is taking additional steps to more 
thoroughly analyze the disruption and understand how the 
accumulation of events led us to the end result, from internal 
department reviews to engagement by our Board of Directors and 
Commission, and a rigorous third party assessment. Based on all 
this work, we will then reassess our current plans and make any 
necessary changes.
    We will invest what is needed to execute that plan in a 
timely and efficient manner. Let me conclude by reiterating 
that Southwest believes in building lasting relationships with 
the communities we serve. We are intensely focused on reducing 
the risk of repeating the operational disruption we had in 
December, and repairing the trust of our company has had and 
earned over a 52-year history.
    I will certainly follow up with your constituents, Chair, 
when I return to Dallas. And I thank you and look forward to 
answer your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Watterson follows:]

   Prepared Statement of Andrew Watterson, Chief Operating Officer, 
                         Southwest Airlines Co.
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of the Committee:

    My name is Andrew Watterson, and I am privileged to serve as Chief 
Operating Officer at Southwest Airlines. Thank you for inviting 
Southwest to testify regarding airline operations and consumer 
protections, with an understandable focus on Southwest's operational 
disruption during the last week of December.
    First and foremost, I want to take a moment to sincerely and humbly 
apologize to those who were impacted by this disruption. It caused a 
tremendous amount of anguish, inconvenience, and missed opportunities 
for our Customers and Employees during a time of year when people want 
to gather with their families and avoid stressful situations. Again, on 
behalf of Southwest Airlines, I am sorry.
    As a Company, we are intensely focused on learning from this event 
by taking immediate mitigation efforts, undertaking department-level 
assessments and actions, and conducting a systemic review supported by 
a third party. Our Board of Directors also has formed an Operations 
Review Committee to guide ongoing management efforts. We are committed 
to thoroughly examining our operation, route network, processes, and 
technological capabilities to avoid putting our Customers and Employees 
in that situation again.
    While I am not proud of what happened, I am very proud of how our 
People responded. We have a long, proud record of delivering on 
Customer expectations. And, when we fall short, we aim to do what's 
right. This includes prioritizing Customer refunds and reimbursements, 
which we have accomplished within government-mandated timeframes, as 
well as providing additional gestures of goodwill. We are working to 
repair the trust our Company has earned over our 52-year history, and 
we're committed to being America's most loved and reliable airline. I 
believe we're on our way to achieving that goal.
Why Did This Happen?
    Let me be clear: we messed up. In hindsight, we did not have enough 
winter operational resilience.
    Leading up to the event, our operations performed well throughout 
2022 relative to the rest of the industry. In the fourth quarter, we 
had seen our on-time performance of 80.0 percent improve over the prior 
year's result of 72.6 percent and experienced a multi-year high by 
achieving a flight completion factor of 99.1 percent. However, from 
December 21st to December 29th, Southwest experienced a historic event 
with a combination of challenges we hadn't experienced before. What 
began as a weather event on December 21st turned into a Crew Scheduling 
event by December 24th.
    As we normally do for large weather events, we developed a plan 
that included pre-canceling flights to reduce activity to an hourly 
rate that was consistent with our proven capabilities. However, the 
sub-zero temperatures, high winds, and frozen precipitation were worse 
than forecast, which had a wide-ranging impact on our station 
operations, especially at Denver and Chicago Midway. During this time 
period, we struggled to keep the operation moving at these key airports 
due to a number of factors, including the amount of deicing equipment 
and related infrastructure, the effect of the extreme cold on jet 
bridge hydraulics and ground support equipment fuel, and even, for 
example, the location of our gates and deicing pads. It became clear 
that, with the storm severely disrupting our Denver and Chicago Midway 
stations concurrently, we did not have enough resiliency in our 
operation for the severe effect this winter event had on us.
    Due to these factors, among others, we could not execute the plan 
we had established for operating during the storm. We were forced to 
cancel almost the entirety of our flight schedule in Denver, which is 
our largest station, between the evening of December 21st and the 
morning of December 23rd and in Chicago Midway, which is our second 
largest station, between midday on December 22nd and through the end of 
day on December 23rd.
    Denver and Chicago Midway are two of our eleven Crew Bases where 
Flight Crews begin and end their duties, and they collectively account 
for 25 percent of Flight Crews. Flight Crews are generally assigned to 
three-day work periods where they operate flights across our network. 
When flights in a Crew Base are cancelled, the Flight Crews assigned to 
those flights are unable to begin their three-day pairings. This leaves 
subsequent flights in their schedule uncovered. If the Crew can be 
assigned to work, or travel on a later flight, they can catch back up 
to their assignments and aircraft. With such a large percentage of 
flights cancelled, for such a long duration, in Denver and Chicago 
especially, the Southwest Airlines Crew Network was under severe stress 
as we entered December 24th. Our Crew Schedulers worked diligently to 
re-assign Crews, where possible, and use Reserve Crews from the other 
Bases to cover the open flying.
    As the storm moved east, other Southwest airports--large, medium 
and small in size--in the central and eastern part of the country began 
experiencing similar winter weather operational challenges. 
Communications among our Network Operations Control (NOC), local 
Station Control Centers, and Crew Scheduling deteriorated as the 
developing operational challenges continued. This lack of effective 
communication and coordination resulted in compounding, frequent, 
close-in flight cancellations, rather than our normal practice of 
batched pre-cancellations further in advance of departure times. This 
created an unprecedented amount and frequency of required changes to 
Crew schedules that overwhelmed our Crew Scheduling processes and 
technology.
    Given the volume of ongoing flight cancellations, we, ultimately, 
decided on December 26th that the best course of action for getting 
back on track operationally was to pre-cancel our flight activity by 
two-thirds for December 27th through December 29th. That decision gave 
us time to reset the operation by getting Crews and aircraft into their 
needed positions so that we could return to normal flight levels 
beginning on December 30th. That tactic proved successful, as we 
operated very smoothly at those reduced levels. The fact that we were 
able to go from operating one-third of our schedule from December 27th-
29th, and, then, bounce back to a full schedule on December 30th, with 
so few issues, is truly a testament to our People and the tireless work 
they put into serving our Customers. However, at the end of the day, 
our response to the severe weather and operational challenges did not 
live up to our standards.
    Since December 30th, our operational performance has been solid. 
The month of January saw several ATC outages, historic precipitation in 
California--where we are the largest carrier--and multiple snowstorms 
in Denver--which, as mentioned, is our largest airport operation. 
Despite these headwinds, our on-time performance was ranked third out 
of the ten largest U.S. airlines for January.
Crew Scheduling
    To be clear, our Crew Scheduling software didn't stop working 
during this event. However, the pace and volume of close-in Crew and 
schedule changes over multiple days left our Crew Scheduling 
professionals unable to efficiently address the state of the operation. 
As the situation escalated and close-in cancellations grew, Crew 
Scheduling simply couldn't keep up with the overwhelming volume of 
changes, resulting in individual Crew assignments not being updated in 
a timely manner. Without updated Crew schedules, the Crew decision 
support software could not reassign Crews to solve for flights with 
Crew coverage issues. Of the three moving parts in our point-to-point 
network--the flight network, the aircraft network, and the Crew 
network--and as far as our technology is concerned, the disruption 
primarily revealed a need to add functionality to our Crew Scheduling 
software to solve for a large backlog of broken Crew pairings.
    Since the disruption, we have prioritized enhancements to our Crew 
software. I will address our other short-term mitigation efforts later. 
However, please know that with the mitigations we have in place, we are 
confident in our flight network and the schedules we have published for 
sale. The upgrade to the Crew software will equip us to better handle 
recovery from a mass cancellation event.
Network Schedule
    We are also aware that questions have been raised about our flight 
network. We have been flying at or near the same flight activity levels 
over the past several months and have continued at that level 
throughout January 2023 with high reliability. Thus, we are confident 
in our ability to operate our published flight schedules and respond to 
irregular operations, such as weather and ATC outages. We have been 
purposeful in increasing our ratio of Employees to aircraft, which is 
currently the highest in our history, to support proper staffing coming 
out of the pandemic. In 2022 alone, we added more than 11,600 new 
Employees, and we intend to continue significant hiring in 2023. Our 
flight network is also supported by sophisticated technology that 
regularly produces new aircraft solutions during more-routine irregular 
operations. These tactics further strengthen our operational 
reliability in less-than-ideal conditions.
Immediate Mitigation Efforts
    In the wake of this disruption, we have taken immediate actions. I 
have already mentioned the upgrades to Crew Scheduling that are in 
progress. In addition, we moved swiftly to put mitigation efforts in 
place to reduce the risk of future operational disruptions and help 
fortify our operational resilience. We strengthened our early indicator 
dashboard that closely monitors operational health and alerts us if we 
approach predefined operational thresholds. We enhanced and will 
continue to add functionality to our existing tools for Crews to 
communicate electronically to Crew Scheduling during irregular 
operations, and we established supplemental operational staffing that 
can quickly mobilize to support Crew recovery efforts at the first sign 
of a potential backlog. We also implemented organizational changes 
designed to improve coordination and communication between our Network 
Operations Control, Network Planning, and Crew Scheduling Teams. 
Finally, we are doing a system-wide review of our preparedness for 
winter operations and will implement any measures necessary to mitigate 
the risk of an event like this occurring in the future.
    As a note, we had an opportunity to test some of these newly-
implemented mitigation efforts during the FAA's Notice to Air Missions 
(NOTAM) technology outage in January. Our Network Operations Control 
Team worked around the clock in constant contact with the FAA and the 
industry so that the NOTAM delivery process was restored and valid 
before we pushed any of our flights. We prioritized Safety, 
verification, and compliance, which is why we did not dispatch flights 
before the FAA ground stop was lifted. We did not sacrifice Safety 
during December's event or the NOTAM event, and we simply won't 
compromise on Safety at any time.
Comprehensive Review
    As we continue to work on immediate efforts, Southwest is also 
taking additional steps to analyze the disruption and understand how 
the accumulation of events led us to the final result. As I mentioned, 
our Board of Directors engaged early on, and the committee it has 
established will work with management and help guide the Company's 
response.
    In addition to the ongoing analysis being conducted by teams in 
several departments such as Flight Operations, Inflight Operations, 
Ground Operations, Network Planning, Crew Scheduling, Network 
Operations Control, and Operational Performance, we've also engaged an 
internationally-respected consultancy, Oliver Wyman, to do a third-
party assessment and make recommendations to inform other mitigation 
efforts--such as opportunities to improve performance on bad weather 
days. We've also asked our unions to participate in the work that is 
being conducted. With this third-party review, and our own review in 
hand, we will reassess the operational modernization plans we already 
had in place for 2023 and make any necessary changes in light of the 
challenges we experienced.
    Additionally, I would like to take a moment to address Southwest's 
technology and systems. We have a long history of innovation and 
continuous improvement, and we have implemented numerous large-scale 
technology and business projects over the past five years. We have 
always invested heavily in technology and will continue to do so.
    For 2023, we are currently budgeted to spend $1.3 billion of our 
annual operating plan on investments, upgrades, and maintenance of our 
IT systems. Now, our internal review of the event, along with the work 
of our third-party consultant, will enable us to validate our go-
forward plan and determine what sequence of improvements is most 
appropriate in terms of supporting our Customers, Employees, and 
technology infrastructure. We will dedicate the capital needed to 
execute that plan in a timely, efficient manner.
Taking Care of Our Customers
    As stated previously, we are keenly aware of the impacts that 
disrupted holiday travel plans have on our Customers and their 
relationship with Southwest. An apology alone, no matter how heartfelt 
or how often stated, would not suffice to make things right. In 
addition to apologizing, acknowledging our shortcomings, and acting to 
strengthen our operational reliability, we immediately recognized we 
had to take care of our Customers.
    Our pro-consumer actions included:

  1.  Implementing Dynamic Waivers, which allowed rebooking at no cost, 
        between December 19th and January 7th and increasing our normal 
        two-week rebooking timeline to 30 days for added Customer 
        convenience.

  2.  Making the unilateral determination that every flight disruption 
        between December 24th and January 2nd was treated as ``within 
        the airline's control,'' regardless of the actual cause, 
        meaning that we would grant all reasonable reimbursement 
        requests for our Customers' out-of-pocket expenses (i.e., 
        hotels, rental cars, meals, tickets on other airlines, etc.), 
        which have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars to date.

  3.  Quickly creating a highly-visible, user-friendly webpage where 
        Customers could easily find information and directions on how 
        to request refunds and reimbursements, and we implemented 
        automation that allowed us to process those requests quicker.

  4.  Promptly processing refunds requested by Customers for unused 
        airfare for any Southwest flight cancelled or significantly 
        delayed during the disruption.

  5.  Prioritizing the return of bags to their rightful owners. This 
        included delivering bags to Customers' homes with the 
        assistance of outside vendors.

    I am happy to report that, except for a small percentage of 
remaining reimbursement requests, we have completed the action steps I 
just outlined. Importantly, these actions go above and beyond 
applicable DOT requirements relating to airline refunds and baggage and 
travel expense reimbursements for flights cancelled or significantly 
delayed by an airline. It has truly been an all-hands-on-deck effort, 
and our People will not let up until all requests are complete.
    As a gesture of goodwill to our Customers, and in addition to 
hundreds of millions of dollars in refunds and reimbursements, we gave 
25,000 Rapid Rewards points--roughly a $300 value--to every Customer 
who was significantly impacted by our disruption between December 24th 
and January 2nd. While the specific circumstances that resulted in 
Customers being impacted differed, we felt it was important that this 
gesture of goodwill go above and beyond regulatory requirements. It was 
simply the right thing to do.
    Finally, we recognized that our internal Customers--our Employees--
were also affected by this event. During an unprecedented set of 
circumstances, our People were seen coming together, as they always do, 
to care for our Customers and each other. Many volunteered to assist 
with the surge of Crew Scheduling and Customer Service needs, and it 
was humbling to see the Southwest spirit at work under such adverse 
conditions. On top of expressing deep gratitude, all operation 
frontline employees were paid gratitude and premium pay through the 
disruption and beyond.
Looking Forward
    As we move forward, Southwest is focused on having the right 
People, equipment, processes, and technology in place to efficiently 
operate the network in all conditions when it is safe to fly. With the 
short-term mitigation elements that we put in place, along with any 
other areas of opportunity that we identify, we believe we are well 
prepared to execute our schedule with the level of reliability that 
Customers and Employees expect and deserve.
    As we evolve our schedule, nearly all of our planned 2023 capacity 
additions will go to existing Southwest markets. These additional 
flights will help to add depth and greater resiliency by providing 
better re-accommodation options for Customers, Crews, and aircraft when 
we have weather or delays that create irregular operations. 
Importantly, our growth plans will also foster greater airline 
competition and all of the consumer and economic benefits which more 
competition produces.
    Southwest believes in building lasting relationships with the 
communities we serve. We are the only major airline that has not ceased 
service to any U.S. airport since the start of the pandemic. We're also 
an airline with a proud history of no bankruptcies since our inception 
in 1971--a 52-year record that no other airline can match. We remain 
committed to being exceptionally pro-Customer and pro-Employee, and 
that includes operating a reliable schedule and providing consumers 
with low fares, more nonstop itineraries, and exceptional service.
Conclusion
    Let me conclude by reiterating that Southwest is intensely focused 
on reducing the risk of repeating the operational disruption we 
experienced in December. We are committed to running a great operation 
each and every day, and I have the utmost confidence that our People, 
processes, and technologies will do just that. Above all, I am beyond 
grateful to our incomparable Southwest Employees for running a safe 
operation, restoring our reliability and resiliency, and providing 
excellent Customer Service.
    Thank you, and I look forward to answering your questions.

    The Chair. Thank you. Ms. Pinkerton.

           STATEMENT OF SHARON PINKERTON, SENIOR VICE

         PRESIDENT, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS,

                      AIRLINES FOR AMERICA

    Ms. Pinkerton. Thank you, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Cruz, for inviting A4A to be a part of this discussion today. 
As we begin, I want to give a shout out to airline employees 
who have done remarkable work in getting our customers safely 
to their destinations throughout the pandemic and during the 
recovery.
    I also want to express our sincere appreciation to the 
committee for your leadership in working with us and our labor 
partners on the payroll support program. As you know, PSP funds 
were critical to keeping tens of thousands of employees on the 
job during the most challenging time in the history of 
aviation.
    It is not an overstatement to say that PSP was the only 
thing standing between some carriers and bankruptcy. During 
those difficult days of the pandemic, we continuously said that 
restarting our industry would be as challenging, if not more 
challenging than the rescue. The good news is that air travel 
rebounded faster than anyone could have predicted, but that 
came with growing pains.
    Air carriers, though, quickly took action to address issues 
within their control. I will talk more about that later. But 
the first thing I want to do is address our commitment to our 
customers. Simply put, airlines want their passengers to be 
repeat customers. They compete fiercely on customer service. 
That is why U.S. airlines not only comply with legal 
requirements, but they go above and beyond.
    On customer service issues, we put our money where our 
mouth is. I will give you an example. Since the pandemic, U.S. 
passenger carriers have issued more than $32 billion in cash 
refunds, that is an average of $900 million a month, in 
addition to other forms of compensation. And that is why refund 
complaints last year dropped significantly and were under 0.01 
percent.
    Along those lines, we have absolutely no incentive to delay 
or cancel flights. Safety is our top priority. If it is not 
safe to fly, our planes won't take off. Which gets me back to 
the factors for the operational challenges in 2022. At the 
beginning of 2022, you may remember, Omicron created 
unpredictable staffing and absenteeism challenges for both the 
FAA and airlines.
    The entire system last year experienced extreme weather, 
thunderstorms, flooding, not to mention hurricanes Ian and 
Nicole, and a bomb cyclone. It is not surprising then for that 
the first 11 months of 2022, which are the months that DOT has 
published, two-thirds of U.S. airline flight cancellations were 
caused by extreme weather at 56 percent, and the NAS, national 
aviation system, at 10 percent collectively.
    In other words, 66 percent of the cancellations were out of 
the carrier's control. With that said, carriers take 
responsibility for the 34 percent of the cancellations that 
were within their control, and they have taken decisive actions 
to address those issues. What did they do? They reduced their 
schedules by 15 percent.
    They have been on a hiring binge. We hired over 50,000 
employees last year. We are at an all-time high record for the 
last 20 years. Our growth rate has been 2 to 3 times the job 
growth rate broadly in the United States, and those are airline 
jobs that pay, on average 20-37 percent more than the average 
private sector job. Now, there have been lessons learned from 
the pandemic.
    Like most other airlines--or most other industries, 
airlines had to change their staffing models. Several airlines 
indicate they need 5 to 15 percent more staff to deliver a 
smaller schedule. While training and onboarding takes time, 
carriers are creating larger reserves, we are creating schedule 
buffers, and we are investing record amounts in technology to 
ensure resiliency. It is well documented that the FAA is also 
facing staffing challenges, and as we saw last month, FAA is 
working with antiquated technology.
    On the staffing side, ATC has been saying for years that 
there is a controller staffing shortage. We support 2023 
omnibus language that creates a process by which FAA and ATC 
are working together to identify which facilities are short 
staffed. Follow up on that is needed. FAA's technology issues 
came into the national spotlight last month when the NOTAM 
outage caused a nationwide ground stop, the first since 9/11.
    What didn't receive as much attention were earlier in the 
month when technology issues in Miami resulted in a day's worth 
of long delays for anyone traveling in and out of Florida. I am 
not placing blame or pointing fingers. What industries are 
saying is that FAA needs sufficient and stable resources to 
update their technology along with accountability. We are 
pleased Secretary Buttigieg believes, like we all do, in the 
need to invest in the future and in infrastructure.
    That infrastructure must include personnel and technology. 
In closing, carriers are doubling down on our efforts to 
improve our operational performance, but ensuring operational 
reliability is the most critical action airlines and Government 
can take together for a better customer experience.
    Airlines are investing record amounts in their people, 
their technology, and tools to support operations and 
customers. It is paying off. We saw strong operational 
performance for the industry as a whole in the last 5 months of 
2022, in the first month of 2023, and we expect that to 
continue. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Pinkerton follows:]

    Prepared Statement of Sharon Pinkerton, Senior Vice President, 
        Legislative and Regulatory Affairs, Airlines for America
Thank You
    Airlines for America (A4A) appreciates the opportunity to testify 
on and bring a broader context to the state of airline operations and 
consumer protections. We value the Committee's continued interest and 
focus on our industry and these important issues. We are thankful for 
the many members of this Committee who have dedicated significant time 
and resources toward understanding the nuances and logistical 
challenges our interconnected aviation system can face every day in 
order to craft effective policies tailored to benefit safety, the 
traveling public and the men and women of our industry. No better 
example of this leadership was the crafting, enacting and 
implementation of the bipartisan Payroll Support Program (PSP).
    PSP was critical to ensuring that U.S. airline employees remained 
on the job, ready to go and able to provide essential services 
throughout the pandemic, including transporting first responders, 
shipping medical equipment and eventually distributing vaccines. PSP 
ensured that U.S. airlines were able to make payroll and protect the 
jobs of flight attendants, pilots, gate agents, mechanics and others 
throughout the most harrowing months of the pandemic when the industry 
was in dire financial straits.
    PSP was an overwhelming and widely recognized success--backed by 
labor unions and management in addition to the bicameral, bipartisan 
support in Congress--that kept employees on the job with a paycheck, 
healthcare and retirement contributions without straining federal, 
state and local unemployment programs. Without PSP, U.S. airlines would 
have been forced to implement massive layoffs, dramatically reduce 
service and cancel hundreds of aircraft orders.
    While PSP was many things, it was not a panacea for addressing all 
the economic impacts and unique challenges posed by a pandemic. 
However, it was an effective and necessary policy that provided an 
important human capital bridge and systemwide framework capable of 
responding to the resurgence in travel demand in 2022. While 2022 
operations were certainly beset by many factors and challenges, we 
would not have seen or experienced the modicum of recovery without PSP. 
PSP was a successful tactical investment in critical infrastructure and 
human capital that put the U.S. well ahead of many of our international 
partners--and competitors--who did not have the foresight to invest 
strategically. The entire aviation industry is grateful for your work, 
vision and leadership.
2022/2023 Systemwide Operational Accountability
    There is no doubt that 2022 was one of the most difficult 
operational years in history. However, air carriers took responsibility 
and quickly took actions to address issues within their control. 
Airlines take customer service commitments very seriously and, as a 
baseline, it is important to note that airlines have absolutely no 
incentive to delay or cancel flights and only do so when circumstances 
dictate. While the details of any specific given delay or cancellation 
are contingent on the unique operating variables that led to it, a wide 
array of challenges may contribute to the decision. Variables can 
certainly include circumstances within the airline's control, such as 
maintenance/crew issues or IT failures, and air carriers routinely take 
full responsibility and are accountable for those events both through 
Department of Transportation (DOT) rules and regulation compliance and 
enforcement actions and through the court of public opinion.
    In fact, there are innate disincentives for air carriers to incur 
operational disruptions, exemplified by the recent Southwest Airlines 
incident in December 2022, which in part led not only to their 
participation in this hearing, but also to a DOT investigation and the 
significant financial impacts and ramifications outlined in my 
colleague's testimony. I can assure you that no one at Southwest, or 
any other airline for that matter, takes these events lightly and ever 
wants them to happen. But when they do, there is certainly no lack of 
accountability.
    Conversely, we hope there can also be accountability and broader 
context applied to other factors and variables that lead to delays or 
cancellations. While U.S. airlines are doing everything possible to 
make improvements to operational factors within their control, there 
are many factors beyond their control--including extreme weather, air 
traffic control (ATC) staffing or systems issues, airport power 
outages, National Air Space (NAS) volume and law enforcement activity. 
One can also question where the incentives and disincentives lie for 
ATC and NAS accountability, and this is an area on which we would 
encourage the Committee to focus its attention and oversight. As an 
industry, we are committed to addressing issues on our end; the 
government, which is a critical component of our supply chain, should 
focus on its end and take accountability for failings as well.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Analysis of 2022 data provides a good example for how broader 
review can provide context to what is actually happening across the 
aviation system. While acknowledging that DOT has not yet released data 
for December, for the first 11 months of 2022, 66 percent of flight 
cancellations in the system were caused by weather (56 percent) and the 
NAS (10 percent) collectively, as our Nation experienced unprecedented 
weather events, ATC staffing shortages amid rising volume from 
commercial aviation and general aviation as well as an increase in 
commercial space launches.
    Further, at the onset of 2022, the country experienced several 
significant winter storms and air carriers dealt with the unpredictable 
staffing/absenteeism challenges caused by the Omicron variant. Moving 
into the Memorial Day holiday and the summer months, the system 
experienced significant thunderstorm activity, carrier staffing 
challenges and numerous ATC facility and system challenges including 
staffing issues that resulted in ground delay programs and ground 
stops, along with several runway closures.
    As we transitioned to the fall, the system had to deal with the 
impacts of Hurricane Ian in September and Hurricane Nicole in November, 
among others, and in the final week of December the country was hit 
with a bomb cyclone. Despite all these events, preliminary data show 
that U.S. airlines completed more than 97 percent of flights at U.S. 
airports in 2022--meaning that fewer than 3 percent of flights were 
canceled.
    In January 2023, despite two major Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) system outages and several winter storms, airlines canceled just 
2 percent of flights, better than January 2018, 2019 and 2022.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Some of the issues beyond the airlines' control included:

  <bullet> January 2: The FAA En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) 
        system had a failure that forced the agency to order a ground 
        stop, slowing traffic at Florida airports. Also, there was 
        reduced visibility in Orlando (MCO) and Fort Lauderdale (FLL) 
        along with winter storms in the west that brought low 
        visibility, rain, and wind to San Francisco (SFO), as well as 
        snow in Denver (DEN) that extended into Minneapolis (MSP) and 
        Chicago.

  <bullet> January 4: Thunderstorms in Charlotte (CLT) and central 
        Florida.

  <bullet> January 11: Nationwide ground stop due to a FAA Notice to 
        Air Missions (NOTAM) system outage. Once the ground stop was 
        lifted, airlines and airports struggled with managing compacted 
        demand and recovering diversions resulting in particularly 
        acute cancellations at Ronald Reagan National (DCA), LaGuardia 
        (LGA) and CLT.

  <bullet> January 25: Low visibility, snow and wind hit Chicago and 
        Detroit; strong winds and low ceilings impacted LGA.

  <bullet> January 30-31: Low ceilings in Las Vegas (LAS) reduced 
        arrival/departure capacity during high-volume periods; winter 
        storms with snow, ice and unusually cold temperatures impacted 
        several airports in Texas and the Southeast.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]        

    Despite these many challenges, airlines remain committed to using 
every tool at their disposal to provide a safe and smooth experience to 
the traveling public, and our industry will do all it can to maintain 
and continually improve operational reliability.
State of the Industry
    Jobs & Staffing. U.S. airlines have had an acute focus on staffing 
and have been working diligently and continually to address operational 
challenges within their control by hiring additional staff and 
adjusting schedules to improve reliability. As 2022 progressed, 
carriers proactively reduced their scheduled departures from their 
initial levels by about 15 percent to improve operational reliability.
    At the same time, like many other industries across the economy, 
airlines also quickly had to adjust to new employment realities and 
modify pre-pandemic staffing models. For example, in the second half of 
2022, carriers continued to observe higher-than-pre-pandemic rates of 
absenteeism, and several carriers have indicated that they now require 
5-10 percent more staff to operate the same amount of pre-pandemic 
capacity. These factors led to aggressive hiring tactics that have 
resulted in the U.S. passenger airlines adding 50,000 employees over 
the course of 2022.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    In fact, as of November 2022, U.S. passenger airlines had their 
highest employment level in more than 20 years (since July 2002) and 
were adding jobs at a rate more than twice that of the U.S. economy.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Carriers have also been focused on securing a pipeline of employees 
across the industry to accommodate future demand for air travel and 
have invested heavily in new programs, including apprenticeships, pilot 
academies and partnerships with universities. These pathways offer 
tremendous opportunities, and airlines are proud to offer high-quality, 
career track jobs that are well-paying and provide solid benefits. For 
example, in 2021, per the latest data point available from the Bureau 
of Economic Analysis, air transportation employees earned wages 37 
percent higher than the average private sector employee.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Debt. Even with all the public and private actions taken over the 
course of the pandemic, U.S. carriers amassed a significant amount of 
debt, which ended 2022 just shy of $150 billion in 2022. This debt 
comes with heavy cash outlays for interest. In fact, net interest 
expense tripled from 2019 to 2021 and will remain elevated through 
2023. As of February 7, nine publicly traded U.S. airlines had 
published their full-year 2022 results, posting just $2.5 billion in 
pre-tax earnings--a modest 1.3 percent pre-tax profit margin. Notably, 
that comes on the heels of $49 billion in pre-lax losses recorded in 
2020 and 2021 combined.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Costs. In 2022, U.S. airline unit costs, including interest 
expense, were approximately 30 percent higher than in 2019. This 
includes the higher costs in the price of jet fuel, which averaged 83 
percent more in 2022 than in 2019 and, in January 2023, was 109 percent 
higher than in January 2019.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Record Reinvestment. U.S. passenger airlines are reinvesting record 
sums in their products to continually improve the customer experience, 
enhance operational reliability, increase efficiency and reduce 
emissions. In addition to aircraft, facilities and ground equipment, 
this includes a wide range of customer-facing technology initiatives 
that make it easier for travelers to shop for tickets and other 
services; check in for their journeys and navigate airports; check or 
track bags; to modify their itineraries; redeem vouchers or loyalty 
points; and to stay apprised in real-time of changes to their flights 
during irregular operations.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    This has also been matched by record investments by U.S. airports, 
supported predominantly by rents, landing fees, parking fees, 
concessions, ticket taxes and other revenues generated from airport 
customers.

Deregulation Continues to Benefit Consumers
    Prior to the pandemic, we were experiencing what many have called 
the ``Golden Age'' of air travel. U.S. airlines were flying a record 
2.5 million passengers and more than 58,000 tons of cargo each day. 
Those record numbers were in large part because of two main factors: 
affordability and accessibility. Accounting for inflation, and 
including ancillary services, average domestic ticket prices fell 15 
percent from 2014-2019, 22 percent from 2000-2019 and 44 percent from 
1979-2019--the 40-year period following the Airline Deregulation Act of 
1978. Those lower fares made commercial air travel accessible to nearly 
all Americans. Air travel was opening doors, connecting loved ones and 
generating opportunity across all walks of life and economic 
circumstances demonstrating that air travel is not just for the 
affluent anymore.
    While the financial repercussions of the pandemic will be felt for 
years, the value proposition to consumers for air travel is still 
strong: it is affordable and accessible, and airlines are reinvesting 
record sums to continuously improve the product. U.S. airlines strive 
to provide the highest levels of customer service, and commercial air 
travel in the U.S. is safer and more environmentally friendly than ever 
before thanks in large part to the competition and innovation unleashed 
by multiple decades of deregulated air service.
Airline Fares
    In 2021, domestic air travel (including ancillary fees) was 55 
percent less expensive than it was in 1979. In 2022, inflation-adjusted 
fares averaged 6.8 percent below 2019. U.S. airlines have maintained 
this level of affordability while facing significantly higher costs, as 
detailed in the previous section.

Competition, Consumer Protection & Reregulation
    In November 2021, Compass Lexecon released a report \1\ entitled 
`The U.S. Airline Industry: Myths vs. Facts' which concluded that 
competition in the U.S. airline industry remains dynamic and robust, to 
the benefit of consumers, communities, the U.S. economy and airline 
employees. The report also summarizes that:

  <bullet> Today's airline industry offers consumers more choices among 
        and between carriers competing with different business models 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        than ever before.

  <bullet> The lack of entry barriers and more comprehensive networks 
        made possible by mergers has resulted in the average number of 
        competitors per domestic city pair increasing from 3.33 to 3.44 
        over the past two decades.

  <bullet> Lower cost carriers have entered hundreds of new routes and 
        now carry nearly half of all domestic passengers; nearly nine 
        of ten domestic passengers have lower cost carrier options for 
        their travel.

  <bullet> Lower cost carriers (including new entrants) are growing 
        several times faster than the U.S. global network carriers and 
        have hundreds of additional aircraft on order to support future 
        growth.

  <bullet> Mergers between the large network carriers have enabled them 
        to regain their financial footing and restore their growth, 
        including to small communities that depend on their large hub 
        and spoke networks.

    The facts and data show that passengers greatly benefit from 
vigorous airline competition, which creates greater choice and service 
options. Congress recognized the benefits to consumers when they acted 
on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to deregulate the airline industry in 
1978. At the same time, Congress also recognized that DOT needed to be 
a principled regulator and granted DOT broad regulatory authority and 
charged the Department to regulate with three complimentary 
considerations, which remain part of DOT's mission today:

  <bullet> Prevent unfair, deceptive, predatory or anticompetitive 
        practices;

  <bullet> Place ``maximum reliance'' on competitive market forces and 
        on actual and potential competition; and

  <bullet> Maintain an air transportation system that relies on actual 
        and potential competition to provide efficiency, innovation and 
        low prices, and to determine the variety, quality, and price of 
        air transportation services.

    We acknowledge the need for a principled regulator, and our 
industry does not oppose all regulations. Rather, we firmly believe 
that regulation of airline services or practices should only be 
promulgated in response to proven market failures or when DOT has 
evidence of the need for government intervention in the marketplace to 
prevent actual consumer harm. We believe the same complimentary 
considerations should be exercised by Congress.
    However, despite DOT's robust regulatory framework and the broad 
authority in this area, over the course of the pandemic our industry 
has needed to remain nimble and vigilant to many well-intended, but 
sometimes unnecessary, mis-guided and/or untimely, legislative and 
regulatory proposals. Some examples, among many others, are:

  <bullet> Refunds. Some in Congress and the DOT, through a Notice of 
        Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), have proposed significant changes 
        to DOT's airline refund requirements even though U.S. passenger 
        airlines have been and remain keenly responsive to customers' 
        refund interests. We support many of provisions in DOT's 
        proposal, such as getting to a single definition of what 
        constitutes a significant delay, but also have recommendations 
        on how to ensure that some of these provisions are clear and do 
        not have unintended consequences. Today, A4A member carriers 
        abide by--and frequently exceed--all DOT regulations regarding 
        these consumer protections, and there is no evidence of a 
        market failure or unfair or deceptive practices in this area. 
        In addition to other forms of compensation, the 11 largest U.S. 
        passenger airlines issued more than $32 billion in customer 
        refunds, or $900 million per month, between January 2020 and 
        December 2022. This includes $11.2 billion in 2022 alone, 
        exceeding 2019 by almost 50 percent. The $32 billion in refunds 
        issued by these carriers equates to 65 percent of their $49.6 
        billion in PSP receipts. It is also worth noting that DOT 
        received just less than one (0.86) complaint about refunds for 
        every 100,000 U.S. airline passengers flown--a 90 percent 
        improvement from the 2020 peak and airlines are working hard to 
        reduce that number further in 2023. Additional regulation is 
        simply not necessary.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
        
  <bullet> Ancillary Fees. The DOT has issued an NPRM which proposes to 
        reregulate the disclosure and distribution of airline ancillary 
        services and fees. A4A supports consumer protection regulation 
        that advances the DOT's central obligation under airline 
        deregulation to place maximum reliance on competitive market 
        forces. Regulations that empower consumers to make intelligent 
        choices in a competitive marketplace are consistent with 
        airline deregulation. However, regulations that would stifle 
        innovation and interfere with a thriving marketplace, such as 
        those proposed in the NPRM, are fundamentally inconsistent with 
        airline deregulation and will ultimately harm consumers. 
        Competition--not government regulation--is the most reliable 
        and efficient means to ensure air carriers deliver high-quality 
        service, choice and value to their customers.

    Similarly, some in Congress have proposed instituting government-
        controlled pricing, establishing a private right of action and 
        dictating private sector contracts. These proposals would 
        completely unravel the positive policy benefits that consumers 
        have reaped via deregulation of the airline industry; would 
        decrease competition; and would inevitably lead to higher 
        ticket prices and reduced services to small and rural 
        communities.

    A good example of the competitive market working is the evolution 
        of change fees where competitors started to eliminate change 
        fees and others in the market followed. Notably, in 2022, 
        revenues from reservation change fees were just a third of what 
        they were prior to the pandemic.

    Stakeholders also have a number of effective and existing forums to 
transparently discuss and debate consumer protection issues. For 
instance, at Congress's direction, the DOT re-established the Aviation 
Consumer Protection Advisory Committee (ACPAC) in 2018 to advise the 
DOT Secretary in carrying out the DOT's activities related to aviation 
consumer protection. The ACPAC, with representatives of key 
stakeholders (airlines, airports, state and local governments and 
consumer protection groups), evaluates existing consumer protection 
programs, recommends improvements to such programs and recommends new 
protection programs, if needed.
    Additionally, airlines and other stakeholders also work closely 
with the disability community and the DOT to proactively address 
accessibility issues. Similar to the ACPAC, the DOT established an Air 
Carrier Access Act Advisory Committee (ACAA Advisory Committee) in 2019 
and includes committee members with expertise in accessibility, airline 
accessibility practices and aircraft design.
    The ACPAC and ACAA Advisory Committees are valuable tools and 
provide a transparent and public forum for consideration of data and 
evidence concerning consumer protection issues. These Committees should 
be used as alternatives to rigid and proscriptive regulatory mandates.
FAA Reauthorization
    As this Committee begins debate on the reauthorization of the FAA, 
we respectfully request that policymakers restrain from adopting 
punitive policies such as tax or fee increases or onerous rules and 
regulations that will otherwise hamper our industry, employees and 
customers. The cloud of the pandemic should not be used for convenient 
legislative opportunism to reregulate or refashion what was a highly 
competitive and burgeoning well-paid job creator prior to the pandemic. 
We should be moving forward, not backward to the early 1970s.
    We would also encourage the Committee to take serious stock and 
review of the broader context and situational awareness we should all 
be attuned to going into this reauthorization. The last FAA 
reauthorization was passed in 2018. However, in the interim there has 
certainly been no lack of legislative activity which has included the 
Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act and the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, both containing significant 
policy and funding requirements--all of which have piled onto the FAA's 
workload and responsibilities.
    The U.S. airline industry is in the early years of a very long road 
to full economic recovery; we also have an aviation safety regulator 
that is well behind schedule on existing mandates and that is 
struggling to just maintain a legacy ATC system, let alone 
operationalizing NextGen priorities. We would encourage Congress to 
fundamentally think about what needs to be done to structurally prepare 
the FAA for what is to come. Both from a resource and organizational 
perspective, is the FAA ready and capable of meeting existing demands 
along with the considerable challenges of the future like integration 
of new entrants into the ATC system? We think the answer to that 
question is clearly `no'. Unfortunately, the FAA is on the precipice of 
being overwhelmed, if they are not already. Policymakers should keep 
this in mind as the legislative process moves forward.
    With that context and foundation in mind, we are hopeful you will 
also consider proposals, among others, that address the following 
priorities:

  <bullet> Adequate funding and accountability measures for ATC 
        staffing and modernization;

  <bullet> Workforce challenges, including increased diversity and 
        supply (i.e., pilots and mechanics); and

  <bullet> Increased resources for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) 
        supply and related environmental improvements.
Conclusion
    We are thankful for the opportunity to testify, and we look forward 
to working closely with the Committee over the coming months on many of 
these issues. From our perspective, the simple goals of the upcoming 
FAA reauthorization effort should be long-term stability, 
predictability and a Congressional understanding of `do no harm,' all 
components of an aviation policy that will serve the FAA, industry and 
consumers well, especially at this moment in time.

    The Chair. Thank you very much. We will turn to our--now, 
our last witness, Dr. Clifford Winston, who is going to join us 
remotely. Dr. Winston.

               STATEMENT OF DR. CLIFFORD WINSTON,

            SENIOR FELLOW, ECONOMIC STUDIES PROGRAM,

                   THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION

    Dr. Winston. Thank you for inviting me here. Can you hear 
me?
    The Chair. Yes, we can.
    Dr. Winston. OK, great. So, in my written testimony, what I 
provided was a summary of academic research on the state of 
airline competition, the desirability of re-regulation or 
regulatory reform, and recommendations of policies that would 
improve the performance of the airline industry.
    And in a nutshell, what I basically argued was that the 
strength of airline competition is quite strong, there is good 
strength there, but I could not really identify a re-regulatory 
or new regulatory policy that I thought would be helpful to 
consumer welfare, but I could recommend some policies that had 
a basis in markets that could greatly help travelers as well as 
even carriers, OK.
    So, that is really what I am talking about. What I will do 
in the oral presentation is I will talk about a key 
methodological point in my summer, in my testimony, and that is 
the idea of a counterfactual analysis, and then the substantive 
policy point, and that is the idea of policy experiments.
    This may sound a bit academic, but I assure all I make this 
conversational for you. OK, let me begin with the idea of a 
counterfactual. A counterfactual is a type of analysis that has 
to be taken to assess any policy, even mine. Any 
recommendations today, anything I am going to recommend, you 
really have to run through a counterfactual.
    And what that is, is an understanding of the world within 
the policy and the world without the policy, all right. The 
ideal counterfactual is something that you see probably every 
year at Christmas time, or at least seen it once. And that is 
the film, ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' What you see is a 
counterfactual for a human being.
    They get to see what life would be like if they were never 
born and compare that with the life that they are currently 
living now--leading now. And there are problems with his 
current life, but you learn that the world would be a lot worse 
off if the person were never born.
    Now we can't run Hollywood type counterfactual for policy, 
so what have we got in airlines? Well, to justify the case for 
deregulation, what we did, if you compared fares and intrastate 
flights which were unregulated in California and Texas, with 
the fares and interstate flights from Boston to Washington.
    Those are regulated by the CAB. And what we found is that 
the unregulated fares in this counterfactual were substantially 
lower than the regulated fares. And Congress was impressed by 
that finding, and that helped lead to deregulation.
    When we were in deregulation, how do we assess whether it 
was a good policy? What we did was project up what regulated 
fares would be based on the SIFL, which is what the CAB used to 
determine regulated fares and compare them with actual 
deregulated fares.
    And again, saw a big difference between the lower 
deregulated fares and the CAB, what they would have been 
regulated fares. And in fairness to Southwest, they really 
deserve the lion's share of the credit or the benefits from 
deregulation.
    Now the main point of all this is I can't give you a 
counterfactual how reregulation or new regulations would help. 
If I skim through it, I am going to point out other things that 
are going to lead to costs. They are going to offset what you 
see as benefits. OK, so what can we do? Let me give you a 
different counterfactual.
    Imagine the automobile industry and it does not allow 
foreign cars to be made or sold in the U.S., no Toyota, no 
Honda, no Maserati, whatever, right. Make it worse, there are 
no private dealers, there is only public dealers in major 
metropolitan areas like Minneapolis, Denver, and Atlanta. There 
is only one.
    Now, this obviously is not a desirable state for the 
automobile industry, but I have just described the U.S. airline 
industry. There is no foreign competition in the U.S. markets. 
All airports are public and some places only have one. So, what 
I am suggesting is allow--cabotage it, is allow foreign 
carriers to serve domestic routes, privatize the airports where 
they have a vested interest in helping consumers.
    And I will add on, privatizing air traffic control is in 
many ways having the same effects of increasing competition, 
OK. Now, it is my final point, let me raise the policy 
experiment. You will hear this and say this is too much. You 
know, we can't let every carrier in this country--we can't 
privatize every airport. Fine, let's do experiments. Let's do 
this for North America in terms of cabotage. Allow Canadian, 
Mexican, U.S. airlines to serve all routes in these countries.
    In terms of airports, we don't privatize all, but let's 
privatize airports in major metropolitan areas where there are 
at least three, New York, San Francisco, L.A., and Washington. 
Let those airports compete. Can they work with airlines to make 
passengers better off, reducing congestion, putting in heated 
runways where appropriate to melt snow and ice, make things 
safer, and even try to work out a way to provide low-cost 
accommodations. This is the idea.
    So, I would say in summing up, Southwest did not make 
mistakes. DOT did not make mistakes. Congress does not make 
mistakes. People make mistakes. If you want to reduce the 
likelihood of mistakes and you want people to be able to 
correct their mistakes, they need to be held accountable.
    More competition will enable that to happen, and I hope you 
proceed with considering these policies. Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Dr. Clifford Winston<SUP>*</SUP>, Senior Fellow, 
          Economic Studies Program, The Brookings Institution
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \*\ This testimony represents my personal views and does not 
reflect the views of the Brookings Institution, its other scholars, 
employees, officers and/or trustees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
    Southwest Airlines' cancellation of some 17,000 flights during the 
2022 holiday season provoked outrage among Southwest's customers and 
caused an outpour of empathy from the Nation's dissatisfied fliers. 
Although Southwest's flights were cancelled because of a combination of 
poor weather conditions for flying and its antiquated technology for 
allocating its labor force to provide scheduled flights, the 1978 
Airline Deregulation Act and the excesses of capitalism have been 
targeted by industry observers and commentators as the underlying cause 
of travelers' poor treatment. See, for example, the guest essays in the 
New York Times by Elizabeth Spiers and William McGee. Consequently, 
policymakers have renewed their interest in policies that could 
potentially improve air carrier operations and increase fliers' 
satisfaction from commercial air travel.
    My testimony discusses policymakers' concerns about the adequacy of 
U.S. airline competition and whether some form of industry re-
regulation or new airline regulations could increase airline 
efficiency, improve its treatment of passengers, and reduce fares. A 
concise journalistic overview of the contents of the testimony is 
contained in this article. In what follows here, I draw on economics 
research to argue that airline industry competition is strong and that 
carrier efficiency and travelers' satisfaction with air travel would 
not be improved by re-regulation or new regulations. However, I also 
argue that policymakers could take actions to strengthen airline 
competition and to significantly benefit air travelers by granting 
cabotage rights to foreign airlines and by privatizing airports and air 
traffic control.
Airline Competition
    The state of airline competition is important because it affects 
travelers' fares, the availability and convenience of service, and many 
amenities including but not limited to carry-on luggage space, meal 
service, seat comfort and spacing, and the like. It is straightforward 
to show that airline competition has disciplined air fares given that 
inflation-adjusted airfares were 60 percent lower in 2020 than in 1980, 
according to Airlines for America. In addition, fare levels are low 
enough to allow most Americans to fly--by 2020, 87 percent of the U.S. 
population had taken a commercial airline trip.
    Despite this evidence, critics of the state of airline competition 
raise concerns that there is little choice of carriers because the 
number of carriers in the airline industry has significantly decreased 
in the past few decades following a spate of major airline mergers. 
However, airline competition occurs at the route level not at the 
national level and the most heavily traveled routes, such as New York 
(JFK)--Los Angeles (LAX), Los Angeles (LAX)--San Francisco (SFO), New 
York (LGA)--Chicago (ORD), Los Angeles (LAX)--Chicago (ORD), and 
Atlanta (ATL)--Orlando (MCO), account for a large share of all U.S. air 
travelers and those routes are served by several carriers. Competition 
also exists on routes connected to smaller airports. For example, after 
Delta made significant cuts in service at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky 
International Airport, Allegiant, Frontier, and Southwest added new 
service. Similar changes are occurring at other former hubs, including 
Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Memphis, and St. Louis.
    In chapter 7 of our forthcoming Brookings book, Revitalizing a 
Nation: Competition and Innovation in the U.S. Transportation System 
(hereafter Revitalizing a Nation), we conduct a useful exercise that 
reveals the state of U.S. airline competition by estimating the 
hypothetical effect on airline fares if Ryanair, a low-cost Irish 
carrier modelled after Southwest, or EasyJet, a low-cost British 
carrier, entered all U.S. routes that were not currently served by a 
low-cost carrier. We find that the effect of either carrier on U.S. 
fares is more modest than might be expected because some 80 percent of 
domestic passengers in the United States are already flying on routes 
that are served by at least one low-cost or ultra-low-cost carrier.
    It is more difficult to quantify the effect of airline competition 
on many aspects of service quality because they are difficult to 
measure. However, carriers have long engaged in fare and non-fare 
competition; thus, the robust level of fare competition suggests that 
carriers also are competing on service quality, but not necessarily at 
the level that consistently satisfies air travelers.
    However, where airline competition may be lacking, I argue that 
government policy is generally to blame, and I will explain how 
government policy can be reformed to increase and expand airline 
competition that could potentially benefits carriers and travelers.
Regulatory Policy
    Re-regulating the airline industry or introducing new regulations 
would not lead to greater competition. To understand this, it is useful 
to discuss how the empirical case for airline deregulation was 
developed and how deregulation was justified after it was implemented. 
Because nationwide airline deregulation and regulation never occurred 
at the same time, economists developed what is known as a 
counterfactual analysis where the actual effects of regulation were 
compared with the hypothetical effects of deregulation or vice versa.
    As Steven Morrison and I discuss in our book, The Economic Effects 
of Airline Deregulation, economists estimated the potential effects on 
airline fares from deregulation by comparing intrastate fares for 
flights in California and Texas, which were not regulated, with 
interstate fares for flights of comparable distance, which were subject 
to Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) regulation. They found that the 
deregulated intrastate fares were considerably lower than the regulated 
interstate fares. Congress found this evidence compelling, and it 
helped to strengthen the case for deregulating the airline industry.
    To assess the actual effects of airline deregulation, Morrison and 
I compared fares and flight frequencies on a large sample of routes in 
1977, when the airline industry was still regulated, with fares and 
flight frequencies on the same sample of routes in 1983, when the 
industry had been deregulated for five years. After adjusting for 
differences between the macroeconomies of those two years and fuel 
prices, we found that lower fares and greater flight frequencies had 
netted travelers some $6 billion in annual benefits (in 1977 dollars) 
from deregulation, while airline earnings increased by $2.5 billion a 
year.
    That evidence is based on the early years of deregulation. As a 
follow up study, Morrison and I included a calculation in another book, 
The Evolution of the Airline Industry, which compared what regulated 
fares would have been during the period of deregulation into the 1990s 
using the Standard Industry Fare Level, which was developed by the CAB 
to determine regulated fares and was still calculated by the U.S. 
Department of Transportation for other purposes, with actual 
deregulated fares. For this calculation, we found that, on average, 
deregulation led to fares 22 percent lower than they would have been 
had regulation continued, with an annual saving to flyers of roughly 
$12.4 billion dollars (in 1993 dollars).
    Finally, chapter 7 of Revitalizing a Nation quantifies the 
substantial contribution that Southwest Airlines has made to the 
benefits from airline deregulation from its entry on U.S. routes. We 
find that Southwest has reduced fares, on average, 30 percent and that 
air travelers have gained $67.6 billion (2000 dollars) from its entry 
during the sample period, 1994-2014.
    Today, it is very difficult to construct a plausible counterfactual 
that would provide empirical evidence that re-regulation or some new 
regulation of fares would benefit air travelers. For example, suppose 
regulators put a cap on air fares. The airline industry has periods 
when they are highly profitable, but they also have periods when they 
lose a lot of money. Airlines cannot stay in business in down times--
and several have been liquidated--if they must sacrifice revenue that 
is generated when demand is high. So, if forced to sacrifice revenue 
due to fare regulation, they will try to make up for lost revenue 
elsewhere and create other problems in the process. To wit, paying 
employees less would mean more employee turnover and a less experienced 
workforce; raising the price of checked luggage would turn cabins into 
hand-to-hand combat zones for overhead space; jamming more passengers 
into cabins would require narrower seats with (even) less legroom and 
longer boarding times; and so on.
    How have other aspects of air travel fared under deregulation 
besides fares and flight frequency and could new regulations improve 
any of those aspects? Importantly, the benefits from airline 
deregulation have been accompanied by improvements in airline safety to 
the point where no major U.S. commercial airline has been involved in 
an accident resulting in a fatality in the United States since 2009.
    Airline congestion and travel delays have become worse since 
deregulation, but this adverse trend is not attributable to 
deregulation per se. Instead, it is a consequence of policymakers 
failing to align other public policies with the effects of airline 
deregulation. Specifically, deregulation increased air travel, 
especially during peak periods, but airports have continued to set 
weight-based landing fees, which charge aircraft that weigh the least, 
such as private planes, less than heavier planes to use scarce runway 
capacity. This policy is perverse because smaller aircraft increase 
travel delays more than larger aircraft increase those delays because 
smaller aircraft require greater separation between aircraft to prevent 
wake turbulence. The efficient policy is to charge all aircraft 
congestion-based takeoff and landing fees, which vary with the volume 
of hourly air traffic. Thus, aircraft operations would be spread more 
evenly throughout the day and would result in less congestion and 
delays during peak travel periods.
    Average load factors also have increased from roughly 55 percent 
during regulation to more than 80 percent today, which has created more 
competition for luggage space and tension in the cabin. This trend is 
attributable to the significantly lower fares caused by deregulation, 
but it is difficult to reverse this trend without re-regulation to 
raise fares. As I discuss, the trend could be reversed by policies that 
increase competition and available seats.
    Finally, deregulation has enabled airlines to unbundle various 
amenities with separate charges, such as checked luggage, seats with 
more legroom, and so on. Unbundling prices for specific amenities 
enables travelers who prefer the lowest fares to purchase them without 
paying for amenities they do not value and enables other travelers to 
pay higher fares and receive amenities they do value. It would be 
difficult for policymakers to introduce a regulation that mandates a 
specific amenity at no cost without the regulation harming travelers in 
other ways.
    In sum, whether policymakers seek to implement a new regulation to 
reduce fares, increase seat widths, prohibit charges for checked 
luggage or seat selection, require that all passengers be served hot 
meals, and so on, none of those regulations are likely to be supported 
by counterfactual empirical evidence that they would benefit air 
travelers on net.
Constructive Policy Improvements
    The preceding conclusion is unlikely to appease travelers and 
government officials who are still outraged by Southwest's cancelled 
flights that ruined thousands of vacations and by travelers being 
stranded in airports with nowhere to sleep and little food to eat. Is 
it possible to do something to potentially address air travel 
nightmares even if they do not occur regularly?
    Unfortunately, it is difficult to craft an effective policy to 
prevent an unanticipated disastrous air travel event beyond certain 
forms of terrorism. Freak storms, human illnesses, mechanical failures, 
air traffic control disruptions, and events that have yet to occur will 
always pose a threat to air travel and potentially ruin flights for 
passengers, flight attendants, and pilots. However, those events affect 
a very small share of the hundreds of millions of people who fly in the 
U.S. every year.
    At the same time, it is possible to adopt policies that would 
enable the U.S. air transportation system to become more robust and 
respond more effectively to unanticipated events and would generally 
improve air travel. Those policies include granting cabotage rights to 
foreign air carriers, privatizing U.S. airports, and privatizing U.S. 
air traffic control.
    Cabotage. The simplest way to understand the motivation for 
granting rights to foreign air carriers to serve U.S. domestic routes 
is to consider a U.S. automobile industry that prohibited foreign 
automakers, including but not limited to Toyota, Honda, Nissan, 
Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, and Volvo, from manufacturing and selling their 
vehicles in the United States. Clearly, such a policy would greatly 
harm U.S. consumers.
    Currently, that policy effectively governs air travel on U.S. 
domestic routes because Air Canada, British Airways, Lufthansa, 
Singapore Airlines, Air France, ANA, Emirates, and several other 
foreign airlines cannot serve domestic passengers on a route that 
consists of an origin and destination airport in the United States. The 
historical justification for the policy is that the U.S. military might 
need immediate access to all aircraft during times of war. Politically, 
domestic airline labor would mount significant opposition to additional 
competitive threats that could reduce its earnings. However, given the 
Nation's increasing reliance on unmanned military aircraft and the 
weakened political position of airline labor in the wake of 
deregulation, those arguments have lost much of their force.
    Travelers on U.S. international routes have already benefited from 
policies that promote competition. Beginning in 1992 with the 
Netherlands, the U.S. has negotiated open skies agreements with some 
countries that deregulate fares and carrier entry on the routes 
connecting the U.S. and those countries. In my paper with Jia Yan, we 
estimate that travelers on routes subject to open skies agreements have 
gained at least $4 billion annually and that they would gain an 
additional $4 billion annually if the U.S. negotiated open skies 
agreements with other countries that have a significant amount of U.S. 
international passenger traffic.
    As noted, chapter 7 of our forthcoming book Revitalizing a Nation 
expands the analysis of the effects on fares of competition between 
U.S. and foreign airlines to the case of a foreign low-cost airline 
serving U.S. domestic routes that were not already served by a low-cost 
U.S. carrier. We found modest benefits, but we qualify that finding as 
a very conservative estimate of the potential benefits of allowing 
cabotage because it does not account for the change in the entire 
global airline network, including competition from other carriers on 
domestic and international routes in all countries. Indeed, changes in 
the global network would probably be the largest source of travelers' 
gains from cabotage because carriers would seek to provide seamless air 
travel throughout the world as, for example, travelers would be able to 
use a single carrier from, say, Des Moines to Vienna, and reduce 
connections and waiting time if connections were necessary.
    Allowing cabotage would make it much less likely that low-density 
domestic routes were underserved because passengers on those routes 
could provide feed for international routes that originate in the US. 
Foreign carriers also would intensify competition on higher-density 
routes, reducing fares and improving service quality. Finally, foreign 
carriers could provide additional seating capacity, which could soften 
the traumatic effects if a domestic carrier experienced a meltdown.
    Privatizing Airports. Privatizing airports can be motivated by 
considering an ill-conceived policy requiring all automobile dealers to 
be owned and operated by the government. In addition, the policy would 
result in some large metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, Minneapolis, 
and Denver, being served by only one dealer and new dealers rarely 
entering the national dealer network.
    That policy essentially governs the U.S. commercial airport system, 
which consists almost exclusively of public airports; Atlanta, 
Minneapolis, and Denver are served by only airport; and only one new 
major commercial airport, Denver International Airport, has been built 
in the United States since 1973. U.S. commercial airports were private 
enterprises until the Great Depression, when they experienced serious 
financial problems because of plummeting passenger demand. Government 
could have given airports financial assistance so they could remain in 
the private sector. Instead, they were put under the control of state 
and local governments, which had the sole authority to issue bonds to 
pay for airport facilities and operations.
    Because new airports rarely compete with existing airports and 
because existing airports have little financial incentive to attract 
additional airlines and travelers, competition between multiple 
airports in a metropolitan area is limited. Chapter 8 of Revitalizing a 
Nation finds that travelers flying out of metropolitan origins with at 
least three airports pay lower fares, ceteris paribus, than travelers 
flying out of metropolitan origins with only one airport; but that 
fares from metropolitan origins with exactly two airports are higher 
compared with fares out of single-airport metropolitan origins. In 
other words, our results suggest that the presence of two airports is 
not sufficient to induce competitive pressures to reduce fares (and 
their presence may be counterproductive).
    Our preferred explanation for this finding is that three or more 
airports competing in a metropolitan origin facilitate more entry by 
low-cost and ultra-low-cost carriers and facilitate competition on 
adjacent routes. In other words, the channel by which three or more 
airports reduces fares is by generating additional airline competition. 
In contrast, when two airports serve a metropolitan origin, they tend 
to differentiate their service by developing distinct business models 
consisting of network airlines primarily catering to international and 
domestic markets and point-to-point airlines primarily catering to 
domestic markets. The distinct business models do not reduce fares 
because they do not encourage additional airline competition in the 
same markets.
    Thus, although greater airport competition could reduce fares by 
increasing airline competition, such competition has not significantly 
developed because public airports generally do not have the economic 
incentive to compete with each other. Even worse, airports impede 
airline competition by erecting entry barriers, such as exclusive use 
gates, and policymakers institute slot controls at highly congested 
airports. Privatizing airports could therefore benefit travelers 
because those airports would have an economic incentive to compete by 
eliminating entry barriers and expanding facilities to attract more 
airline service, which in turn would increase airline competition that 
reduces fares. New private airports that enter the system, especially 
in metropolitan areas served by only one or two airports, also would 
have strong economic incentives to compete vigorously to attract more 
airlines and to provide adequate facilities for them.
    A competitive private airport system also could improve air travel 
because private airports would have an incentive to implement 
congestion pricing, which would make more efficient use of runway 
capacity, and to adopt technological innovations, such as heated 
runways, which would melt snow upon contact, reduce air travel delays 
and cancellations, and improve safety. Chapter 8 of Revitalizing a 
Nation quantifies the potential benefits to travelers, airlines, and 
Boston Logan Airport if it installed heated runways.
    Private airports also would have an incentive to work more closely 
with airlines to improve airline service and facilities to benefit 
travelers. For example, it would be in an airport's financial interest 
to incentivize and to help, if possible, airlines reduce the time they 
spend on their tarmac before departing, which frustrates passengers. 
Private airports also would have an incentive to explore the 
possibility of providing low-cost sleeping accommodations should 
airlines cancel flights, which would help reduce travelers' anxieties 
and possibly reduce the cost of compensation that airlines provide.
    In sum, privatizing airports could enhance travelers' flying 
experiences by producing the expected benefits of competition; that is, 
more efficient operations and new innovations that reduce costs and 
prices and improve service, and by producing benefits from greater 
cooperation between airports and airlines, such as improved operations 
and facilities that are more responsive to passengers' preferences.
Privatizing Air Traffic Control.
    The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has long been criticized 
for its failure to develop and operationalize a technologically modern 
air traffic control (ATC) system, which could expand airspace capacity, 
reduce traffic delays, and enhance safety. Nav Canada, Canada's ATC 
system, is seen as a model for the United States to privatize, or at 
least corporatize, its system to improve ATC efficiency, technology, 
and effectiveness. Canada's system improves on the U.S. radar-based 
system to keep better track of aircraft in flight by using a 
constellation of satellites, which updates the position, altitude, and 
velocity of aircraft much faster than radar and provides considerable 
redundancy to ensure safety.
    A privatized ATC system that adopts a satellite-based technology 
and expands air space capacity could benefit U.S. air travelers by 
facilitating more aircraft operations and competition, enabling pilots 
to select faster routings, and making it even more likely that U.S. air 
travel will continue to be extremely safe.
Final Comments
    The fundamental challenge facing any transportation firm is to 
align capacity, which must be purchased and scheduled in advance, with 
consumer demand. The challenge to airlines is exacerbated by shocks to 
the macroeconomy, spikes in fuel prices, terrorist attacks, and other 
unanticipated events, which make it more difficult for airlines to 
align available seat capacity with potential demand. In fact, the U.S. 
airline industry as a whole has never made money during a recession.
    However, Southwest Airlines has made money during a recession and 
is responsible for a large share of the benefits to travelers from 
lower deregulated fares. Clearly, Southwest has been doing something 
right. Yet, its mass cancellation of flights during the 2022 holiday 
season has created waves of doubt about deregulation and spurred calls 
for some type of government action.
    I have argued that certain government actions, granting cabotage 
rights to foreign airlines and privatizing airports and air traffic 
control, which promote airline competition, are called for to enable 
the air transportation system to be more responsive and robust to 
unanticipated shocks. The justification for this approach is that 
market participants facing competitive pressures would be strongly 
incentivized to correct their mistakes and to improve the efficiency of 
their operations or they will face financial failure. In contrast, 
government performance is generally static because policymakers rarely 
have the incentive to reform their policies to enhance economic 
efficiency. Evidence that shows the lack of efficient government policy 
reforms is available here.
    The U.S. government should not undo airline deregulation or open 
skies agreements because those policies benefited the flying public and 
were not mistakes. Instead, policymakers should expand those policies 
by taking the lead in global airline deregulation and by privatizing 
air transportation infrastructure.
    To be sure, those policies would represent a dramatic change and 
could pose possible risks to the public. Accordingly, it is appropriate 
for policymakers to first consider policy experiments. For example, the 
U.S. could negotiate a fully deregulated North American airline network 
with Canada and Mexico, where the three countries' airlines would be 
free to serve any airline route in North America. The European Union 
has a similar policy for participating countries' airlines. U.S. 
policymakers could then assess the effects of additional competition on 
travelers' and carriers' welfare and reform the policy as appropriate. 
Similarly, policymakers could privatize airports in metropolitan areas 
that are served by three or more airports, assess the effects of the 
policy, and reform it as appropriate.
    In the final analysis, governments and companies do not make 
mistakes; people make mistakes. People are less likely to make mistakes 
and more likely to correct the mistakes that they do make in an 
environment where they are held accountable for their mistakes. 
Increasing competition in the air transportation system is the best way 
to hold the system's participants accountable for their mistakes and to 
improve air travelers' satisfaction from flying.

    The Chair. Thank you very much for your testimony. We will 
now turn to questions. Five-minute rounds, and I ask my 
colleagues if you can stick to 5-minute rounds only because we 
are expecting a vote at 11 a.m. and also a briefing in the 
Capitol on the Chinese balloon situation that I know many 
members are going to want to attend.
    So, hopefully we can get in through as many questions as 
possible. And depending on the interest of the committee, we 
will adjourn for a time period and come back to allow members, 
if we haven't finished up with their questions. But I also want 
to say, this committee is going to make FAA reauthorization a 
very big priority, so today I guess is a kind of a kickoff, if 
you will.
    Not intended thus, but you, many of the witnesses have 
brought up several issues that will, I think, attract more 
attention from us in our discussion period about this. And we 
are having a NOTAM hearing with the FAA, I think, next week, so 
we will continue the operational issues into the future for 
sure. But I wanted to start with that because I think the issue 
of operational control is very important.
    Mr. Watterson, you now plan to upgrade your system. And 
then one of the things about Southwest again is that point-to-
point service that has more of a problem dealing with the 
weather event as opposed to a hub model. When are you going to 
complete that upgrade?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. The upgrade to the 
cruise system, I talked about.
    The Chair. The dispatch--the flight dispatch system.
    Mr. Watterson. So, please correct me if I am not getting 
your question correct, but we are spending $1.3 billion in 
technology this year, which is about 25 percent more than 2019. 
And that was, again, 9 percent more than in 2018. So, we are 
moving our spending up faster than our revenue in our size, and 
we are upgrading a number of systems with that. With regards to 
this event, our crew scheduling software had a particular 
fault. It didn't stop working, but we lost--it fell down, so to 
speak, and overwhelmed. And there is a specific----
    The Chair. I don't think--my constituents' point, I don't 
think they care about what--whether it was, didn't go to full 
capacity, had a glitch. They want to know if you are going to 
fix that system and when?
    Mr. Watterson. Senator, tomorrow, the fix will go in and 
then it will be live in a production system. It is already had 
two rounds in our test system.
    The Chair. So, that the same event, if it happened in a 
week, we would have a different outcome?
    Mr. Watterson. That technology would not stop functioning. 
As I mentioned in my testimony, we believe our winter 
operations resiliency was the root cause and that will take 
longer to address. And so, we will focus on that for the bulk 
of our time.
    The Chair. OK. You are here today, and I very much 
appreciate it. Your CEO didn't want to show up. Now, we could 
have figured out a way to get him here. But you are the 
operations guy, and I thought, you know what, I really want to 
talk to him. So, I really want to understand, because I have a 
lot of pilots here and they are telling me that they have been 
telling you about this for a long, long time.
    And so, what I want to know, because a lot of people 
suffered a lot because of this juxtaposed to other airlines and 
where they were, and you just paid out a huge dividend.
    So, people want to know, are these guys going to invest in 
the technology that will make this system operational, so this 
will never happen again?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. We need to invest in 
technology, but also in our operational systems outside of 
technology because the winter operations were too much for us. 
You are correct that other airlines were able to handle the 
winter weather and we were not.
    And so, to be able to better handle the winter weather, we 
need more infrastructure at airports for de-icing. We need more 
de-icing trucks. We need new technology systems with de-icing. 
We need to weatherize our ground support equipment.
    So, there is lots of work and lots of expenditures we 
expect to prevent this from happening again, and that will be 
the bulk of the effort.
    The Chair. And so, what is the cost of that upgrade that 
you need to do and when will it be completed?
    Mr. Watterson. We are undergoing the assessment right now. 
We are doing a top to bottom view of our winter operations, and 
undoubtedly will be in the millions and millions of dollars, 
but it won't be until probably in March we will have finished 
the assessment of exactly how much and where. We already know 
in Denver and Midway we need substantial upgrades and we are 
already pursuing that with the airports.
    The Chair. Do you understand the public's frustration with 
this? Do you understand that they want to know, and we are 
going to get into a lot of technology issues, trust me, but I 
think they want to know that you are going--your brand, yes, 
has been built.
    And I definitely think Herb Kelleher would be here if he 
was the CEO. He would have been here today because that is 
Herb. I actually sat with him on the Road to End Commission so 
got to know a lot about his views on aviation. I think Mr. 
Murray, Captain Murray is going to say that you lost 
operational control, and that is the FAA's oversight to make 
sure that you have operational control.
    So, if you don't make the technology investment to keep up 
that operational control, then yes, we should say something 
about that. Now, Captain Murray, did Southwest Airlines lose 
operational control in the aftermath of the weather event?
    Mr. Murray. My answer is yes. I think the written testimony 
provides a lot of data and tells the story of how it did. Mr. 
Watterson's own written testimony, fourth paragraph under why 
did this happen? He actually says, ``we could not execute the 
plan we had established for operating during the storm.'' And I 
believe that answers your question as well.
    The Chair. What do you think it takes to get this system 
changed and upgraded so that if we have another massive weather 
event, that the point-to-point system that is unique to 
Southwest doesn't have the same kind of delays and outages?
    Mr. Murray. Well, I think it is going to take a much more 
holistic approach to operating our network. We love our 
network. We think it is the magic behind Southwest. That is not 
our issue. Our issue is, is when there is a disruption, then 
Southwest--it takes Southwest much longer to recover.
    And it is more for us, it is a process and how they program 
that IT, in how they connect pilots to airplanes and flight 
attendants, which is what causes the ongoing execution 
problems. So, that is something that can be done relatively 
quickly.
    They have to change--any pilot who is here, and these 
pilots have come here on their day off, can attest to the chaos 
that they go through when going to work. They don't know where 
they are going to go.
    They don't know where they are going to overnight. They 
don't know how long they are going to be on duty. And they 
don't know how long their overnight is going to be. So, it is 
holistic.
    The Chair. Thanks. My time has expired, but I will point 
out Ms. Pinkerton's point about the overstaffing and 
scheduling. We are going to see, when we look at this whole 
system and we have all the airlines, we are going to find out 
that the people who overstaffed had enough people to survive 
this the best. And the Southwest ended up on the other end 
because of this technology and the point-to-point system. But 
anyway, Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to each of 
the witnesses. And thank you also to the many pilots and 
individuals who are here for this hearing. And I know many of 
you are Texans, and so, welcome to Washington.
    We are glad to have you here. Kevin Murray, let me return 
to what you and Chair Cantwell were just discussing. In the 
view of the Southwest pilots, what caused 16,000 flights to be 
canceled, and what needs to be done to prevent that from 
happening again?
    Mr. Murray. Well, thank you, Ranking Member Cruz. Again, it 
was a cascade of events that ultimately caused, you know, the 
failure in IT, the failure in its ability to keep up, the loss 
of where pilots, where airplanes, and where crews were.
    A failure of infrastructure. Our operations agents who have 
a front row to our customers and board our airplanes weren't 
sure what was going on nor could get answers. So, it was a 
failure epically from top to bottom. We had crews that were on 
the phone, we have screenshots, 17 hours on the phone trying to 
get a hold of someone.
    Many of our frontline employees went above and beyond, and 
were able to cobble together a crew, cobble together an 
airplane, get passengers, and they did that on their own.
    And so, when I said in my oral testimony that, you know, 
they rely and they have continued to rely more and more on 
being supported by their employees, the employees are the ones 
that did the Herculean task of kind of trying to recover.
    Senator Cruz. So, in your testimony, you expressed 
frustration that, in your view, management was not listening to 
the concerns of the pilots. Could you elaborate on that 
frustration, and do you feel that the changes that are needed 
are being implemented now?
    Mr. Murray. Well, so the pilots have been sounding the 
alarm bells for over a decade. We have been the whistleblowers 
on this. We have watched this progress and seen these meltdowns 
occur.
    I have laid it out in my written testimony for you. We have 
seen these meltdowns occur with more frequency and more 
severity. We have tried to get them--we love our airline, and 
they have to be better. And we are trying to partner with them. 
And I think that is key.
    The front-line operators, whether it is a baggage cart, 
whether it is a fueling truck, whether it is a pilot, whether 
it is a flight attendant, whether it is a customer service 
agent, all have front line experience in seeing what goes on, 
and there has to be a partnering. We are a very data driven 
organization at SWAPA.
    We have provided them point-to-point solutions for their 
point-to-point network. So, I think there has to be--this isn't 
an IT fix, this isn't a plug and play. Again, it is got to be 
holistic and it has got to be addressed, and it can be 
addressed tomorrow in a process.
    Senator Cruz. And to clarify, your criticism is not with 
point-to-point model. Southwest is unusual. Most other airlines 
have a hub and spoke model, whereas Southwest has a point-to-
point model.
    You are--and some members of this committee have raised 
concerns with the point-to-point model. I will say as a 
customer, I actually find it very convenient. And there is a 
reason I am on a Southwest flight just about every week of the 
year. But your concern is not with the point-to-point model, is 
that right?
    Mr. Murray. Absolutely not. I do believe that if you look 
at Southwest Airline's history in comparison to the rest of the 
industry, since our existence, we have made money every year 
except during 2020. The rest of the airlines have not.
    And I believe that is the magic of our point-to-point 
system. I think our customers love it. I believe it gives us a 
competitive edge. More importantly, during downtimes, it 
provides some flexibility and some agility to take advantage of 
times.
    Herb Kelleher has a famous quote of that we have predicted 
12 out of the last 5 recessions. And he--and it was our point-
to-point network that provided for that.
    Senator Cruz. Dr. Winston, some of the proposals that have 
been discussed by Democrats on this committee, and indeed by 
President Biden in the State of the Union address, involve the 
Government regulating things like pricing, things like fees 
that customers are paying, regulating things unrelated to 
safety.
    And let me be clear, I think it is an integral 
responsibility of the Government, the FAA, to focus on safety 
and ensure safety for the flying public. And I can understand 
the appeal of saying to people, you don't want to pay this fee 
or that fee.
    I could understand the appeal of saying that every airline 
must have only first-class seats and a free foot massage with 
every flight, and that would make flying quite comfortable, but 
it would also predictably drive up the cost of air travel and 
price many Americans out of the market of being able to travel 
for work or leisure.
    So, Dr. Winston, what would the effect be of the 
regulations being discussed for the flying public, and would 
consumers be better off or worse off with the Federal 
Government regulating pricing and fees and other aspects of 
airline travel unrelated to safety?
    Dr. Winston. Thank you. So, I think the important thing 
here, we need to be specific and we want to work with the 
counterfactuals so we don't--it's hard to understand if we go 
very general saying, oh, regulation. I want to know, what 
regulation are we talking about? And then we just spin through, 
OK, what is going to be the full effect of that regulation? So, 
I will mention one.
    Suppose we say that all checked luggage is free. You know, 
we have to allow people to be able to check luggage and not 
charge them. And, you know, on the face of it, that sounds a 
good thing. People want to check their luggage. They don't want 
to pay extra fees. But then spin through what is going to 
happen.
    Well, airlines are going to incur costs from that. And this 
is all airlines, not just Southwest. And this is a competitive 
industry. And they can't incur these costs, they have to pass 
them on and they will with higher fares. And we can continue to 
do this exercise, but pretty much anything that I have heard 
thus far recommended. Now people complain about transparency.
    That is a different issue. I mean, certainly airlines, and 
I don't really know why these--why companies do this, can say, 
look, here is the full--here is the price, end quote, does not 
include in bold letters extras. Put an asterisk and say, here 
are the extras So, people know they have to pay for baggage, 
and so on and so forth.
    So, that is in general what we can expect to see, and we 
can plug in specific policies. Am I allowed to say something 
else?
    The Chair. Well, if it is really very short, because we are 
over this time and we need to get to various members.
    Dr. Winston. OK, very short. All airlines run point to 
point. The only flights that are not point to point are those 
that crash. Southwest really does not run that different a 
network than other airlines.
    The Chair. Senator Baldwin.

               STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN

    Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Watterson, you 
have undoubtedly heard directly from the families who have 
been--whose travel plans were disrupted by the Southwest 
meltdown. And many families from Wisconsin also reached out to 
me.
    One gentleman, Paul, wrote to me about his very expensive 
attempt to fly home from Florida to Milwaukee with Southwest. 
His flight was canceled twice at the very last minute, and 
while he was waiting at the airport, he had no choice other 
than to spend an unexpected $222 to stay at a hotel.
    The next morning with no good options, he spent about $700 
to rent a vehicle and drive 23 hours home. Yes, Paul ultimately 
was reimbursed by Southwest for those expenses, but he can't 
really be reimbursed for the time and frustration of being in 
that unacceptable situation which so many other travelers found 
themselves in, because of Southwest cancellations.
    So, Mr. Watterson, as you know, air carriers who accepted 
payroll support program relief funding were banned from 
conducting stock buybacks until last year. For me, this was an 
essential condition when we were writing the CARES Act. While 
Southwest has not yet conducted any stock buybacks, it was the 
first major carrier to reinstate stock dividends to 
shareholders.
    My preference would be that you prioritize your customers 
the highest of all. And so, do you plan on moving forward with 
any stock buybacks prior to ensuring that your technology is 
fully prepared to deal with a similar disruption in the future?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. And I apologize once 
again for the disruption your constituents experienced. It is 
indeed unacceptable and we will endeavor to make our system 
more robust so that does not happen again. And I am glad they 
are reimbursed. The extent you have constituents that were not 
reimbursed, please contact our office.
    We will definitely follow up because we want to do right by 
our customers even if they were unacceptably disservice. And I 
am also very grateful for the Payroll Support Act and other 
follow-on bills, and we took pains to maintain our end of the 
bargain not ceasing service to any domestic airport, 
restrictions on buybacks, dividends, and executive 
compensation, which you all find very appropriate, and we are 
happy to abide by them. And yes, we did our recently declared 
dividend.
    We did that after we felt like we had enough funds to 
properly fund both paying our employees top of the industry 
wages or at least accruing for them, for funding giving 
generous benefits, funding purchase of our aircraft, funding 
for our IT department, and also paying down our debt.
    And so, essentially, we paid shareholders kind of at the 
end of the line after we funded everybody else. And so, yes, 
Senator, we will continue to fund what is necessary, and 
whatever comes out of this review, we will fund what is 
necessary to achieve that.
    Senator Baldwin. All right. It is my understanding that 
some airports that are serviced by Southwest were not receiving 
timely information from the company's leadership throughout the 
December meltdown.
    This includes Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin. Although Milwaukee is the only airport in Wisconsin 
that Southwest serves, Southwest provides about 45 percent of 
the airport's service. While the airport did its best to react 
to the situation by securing affected passengers' bags, it had 
little to no information from the company about when they could 
expect the situation to improve.
    Can you commit to providing clear and improved 
communication with airports moving forward to ensure that they 
are able to provide the best service possible to their 
communities, particularly during any future disruptions in 
service?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. Yes. We are proud to 
serve the Milwaukee area and provide them great air service. 
And I commit to you that we will follow up and make sure we 
communicate better with airports in such situations.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you. Captain Murray, real quickly. 
The Southwest Airline Pilots Association, SWAPA, has been 
raising the alarm about Southwest's technology not being 
equipped to deal with a major weather disruption for years, as 
you have just emphasized, including a podcast that was aired 
just before the December meltdown.
    Given your members' firsthand encounters with the 
shortcomings of the existing technology, has Southwest done 
enough to ensure SWAPA and other workers have a seat at the 
table with any forthcoming technology upgrades?
    Mr. Murray. Well, I think that is one--thank you, Senator. 
I think that is 100 percent critical as we move forward. And it 
is got to be--excuse me, it has got to be all of labor. And up 
to this point, we have seen some minor touches and been 
included in two meetings.
    But really addressing our process failures and how that is 
going to be programmed into our IT, the front-line operators 
must be involved, and that is something that we are insisting 
on, and it is something that I hope comes from this testimony 
today.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Capito.

            STATEMENT OF HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    Senator Capito. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I thank the 
Ranking Member. And thank all of you for being here today. I 
will say anecdotally in my office, I have had like 10 of my 
staff members, I said, who was affected by what happened? About 
four of them were affected. So, that shows you the breadth of 
Southwest, I think.
    And they were all satisfied with the--while, a lot of 
frustrations at the time and all of that, satisfied with the 
remedies that Southwest brought forward to them. So, I think, 
you know, if we are going to find some good news here, I think 
that is a little bit of good news, at least for those who I 
understand it may not be universal, but at least in those four, 
they were.
    So, Mr. Watterson, your CEO, in an interview last week, 
said that ``it is a misconception that technology was the issue 
and blamed more of the storm,'' understanding that it is more 
than one thing.
    But I am hearing in the testimony and response to 
questions, and the fact that you are putting a large investment 
in technology, that it is, in fact the technology. How would 
you respond to that?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. Yes, there were 
technology issues during the disruption and we don't dispute 
that, and we will make the necessary investments there.
    All we were trying to say is, the problem or the root cause 
was how we handled our winter operations, and that is where you 
will see us put some focus over a multi-year period, because 
that is what started the dominoes falling.
    The last domino was the crew scheduling system not being 
able to function as we would like, but it was the upstream 
stuff that was a bigger problem that we are addressing.
    Senator Capito. Well, I understand one of the other 
problems, too, was de-icing. Say, in Denver, there was not 
enough de-icing equipment. The plane sits out. You have got to 
come back around, get back in line, and then you run into 
timing problems and other things. How are you addressing that 
de-icing in those areas that obviously--Detroit, I mean, 
Denver, Chicago need the extra equipment. And I understand that 
is your responsibility, really, as an airline to provide that 
rather than the airport?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. And generally, yes, the 
de-icing pads, some airports you must de-ice in specific 
location to have the fluid recaptured. That is done in 
conjunction with the airport.
    And so, we are meeting with Denver Airport February 14 to 
discuss this and following up also with Chicago, as well as 
other airports as far as those infrastructure. But then the 
other equipment staffing is our responsibility, and we are 
definitely evaluating everything and making the necessary 
investments from top to bottom.
    It is not just in those areas, but also technology used in 
de-icing, our training, our procedures. We are looking at 
everything to see what we can do to up our game so this doesn't 
happen again.
    Senator Capito. Yes, I saw a lot of heads nodding there in 
the pilot population on that question. Another thing I have 
wondered, did you ever run a worst-case scenario? I mean, 
certainly, you know, you always want to plan for the worst.
    But did you ever run a fallout scenario where you could 
anticipate a bad storm, you know, de-icing issues so that you 
could have gone back to those trial runs to see how we can fix 
this more quickly?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. In regard to winter 
operations, what we look at is our throughput of how many 
aircraft per hour we are able to effectively de-ice in 
different levels of storms.
    And so, the initial plan that I referenced in my testimony 
was based on our previous modeling of how much we could per 
hour handle in our de-icing pads and such. In Denver and 
Midway, those--based on history, those proved to be incorrect 
for this storm.
    And that is why we need to go back and reinvest in those 
areas so that we can more robustly achieve those throughput 
rates.
    Senator Capito. All right. Well, I would highly recommend 
that. I mean, that also could have brought up, I think, more 
quickly your technology failures as well.
    Ms. Pinkerton, we were talking about compensating 
customers, and I know that some of my colleagues are pushing 
for an airline consumer protection law similar to what they 
have in the EU.
    How do you think, when we see what the response of 
Southwest has been, would this change that or would it put--how 
do you think that would impact what we saw as their response?
    Ms. Pinkerton. Well, as I mentioned in my opening comments, 
collectively, the industry has refunded $32 billion since the 
pandemic. And I think that having an EU-type compensation in 
this country would be a disaster. I mean, deregulation has been 
an enormous benefit for consumers.
    Senator Capito. A disaster in that it would be more costly 
to the consumer or--?
    Ms. Pinkerton. Absolutely. You know, you all are too young 
to remember this, but it used to be that only the rich could 
fly. That is not the case anymore, and we would like to keep it 
that way.
    There is no doubt that deregulation has democratized air 
travel, and, yes, a compensation system--and there have been 
analysis that have been done of the EU system. It just adds 
cost. It doesn't fix the problem. Southwest and all of our 
carriers have made record investments in our technology to make 
it more resilient, to recover more quickly.
    $21 billion this year. We are expecting $27 billion next 
year. We need that money to continue to invest in our people, 
and our product, and our customers.
    Senator Capito. Thank you. And I would like to say to the 
men and women that work in the airlines, particularly the ones 
flying into places like West Virginia, although Southwest is 
not, thank you for keeping us safe.
    We--it is with great pride, I think, for us to feel, when 
we sit down and then buckle in, that we are handled with great 
professionals who have our safety at the top of the list. So, 
thank you all very much for that.
    The Chair. Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Well said, Senator Capito. Thank you, 
and I agree. Thank you for all your good work. And thank you, 
Chair, for having this really important hearing. We all know 
what happened. I know that, as we say in the Senate, everyone 
has said it, but I haven't said it.
    But I know what happened in my state, and that is that in 
Minnesota, nearly 80 percent of Southwest's flights in and out 
of our Minneapolis Saint Paul Airport were canceled over the 
Christmas holiday weekend. And meanwhile, the breaking in the 
crew scheduling led to a lot of overworked Southwest employees 
with little direction on how to improve the situation.
    We all know it is unacceptable, and I appreciate the 
apologies and the comments about the changes that are going to 
be made. Senator Moran and I Co-Chair the Travel and Tourism 
Caucus of the Senate.
    We are very focused on this, as I know the Chair is, and 
many others. So, I worked with Senators Moran and Capito just 
recently to introduce the NOTAM Improvement Act, which is a 
simple beginning to all this with a task force to recommend 
improvements to prevent future outages.
    Representative Stauber from Minnesota, carrying it in the 
House, it actually already passed the House. And I know there 
is going to be many other ideas. I know that Senators 
Duckworth, Thune, Moran, Fischer, and Kelly, and myself are 
working on a bill to expand the FAA's workforce development, 
which is also a key part of this, both at the FAA and the 
private airlines.
    So, Captain Murray, in your testimony, you highlight how in 
November you warned about risks associated with crew scheduling 
and IT systems. Why do you think your warnings were ignored?
    Mr. Murray. Thank you, Senator. That podcast was one of 
many warnings that we had relayed to Southwest either publicly, 
privately. And we have been trying, as is I testified a little 
bit earlier, you know, we have tried to offer solutions where 
we see breakdowns.
    And so, we have gotten very little traction in that regard. 
And so, as we have moved forward, we have been expressing some 
very dire warnings about how brittle.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. I am going to go to you, Mr. 
Watterson. Southwest recently announced a $1.3 billion 
investment to update the technology. Is that going to get at 
the issues that Captain Murray raised? How is the money going 
to be spent?
    Mr. Watterson. Thanks, Senator. Yes, the $1.3 billion is a 
25 percent increase over 2019 pre-pandemic levels. So, we are 
increasing our IT spend, obviously faster than our company is 
growing, and we are going to use that across the operation, 
both in the crew scheduling area, but also in our ground 
operations and flight operations area so that we can make sure 
that we have modernized our operation.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you. Ms. Pinkerton, in 
addition to the operational challenges this winter, there were 
also disruptions during the spring and summer of 2022. Part of 
it was post COVID travel demand. What changes did airlines 
implement to correct the operational challenges they faced 
during this time period?
    Ms. Pinkerton. You are absolutely right, carriers did learn 
lessons post-pandemic. We had to change our staffing models as 
a result of people being sick, increased absenteeism. The two 
most important things we did, we reduced our schedules by 15 
percent in 2022.
    And then second, we went on a hiring binge. We hired 50,000 
people in 2022. And, you know, as I was saying earlier, 
carriers have identified the fact that they need 5 to 15 
percent more staff to fly a smaller schedule.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you. Mr. Watterson, different 
subject, customer service. Senator Baldwin. I heard asked some 
questions about it. Could you talk about what steps you have 
taken to improve customer service in communication with 
passengers? Senator Capito got at clearly some of the remedies.
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. Yes, we have implemented 
improved ways for customers to inquire with us about refunds, 
baggage return, and the like. And we have also made sure that 
we stayed well within the DOT guidelines for how we reimburse 
and refund customers who have had disruptions.
    We pride ourselves on having high net promoter scores, so 
we are making sure we have increased staff, increased 
investment to be able to respond to our customers when they 
contact us.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK, very good. I think you know how 
important I believe it is to have competitive airlines and have 
more competition. So, I am with you hoping that this is all 
going to work and that you get at some of these cyber issues 
because we can't have no competition in the airline.
    And you are clearly, as we all know, and your employees are 
one of the key competitors for people to get affordable. And I 
would put a pitch in for Sutton Country Airlines of Minnesota 
as well on that front.
    Ms. Pinkerton, I mentioned this legislation to get--to 
strengthen the resiliency and the cybersecurity of the NOTAM 
system. In your view, how can we make sure something like this 
doesn't happen again?
    Ms. Pinkerton. It is a great question. I think that thank 
you for the for the legislation. I think that is a great first 
step. I will say that I think that that is just the tip of the 
iceberg at the FAA.
    Their capital budget has been stagnant for 14 years, so I 
think we are going to see more and more--the program is 30 
years old, their facilities are 50 years old. I think this 
issue requires leadership from the White House, OMB, DOT, FAA, 
and then Congress supporting an ask for additional resources, 
frankly, and accountability--and accountability.
    Senator Klobuchar. Right. And as well, I am out of my time 
here. And maybe I will ask you a question on the record later, 
but just about the investment on the private side as well. It 
goes together.
    Ms. Pinkerton. It absolutely does. That is something we 
need to do together. We had record $21 billion worth of 
investment in technology this year, and we are predicting 
forecasting $27 billion next year compared to the $2.9 billion 
that the FAA is doing. For 5 percent of the GDP is what we 
support, so that is an important investment.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. Thank you all of you.
    The Chair. Senator Vance. Thank you. Senator Vance.

                STATEMENT OF HON. J. D. VANCE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Vance. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Thanks for 
everybody for your time. But I want to start actually just 
asking, maybe following up a little bit all that Senator 
Klobuchar talked about and some of the antitrust questions, so 
I would like to direct this to Mr. Hudson and then to Ms. 
Pinkerton, because I would like to get, you know, both sides 
perspective here.
    You know, there has been a lot of argument that the, you 
know, if you look at margins in the airline industry, if you 
look at certain geographic routes, if you look at certain 
practices, that there is some evidence of consolidation and 
consolidation in a way that is very anti-competitive and not in 
the best interest of consumers.
    I would love to get your reaction to that. What do you 
think the evidence is for consolidation? What do you think the 
evidence against it is? Because I would like to understand, 
frankly, what is going on.
    Mr. Hudson. Thank you, Senator. If we can look back at the 
history, 45 years since the Deregulation Act, what we see is 
originally there was a great profusion of new airlines that 
come into the system. Then it causes instability and many of 
the older ones go bankrupt and there is consolidation.
    We now have a system which essentially four airlines 
control over 80 percent of all the domestic flights. They 
essentially have an oligopoly. And the way we think you have to 
deal with that is have reasonable regulation as well as 
competition. I would like to quote two people who are really 
authorities in this who couldn't be here today.
    One, Alfred Kahn is a former Chairman of the CAB and 
considered the father of airline deregulation. He said this 
about 25 years ago when the problems we're really raising that 
we have today, these problems drive home the lesson that the 
dismantling of comprehensive regulation should not be 
understood as synonymous with total Government laissez faire.
    The principal policy failures over the past 15 years have 
been failures on the part of Government to vigorously and 
imaginatively fulfill responsibilities that we, and he is 
talking about himself really, in deregulating the industry 
never intended to abdicate. One other person I would imagine--
--
    Senator Vance. Sorry, sir--because of the limited time. 
Thank you, but Ms. Pinkerton, I would love to get your thoughts 
too.
    Ms. Pinkerton. Absolutely. I will give you the evidence. 
And I think the first piece of data, again is air fares, which 
are the fares and the ancillary fees in the last 40 years have 
dropped 55 percent.
    Flying used to be for the rich. It is not anymore. We want 
to keep it that way. Deregulation has democratized air travel. 
It is critical that we not turn the clock back on that. In 
terms of consolidation, don't forget, there were a lot of 
bankruptcies after 9/11 and there was consolidation after that.
    But has it produced? It has produced an industry where we 
have fierce competition, we have low-cost carriers, we have 
ultra-low-cost carriers, and we have global network carriers. A 
lot of people like to make the global network carriers out to 
be the bad boogeyman. The fierce competition from the low-cost 
carriers and the lower cost carriers means they are carrying 50 
percent of the market today.
    Global network carriers have lost market share. It has gone 
from 72 percent 20 years ago to 51 percent today. So, I think 
the evidence is in the data. It is the customer service and 
airfares, and the variety of airlines that are out there. 11 
years--we just had two new airlines get into this industry, 
Breeze and Avelo, plus the other 11 airlines that are out there 
competing fiercely every day.
    Senator Vance. Thank you. I appreciate that both. And 
during this last question, Mr. Watterson, just because this may 
have a policy implication, it may not, but how often do you get 
to talk to one of the senior executives of America's airlines, 
or one of America's biggest airlines.
    And so, you know, I have heard this from constituents many 
times. I have experienced this myself. You know, you go to the 
gate and your flight is supposed to leave in 20 minutes. And 
yet the flights that is supposed to take you to where it is 
supposed to go has not even arrived.
    And of course, it has to deplane and all that stuff. And 
then, you know, it is supposed to leave in 10 minutes and then 
you go and ask the gate agent, is the flight going to leave on 
time? And they say, yes, even though the flight hasn't arrived 
yet. And then an hour and a half later is when your flight 
actually departs.
    I mean, that is a pretty common experience, I think, for a 
lot of travelers across a number of airlines. I am just curious 
why you guys do that. Is there a business practice that 
motivates that decision? Because it seems like it is pretty 
obvious to everybody the flight is not going to leave on time, 
but there isn't always transparency about that fact.
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. And I apologize if you 
experience that in Southwest Airlines. The system--the 
situation we often find ourselves in is more smaller times, not 
an hour and a half.
    But usually when the flights are maybe plus or minus 15 
minutes, we are--we have two choices, be super transparent, and 
the time could go plus or minus 5 or 10 minutes every 5 or 10 
minutes or stick with the original time knowing that you are 
kind of a little bit off.
    And so, a lot of times we have customer confusion or it is 
a debate of like how frequently to update them knowing that 
time will change frequently, or do you stick with the original 
time even if it be off a little bit? So, there is probably not 
a very good answer in the end on which way to go.
    Senator Vance. Thank you.
    Senator Klobuchar. Senator Markey.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Madam Chair. During the first 11 
months of 2022, more than 25 percent of Southwest flights 
either arrived late or were canceled. Southwest's worst 
performance since 2014.
    Southwest pilots have been sounding the alarm about these 
operational issues for years. Yet these warnings were 
apparently summarily ignored. Mr. Watterson, did the Southwest 
Airline Pilots Association warn Southwest about the issues that 
led to the meltdown, yes or no?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. They warned us about 
some of the issues that were part of the meltdown.
    Senator Markey. OK. And why didn't you do anything about 
it?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. We were addressing part 
of those issues. Obviously, it was unsuccessful, but with 
regard to some of the crew scheduling, we had invested in those 
areas.
    Senator Markey. Well, again, because you did not listen to 
those warnings, catastrophic conditions were created for 
passengers by the hundreds of thousands all across our country. 
So, that is absolutely unacceptable. You were warned.
    That mismanagement absolutely led to real pain, real harm 
for families. In response to what happened, Senator Blumenthal 
and I called on Southwest to provide a cash hardship payment 
beyond refunds and reimbursements to help compensate for 
passengers suffering. Instead, Southwest gave each passenger 
frequent flier miles.
    Mr. Watterson, will Southwest commit to providing customers 
with a cash hardship payment instead of frequent flier points, 
if passengers desire that?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. We believe being 
generous with the reimbursements and giving frequent flier 
points is a preferable way to compensate our customers.
    Senator Markey. Well, unfortunately for those customers, 
those payments are little consolation for passengers like 
Christine Pastore and her husband, who were unable to visit 
their sick daughter at the hospital on her birthday over the 
holidays because of Southwest cancellations.
    Mr. Watterson, if an impacted passenger refuses to fly 
Southwest again, will Southwest commit to providing the 
passenger with a cash payment instead of the frequent flier 
points, yes, or no?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator, for the question. I 
think we have plenty of opportunities for them to fly us. They 
choose to fly somebody else, that is certainly their choice.
    Senator Markey. It is their choice. Would you give them a 
cash payment in order for them to fly on another carrier rather 
than Southwest?
    Mr. Watterson. No, Senator. We will not pay them cash to be 
in another airline unless it is for reimbursement of a flight 
they took in the disruption.
    Senator Markey. And again, that just misses the whole point 
about the customers, how they were inconvenienced, and how they 
need to be compensated with cash. It is deeply disappointing to 
us.
    For many passengers, the point system that you want to use 
is just going to be useless. It is nothing but an empty 
gesture. And I will say that 14 of the senators wrote you a 
letter asking you to answer questions on this and get the 
answers back by February 2nd. It is now February 9th.
    Obviously, your answers could have helped us to prepare for 
this hearing, and it is unacceptable that Southwest did not 
respond to the Congress in time so that we can be fully 
prepared for this hearing.
    Ms. Pinkerton, in your testimony, you write that 66 percent 
of flight cancellations between January and November of last 
year were caused by weather or the national aviation system. 
Here is another way to look at that data.
    More than one-third of cancellations were the airline's own 
fault, such as maintenance or staffing issues. Ms. Pinkerton, 
what percentage of flights were canceled in 2019 due to the 
airline's own operational problems?
    Ms. Pinkerton. Senator, I don't have that data at my 
fingertips, but what I did earlier was say that we take 
responsibility when cancellations are within our control. We 
acted very quickly in 2022. We did two things. We reduced our 
schedule by 50 percent and we went on a hiring binge. We hired 
50,000 people in 2022.
    Senator Markey. Right. Well, the answer is 28 percent, far 
less than the 35 percent last year that is due to the airline's 
own operational problems. And in 2018, it was under 25 percent. 
And in 2017, that figure was below 23 percent. So, again, this 
number just keeps rising year after year.
    There is a serious problem. In total, the airlines caused 
53,000 cancellations in the first 11 months of 2022, more than 
double than before the pandemic. Airlines also caused over 33 
million minutes in flight delays during that period, up 65 
percent over pre-pandemic figures. That data tells a clear and 
obvious story.
    Airlines failed travelers last year over and over. 
Passengers missed birthdays and weddings. And Congress needs to 
put guardrails on the industry to stop this putting of profits 
over people, and we also need to pass my Fare Fees Act so 
airlines stop nickel and diming customers for basic airline 
services, including my Families Fly Together Act, which 
reintroducing again today to prevent airlines from charging 
fees just so a mom can sit with a 5-year-old daughter on a 
plane.
    Ms. Pinkerton. Senator----
    Senator Markey. It is absolutely unacceptable that airlines 
charge for that service.
    Ms. Pinkerton.--I have to make clear, none of the air 
freight carriers charge a family seating fee. There are a 
couple of carriers that do so, but that is not targeted at us.
    But I also want to say, just on the whole ancillary fees, 
just because I know it's a passion of yours, I wanted you to 
know ancillary fees have actually been reduced over the last 
several years. In fact, change fees are now a third of what 
they used to be----
    The Chair. OK. So, Ms. Pinkerton, we have to get on to 
other people. This is an important issue and I guarantee you we 
will get into a much heavier debate. But accountability isn't 
reregulation, and I think we will have a lot of conversation 
about how to grow the airline industry and how to protect 
consumers.
    Senator Markey. So, can I just say 10 seconds, 10 seconds. 
Customers just feel like they are shaken upside down at the 
counter for all these additional charge fees. It just has to.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Duckworth, I am turning the 
gavel over to you. I hope you will call on Senators Budd, and 
yourself, and Senator Schmitt, and then recess us until after 
the secure briefing.
    We are going to take inventory to make sure that people do 
want to come back and ask further questions, but we will take 
account of that. But anyway, I am turning the gavel over to you 
to call on, Senator Budd is next. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. Yes, thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
Senator Budd.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED BUDD, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Budd. Thank you, Chair. And I thank the members of 
the panel for being here today. So, Mr. Watterson, Southwest 
December failure disrupted the Christmas plans of tens of 
thousands of Americans, as we all know. Families were unable to 
gather. People were left stranded.
    Luggage was shipped all over the country, separating from 
their people, from their possessions and sometimes even from 
their vital medications and their appointments. Now, you have 
had to answer a lot today, but for the sake of the folks I 
represent back in North Carolina, I would like to hear your 
answers to a few questions.
    So, what steps are your airline taking to make sure that 
you are ready for the next busy travel season, and also to deal 
with inclement weather?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. Our plan involves three 
buckets of actions. The first bucket is immediate short-term 
actions we have implemented just after the disruption so that 
this exact similar type of activity with regards to some of our 
crew scheduling software and some of our decisionmaking were 
remediated.
    We have a second bucket, which is each operations 
department is going back and revisiting the disruption and 
understanding what they in those departments could do better. 
That could be engine covers and engines, you know, de-icing 
trucks, things of that nature in these department.
    And then third, we have a systemic reviews at the company 
level where we understand how all the dominoes and sequence led 
to that last domino. And so, that third one will be bigger 
changes that we must fund over the balance of this year so by 
the next winter season we are ready.
    Senator Budd. Thank you for that. So, in 2022, I understand 
that your operating revenues were around just shy of $24 
billion and Southwest spends about $1 billion on technology 
every year. And I understand that you plan to spend $1.3 
billion in Fiscal Year 2023 on technology upgrades, right, so 
far?
    Mr. Watterson. Yes. Yes, that is correct.
    Senator Budd. OK, great. So, is roughly spending the same 
amount of money on this issue going to fix what went wrong back 
in December? So, here is the question behind the question, is 
it really a technology problem or is it a management problem?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. We have technology needs 
that need to be addressed. So, we will spend incremental to 
that $1.3 billion if necessary. If we find that there is 
technology that requires additional--that is not already 
funded.
    Number two, I mentioned earlier that we have some winter 
weather capabilities which we need to invest. And so, I think 
that is the biggest root cause we found so far, and so, that 
will take the likely the largest amount of our effort and our 
funding.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. So, of all your annual technology 
spending, was Southwest prioritizing its crew software for 
upgrades prior to December?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. We were--that spending 
was across all operation. The crew spending was in the earlier 
stages of its modernization, so to speak, whereas maintenance 
that had just been finished and flight operations was about 
midway.
    Senator Budd. Sounds like it was in the mix, but it wasn't 
the priority. It was part of a total technology upgrade plan, 
it sounds like.
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. It was more timing. The 
timing doesn't mean priority, so it is very important we will 
fund it. But the maintenance system came first and then came 
our ground operations, and now we are working on the flight 
operations.
    Senator Budd. So, thanks to--Mr. Watterson, thanks to 
airline deregulation, customers have many low-cost flying 
options and they get to vote with their feet and with their 
dollars.
    So, it is obvious that you all messed up and your 
customers, they expect you to fix it. So, will you commit to 
keeping us informed on the steps your company is taking to make 
sure that these meltdowns never happen again?
    Mr. Watterson. Absolutely, Senator. We will definitely 
follow up.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. Well, again, I want to thank the 
panel. Consumers, again, they get to vote on airline policies 
and performance, especially with their feet, and that vote is 
where they take their business.
    Travelers should never have to experience what happened 
over Christmas again. When carriers melt down, they need to fix 
the problem and regain customers' trust. Thanks to deregulation 
and increased customer choice, airlines already have a powerful 
incentive to provide services in ways that their customers find 
valuable, and we should keep it that way. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. I will recognize myself, five minutes 
for questions. Mr. Watterson, Chicago is home to Midway 
Airport, Southwest's second largest base of operations, and 
what happened over Christmas was appalling.
    We have heard many of these stories already today, and I am 
going to add to them because it is important to keep telling 
these stories because these are individual human beings who 
were significantly affected. One Chicagoan who was scheduled to 
fly with two young children to see their grandparents checked 
their coats and the children's car seats, only to be told their 
flight was canceled, and because of a staffing shortage, there 
was no one who could return those essential items to them.
    Imagine going without coats in Chicago in December. It is 
dangerous, and so, is putting children, small children, in a 
car without a car seat. It is actually illegal. I don't know 
what a family like this was supposed to do or how they were 
even able to get out of the airport and home safely. Another 
Southwest customer with stage four cancer got stuck in Chicago 
while trying to fly home for treatment.
    And the thing that I find so shocking is that while all 
these delays and cancellations were happening, and passengers 
were calling Southwest for help, it took hours to reach a live 
person, if they ever reached a live person at all.
    Mr. Watterson, will Southwest guarantee that passengers on 
canceled flights will be able to reach a live person within a 
reasonable amount of time when they call Southwest for help? 
Just say yes or no. It is a simple question.
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. In a normal disruption, 
we aim for a three to 9 minute average speed of answer, and 
that is how we fund our union represented call centers.
    Senator Duckworth. What is your--what is acceptable to you 
in terms of delay when it is not a normal disruption? Three 
days?
    Mr. Watterson. Unfortunately, Senator, it is a disservice 
to all your constituents that we had during that period of 
time, despite having all of our people that were available 
working in on overtimes. There is no amount of people we could 
have put in place to handle all the calls of that time because 
of the scale of the disruption.
    Senator Duckworth. OK. So, you won't guarantee that in a 
canceled flight, especially in an instance like that, that 
anybody will be able to reach a live representative from 
Southwest? That is what you are telling me?
    Mr. Watterson. Senator, in a day like today or analogous 
day, yes, we will be able to. An exact repeat of that 
situation, I apologize, we can't staff--there is no way we 
could staff that high.
    Senator Duckworth. OK, so, maybe they need to come to a 
senator and we will call a hearing, and then we will hand you 
pieces of paper with names and phone numbers on them. That is 
how people get reached. I mean, there are people still waiting 
to hear from Southwest, to reach a live person, and it has been 
a month.
    Mr. Watterson. I am deeply sorry, Senator. Our average 
speed of answer yesterday was 2 minutes. And so, we have 
definitely staffed. And to extent, people are not getting 
through, I deeply apologize. And definitely, please hand me the 
piece of paper and I will follow up.
    Senator Duckworth. For someone with a disability such as a 
visual impairment, the inability to reach someone by phone at 
Southwest is especially frustrating. Not all websites and 
mobile apps are easily accessible for persons with 
disabilities, despite existing guidelines and industry best 
practices, and also law, the ADA.
    Mr. Watterson, when was the last time Southwest reviewed 
its website and smartphone app to ensure that it is fully 
accessible for passengers with disabilities?
    Mr. Watterson. Senator, thank you for the question. I am 
unsure of the exact time that we did the last review. I will 
say that our Vice President over call centers is visually 
impaired, and that is a passion point for him.
    Senator Duckworth. OK. Well, I want to know when the last 
time that you reviewed was. If you could just get back to me, 
that would----
    Mr. Watterson. Yes, ma'am, I will.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Ms. Pinkerton, I am working 
on legislation to require the Department of Transportation to 
audit air carrier website accessibility. Given A4A's recent 
accessibility efforts, am I safe to presume that I can count on 
your organization's support for establishing such a 
requirement?
    Ms. Pinkerton. I would be absolutely happy to work with you 
on that. Senator Duckworth, I heard you loud and clear in your 
previous statements, especially about the wheelchair damage. 
And as you probably are aware, our CEOs recently recommitted to 
doing better on accessibility issues.
    I don't know if you are familiar with that, but it includes 
having an advisory committee at each airline, and the 
disability community is part of that, to hear those concerns. 
We have also committed to retraining all of our front-line 
employees and improving that training.
    And we have also committed to third, working with the 
disability community, identifying barriers in planes, and 
studying and trying to develop standards to provide better 
access. So, I just want you to know this has taken on a new 
level of importance at our organization and our CEOs. We are 
committed to doing better.
    Senator Duckworth. Well, I look forward to working with you 
on it. For my final question, you know, what is particularly 
frustrating about this meltdown is that Captain Murray and 
others literally warned that Southwest was one bad storm away 
from suffering serious disruption.
    Clearly, Southwest failed to heed the warnings of its 
frontline personnel. And I just have to say that we need to be 
reminded that the air crews are responsible for people's lives. 
This isn't just about lost luggage. These are professionals who 
commit every day to keeping their passengers safe and to 
making--not just for getting people from one place to another, 
but literally to safeguard their lives.
    And I think we often forget the role that aircrew members 
play. Mr. Watterson, what specific steps is Southwest 
implementing over the course of this year to earn back the 
trust of your flight crews, your gate agents, and all the other 
frontline personnel who were thrown into the breach by this 
collapse that many of your own personnel predicted could happen 
at the very next instance of significant bad weather, and then 
it did? What are you doing to earn back the trust of your crews 
and personnel?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. That is a very important 
point for us to do. And so, within our lessons learned work, we 
looked at systemic issues we face here. We are involving our 
union leaders, both in the input stage right now of what their 
opinions of what went wrong.
    We had a session with both our flight attendant and pilot 
unions, as well as our other front line work forces, and we 
committed them that once we have a comprehensive view of what 
went wrong, we will then share the recommendations out of that 
and work with them on developing the details of that, because I 
think the--involving them in the work to make sure this doesn't 
happen again is the best way to show engagement with them and 
to make sure it doesn't happen again.
    Senator Duckworth. I am going to ask you a question for the 
record, and I want you to respond to me in writing. Please 
explain this specific benchmark Southwest must hit in the 
coming months and years to fulfill your promise that this will 
never happen again. And make sure to address how the company 
would transparently measure progress and hold executives 
accountable for missing those benchmarks.
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. I now recognize my colleague 
from Missouri, Senator Schmitt--my neighbor.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC SCHMITT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI

    Senator Schmitt. Thank you, Chair. I also want to just 
preface this by saying it is an honor to serve on this 
committee. The State of Missouri has had for nearly 50 years 
someone on this committee to ask important questions and 
advocate for the people of the state. Southwest, of course, 
serves Saint Louis and Kansas City. Probably the principal 
carrier, certainly in Saint Louis. I know in Kansas City, too.
    And so, I am not going to rehash a lot of the questions 
that have been asked. I do want to ask, though, specifically on 
the IT and the technology issues that have been identified as 
part of the problem.
    What is the plan moving forward for that kind of 
maintenance and repair? Is there a schedule that has been put 
forth from an operational perspective? How are you guys 
addressing this in the long term?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. So, with regards to our 
flight scheduling software, there is a specific issue we had 
during the disruption and that one will be put in a fix we put 
in tomorrow into production. But the overall flight scheduling 
system, we are looking to upgrade, to replace that.
    So, we have conducted a request for information from 
software vendors to evaluate those, and we will be going to a 
request for proposal here after we have the findings from our 
assessment of what went wrong and after we reengage with our 
flight attendant and pilot unions.
    Senator Schmitt. Now is that the Sky software?
    Mr. Watterson. The system we call SkySolver, Senator, is 
what has--for patch, for a lack of a better word, they will be 
implemented tomorrow. SkySolver is a decision support tool, not 
necessary a scheduling tool.
    The scheduling tool underneath that is the one, that 
functioned fine during the meltdown, is one that we are looking 
to replace over the course of this year and next. And that is 
one we will engage with our unions on.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. And then, Dr. Winston, I have a 
question for you. Are you there, Dr. Winston? No longer?
    Dr. Winston. Yes, I am here.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. There we go. Thank you, and I know 
that we have obviously been very focused on what happened with 
Southwest, but there was more disruption in travel in January. 
And as you may recall, thousands of flights couldn't take off 
because of a failure of the FAA's NOTAM system.
    And I think it was Captain Murray that mentioned the 
normalizing of organizational drift. And I want to address that 
here with the Department of Transportation as it considers more 
red tape and regulations. In December of 21, 2021, the system 
known as the Notice to Airmen System was changed to the Notice 
to Air Mission Systems to be, as I quote, ``more inclusive to 
all aviators in missions.''
    And with the 2023 FAA reauthorization bill approaching, how 
can we ensure that the FAA stays true to its mission of making 
sure that it is the safest, most efficient aerospace system in 
the world as opposed to this kind of virtue signaling?
    Dr. Winston. I think the position that we have had now for 
many, many years is that it is really a bad idea to have the 
FAA both be a regulatory agency and a technology agency. It is 
not really equipped to do both.
    And I think the general recommendation is that we split the 
FAA to a regulatory part and the technology part. And that the 
technology part should be privatized, and the model for that is 
Air Canada. And I think that is really where we can make 
progress. And as you know, the FAA has been talking about a new 
air traffic control system for decades, and repeatedly it is 
found to be overbudget, behind schedule, but most importantly, 
it is behind the technology.
    You know, other countries have satellite-based air traffic 
control. You know, give much more freedom to more efficient 
flight paths to pilots. We don't have that. We still have a 
radar-based system.
    And that is obviously something that puts us behind. So, I 
think the recommendation of legislation that has been around 
for quite a while is separate FAA into a regulatory group, and 
then have a new group to do work on the technology, is sound, 
and that is what I would suggest that you focus on.
    Senator Schmitt. And Dr. Winston, just a follow up on that, 
do you know how much time was spent, again, trying to address 
this kind of language as opposed to putting that time and 
effort into making sure the system works best for customers, 
and that it is on time, and it is safe? Because this is not the 
first time the Department Transportation has engaged, again, in 
this kind of virtue signaling. Are you aware of how much time, 
or how could that time be better spent?
    Dr. Winston. Well, if we are interested, frankly, in 
improving air travel, and reducing delays and cancellations, 
start with the airports. I am serious. Introduce congestion 
pricing at airports. That could make an incredible difference 
in terms of the efficiency of the system.
    Senator Schmitt. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chairman.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. As you can see, many of the 
members have gone to vote. We are voting on the floor right 
now, so I am going to put the hearing into a recess, subject to 
the call of the Chair. Thank you.
    [Recess.]
    The Chair. The Senate Commerce Committee will reconvene. I 
appreciate our witnesses dealing with the Senate schedule and 
the secure briefing that members are attending. The briefing 
part has ended. The members are in their questions.
    So, I do believe that we will get rejoined with some of our 
colleagues here who didn't get a chance to ask questions. And 
hopefully in the next half an hour or so we will be able to 
wrap up those who are interested in asking questions today. So, 
if you can bear with us, we appreciate it.
    While we are waiting for colleagues to arrive, you know, 
one of the issues that we definitely want to look at in the FAA 
bill, and something that came up in the conversation, maybe I 
could get a little bit of input on is, what is this staffing 
capacity issue? Does anybody have a number for it?
    Does anybody have a percentage of increase over what our 
current system is that we think that we need to be skilling and 
training for that would help us build the kind of capacity that 
we need? We can talk later about whether we think the model 
that, say, United or other people have, which is I think a 
little bit about overstaffing and thus being able to handle 
outages and systems better.
    But let's just get an idea of what people think are the 
issues for staffing right now, that we need to do an upskilling 
for the workforce that we need.
    Ms. Pinkerton. So that I am clear, Senator, are you talking 
about the FAA or the carriers?
    The Chair. I throw it all in. I care about an aviation 
system that works. The safety and security bill that we have 
worked on clearly identified the needs of the FAA. We feel like 
the FAA needs a lot more technical workforce to keep pace with 
the level of innovation. But we, I am sure my members from both 
sides will show up and say that, you know, their economies are 
constrained by lack of pilots.
    You know, I have an airport in my state, Wenatchee, where 
people are telling them, well, we can only have one flight a 
day because we don't have enough pilots. We can't have rural 
economies basically just stranglehold because we don't have 
enough pilots, so we need to figure this out.
    So, anybody who has a thought on where we need to go in 
building capacity, that way--OK, we will go right down the 
line.
    Mr. Hudson. Thank you, Senator, for that question. We think 
that there are a number of things that could be used to take 
care of that problem. Right now, the airlines set their own 
requirements for reserved capacity, whether it is personnel or 
equipment. There are no minimum standards set by the 
Government.
    So, we think that there needs to be some minimum standard 
for that. Because the way it is now, some airlines are actually 
operating on negative reserves. So, in a perfect day, they 
cancel at least 1 to up to 3 or 4 percent of their flights. 
That saves them money. And as I indicated in my earlier 
testimony, we need to change the financial incentives from 
offering bad service that is profitable, and in this case, 
unreliability or unsafe, to service that is good for the system 
and good for the consumer.
    With regard to supply of pilots, we made a number of 
suggestions in June of last year, and it is attached to my 
testimony. Two of them were to authorize temporarily raising 
the age of mandatory retirement from 65 to 68 with good health. 
The second one was to offer temporary visas to foreign pilots 
that are already authorized by the FAA to fly to and from the 
United States, to fly temporarily within the United States.
    And a third proposal is to set a minimum wage for 
commercial airline pilots because we have increased the hours 
up to 1,500 as a minimum. But the, in many cases, the starting 
pilots especially are at a very, very low wage and that 
restricts supply, as two of those other things.
    The Chair. Thank you. I see my colleagues have arrived. I 
don't know whether Senator Blackburn is ready to go. She is 
ready to go. Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. I will pick up right where you are. 
Senator Graham has a bill that would allow pilots----
    The Chair. Is your microphone on?
    Senator Blackburn. Yes.
    The Chair. OK.
    Senator Blackburn. It is. Is it picking up? OK. That would 
allow--let's see what he calls this thing, Let Experienced 
Pilots Fly Act. And it would allow pilots to fly up into age 
67. So, what I would like to hear, Mr. Watterson, let me start 
with you. See what you think about that and then let's see, is 
it Captain Murray? I would like to hear from you on this also.
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. I would respectfully say 
that I think more can be done on the other end of the spectrum 
so to speak. It takes far too much money for an airline pilot 
to go through schooling and get the experience to qualify to 
become an airline pilot. Other professions in the United States 
receive Government assistance and education process, and that 
is not, to a fulltime, available to pilots.
    Senator Blackburn. Well, that takes time, sir. So I am 
talking about alleviating issues today. I live in Nashville. 
Fly you all a lot. I know sometimes we have grouchy flight 
attendants in some planes, people that are overworked. I talk 
to pilots. They are doing yeoman's work, and God bless them 
all, and all the ticket agents and gate agents that worked so 
hard through this debacle.
    So, this is something that could be done in the short term. 
You are talking about a long-term fix. I am talking about 
today. So just answer me, yes or no, would you support that?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. Unfortunately, I will 
defer to Captain Murray. We stand behind our pilots with regard 
to age limits.
    Senator Blackburn. All right, Captain.
    Mr. Murray. Well, and mine won't be a simple yes or no. I 
believe very strongly, especially with FAA reauthorization, 
that a lot of our issues with where the pilot shortage is 
occurring is at the evaluation level, and FAA availability to 
really test pilots and help them come up and get through check 
rides.
    And so, moving forward, that is where we have to address 
it, is really at the cradle. I have spent a fair amount of time 
with----
    Senator Blackburn. Well, and I agree with that. And when we 
do the FAA reauth, we can have those discussions. A part of 
that is someone who is 65 years old today and is going to turn 
66 next month, and they are in good health and they have a 
great record and they want to continue to fly for a year or 
two. It is allowing them to stay and to continue to work. That 
is simply what this bill does.
    Mr. Murray. And what we saw in 2008 with the age 60 to 65 
had some caveats in there as we--having to do with medicals, 
having to do with who flew. There were ICAO issues. And so, we 
would have to see how that is addressed in allowing from 65 to 
67 or 68, and however that is.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. All right. Thank you for that. Let's 
see, Ms. Pinkerton, I want to ask you about this. We have seen 
fuel cost escalate, and I know for years Southwest had done a 
pre-purchase on their fuel and they kept the costs low. It 
helped with their ticket price.
    And right now, one of the things that I hear from pilots 
and others is the accelerated cost of fuel and the effect that 
that has had, and how airline companies are having to take 
funds that were set aside for other activity and place it to 
cover fuel cost. Give me your read on that. What do you see?
    Ms. Pinkerton. Well, definitely fuel prices in 2022 were up 
87 percent over the prior year, so there is no doubt. And then 
in the month of January, we saw it go up even further.
    So, it is the price of oil, but we also have a unique 
situation with jet fuel has to be refined separately, and we 
have got, frankly, refinery shortages in this country----
    Senator Blackburn. So, supply chain issues----
    Ms. Pinkerton. Exactly, exactly----
    Senator Blackburn. OK, let me--Mr. Watterson, how has the 
increased cost of fuel affected you all? Did that take money 
away from other projects like enhancing your technology?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. We are--it doesn't take 
it necessarily directly away from our other projects. We are 
experiencing elevated both fuel costs, but also what is called 
the ``crack spread.'' The difference between the price of oil 
and the price of jet fuel is elevated because of refinery 
capacity issues.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you for that. Madam Chairman, I 
hope that as we look at this issue and look at FAA reauth, that 
we will hear from some of the other airlines about their 
response on this December storm.
    I know that there are airlines that have not made refunds. 
I know there are airlines, I know families that booked with air 
miles and the flight got canceled, but they won't give the air 
miles back to people here.
    And this was--they had no control over this. So, it is not 
just Southwest. I think Allegiant, American, Delta, all of 
these, JetBlue, we need to hear from all of them on how they 
are dealing with these issues.
    The Chair. I couldn't agree more, Senator Blackburn. And 
consumers deserve refunds----
    Senator Blackburn. Yes, they do.
    The Chair. If we give a licensure through the FAA to 
certify that you can be an air carrier and deliver service, you 
need to deliver it or give a refund. OK, Senator, Sinema is 
next.

               STATEMENT OF HON. KYRSTEN SINEMA, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA

    Senator Sinema. Thank you, Chair Cantwell. And thank you to 
the witnesses for joining us today. Southwest Airlines is one 
of the largest airlines serving my home State of Arizona, with 
a base at Phoenix Sky Harbor and a significant footprint at 
Tucson International. And due to Southwest's connection with my 
state, our office has heard from many, many Arizonans who were 
impacted by Southwest's 15,000 flight cancellations over the 
holidays.
    In many cases, these Arizonans were unable to be with their 
families for Christmas. And many Americans who wanted to 
celebrate the holidays on vacation in Arizona couldn't make it 
there, which hurt both the travelers and the small businesses 
in Arizona who were ready to welcome them to the State.
    So, just like so many Arizonans, the staff of Senate 
offices were also impacted by Southwest cancellations. One of 
my staffers was stranded at his connecting airport, rebooked on 
a flight multiple days later, which was incidentally also 
canceled, and never made it home for the holidays because of 
the disruption.
    So, my first question is for Mr. Watterson. We know that 
many Southwest passengers, like my staffer, were stranded for 
days at their connecting airports. And my question is, what did 
Southwest do, if anything, as the cancellations increased to 
ensure that passengers with special needs, like unaccompanied 
minors, persons with disabilities, those with dietary 
restrictions, were safe and able to obtain food and lodging, 
particularly when many businesses were closed on Christmas Day?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator, for the question. With 
regards to unaccompanied minors and young travelers, early in 
disruption, I can't remember exactly what day, but we can 
follow up with your staff, we prohibited the travel of young 
travelers under the age 18 and unaccompanied minors on 
connecting journeys. We allowed them on just a point-to-point 
flight, that way we reduce the risk of them being stranded 
because of a disruption in the connecting point.
    With regards to travelers' disabilities, we certainly, in a 
retrospective, looked at the number of our complaints and 
failures with regards to assistive devices, and we found 11 of 
those. And in each 11 of those we offered replacement services 
for those customers while well we serviced their equipment, and 
that rate was similar to the rate we experienced in our normal 
times, which we believe is still too high and have efforts 
under way to lower that. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Sinema. According to your website, Southwest, has 
committed to, ``reimbursing reasonable expenses incurred as a 
result of disruption, including meals, hotel accommodations, 
and alternate transportation.'' And on the website, the word 
reimbursement is used repeatedly.
    Yet the calls I am getting to my office say that when folks 
are receiving these payments, the payments are being labeled as 
settlements instead of reimbursements. Now, not everyone 
understands the difference there, but as I am sure you 
appreciate, the term settlement implies that customers are 
agreeing to forfeit their rights to pursue legal remedies, 
something that is not disclosed to customers on the website 
when they are uploading the receipts for reimbursement.
    So, why is Southwest describing these payments as 
reimbursements on the website, but as settlements when the 
payment is made? That is my first question. And my second 
question is to ask you for a commitment that despite this 
language change, I would like you to make clear that Southwest 
is not arguing that a customer has waived their legal rights 
because they followed your company's instructions to submit 
receipts for reimbursement?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. I was unaware that on 
the payment website that it was label settlement. We did not 
mean it to be that way. We only meant it to be, we are 
returning your money and nothing else.
    Senator Sinema. OK, so, folks--So, you do want--So, you 
believe that Southwest customers do retain all of their legal 
rights and are not waiving them when they receive their 
reimbursements?
    Mr. Watterson. I am unfamiliar with the topic, Senator. It 
is our intention just to refund people's money and not take 
away the legal rights. I can certainly follow up with that. I 
apologize, I don't know that information off the top of my 
mind.
    Senator Sinema. Great, good. Well, that commitment is very 
important. On the topic of reimbursements, we heard that 
Southwest wasn't promising to reimburse expenses until multiple 
days after the cancellations began.
    So, a lot of customers in the early days didn't book 
alternative transportation, like they didn't book expensive 
alternative flights because they didn't know whether or not 
Southwest would pay them back.
    So, my question is, why did it take so long to make this 
commitment? And for customers who are concerned about this for 
the future, I am asking that you update your contract of 
carriage to clearly state that reasonable expenses will be 
reimbursed in the event that a similar disruption occurs in the 
future.
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. The early part 
disruption was a weather event like everyone else experienced, 
and then it turned into a crew mix event that only we 
experienced. And when that happened, my recollection is that we 
then changed our language to be that we would reimburse.
    And then I believe we have held true to that word as well. 
And as far as the updates to our contract of carriage, I 
believe we are consistent with the DOT policy. We certainly 
want and endeavor to reimburse our customers, but I will commit 
you that we will go back and we look at that language and make 
sure it is up to date.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. Chair Cantwell, I know my time 
has expired, so I am going to submit another question for the 
record about code sharing and interline agreements around 
rebooking on other lines. I don't have time to get to that 
today, but it is something I am very concerned about, and so I 
will follow up. Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you. Thank you for that question. Senator 
Rosen.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. There we go--and if I can get the unmute 
button to work. Thank you, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz. 
Today's hearing is so important because I don't have to tell 
anyone here that Nevada's tourism economy, it is the backbone 
of our state.
    And like my colleagues, I agree that it is unacceptable 
that thousands of flights during the busiest travel season of 
the year were canceled or significantly delayed. They left many 
travelers stranded, affecting plans to be with families and 
loved ones.
    And like every other state, these cancellations had a 
devastating impact on families across Nevada. I received 
messages from all around the state, people who were affected by 
this unmitigated disaster. One gentleman wrote to me about 
spending all of Christmas Day at the Reno-Tahoe Airport after 
multiple flight cancellations, going back at 4 a.m. on 
Christmas Eve morning.
    Another constituent e-mailed me about cancellations, 
stranding his family on the way home to Las Vegas cost him more 
than $3,000 in alternative transportation and lodging. Besides 
all this impact to travelers, the cancellations also hurt the 
workers in my state. They are the backbone of Nevada's travel, 
tourism, and hospitality industry. It hurt our airports, which 
are the gateways to our economy, and it will hurt the future 
travel to my state if we don't fix the problems caused by this 
calamity right away.
    And so, I am a former computer programmer. I am going to 
talk a little bit about IT integration here. I want to discuss 
Southwest technology infrastructure. Mr. Watterson, we have 
heard today the primary reason for the meltdown in December was 
a system failure based--caused by your outdated optimization 
technology.
    Why now, when you mix a decades old IT system that the 
airline's outgrown with a staffing shortage and winter storm in 
the busiest travel season of the year, the end result--well, we 
know what it was, over 15,000 flights canceled, people sleeping 
in airports, people missing holidays or medication, so on and 
so forth. It might have been the perfect storm, but it was 
entirely predictable.
    So, Mr. Watterson, in addition to the upgrades you plan to 
make as a result of this incident, does Southwest have a long-
term plan for--what is your plan for long-term technology, for 
the integration of these outdated systems?
    And what is your next phase? And what is that long-term 
strategic plan that the traveling public, number one, and then 
the hospitality industry that relies for jobs and income on 
people traveling, what is your long-range plan so you don't 
outgrow these systems as well?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. With regards to our 
disruption, technology was an issue, it wasn't the root issue. 
But there is technology work to do as a result, and we will 
certainly fund that both out of our current plans and 
incremental money if necessary. Additionally, the root cause, 
we believe, of the disruption was our capacity to handle winter 
operations, and that needs substantial improvement this year.
    And so, that is what we endeavor to fix this year. But over 
a multi-year period, we will be going through every part of our 
operation and modernize it. And it is one of the tenets of our 
new CEO, to modernize the operation over the next 3 years. And 
so, we will be proceeding apace in every work group, whether it 
is technology, equipment, or processes.
    Senator Rosen. And so, I am going to build on that because, 
of course, we have a hospitality work force, and our 
hospitality and our travel, the ecosystem of travel, relies on 
staffing, flight crews on the plane, maintenance people, 
baggage handlers, off the plane, all of that. So, it relies on 
staffing to be sure that people who are traveling get to where 
they need to go.
    So, can you talk about your staffing a little bit? How is 
it disruptions over the holiday season, how it impacted your 
pilots, your flight attendants, other airline employees, like I 
said, baggage handlers, gate agents and the like?
    How do we be sure that they are taken care of and this is 
not going to happen to them in the future? Did you reimburse 
them for all the accommodations and meals, transportation if 
they were stranded?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. Our people were the hero 
of the event. They showed up. We had absolutely no problem with 
attendance nor service, and so we are very grateful for our 
people who showed up.
    There is no way we can give back the time that was taken 
from them, but we were able to show them some gratitude with 
the incremental pay and then we are going to be involving them 
in our efforts to make sure this doesn't happen again. I think 
it is the part--the biggest thing we could do.
    Senator Rosen. And then, of course, I just have a few 
seconds left, but how are you working with the airports? Every 
airport and major airport and states, this is a huge economic 
driver. Again, the ripple effects for the related entities, 
airport concessionaires and their workforce. Are you working 
with airports? Can you tell us briefly what you are doing to be 
sure the impact on their staff, that is so great?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. There are specific 
airports where we had infrastructure shortcomings, not because 
the airport failed to provide it, but because we did not ask 
for it. And now we will ask for incremental infrastructure as 
part of our effort to revamp our winter operations.
    Senator Rosen. And I am going to submit this for the record 
because we would like some actual data, but does everyone have 
their luggage, their strollers, their other essentials, 
wheelchairs? You can respond to that.
    I am sure I might have somebody after me and I have gone 
over my time. But I want to be sure that everyone who was 
traveling is reunited with the important items that they left 
home with.
    Mr. Watterson. Yes, Senator. We have returned every single 
bag except for there is 200 we still have that have no markings 
nor identifying information that we are holding, and we will 
continue to hold those until we can find somebody who owns it.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Lujan.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I will pick up 
where Senator Rosen concluded there. From a reimbursement 
perspective, I am pleased to see that Southwest is taking its 
commitment to customers seriously, providing reimbursements and 
refunds, points and direct delivery.
    As we have heard from colleagues today, that many 
constituents that we have across the country still have not 
been made whole. Nonetheless, I hope that there is a process 
that we can talk about, as our offices are working on this with 
everyone.
    Southwest has set up a portal, but if there is a way for 
our offices with constituent services to be able to work with 
our constituents and make sure that we are pointing in the 
right place, that would be appreciated.
    And I hope you all can let us know what that is, and where 
it is, and who the person is for us to work with. Can you share 
the number of customers who have not received reimbursements?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. Let me consult my notes 
here. Senator, we have had 284,188 cases, eligible cases 
submitted, and we have reimbursed 273,406. And that leaves 
10,782 that have not yet been reimbursed, but those are ones 
that have been submitted most recently. And we were within the 
DOT timelines of 30 days for processing all those.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate those numbers. Mr. Watterson, 
is Southwest still working to follow through to ensure 100 
percent of your customers are made whole, including reaching 
out to customers who may be unaware of the available remedies 
via e-mail or phone?
    Mr. Watterson. Yes, Senator. We have e-mailed every single 
person that was disrupted and gave them points, as well as 
apologized and gave them resources to contact us back, should 
they need so.
    Senator Lujan. Do you know that every Southwest customer 
that was impacted has an e-mail?
    Mr. Watterson. We know which ones do and do not. The large 
majority have an e-mail. As part of their purchase, you have to 
enter an e-mail to get your receipt. So, except for 
exceptionally small circumstances, everyone has an e-mail, 
Senator.
    Senator Lujan. So, for the folks that don't have an e-mail 
that you have identified, how have you reached out to them?
    Mr. Watterson. I am unaware--I can follow up with you, 
Senator. It is a very small number.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. Well, I hope that they 
are not just left out say, oh, well, that is the cost of doing 
business, because it turns out in America, you know, 
connectivity is a problem. So, coming from a more rural state, 
I just hope that we can get there. So, I look forward to 
hearing back there as well.
    Now, several of my colleagues today have raised concerns 
about the fact that Southwest frontline employees, from pilots 
to flight attendants to customer service representatives, have 
been sounding the alarm on many of these known issues for 
years, and yet Southwest did not implement changes to address 
them.
    I am disappointed to hear that the voices of staff on the 
frontlines of Southwest Airlines operations, including pilots, 
flight attendants, and customer service representatives, have 
not been a priority.
    Mr. Watterson, I want to follow up on your commitment to my 
colleague, Senator Duckworth, that your front-line employees 
will be at the decisionmaking tables as Southwest reflects on 
the December 2022 meltdown.
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. Yes, we have involved 
all of our unions from our frontline in our lessons learned. We 
are looking at understanding what went wrong. And then once we 
synthesize that into what we should do about it, we will 
reengage with each union and with the efforts that were, you 
know, relevant to their work group, and involve them in the 
plan for going forward.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that change. As a result of 
implementing that--changes, is Southwest considering changes to 
the management structure and decisionmaking process to ensure 
the voices of your frontline workers are heard and prioritized 
as part of Southwest decisionmaking process?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator. I think with a certain 
of our work groups, our relationship has maybe atrophied. And I 
have committed in my position to reengage and work with their 
elected union officials to develop a better relationship, maybe 
a return of a better relationship with those work groups.
    Senator Lujan. That is a yes to the question?
    Mr. Watterson. I believe that Senator. Maybe I 
misunderstood the question.
    Senator Lujan. So, Southwest, in addition to the change 
that you just laid out to me with creating a process to hear 
from more frontline employees, has Southwest also changed its 
management structure to ensure that that is included?
    Mr. Watterson. I am sorry, Senator. Specifically, what kind 
of things do you have in mind? I am not sure if I follow your 
question.
    Senator Lujan. They weren't being listened to before ? so 
they weren't being listened to before. Your management 
structure told them, thanks for being here, but I am not going 
to listen to you. So, have you changed your management 
structure so that that is not happening?
    Mr. Watterson. Thank you, Senator, for the explanation. 
Yes, we have made management changes and we will change our 
management practices more than the structure of how we engage 
with our union leaders going forward.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate it. Thanks for the time, Madam 
Chairman.
    The Chair. Senator Young. And then Senator Hickenlooper, 
and Senator Sullivan.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TODD YOUNG, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA

    Senator Young. Well, I thank our witnesses for being here 
today. And I know a number of my constituents are tuning in for 
this hearing because the recent challenges experienced by 
Southwest have impacted some of them and really in a personal 
way.
    This whole situation is sort of interesting to me, not in 
an academic way, but I think academics will take note. I mean, 
this will be like a business case study moving forward, from 
the lead up to the Christmas time flight issues, to the initial 
response, the realization that things have really hit the fan, 
and now the current response by businesses.
    And to me, it is an illustration, as I watch it play out, 
that the market really can work. I think a number of consumers 
are making up their mind. Are they going to continue to--are 
they going to continue to do business with Southwest Airlines? 
In my experience, most will probably conclude, yes, because of 
the value proposition.
    Others haven't made up their mind yet and so forth. But 
that ability to exercise choice, which is the hallmark of the 
free enterprise system, is playing out before our eyes. And I 
think we have to be really careful here, as we discuss an 
appropriate regulatory framework, not to overshoot and limit 
choice too much.
    So, all of us here, I think, without exception, would say 
Government has an appropriate role to play regulating, 
especially in the area of safety, regulating our carriers. I 
think it is very important to make sure that we don't destroy 
the proverbial goose that lays the golden egg.
    Now, with that lead in, I want to ask a question to Dr. 
Winston. I think he might be joining us remotely. That is my 
hope. Because in his testimony, he discusses a few policies 
that would enable the U.S. aviation system to more effectively 
respond to unexpected events, events like the Christmas time 
flight challenges.
    So, I ask Dr. Winston, if you are still there, sir. Can you 
discuss some of those policies, namely the issue of foreign 
competition and cabotage rights?
    Dr. Winston. OK. Well, that is, you know, what we are 
talking about there is a longer run policy. And the idea, 
obviously, is to stimulate airline competition with all the 
benefits that we have already received from deregulation, and 
effectively another round. You will have more people then 
competing on routes and offering new innovative services.
    And there will be spare capacity, so to speak, or at least 
additional capacity. You know, I have had experiences, probably 
everyone has, had a canceled flight on one carrier, but there 
was another airline operating at the airport and I went to them 
and took that flight.
    So, those kinds of backups could be around and would help. 
But I think the other one, the point that I keep on harping on 
that doesn't seem to get much attention is the role of 
airports. All this is happening at airports, right. It is their 
property, so to speak.
    What are they doing to be working with carriers and trying 
to provide transparent information, and accommodating them in 
some kind of sleeping arrangements when things break down? I 
think that is where we need to stimulate much more competition 
and interaction, where airports have an incentive to work with 
airlines and have the airports, for example, be in charge of 
de-icing.
    It is kind of amazing that the airlines have that response 
when the airports should be doing that, and I think they would 
compete to do that. So, I think it is the combination of both, 
the infrastructure and competition that is going to, you know, 
improve things greatly.
    Senator Young. Dr. Winston, thank you for that response. 
And with your indulgence, I would like a member of my staff to 
follow up with you about those suggestions, if that is OK.
    Dr. Winston. Sure.
    Senator Young. All right. Ms. Pinkerton, your association 
represents a number of U.S. airlines, and I am interested in 
the broader context about what is happening industrywide, and 
what should happen to passenger carriers as a whole in response 
to this high-profile flight disruption. Can you briefly touch 
on whatever piece you think is relevant about the state of the 
industry and being concerned about efforts to reregulate the 
industry?
    Ms. Pinkerton. Well, absolutely. As I explained in my 
testimony, I think carriers at the beginning of 2022 saw that 
they were living in a post-pandemic world. They adjusted their 
schedules. They reduced their schedules and they went on a 
hiring binge. All of our carriers have done that.
    And then they focused on making sure that the schedule they 
put out, that they have the resources to meet that schedule. 
So, I take what Chair Cantwell said very seriously, 
accountability is appropriate. But what the concern is here, 
for example, in the refunds base, I said in the last 3 years 
since the pandemic, we have refunded $32 billion worth of cash 
refunds.
    So, and we have brought the complaint rate down to 0.01 
percent. So that is just one example of a place where I think 
there, you know, there is plenty of incentive. The customers 
are voting with their feet, their wallets. They will make 
decisions about what carrier they want to fly.
    But I think it is important, since we know that 
deregulation has reduced airfares dramatically, brought us more 
service and more choice, not to overreact on the regulatory 
framework with a one size fits all type of approach.
    The Chair. Thank you. Your time has expired. Senator 
Hickenlooper. And after Senator Hickenlooper, Senator Sullivan.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you 
all for taking your time out of your busy lives to be here with 
us. Ms. Pinkerton, the FAA has an important mandate to ensure 
passengers have reliable, safe, accessible access to travel.
    Agency oversight rule applies to large hub airports, 
essential air services for rural communities, and more. Ms. 
Pinkerton, what would the FAA do to improve air service with a 
permanent Senate confirmed administrator in place?
    Ms. Pinkerton. Probably a better question for FAA, but I 
can say what we would like a new administrator to do is to 
exercise leadership. And I think one thing that is essential to 
support small community service is having the adequate staffing 
and technology at the FAA, quite frankly. I mean, it is very 
important.
    The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has told 
us there is a controller shortage. We know that for small 
communities there is a serious pilot supply issue. I want to 
applaud those who are working on legislation that would provide 
aid for pilot education and training. Those are the types of 
things we would hope a new administrator could focus on.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you. And the FAA is not 
here per se. They are here, but I just wanted to speak to the 
other committee members that President Biden re-nominated in 
January, Phil Washington to become the first African American 
to lead FAA. And he is someone I worked with a number of years.
    I want to just make sure that the other committee members 
know that this is long overdue. We need leadership at that 
level. And this is a classic example of where that would be 
needed. Mr. Washington served our country for 24 years in the 
U.S. Army. He rose to the back of the rank of command, Sergeant 
Major, which means he is one of those people that actually gets 
things done.
    Some people say he hasn't had enough air experience, but 
immediately following the winter storm catastrophe, Mr. 
Washington is now the head of the third busiest airport in the 
world, Denver International Airport.
    Mr. Washington, after that winter storm catastrophe, he 
launched an after-action review with its airline partners, 
including Southwest Airlines, and they are hard charging in 
terms of identifying operational barriers and methods to 
improve service in and out of DIA, and how to make sure that 
each airport is doing everything they can to make sure these 
things won't--such an event doesn't happen again.
    Mr. Washington has led major transportation organizations 
now for the last 12 years. He was a CEO--I first met him when 
he was running the regional transportation district in 
Colorado, which had passed fast tracks 121 miles of new light 
rail track, at the time, the largest transit initiative in the 
modern history of the United States. He was so successful that 
we lost him.
    He was lured away to Los Angeles to run their county 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. And then he was brought 
back as the CEO of DIA about three and a half years ago and was 
appointed with unanimous support by city council. Even as he 
hit--came to DIA, hit the ground running because he was in a 
situation--we were at about 60 million or 65 million passengers 
every year in an airport that was designed for 50 million.
    He put the Great Hall Terminal Project, which had been 
through years of delays, got it right back on track and back on 
budget. It will modernize the airport's terminal and screening 
capacity dramatically.
    He launched DIA's Vision 100, which is an initiative to 
make sure that we can support 100 million annual passengers by 
the end of this decade. And he created the first of its kind 
Center for Equity and Excellence in Aviation, to grow a skilled 
and diverse aviation workforce of tomorrow.
    Now, as Congress prepares to reauthorize FAA for the first 
time since 2018, it needs to have a permanent leader in place. 
The agency, I think, is hamstrung on major rulemaking is 
without a permanent administrator. They need to be able to 
implement bipartisan infrastructure law programs.
    I think Mr. Washington is uniquely and exceptionally 
qualified to serve at the FAA. He has got the military 
discipline, the organizational leadership, and the forward-
looking vision. So, I want to urge the committee to make sure 
that we hold the hearings and get Phil Washington's nomination 
confirmed ASAP.
    So you guys got off the hook there a little bit. Thank you. 
I yield back.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you. Well, I guess the Chair has 
left, so I am going to call on myself here.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hickenlooper. I was going to call on you.
    Senator Sullivan. Oh, thank you. So, Captain Murray, I am 
curious about the role that the pilots association are going to 
play in the third-party assessment that is being commissioned 
by Southwest. I am a big fan of our pilots, fly a lot, being 
the senator from Alaska.
    And I know almost all--I feel like I know almost all the 
pilots up in Alaska. A lot of them are veterans. I am sure a 
lot of them are veterans in your organization. But how are--how 
do you think you guys are going to fit into this assessment, 
and what are going to be the highlights from your perspective?
    Mr. Murray. Well, thank you, Senator, and thank you for the 
question. I think that SWAPA is uniquely qualified to provide 
input, and we have been trying to do that for many years. I 
would like to say that Southwest has an airline to run.
    We have an airline to analyze. And that is what we do, and 
we have some of the best in the world at analyzing. And as I 
have spoken about processes before, that is where I feel, along 
with, you know, an IT support system for the correct processes, 
has to be addressed.
    Mr. Watterson just testified that, you know, tech was an 
issue but not the issue. And I agree. He said primarily, 
though, it was the capacity to handle the storm. And with that, 
I disagree with.
    We have been sounding the alarms for years, and I know that 
has been echoed in this room today, over two dozen times, 
through podcasts, through e-mail blasts. We have been trying to 
draw attention to the chaos that all of our pilots have to deal 
with every day.
    And so, I am concerned moving forward that we are not going 
to be addressed or any of the front-line employees are going to 
be addressed as true partners.
    Senator Sullivan. Yes.
    Mr. Murray. And that has to be done.
    Senator Sullivan. Well, I hope that happens. I mean, Mr. 
Watterson, is that going to be--obviously, I mean, your 
intention. That is part of the reason you brought the pilots 
in, I am assuming, for the third-party assessment.
    And I am sure you have seen Captain Murray's testimony, 
which has these history of meltdowns that he lays out on this 
chart. Is that going to be your intention to work with them in 
terms of the assessment?
    Mr. Watterson. Yes, Senator. We have met with them on a 
couple of occasions. We intend to meet with them on a lot more 
occasions. We also intend to improve the processes Captain 
Murray discusses and others. An effort that had already been 
started prior to the disruption to do exactly that, but it 
certainly will work ahead for us.
    Senator Sullivan. Good. I want to turn to the broader 
topic, I know we have already talked about it a lot, Ms. 
Pinkerton, on the issue of technology, and then everybody else 
kind of weigh in.
    And we had a--well, I noticed the CEO of United Airlines, 
Scott Kirby, in his tech infrastructure--well, it was an 
earnings call in mid-January. He said the FAA, as well as most 
airlines, with the exception of network characters have, 
``outgrown their technology infrastructure and simply cannot 
operate reliably in this more challenging environment.''
    Do you agree with that? And do others agree with that? And 
do we do about it? And is that both--is that, and I am--I mean, 
obviously I would rather have Mr. Kirby speak to his own words. 
But do you think he is getting at aviation infrastructure 
technology, or FAA, or the combination of both?
    Ms. Pinkerton. So, I won't address a particular airline's 
comments, but what I will do is speak for the entire industry.
    Senator Sullivan. Well, he was trying to speak to--you 
know, as the CEO of a big, prominent airline, he probably has a 
pretty good purview.
    Ms. Pinkerton. Yes, I would say I do as well, having worked 
closely with carriers now for over 15 years. So, I can tell you 
that this year, 2022, all of our carriers together made record 
investments in their people and in their product and 
technologies to make sure that they can recover from 
operational issues.
    We hired more people in 2022. You have heard we have needed 
that extra staffing even for a smaller schedule. Technology is 
something that is a constant refresh. I put these technology 
bucket investments into three categories. One is for the 
passenger, the apps, the communication, the bag tracking that 
goes on automatically from your phone. Then we have got what we 
give our front-line employees.
    They have got iPads and Apple phones and technologies that 
they can use to assist passengers. But then importantly, there 
is this operational technology bucket. And I can tell you, our 
carriers have made--done a lot of things that I think are 
actually instructive for the FAA, such as moving some of their 
onsite, on premises technology to the cloud to make sure that, 
and then having, you know, an East Coast cloud and a West Coast 
cloud so that if the East Coast cloud goes down, you have still 
got the West Coast and you don't have everything at one 
physical location.
    More operational kind of computing juice so that when you 
have this influx of data with irregular operations, you can 
handle it. So, $21 billion is a record for investment, and we 
are forecasting $27 billion. I think carriers are absolutely 
taking the operational reliability and technology issues very 
seriously and they are investing robust amounts of money.
    Senator Sullivan. Let me ask--Madam Chair, can I ask one 
final question? I know I have run out of time. But, you know, 
there has been a couple reports in the news, just in the last 
months, of some FAA--of some near-misses within our airline 
system.
    Fortunately, nothing happened in terms of an accident, but 
I think most Americans take for granted but are proud of how 
safe our passenger airline service is, because it is quite 
remarkable when you think about it. But are there any things 
that you, Ms. Pinkerton, or anyone else on the panel, think 
that we need to be thinking here to get ahead of the curve?
    What I always think, when Congress is acting at its best, 
it is preempting challenges and getting in front of them, 
before--you know, you don't want to have a hearing because 
there was a major midair crash, and the FAA realized it had a 
problem.
    From a safety perspective, is there anything right now that 
any of you would say, hey, make sure you are getting on this 
and watching it before something bad happens, none of which--we 
don't want anything bad to happen. I will start with you.
    Ms. Pinkerton. Yes. And I can't obviously talk about any 
particular incidents that were under investigation. But I will 
tell you, we are extremely proud of our safety record. It is 
because we do things like systems, management systems analysis 
of safety issues to see if there are trends.
    And so, we try to be more predictive in our work on safety 
than forensic, for example. So, I am not aware that there are 
any troubling trends that are out there right now. And again, I 
think our safety record--I have seen a couple of stories post 
these incidents that compare our record.
    It is much safer to fly than it is to drive, be in a bus, 
or train. But that doesn't--we take every incident seriously 
and we learn from it.
    Senator Sullivan. Any other panelists who want to just 
comment?
    Dr. Winston. Can I make a comment?
    Senator Sullivan. Sure.
    Dr. Winston. Can I talk? OK. So, let me just stress again, 
I think the fundamental problem is that the Government's 
comparative advantage is not really to manage and operate a 
technology service. That is something the private sector can do 
much better.
    And that is why it is important to separate FAA into a 
safety regulatory responsibility and have a new agency, 
preferably private, that is responsible for adopting a new 
technology for air traffic control that focuses on a 
constellation of satellites, which will keep much better watch 
on aircraft and expand airspace capacity in the process.
    I think that is really the first order of business, if you 
really want to improve the system in the long run.
    The Chair. OK, quickly, Captain Murray and Mr. Hudson.
    Mr. Murray. Yes. I just want to add that there is an 
infrastructure issue that has to be addressed. That is what you 
all will be doing. But at the end of the day, whatever failures 
occurred, and it is still under investigation, the latest one, 
at the end of the day, what saved those two airplanes was an 
experienced professional crew that broke the error chain at the 
very last moment.
    And it is an incumbent, as we move forward and as we see 
emerging technologies, that two crew members stay on the flight 
deck to prevent exactly what occurred in Austin.
    The Chair. Yes, Mr. Hudson.
    Mr. Hudson. Some things that we have suggested in the past 
would be to involve NASA, not just the FAA, in what has been 
called NextGen, which has been delayed or has gone through 
maybe five iterations.
    Second, that we need stress tests on the computer systems, 
both the scheduling and the safety. We don't have that right 
now. And we would agree somewhat with the doctor here that we 
should consider standing up a new agency for air travel 
regulation and taking the safety aspects from the FAA and the 
economic regulation in Transportation Office of the Secretary, 
which is really there are by historical accident, and put them 
into a new agency that will really be focused on safety as well 
as good regulation.
    The Chair. Thank you.
    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Yes. Thank you, Senator. I know how important 
air travel is to Alaska, so. Well, believe it or not, I think 
we are at the end of the road here of getting members to ask 
questions of our witnesses. I did want to clarify something, 
Mr. Watterson, on the question Senator Lujan asked.
    How many tickets actually were canceled because of people--
you gave a number, but then I wasn't sure if that was how many 
people had asked for refunds. Do you know a number of how many 
actual tickets were canceled?
    Mr. Watterson. I have the refunds. Would that be 
sufficient?
    The Chair. No, no. I am asking--if you don't have it today, 
if you get that for us. What we are really trying to understand 
here, you can imagine if you are in any kind of oversight of 
this, you really want to know how many people really had their 
tickets canceled. And then you want to know how many people you 
really did refund.
    So, until you know that you don't really know the answer. 
You know how many people submitted something, but what we 
really want to know is how many tickets actually were canceled, 
that didn't fly? So, if we could get that information from you, 
that would be helpful.
    Mr. Watterson. Certainly.
    The Chair. Thank you. OK, so, I thank all of our witnesses 
for today. We will have the record remain open for four weeks 
until March 9, 2023. Any Senators wishing to submit questions 
for the record, do so in the two weeks from now until February 
23.
    And we ask the witnesses to be able to return that 
information to the Committee by March 9, 2023. And that 
concludes today's hearing. Thank you all very much.
    [Whereupon, at 1:32 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to 
                            Andrew Watterson
         Topic: Establishing Benchmarks and Measuring Progress
    Question 1. On December 25, 2022, Southwest cancelled 74.3 percent 
of its flights, more than every other airline combined. Between 
December 27 and December 29, among flights originating or terminating 
in the United States, Southwest cancelled 7,566 flights. By comparison, 
all other airlines combined cancelled 1,077 flights. Finally, on 
December 30 more than a week after Winter Storm Elliott hit, Southwest 
returned to a normal travel schedule. In total, Southwest cancelled 
nearly 16,000 flights during this period. Can you explain what specific 
benchmarks Southwest must hit in the coming months and years to fulfill 
your promise that an operational failure like this will never happens 
again and how the company will transparently measure progress and hold 
executives accountable for missing these benchmarks?
    Answer. Prior to these events, our operations performed well 
throughout 2022 relative to the rest of the industry. In the fourth 
quarter, our on-time performance of 80.0 percent improved over the 
prior year's result of 72.6 percent and we achieved a multi-year high 
flight completion factor of 99.1 percent. Key benchmarks that we set 
and measure year-to-year include completion factor, on-time 
performance, and mishandled bag rates. Each year, we establish these 
benchmarks and other operational goals, and executive/leadership 
compensation is in-part tied to meeting or exceeding such benchmarks. 
These annual benchmarks are outlined in our public filings and related 
data are reported to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of 
Transportation Statistics. We have every incentive to run an operation 
that provides safe, friendly, reliable, low-cost air travel to our 
Customers. To do that we are working to build more resiliency into our 
operation, with a major focus on strengthening our extreme winter 
weather resiliency, investing in technology and equipment, and further 
reinforcing the resiliency of our route network. Nearly all of our 
planned 2023 capacity additions are for existing Southwest city-pair 
markets. These additional flights will add depth and greater resiliency 
by providing additional options for Customers, Crews, and aircraft when 
weather or other factors create irregular operations. Our growth plans 
also will foster greater airline competition and the many consumer and 
economic benefits which more competition produces.
Topic: Website Accessibility Review
    Question 2. Technology lowers barriers that people with 
disabilities encounter in their daily lives and allows them to 
participate and enjoy the benefits of the digital society. For someone 
with a disability such as visual impairment, the inability to reach 
someone by phone during this meltdown was unsatisfactory. Not all 
websites and mobile apps are easily accessible for persons with 
disabilities, despite existing guidelines and industry best practices. 
When was the last time Southwest reviewed its website and smartphone 
app to ensure that they are fully accessible for passengers with 
disabilities, and how often does Southwest conduct such a review?
    Answer. Southwest Airlines is committed to ensuring our legendary 
Hospitality is provided to Customers with disability-related needs. Our 
digital content design teams are required to take accessibility 
training to ensure we create content that meets accessibility 
standards. Our desktop website experience was designed with a full 
accessibility check, and we carry out ongoing accessibility checks for 
each new feature and page that is added to ensure we remain accessible 
as the site evolves. Our mobile apps are designed to be compatible with 
the accessibility features of the iOS and Android platforms. 
Accordingly, accessibility checks are an ongoing and continuous 
process.
    We are committed to continuously improving our tools for and our 
service to Customers with disability-related needs. Our policies and 
procedures are developed in accordance with 14 CFR Part 382, 
Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Air Travel. We want to 
exceed minimum requirements and provide the legendary Hospitality that 
Southwest is famous for to every Customer. To that end, we welcome 
feedback and the opportunity to work with you and your staff on this 
incredibly important issue.
Topic: Winter Weather Equipment
    Question 3. The fact that Chicago has cold weather in the winter 
should not be a surprise to Southwest. Yet, Southwest has a history of 
not having enough de-icing capacity in Chicago and resulting flight 
cancellations. In February 2018, Southwest canceled more than 250 
flights when it ran short of glycol and a pump on one of the glycol 
tanks failed. What is Southwest doing to ensure that it will have 
enough de-icing capacity and other winter weather equipment at airports 
so that flights will not need to be canceled due to a lack of winter 
preparedness?
    Answer. For the last 38 years, Southwest has been a part of the 
Chicago community, and over the decades, our People in Chicago have 
provided valuable and reliable service to the community. While we are 
not perfect, we are very proud of the reliable operation that our 
nearly 6,000 Chicago-based Employees provide, including during many 
previous winter weather events. In hindsight, we did not have enough 
extreme winter operations resiliency at several airports in our 
network, including at Midway, for the unique conditions of this extreme 
storm, from where and how we de-ice aircraft to the operability of our 
ground support equipment and infrastructure in extremely cold winter 
weather conditions. Ultimately, none of this is an excuse. We need to 
make sure our operational resiliency is strengthened for future extreme 
weather events. We owe that to our Customers and to our Employees.
    To mitigate the risk of any repeats we're investing in capabilities 
across the airline. This will address everything from ground equipment 
to the amount of de-icing we can accomplish in the harshest conditions, 
to how we communicate and align across multiple operational workgroups 
during disruptions, to strengthening our interconnected systems so they 
remain functioning in extreme circumstances where historic levels of 
problems are thrown at them.
    We're also reprioritizing and increasing investment in technology 
and have $1.3 billion budgeted for technology projects in 2023, which 
is about 25 percent higher than what we spent in 2019. We're 
prioritizing enhancements to our crew scheduling software, and we've 
strengthened our early indicator dashboard to escalate operational 
issues earlier. We've identified and trained teams that can quickly 
mobilize to bring additional people power to support crew recovery 
efforts. We've also made organizational changes to improve 
communication and coordination among key divisions of the airline so 
that we can much more quickly access data to keep our overall system 
moving.
Topic: Chicago Midway International Airport Upgrades
    Question 4. During the hearing you mentioned that Chicago Midway 
International Airport needed ``substantial upgrades and that we're 
already pursuing that with the airports''. Please provide what specific 
upgrades are needed, what your implementation timeline is and how much 
this will cost Southwest Airlines and Chicago Midway International 
Airport?
    Answer. Southwest Airlines and the Chicago Department of Aviation 
are in alignment on a project that would convert the use of additional 
existing airfield infrastructure for the purpose of deicing. We need 
FAA approval for this modification, and we hope that approval will be 
timely. Once FAA approval is provided, this project will enable 
significant improvements in deicing capacity at Midway. Beyond 
modifying facilities for additional deicing capacity, we are 
implementing other lessons-learned from this event to improve our 
winter weather operations under extreme conditions at Midway. Regarding 
costs, Southwest is eager to invest in the improvements. As you know, 
commercial service airports are funded by their users. Southwest 
carried 17.3 million Customers through Chicago Midway in 2022, which is 
93 percent of the total passengers at the airport. Through rents, 
charges, and passenger-paid airport fees, Southwest and our Customers 
cover the lion's share of costs associated with operating Chicago 
Midway. Midway is a fantastic airport and an economic engine for 
Chicago. We provide vital competition in the Chicago travel market, and 
we have an incredible team of nearly 6,000 Southwest Employees based in 
Chicago. We are committed to these improvements.
Topic: Addressing Disability Complaints
    Question 5. In 2020, the Department of Transportation reported that 
32 U.S. air carriers received 35,510 disability-related complaints in 
the previous calendar year. The report also showed that the problem had 
been worsening over time. How does Southwest and the members of 
Airlines for America:

  <bullet> Make sure that passenger complaints related to travelers 
        flying with a disability are addressed quickly and effectively?

  <bullet> Ensure that staff are properly trained to engage with and 
        assist passengers with disabilities, and how often does this 
        training take place?

    Answer. Southwest complies with all requirements of the Air Carrier 
Access Act and DOT's implementing regulations (14 CFR Part 382). 
Southwest has a dedicated team of Specialists (i.e., our Customer 
Advocacy Team) who are considered experts in 14 CFR Part 382. Their 
focus is to research and respond to disability-related complaints 
within the required DOT timeframes. For Customers with disabilities 
that do not have a written complaint but instead want to speak to a 
Complaint Resolution Official (CRO) verbally, we train reservations 
leaders, airport-based Customer Service Leaders (supervisor and above), 
and Operations Agents (boarding agents) as CROs.
    Southwest provides CRO training or disability awareness training 
annually to our Employees in Departments ranging from Ground 
Operations, Ramp, and In-Flight (flight attendants) to Customer 
Experience and Customer Support & Services. Our CRO Initial training 
for Ground Ops Leaders and Ops Agents will be back to 100 percent in-
person this month. The Customer Advocacy Team works with SWA University 
(our training Department) on a weekly basis to update and improve our 
disability awareness and CRO training enterprise-wide.
                                 ______
                                 
   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                            Sharon Pinkerton
    Airline Refunds and Scheduling. During the first few months of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, A4A member airlines did not always issue refunds for 
cancelled and significantly delayed flights--instead offering 
vouchers--or did not process refunds in a timely manner. As a result, 
in 2020, DOT was inundated with 29,687 refund complaints against U.S. 
airlines, a 4,634 percent increase over 2019. And in 2021, when things 
had allegedly improved, complaints were still 959 percent higher than 
before the pandemic.
    We are still waiting for the final 2022 data, but it will likely be 
even worse than 2021. Through November 2022, DOT had received 6,379 
refund complaints. As a result, DOT has proposed a new rule to codify, 
clarify, and strengthen existing refund standards.
    Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines, recently stated that there are 
currently some airlines ``who cannot fly their schedules'' and that 
``any airline that tries to run at the same staffing levels that it had 
pre-pandemic is bound to fail and likely to tip over to meltdown 
anytime there are weather or air traffic control stresses in the 
system.''

    Question 1. Should DOT investigate airlines that sell schedules 
that they can't possibly operate? Do you believe such scheduling 
practices contribute to a decrease in reliability and resiliency in 
airline operations?
    Answer. DOT's authority permits investigations when there is 
evidence of an unfair or deceptive practice. An unfair practice causes 
or is likely to cause substantial injury, which is not reasonably 
avoidable, and the harm is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or 
competition.
    A deceptive practice is ``is likely to mislead a consumer, acting 
reasonably under the circumstances, with respect to a material 
matter.'' We are not aware of evidence that would meet the criteria of 
an unfair or deceptive practice. Scheduling practices can be one factor 
amongst many that can impact airline operations.

    Question 2. To increase transparency across the system, do you 
believe that airlines should report to DOT the number and type of 
refund complaints they receive? If no, why not?
    Answer. DOT already accepts complaints from consumers on a 
multitude of consumer regulations, including refunds and reports the 
number of complaints it receives in the monthly Air Travel Consumer 
Report (ATCR). This current system provides transparency to the public 
on consumer complaints, including ranking carriers in the ATCR on 
various factors. The current system of reporting works. There is no 
evidence that a significant increase in reporting by requiring 
complaints received by carriers, be reported to DOT is necessary, 
useful, or would outweigh the tremendous burdens such reporting would 
have on DOT (fundamentally changing the ATCR) and carriers. Switching 
from complaints DOT receives to a system that includes DOT and carrier 
received complaints would provide data consistency concerns and less 
transparency to the public.

    Junk Fees. In your testimony you stated that no member airline of 
Airlines for America charges a family seating fee. On February 21, 
United Airlines, an A4A member airline, announced a new family seating 
policy that would help families sit together without paying additional 
seat selection fees.

    Question 1. Would you like to clarify your testimony that now seems 
inconsistent in light of United's new family seating policy?
    Answer. No A4A member airline charges a family seating fee. A4A 
members have seating fees for all customers purchasing certain fare 
classes but no member specifically charges for a child to sit next to 
an adult.

    Question 2. Are there other A4A member airlines that would assess 
seat selection fees to allow a family to sit together?
    Answer. As mentioned above, no A4A member has a ``family seating 
fee'' (e.g., a fee for a child to sit next to an adult).

    Question 3. If A4A member airlines do not charge a family seating 
fee and make every effort to seat families together, do you believe 
that should be the baseline applicable to all airlines?
    Answer. We do not believe that there is a reason to further 
regulate family seating. Carriers have worked with DOT over the past 
several years to improve families getting to sit together. DOT and 
carriers receive low numbers of complaints in this area and no further 
regulation is necessary.

    Question 4. A4A takes the position that government restrictions on 
ancillary fees will prevent the industry from innovating services and 
remaining competitive. However, do you believe airlines should clearly 
disclose ancillary fees to consumers when they book tickets so that 
consumers can make informed choices that best match their 
circumstances?
    Answer. Airlines disclose ancillary fees today to consumers 
shopping on carrier websites and have all the information they need to 
make informed choices. There is no market failure or unfair or 
deceptive practice for DOT to regulate. Airlines provide ancillary fee 
information by various means that efficiently provide information to 
passengers.

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Amy Klobuchar to 
                            Sharon Pinkerton
    Airline Information Technology Investment. Airlines for America's 
written testimony highlights how U.S. passenger airlines are 
reinvesting record sums in their products to continually improve the 
customer experience, enhance operational reliability, increase 
efficiency and reduce emissions.

    Question. What investments are the airlines making to modernize 
their technology infrastructure to help reduce the risk of future 
disruptions to air travel? How will these investments complement 
current Federal programs?
    Answer. In 2022, A4A passenger carriers an aggregate of $6.5 
billion in annual IT operating and capital expenditures. Further, over 
the five-year period 2018-2022, total IT spend by A4A passenger 
carriers was approximately $28B, or about $5.6B annually. This includes 
a wide range of both customer-facing technology initiatives that make 
it easier for travelers to shop for tickets and other services; check 
in for their journeys and navigate airports; check or track bags; to 
modify their itineraries; redeem vouchers or loyalty points; and to 
stay apprised in real-time of changes to their flights during irregular 
operations in addition to bolstering IT systems resiliency. All 
dedicated to maintaining, operating and improving the customer 
experience.
    Our industry investments would be best complemented with increased 
funding for the FAA. We support additional funding for the FAA's 
capital programs--particularly the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) 
account--through higher authorization levels and appropriations that 
match those levels. F&E has been stagnant for the last 14 years and 
resources have not kept up with inflation, much less the needs of the 
NAS.
    We recently joined 15 other aviation associations on a letter to 
Congress expressing our support for ensuring America has a safe, 
reliable and modernized air traffic control (ATC) system. While we 
commend the Administration for a budget recommending increased funding 
for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in FY2024, we believe 
more can and needs to be done to better balance not only the 
maintenance and sustainability of the ATC system but also the 
modernization of that system. We have growing concerns about the urgent 
need for additional human and technological resources to ensure a 
healthy and scalable National Airspace System (NAS). The U.S. aviation 
system remains the safest mode of transportation in the world. However, 
we must continue to develop our safety culture and invest in both human 
and technological infrastructure to maintain and improve that safety 
record.
    The aviation industry--from commercial aviation to general 
aviation, manufacturing, Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and many other 
emerging technologies- accounts for more than five percent of the U.S. 
gross domestic product (GDP). Robust investment in our aviation system 
is critical to continued safety and our global competitiveness and the 
private sector is investing billions in both human and capital 
expenditures to keep pace. However, controller staffing shortages and 
slow modernization demonstrate that the FAA is not keeping up with the 
growing needs and complexity of our aviation system and the demands 
being put on it to the detriment of consumers. These technology, 
personnel, and regulatory challenges need to be addressed if the U.S. 
is to maintain its global leadership in aviation safety and innovation.

Topic: Addressing Disability Complaints
    In 2020, the Department of Transportation reported that 32 U.S. air 
carriers received 35,510 disability-related complaints in the previous 
calendar year. The report also showed that the problem had been 
worsening over time. How does Southwest and the members of Airlines for 
America:

  <bullet> Make sure that passenger complaints related to travelers 
        flying with a disability are addressed quickly and effectively?
    Answer. Airlines take passenger complaints relating to passenger 
with disability accessibility services very seriously and dedicate 
significant resources to ensure they are addressed quickly and 
effectively. Under the U.S. Department of Transportation's 
accessibility regulations, our members ensure that each of their 
Complaint Resolution Officers (CRO) have authority to make dispositive 
resolution of complaints on behalf of the airline, prompt dispositive 
action by the CRO for immediate complaints, and dispositive action for 
written complaints within 30 days (giving the necessary time for 
investigation of the incident which may have occurred up to 45 days 
prior).
    A4A members also take additional efforts and best practices to help 
passengers submit accessibility service concerns to the airlines and 
respond to those concerns, including:

  <bullet> Providing links on electronic communications for passengers 
        with disabilities to submit feedback at any time during the 
        journey;

  <bullet> Providing an accessibility hotline that is available 24/7 
        that is monitored by a team that will respond to the customer's 
        concerns within 24 hours;

  <bullet> Staff with the specific responsibility of monitoring social 
        media for potential complaints and to identify trending social 
        media accessibility issues to reach the customers and mitigate 
        the issue;

  <bullet> Soliciting specific feedback to identify trends and 
        opportunities that are raised with field leadership for action 
        on identified issues;

  <bullet> Processes to ensure chat, direct messages, SMS text and e-
        mails received by other departments that are accessibility 
        related are forwarded to the correct team for an expeditious 
        response;

  <bullet> Automated processes to identify complaints that are 
        accessibility related;

  <bullet> Assignment of CRO teams to handle specific issues and 
        address post-event actions;

  <bullet> Having a specialty team in the customer relations 
        department, with specialized training on disability 
        regulations, to handle accessibility services complaints;

  <bullet> Giving high priority to accessibility related complaints for 
        handling by a CRO-trained customer care agent;

  <bullet> Training frontline employee leaders, including reservation 
        leaders, airport customer service leaders, and operations 
        (boarding agent) leaders as CROs;

  <bullet> Analysis of complaints and CRO reports into categorized and 
        detailed reports that are used to investigate issues and take 
        action within the respective operational department; and

  <bullet> Monthly quality control reviews regarding complaint response 
        processes.

  <bullet> Ensure that staff are properly trained to engage with and 
        assist passengers with disabilities, and how often does this 
        training take place?
    Answer. Our members provide significant training for frontline 
employees regarding accessibility services and have made an explicit 
commitment to enhance their accessibility services training for 
frontline workers and educate their employees about passengers with 
disabilities.
    Additionally, the industry continues to support the recommendations 
of Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act Accessibility 
Committee relating to training, including the adoption of best 
practices regarding the training on special service request codes, the 
involvement of disability community organizations to improve airline 
training and adoption of hands-on training for the handling of battery-
powered wheelchairs or scooters.
    On training, our members exceed the Department's regulatory 
requirements for accessibility services training, which already 
requires proficiency training for all personnel who deal with the 
traveling public, training with respect to awareness and appropriate 
responses to passengers with a disability, training to recognize 
requests for communication accommodation, and ensure that all such 
personnel receive refresher training every three years. These training 
obligations extend to our members service providers as well.
    Examples of best practices that A4A members have implemented with 
regard to training and that exceed the Department's requirements 
include:

  <bullet> Recurrent training on an 18 month, annual or quarterly basis 
        (topic specific);

  <bullet> Additional training through ad hoc communications;

  <bullet> Training of personnel that do not deal with the traveling 
        public (e.g., ramp agents); and

  <bullet> Use of training developed by disability community 
        organizations that explains the importance and impact of 
        accessibility services.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Raphael Warnock to 
                            Sharon Pinkerton
    Investing in Infrastructure. Though Southwest's meltdown over the 
December 2022 holidays was alarming, it was only one in a series of 
recent air-travel failures and disruptions that this country has 
experienced over the past few months. In mid-January, the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) suffered an outage of their Notice to Air 
Missions (NOTAM) system, which caused all domestic flights to be 
grounded for almost two hours. Just a few days later, two planes nearly 
collided on the runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport, an 
incident which was nearly repeated a few weeks later in Austin, Texas. 
Each of these disruptions and near misses poses significant safety 
concerns and appears to be the result of both public and private 
underinvestment in critical infrastructure.

    Question. Do you believe that underinvestment in critical aviation 
infrastructure, such as air traffic control software, is a challenge to 
our aviation system?
    Answer. Yes, in fact we recently joined 15 other aviation 
associations on a letter to Congress expressing our support for 
ensuring America has a safe, reliable and modernized air traffic 
control (ATC) system. While we commend the Administration for a budget 
recommending increased funding for the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) in FY2024, we believe more can and needs to be done to better 
balance not only the maintenance and sustainability of the ATC system 
but also the modernization of that system. We have growing concerns 
about the urgent need for additional human and technological resources 
to ensure a healthy and scalable National Airspace System (NAS). The 
U.S. aviation system remains the safest mode of transportation in the 
world. However, we must continue to develop our safety culture and 
invest in both human and technological infrastructure to maintain and 
improve that safety record.
    The aviation industry--from commercial aviation to general 
aviation, manufacturing, Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and many other 
emerging technologies- accounts for more than five percent of the U.S. 
gross domestic product (GDP). Robust investment in our aviation system 
is critical to continued safety and our global competitiveness and the 
private sector is investing billions in both human and capital 
expenditures to keep pace. However, controller staffing shortages and 
slow modernization demonstrate that the FAA is not keeping up with the

personnel, and regulatory challenges need to be addressed if the U.S. 
is to maintain its global leadership in aviation safety and innovation.

    Question. What can Congress do to encourage airlines, as well as 
the FAA, to invest in this critical infrastructure?
    Answer. U.S. passenger and cargo airlines spent $168 billion on 
aircraft, ground equipment, information technology, facilities and 
other capital improvements from 2010 through 2019 and an additional $51 
billion from 2020 through 2022. During this same time, passenger 
airlines spent $581 billion on wages and benefits to build the largest 
workforce they have had in 20 years. And in 2022, A4A passenger 
airlines spent $6.4 billion on information technology. The most 
important role Congress can play in encouraging more such investment by 
industry is to foster an environment in which airlines can thrive 
financially. Historical data shows a clear correlation between the 
industry's financial health and its ability to reinvest in its product 
and people.
    For the FAA, Congress should identify programs that provide the 
most effective improvements in safety, capacity and efficiency and then 
apply metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and hold the FAA 
accountable for the impacts of the investments. Specifically:
Increase Funding for FAA's Capital Programs
    We support additional funding for the FAA's capital programs--
particularly the Facilities and Equipment (F&E) account--through higher 
authorization levels and appropriations that match those levels. F&E 
has been stagnant for the last 14 years and resources have not kept up 
with inflation, much less the needs of the NAS.
Operationalize NextGen
    Our goal is to implement and integrate NextGen/ATC Modernization 
capabilities, aircraft equipage and people to achieve the intended 
purpose and produce measurable benefits for passengers and 
stakeholders. This includes throughput, efficiency, sustainability, 
fuel savings, emissions reductions, reduced miles flown and noise 
reductions in specific locations and time frames.
    Our top priorities to achieve this goal and improve customer 
service are:

  <bullet> Flow Management/Flight Planning Tool--Replace the FAA's 
        outdated Traffic Flow Management System (TFMS) with a 
        modernized national planning tool (Flow Data Management System 
        or FDMS) by 2025. FDMS provides the FAA with the necessary 
        capabilities in concert with operator flight planning 
        automation enhancements to provide the basis for expanded 
        capabilities for and improved use of automation by aircraft 
        operators that are extremely limited by the current TFMS.

    TFMS provides tools for users to develop, coordinate, issue and 
        manage Traffic Management Initiatives that balance flight 
        demand and NAS capacity. However, those tools have reached end 
        of life and are exhibiting accuracy and latency issues, as well 
        as shortfalls in reliability, maintainability and availability 
        (RMA). The FDMS will provide a standards-based microservices 
        architecture before the full implementation, and the final 
        system will address operational needs such as improved means of 
        flight plan revisions that address weather and traffic 
        congestion, ultimately benefitting passengers and other 
        stakeholders.

  <bullet> Airport Surface Management--Implement (Terminal Flight Data 
        Manager) electronic flight strips and at identified sites, 
        aircraft operational metering at agreed upon locations and time 
        frames to finish 46 sites by 2027.

  <bullet> Ensure the NOTAMs program is resilient, has redundancies and 
        is modernized before 2030.

    Also, leverage investments by industry in aircraft-based equipage 
capabilities and flight planning management.

  <bullet> Navigation--Increase utilization of Performance Based 
        Navigation (PBN) and implement at additional designated 
        airports sites recommended by industry. This includes the 48 
        site specific proposals made by the industry to the FAA under 
        the NextGen Advisory Committee in the Performance Based 
        Navigation (PBN) Clarification Ad Hoc Team, NAC Task 19-4 
        Report to achieve desired PBN outcomes in the implementation of 
        the FAA's PBN NAS NAV Strategy. The FAA should continue the 
        implementation of Established on Required Navigation 
        Performance (EoR) Procedures and development of Multiple 
        Airport Route Separation (MARS). The Agency should continue 
        making use of Converging Runway Display Aid (CRDA) as a 
        metering tool to facilitate PBN implementation.

  <bullet> Communication--Complete initial EnRoute DataComm and 
        implement full data services by 2024.

  <bullet> Surveillance--We support leveraging carrier investment in 
        ADS-B Out and ADS-B In aircraft equipage to provide operational 
        benefits and enhance trajectory-based operations capabilities 
        to improve airspace efficiencies and reduce delay in the NAS. 
        The FAA has shown benefits from reduced spacing in Center 
        airspace and should complete implementation of this efficiency 
        and capacity capability using ADS-B at all locations by 2025. 
        Expanded use of ADS-B surveillance should also be matured to 
        implement reduced spacing at airports and in the Northeast 
        Corridor as the Agency outlined in its report to Congress, as 
        required by Section 505 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 
        (P.L. 115-254).

  <bullet> Satellite Communication (SATCOM)- We recommend requiring the 
        FAA to utilize equipage for ATC communications in remote areas 
        without VHF radio capability to improve system performance and 
        efficiency benefits. Reduction of procedural separation should 
        be developed for implementation in Oceanic WTRS and Gulf of 
        Mexico Airspace through SATCOM.

    Status of the Aviation Industry. Though Southwest's December 2022 
meltdown is certainly cause for concern, Southwest represents just one 
pillar of a diverse and expansive aviation industry in the United 
States. As home to the county's largest airport in Hartsfield-Jackson 
International Airport, Georgians are keenly interested in the health 
and success of the aviation industry as a whole. With that in mind, I 
would like to learn more about the state of the aviation industry in 
the United States.

    Question. Is the aviation industry, including both airlines and 
airports, fully staffed? If not, why?
    Answer. Data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics show in 
January U.S. passenger airlines employed their largest workforce since 
October 2001. They added 46,344 jobs in 2021, 49,796 in 2022, and 4,380 
in January--a total of 101,519 full time equivalent employees (FTEs). 
Including cargo-only airlines, total industry headcount exceeded 
787,000 in January. What has changed is that due to higher rates of 
employee absenteeism--in aviation and other sectors of the economy--and 
longer taxi times at airports, airlines now require more staff--
especially pilots--and aircraft to produce the same amount of capacity 
as they did preceding the pandemic. Several airlines have announced 
plans to expand their payrolls further in 2023, especially their pilot 
ranks. At the end of 2022, U.S. passenger airlines employed 5 percent 
more pilots and 1 percent more flight attendants than they did at the 
end of 2019.
    As to airports, A4A does not have specific data on airport staffing 
but we would encourage your staff to reach out to the airport 
associations for more information.

    Question. How much debt is currently being held by airlines and 
airports as they seek to return to normal operations following the 
COVID-19 pandemic?
    Answer. U.S. carriers amassed a significant amount of debt, which 
ended 2022 just shy of $150 billion in 2022, despite the public and 
private actions taken over the course of the pandemic. This debt comes 
with heavy cash outlays for interest. In fact, net interest expense 
tripled from 2019 to 2021 and will remain elevated through 2023. As of 
February 7, nine publicly traded U.S. airlines had published their 
full-year 2022 results, posting just $2.5 billion in pre-tax earnings--
a modest 1.3 percent pre-tax profit margin. Notably, that comes on the 
heels of $49 billion in pre-lax losses recorded in 2020 and 2021 
combined.
    As to airports, A4A does not have specific data on airport debt but 
we would encourage your staff to reach out to the airport associations 
for more information.

    Question. How are inflation and supply chain issues affecting the 
industry?
    Answer. Regarding inflation, from 2019 to 2022, while passenger 
airline operating revenues rose 8 percent, operating expenses rose 16 
percent due to higher rates for labor, fuel, aircraft, maintenance, 
airports and other costs of doing business. And, thanks to the 
aforementioned debt burden, interest expense rose 183 percent, to $5.2 
billion for the 10 largest carriers alone. Meanwhile, supply chain 
issues (e.g., engines, avionics) are apparent in delayed deliveries of 
aircraft, as manufacturers have been forced to shift deliveries farther 
out in the calendar and deployment on new or existing routes is 
postponed accordingly. That is just one of several factors limiting 
capacity growth.
    While there are certainly many supply chain challenges across the 
aviation sector, one key supply chain breakdown that is of particular 
and timely concern relates to the current 5G inference issue. Last 
November, a broad group of aviation stakeholders (including A4A) wrote 
the Administration regarding their commitment to finding reasonable 
solutions that allow implementation of 5G while addressing safety and 
operational disruptions in the National Airspace System. One component 
of those reasonable solutions is the ongoing effort to retrofit 
impacted aircraft with radio altimeters (RAs) that are not susceptible 
to interference from 5G signals. The aviation community has been 
actively and aggressively engaged in meeting retrofit deadlines, 
however, supply chain challenges and certification solutions are making 
deadlines difficult, if not impossible, to meet.

    Question. What factors drive the costs of maintaining airline and 
airport operations?
    Answer. The primary factor is the supply and demand balance for 
workers and materials. The most volatile cost input is the price of 
energy, which is primarily jet fuel for the airlines and utilities for 
the airports.

    Question. What investments are needed to maintain a healthy 
aviation industry?
    Answer. In addition to previous answers above related to 
investments there are also FAA funding and reform issues that should be 
addressed, including:
Ensure Controller Staffing Model Updates Hiring Goals and Provide 
        Funding
    The FAA and NATCA were directed by Appropriators to working through 
the collaborative resource workgroup (CRWG) to improve the process for 
determining controller staffing targets by evaluating staffing needs on 
a facility-by-facility basis as well as improving the algorithm that 
determines the staffing target based on a variety of factors. That 
work, including MITRE's review, has been completed and although it is 
not publicly available, we believe this report should serve as the 
basis for increased funding and staffing to ensure the National 
Airspace System (NAS) is adequately staffed so that fewer passengers' 
itineraries are delayed or disrupted.
Ensure FAA Continues to Operate Normally During any Government Shutdown
    Congress should ensure the FAA's operations are protected during 
any government shutdown by allowing the FAA to continue to draw from 
the Airport and Airways Trust Fund (AATF) during any funding lapse to 
pay controllers and other operational needs so that travelers and 
shippers of goods are not grounded during a shutdown.
Apply Current Funding Mechanisms to New Entrants
    Given the rapid growth and importance of advanced air mobility and 
commercial space new entrants, as new entrants increasingly divert FAA 
staff attention away from moving passengers efficiently across the 
country, we recommend applying passenger taxes and the waybill tax to 
these stakeholders to ensure that everyone who utilizes the system also 
contributes to the AATF.
Hold the FAA Accountable for Achieving Consumer/Operational Benefits
    NextGen Benefit-Focused Metric Task Force--As the FAA restarts its 
air traffic control modernization efforts following Covid related 
restrictions, we want to ensure the NextGen program finally achieves 
its intended purpose, namely greater energy efficiency and emissions 
reductions. Getting passengers and packages to their destination 
safely, efficiently and as quickly as possible is a top priority for 
our carriers.
    Finally, ensure that the FAA is the sole regulator of safety and 
operations for the NAS. We recommend inclusion of language that 
codifies the FAA's singular authority over operations in the NAS. A 
Federal standard for operational and safety requirements ensures that 
all civil operators, including new entrants and drones, comply with 
equivalent safety standards and that state and local requirements 
cannot create a competitive advantage or disadvantage, or negatively 
impact safety and operations.

    Expanding Access to Air Travel. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
number of airline passengers had been steadily increasing for decades. 
As the aviation industry works to recover from severe reductions in 
service and operations, it may be helpful to understand why air travel 
was becoming increasingly accessible prior to the pandemic so that best 
practices may be repeated.

    Question. What were the reasons for the steady increase in air 
travelers prior to the COVID-19 pandemic?
    Answer. The largest single factor was and remains healthy 
competition, led by the rapid growth of (and low barriers of entry to) 
ultra-low-cost carriers, combined with unprecedented transparency in 
distribution and pricing of airline services. The roll-out of 
additional nonstop routes not previously served on a consistent, 
economical basis, was also a factor. Some of these are being showcased 
by new entrants such as Avelo and Breeze, who entered the U.S. 
marketplace in April 2021.

    Question. In general, who were these new aviation consumers?
    Answer. The simple answer is the new aviation consumers were 
consumers who could not previously afford to fly. Prior to the pandemic 
we were experiencing what many have called the ``Golden Age'' of air 
travel. U.S. airlines were flying 2.5 million passengers and more than 
58,000 tons of cargo each day. In 2019, U.S. airlines carried an all-
time high 927 million passengers in scheduled service. Those record 
numbers were in large part because of two main factors: affordability 
and accessibility. Accounting for inflation, and including ancillary 
services, average domestic ticket prices fell 15 percent from 2014-
2019, 22 percent from 2000-2019 and 44 percent from 1979-2019--the 40-
year period following the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. Those lower 
fares made commercial air travel accessible to nearly all Americans. In 
fact, 42 percent of Americans who flew in 2019 had family incomes under 
$75,000. Further, in 1971 only 49 percent of Americans had ever flown 
commercially. Today, 90 percent of Americans have flown in their 
lifetime--and more than half have boarded a commercial aircraft by the 
time they turn 16.

    Consumer Protection. The significant service and operational 
disruptions caused by Southwest's December 2022 meltdown and the recent 
Federal Aviation Administration's Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system 
outage highlight the need for Congress to better protect consumers and 
airline passengers. Airline passengers deserve a travel experience that 
is free of surprises, as well as a guarantee that they will be 
appropriately accommodated should unexpected delays or cancellations 
occur.

    Question. What investments has the aviation industry made to 
support customer service in the wake of these high-profile disruptions?
    Answer. As noted in our testimony, U.S. passenger airlines are 
reinvesting record sums in their products to continually improve the 
customer experience, including a wide range of customer-facing 
technology initiatives that make it easier for travelers to shop for 
tickets and other services; check in for their journeys and navigate 
airports; check or track bags; to modify their itineraries; redeem 
vouchers or loyalty points; and to stay apprised in real-time of 
changes to their flights during irregular operations. The airlines have 
pared back planned growth and updated their staffing models--and hired 
tens of thousands of workers--to reflect post-pandemic operational 
realities.

    Question. What steps are being taken by the aviation industry to 
ensure passengers are being appropriately accommodated when flights are 
delayed or cancelled, regardless of the cause of the delay or 
cancellation?
    Answer. Under U.S. DOT regulations, U.S. airlines are required to 
have a customer service plan, which requires a number of steps to 
accommodate passengers during cancellations and delays and be 
transparent about those policies. For instance, the plan requires that 
carriers provide notice of known delays, cancellations and diversions, 
provide prompt refunds when due, meet passenger essential needs during 
tarmac delays, disclosing cancellation policies and notifying 
passengers in a timely manner. The U.S. DOT holds carriers to these 
customer service plans and will take enforcement action if the plans 
are not followed. In addition, the DOT Dashboard provides the public 
with additional information on carrier accommodations during delays and 
cancellations and DOT holds carriers to these public commitments.

service-dashboard

    Improving Communication and Partnerships. Unfortunately, airlines 
cannot control all of the variables that affect their operational 
performance. Weather, Federal operations systems, and air traffic 
controllers can all affect an airline's ability to transport passengers 
to-and-from their destinations. In order to improve the efficiency of 
the Nation's aviation system, collaboration between all industry 
parties and partners should be encouraged.

    Question. What opportunities exist to foster increased partnership 
and collaboration between public and private aviation stakeholders?
    Answer. The continued partnership that exists between the FAA's air 
traffic management system and the corresponding investments made by 
airlines in modern avionics and traffic management software typically 
referred to as NextGen is a key collaboration. Every effort should be 
taken to operationalize NextGen to implement and integrate NextGen/ATC 
Modernization capabilities, aircraft equipage and people to achieve the 
intended purpose and produce measurable benefits for passengers and 
stakeholders. This includes throughput, efficiency, sustainability, 
fuel savings, emissions reductions, reduced miles flown and noise 
reductions in specific locations and time frames.

      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                            Sharon Pinkerton
    1. The Department of Transportation (DOT) recently announced an 
investigation into Southwest's flight schedule using their consumer 
protection authority derived from 49 U.S.C. Sec. 41712. Specifically, 
DOT is looking into whether Southwest was engaged in ``unrealistic 
scheduling'' which DOT identifies as an unfair or deceptive practice.

    a. To what extent has DOT used this authority in the past?
    Answer. We are unaware of DOT using this authority in the past.

    b. If DOT elects to regulate flight schedules, what impact will 
that have on airline operations and consequently consumers?
    Answer. It is likely that ``regulation'' of flight schedules would 
ultimately mean fewer flights available to the consumer, which would 
put upward pressure on fares and downward pressure on choice. It could 
mean not only fewer local options but also fewer connecting 
opportunities for a passenger without a nonstop option. We should not 
use the cloak of the anomalies caused by the pandemic to re-regulate 
schedules.
    Prior to the pandemic, our industry was experiencing what many have 
called the ``Golden Age'' of air travel. U.S. airlines were flying 2.5 
million passengers and more than 58,000 tons of cargo each day. In 
2019, U.S. airlines carried an all-time high 927 million passengers in 
scheduled service. Those record numbers were in large part because of 
two main factors: affordability and accessibility. Accounting for 
inflation, and including ancillary services, average domestic ticket 
prices fell 15 percent from 2014-2019, 22 percent from 2000-2019 and 44 
percent from 1979-2019--the 40-year period following the Airline 
Deregulation Act of 1978. Those lower fares made commercial air travel 
accessible to nearly all Americans. In fact, 42 percent of Americans 
who flew in 2019 had family incomes under $75,000. Further, in 1971 
only 49 percent of Americans had ever flown commercially. Today, 90 
percent of Americans have flown in their lifetime--and more than half 
have boarded a commercial aircraft by the time they turn 16.

    c. If airlines reduce service, including the number of flights they 
run, how will that impact smaller markets?
    Answer. Given a finite number of planes and pilots, smaller markets 
are often the first to experience service reductions, which we are 
seeing firsthand amid today's relative pilot scarcity. Over the past 
three years, mainline pilot ranks grew 10 percent but regional airline 
pilot ranks fell 14 percent. That is very telling of what would happen.
                                 ______
                                 
   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                          Dr. Clifford Winston
    Competition in the Airline Industry. Dr. Winston, in a recent press 
release, Airlines for America makes the claim that there is ``robust 
competition among U.S. airlines'' and that U.S. airlines ``compete 
aggressively for customers.''
    Yet since deregulation, many rural or smaller markets have been cut 
off from air service altogether or may have one service provider that 
is able to extract concessions from the community without the restraint 
of competition. That is certainly becoming a problem in smaller markets 
in Washington state.

    Question 1. What solutions should Congress be looking at in order 
to enhance competition in the market, particularly in smaller or rural 
communities?
    Answer. To enhance airline competition, Congress needs to enact 
policies that will stimulate new entry by air carriers. There are two 
policies that can accomplish that goal. First, Congress should work 
with other branches of government to grant foreign airlines cabotage 
rights, which would allow foreign airlines to serve U.S. domestic 
routes. Allowing cabotage would make it much less likely that low-
density domestic routes connecting smaller or rural communities would 
be underserved because passengers on those routes could provide feed 
for foreign and U.S. airlines on international routes that originate in 
smaller communities in the US. Both U.S. and foreign airlines would 
seek to serve smaller communities with appropriate-sized aircraft and 
offer passengers seamless international service. (Note cabotage would 
enable U.S. airlines to serve foreign countries' domestic routes). 
Second, Congress could help to privatize the U.S. airport system, which 
would generate more airport and airline competition. Private airports 
in smaller communities would have a financial incentive to attract more 
airlines to serve their airport, which would increase airline 
competition, by improving their facilities and the operations of the 
airlines that serve their airport and by charging airlines attractive 
user fees. Private airports that attempt to charge monopoly user fees 
would be constrained from doing so because airlines could simply 
eliminate that airport from their network.

    Question 2. How do we incentivize airline operators to establish 
and maintain service in smaller markets?
    Answer. Generally, airlines are incentivized to serve markets where 
there are profit opportunities. Contrary to popular wisdom, airline 
deregulation incentivized airlines to serve smaller communities because 
airlines saw profit opportunities by connecting those communities to 
their hub and spoke networks. See, for example, my coauthored book and 
paper. Global airline deregulation, which would be facilitated by 
granting airlines cabotage rights, would provide airlines opportunities 
to increase their profits by expanding the markets they serve, 
including smaller markets, to compete more effectively in the 
deregulated global airline industry. Note that subsidizing airlines to 
serve smaller markets may have the unanticipated effect of reducing 
service by masking profit opportunities. See the aforementioned book 
for a discussion of how the Essential Air Service (EAS) program had 
that effect.
                                 ______
                                 
      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                          Dr. Clifford Winston
    Question 1. The Department of Transportation (DOT) recently 
announced an investigation into Southwest's flight schedule using their 
consumer protection authority derived from 49 U.S.C. Sec. 41712. 
Specifically, DOT is looking into whether Southwest was engaged in 
``unrealistic scheduling'' which DOT identifies as an unfair or 
deceptive practice.

    a. If DOT elects to regulate flight schedules, what impact will 
that have on airline operations and consumers?
    Answer. I would have to know specifically how DOT elected to 
regulate flight schedules to provide a precise evaluation, but the 
uncertainty itself of DOT's regulatory policy raises serious concerns. 
On what basis would DOT regulate flight schedules? How would they 
determine that their regulation would benefit travelers? Southwest has 
incurred substantial financial costs from their alleged ``unrealistic'' 
scheduling. Doesn't Southwest have a strong financial incentive to 
ensure that they can provide the flights that they schedule? By 
regulating flight schedules without addressing my concerns about the 
basis for and evaluation of the effects of their regulations, DOT could 
be providing a solution in search of problem, which could substantially 
hurt airline operations and consumers. Airlines have not been engaged 
in unrealistic scheduling for most of their flights since deregulation 
and as noted, airlines have a strong financial incentive not to engage 
in unrealistic scheduling. DOT has no justification to intervene in 
airlines' flight schedules, especially when it cannot set forth, let 
alone defend, a clear regulatory approach.

    b. If DOT elects to impose new regulations on baggage fees, fare 
refunds, seating arrangements, etc. how will airlines respond and what 
impact will that have on customers?
    Answer. The airline industry is highly competitive and air carriers 
earn close to a normal rate of return on their investment in the long 
run. In such an industry, firms cannot incur costs that they are unable 
to cover with their prices or they will go out of business. 
Accordingly, if DOT imposes new regulations on baggage fees, fare 
refunds, seating arrangements, and the like and those regulations 
impose costs on the airlines, then the airlines will have to recover 
those costs by either raising fares or finding another way to charge 
travelers to cover those costs. Overall, consumers will not be better 
off, but certain consumers who benefit from DOT's new regulations will 
benefit at the expense of all travelers who pay the higher fares.

    Question 2. The air travel industry remains one of the most heavily 
regulated industries in the country.

    a. Please describe existing barriers to new entrants and how that 
impacts competition?
    Answer. There are two major entry barriers to competition in the 
U.S. airline industry. The first is that foreign airlines cannot serve 
domestic passengers on a route that consists of an origin and 
destination airport in the United States. For example, British Airways 
cannot serve travelers flying from Washington, DC to New York. The 
result is that the dozens of foreign airlines that serve travelers on 
U.S. international routes and on routes throughout the world are unable 
to compete for passengers in the U.S. airline market. The second entry 
barrier is that the U.S. commercial airport system consists almost 
exclusively of public airports, which limits airport competition 
because only one new major commercial airport, Denver International 
Airport, has been built in the United States since 1973. Private 
airports do not exist that compete with public airports. Public airport 
competition is clearly limited in major metropolitan areas, such as 
Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Denver, which are served by only one airport. 
The lack of public airport competition translates into a lack of 
airline competition because airports have entry barriers such as 
exclusive use gates, slot controls that limit operations, and the like.

    b. What impact does increased competition have on the price of 
airfare?
    Answer. The lack of competition from foreign airlines and the lack 
of airport competition cause fares to be higher than they would be if 
foreign airlines could compete in U.S. markets and if there were 
greater airport competition. Evidence that fares would decrease and 
service quality would increase if foreign airlines were allowed to 
compete in U.S. markets and if airports were privatized to increase 
airport competition is available in my coauthored book Revitalizing a 
Nation: Competition and Innovation in the U.S. Transportation System. 
In short, increased competition would lead to lower airfares in more 
competitive markets.

    c. What role do low-cost carriers, such as Southwest, play in the 
market and what impact does that have on domestic airfare?
    Answer. The entry of low-cost carriers into the airline industry 
has been essential for the success of airline deregulation. Southwest 
Airlines, in particular, has developed efficient operations that have 
enabled it to have lower costs than most other airlines. As a result, 
we report in chapter 7 of Revitalizing a Nation that Southwest has 
reduced fares, on average, 30 percent and that air travelers have 
gained $67.6 billion (2000 dollars) from its entry during 1994-2014.

    d. What actions can Congress take to increase competition in the 
air travel industry?
    Answer. Congress can work with other branches of government to 
increase competition in air transportation by granting foreign airlines 
cabotage rights, which would allow them to serve U.S. domestic routes 
and to compete with U.S. carriers. Congress also can help to privatize 
the U.S. airport system, which would generate more airport and airline 
competition.

    Question 3. In your written testimony you reference a New York 
Times article titled, ``It's Time to Finally Fix Air Travel'' by 
William McGee, which was published on January 13, 2023.\1\ In that 
piece, Mr. McGee claims the airline industry before de-regulation was 
stable, profitable, and competitive. Mr. McGee concludes that ``the 
deregulation experiment since 1978 needs to be rethought.''

    a. Do you agree that Congress should rethink airline deregulation?
    Answer. Congress should not rethink airline deregulation. Instead, 
Congress should be more aware of the enormous benefits that airline 
deregulation has brought to travelers, in terms of lower fares and 
improved service quality, and to carriers, by giving them the freedom 
and incentive to be more efficient, without causing any degradation in 
airline safety. The policies that I recommend to increase competition 
in the airline industry would build on the benefits generated by 
airline deregulation.

    Question 4. Southwest announced in late 2022 that it would be 
reinstating its dividend payments, which were suspended in early 2020, 
in 2023. Some have suggested these dividends would have been better 
used to improve its crew-assigning software.

    a. As a general matter, how do dividends impact not just 
shareholders but the broader economy?
    Answer. I am not an expert in corporate finance, but the basic 
principle of why firms pay dividends is the same as other actions that 
firms take to be more competitive. Firms pay dividends to help raise 
additional capital, which enables them to be more efficient and 
innovative. By raising capital that enables them to be more efficient 
and innovative, competitive firms are better able to benefit consumers 
and the economy.

    b. How is this favorable compared to companies simply stockpiling 
cash, particularly in the low-interest rate environment we were in over 
the past several years?
    Answer. Again, I am not an expert in corporate behavior, but all 
firms seek to get the highest return on their capital recognizing the 
tradeoff between risk and return. Stockpiling cash in a low-interest 
rate environment is a low-risk strategy but also a very low rate of 
return strategy. Paying dividends as part of a strategy to raise 
additional capital investment is likely to lead to higher returns 
without a commensurate increase in risk.

    c. Southwest offers a ProfitSharing Plan and an Employee Stock 
Purchase plan, which allows employees to purchase Southwest stock at a 
discount so they can directly benefit from the company's success. 
Considering this, how does paying dividends benefit the airline 
employees who are invested in the company?
    Answer. Generally, firms offer benefits in addition to a salary to 
employees to be more competitive in the labor market and thus attract 
the best employees. Southwest's Profit Sharing and Employee Stock 
Purchase plans are employee benefits in addition to an annual salary, 
which enable Southwest to attract high quality employees in all job 
classifications. Clearly, the employees value the benefits from the 
plans, including the dividends they receive as partial owners of 
Southwest. If employees did not value those benefits, Southwest would 
discontinue the plans because they were not helping them to be more 
competitive in the labor market.
