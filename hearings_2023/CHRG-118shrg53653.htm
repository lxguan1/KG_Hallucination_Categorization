 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN FETTERMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
                        OF PENNSYLVANIA

    Senator Fetterman. I call this hearing of the U.S. Senate 
Subcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, 
and Research to order.
    Chairwoman Stabenow.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Good morning, or good afternoon.
    Senator Fetterman [continuing]. and Ranking Member Boozman, 
thank you so much for coming. I thank you for your leadership 
on this Committee, and I look forward to working with you to 
pass a farm bill, a farm bill that works for small farmers, 
rural communities, and hungry Americans. I would also like to 
thank my Ranking Member, Senator Braun, and I look forward to 
working closely with you.
    Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is one of 
the most effective programs to fight hunger and poverty in the 
country. In my time in office, as the mayor of Braddock, to 
lieutenant Governor, to now, I have heard from Pennsylvanians 
about their support for SNAP. Hunger is not a Republican or 
Democrat issue. It is all of our issue that we have to take on. 
We need to come together and stop playing political games with 
Americans' access to food.
    Americans like Charles Jore in the town of North East in 
Pennsylvania tells me that he was a victim of skimming, where 
somebody stole money he relied from his SNAP EBT. Mr. Jore is 
not the first Pennsylvanian I have heard this from, and I fear 
he will not be the last, and I will work in this farm bill to 
modernize SNAP to work for recipients in the 21st century.
    I look forward to hearing from you and your witnesses on 
nutrition assistance in the Farm Bill.
    I will now turn to Senator Braun for any opening comments 
that he would like to make.

 STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE BRAUN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            INDIANA

    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to our 
witnesses for being here today. This is the second Congress 
that I am serving as a Ranking Member on this Subcommittee. I 
am excited to return to the Subcommittee, and I am looking 
forward to working with Chairman Fetterman to find bipartisan 
solutions.
    We are meeting today as part of the Committee's 
consideration of the 2023 Farm Bill. The bill will cost us more 
than it ever has in history, and I want to make sure that if we 
are spending more we do it efficiently.
    Earlier this year, when Secretary Vilsack testified before 
the Committee, I asked him, as a former Governor, if he was 
concerned with runaway spending, and he, like many of us, would 
be. I think whenever we entertain any of this we have got to 
make sure that we are getting value out of whatever we are 
proposing.
    I ran a logistics and distribution business for 37 years, 
and did it sustainably by keeping overhead low, being very 
aggressive in finding new ways of doing things, and was able to 
pay the bills and grow the company sustainably. I would like to 
see some parallel here in terms of how we do things in our own 
Federal Government.
    As the Committee drafts and considers the 2023 Farm Bill, I 
look forward to trying to incorporate these principles into it. 
In the coming weeks I will introduce bipartisan legislation, 
the SNAP Fresh Access Pilot Program Act, to create a pilot 
program with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that 
allows participants to spend down a portion of their benefit to 
receive a food box with fruit, vegetables, meat, dairy, and 
eggs.
    As we learned at this Subcommittee's hearing last year on 
food as medicine, the private sector has a vested interest in 
using wellness in nutrition to decrease spending on remediation 
medically. So not only here, the private sector needs to pick 
up the slack and do that on their own account as well.
    This program checks each of these boxes by creating a new 
option within SNAP that allows recipients to exercise agency, 
and it also is going to let increases to healthy foods through 
SNAP. I think it has got a two-pronged approach to it.
    I also plan to introduce legislation, the HAND UP Act, that 
will ensure SNAP is implemented in a way that measurably 
improves the employment outcomes of able-bodied Americans. HAND 
UP Act helps connect SNAP recipients with work by closing the 
loopholes that government has used to downplay the stability of 
employment by requiring States to focus on common-sense outcome 
measures in their employment and training programs.
    Able-bodied adults without dependents are required, by law, 
to work, volunteer, or participate in a work program for at 
least 80 hours per month to keep their SNAP benefits. This work 
requirement has been in place since 1996, and was passed with 
bipartisan support, including that of Senator Joe Biden.
    Today, 18 States, including California and New York, 
operate with full State waivers, and, in fact, half of SNAP's 
ABAWDs live in waived areas, many of which actually have low 
unemployment and ample job listings. I think this is an 
opportunity to find more employment and help feed those better 
that need it.
    We will hear from our witnesses today about how SNAP can be 
improved to actually help recipients escape poverty, and I am 
really looking forward to what each one of you has to say.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Senator, and we will now move 
to introduce our witnesses. I am excited about the panel that 
we have with us today. I will introduce them all now.
    Mrs. Ty Jones Cox is the Vice President of Food Assistance 
Policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Welcome.
    Ms. Heather Reynolds is the Managing Director of the Lab 
for Economic Opportunities at Notre Dame. Welcome.
    Mrs. Loree Jones Brown is CEO of Philabundance, the largest 
food bank in Pennsylvania, and also serves New Jersey. It is a 
great organization, from a great State that I've heard of 
pretty well.
    Mrs. Jones Brown. We certainly agree.
    Senator Fetterman. Mr. James Whitford is Executive Director 
of the Watered Gardens in Joplin, Missouri. Sir, I like that 
look.
    Finally Ms. Whitley Hasty, the Outreach Specialist with 
Hunger Free America and Foodlink in New York.
    Mrs. Cox, you are now recognized for five minutes.

 STATEMENT OF TY JONES COX, VICE PRESIDENT OF FOOD ASSISTANCE 
 POLICY, CENTER ON BUDGET AND POLICY PRIORITIES, WASHINGTON, DC

    Mrs. Jones Cox. Chairs Stabenow and Fetterman, Ranking 
Member Braun, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify. I am Ty Jones Cox, Vice President of 
Food Assistance Policy at the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities, a nonpartisan policy institute in Washington, DC.
    I want to make three key points: SNAP plays a critical role 
in reducing hunger and poverty; SNAP supports and incentivizes 
work by helping low-wage workers make ends meet; and SNAP 
should be strengthened in the farm bill.
    SNAP is our Nation's most effective tool for combatting 
hunger and food insecurity, especially among children, older 
adults, people with disabilities, and veterans. SNAP reduces 
food insecurity by as much as 30 percent. SNAP also plays a 
critical role in reducing poverty. SNAP provides families with 
the money they need to purchase groceries, helping to free up 
their limited resources to spend more on other basic needs such 
as housing, utilities, and childcare. SNAP improves outcomes in 
education, economic security, and self-sufficiency for children 
later in life. When children are hungry, their performance at 
school suffers, but when children have access to SNAP benefits 
they are more likely to complete school, attain higher 
education, and go on to secure better-paying jobs.
    SNAP is also linked to better health. SNAP participants are 
more likely to report very good health than low-income non-
participants, and children participating in SNAP face lower 
nutritional deficiencies and poor health, which improves their 
health outcomes throughout their lifetimes.
    SNAP reduces racial disparity. One chart that sticks with 
me really highlights huge disparities between the food 
insecurity rate of households headed by a Black, Latino, 
American Indian, or Alaska Native adult in comparison to 
average for the households headed by a white adult. The 
difference in some cases is as big as 15 to 20 percentage 
points.
    Boosts to SNAP benefits in late 2021 reduced poverty for 
Black and Latino people and helped reduce racial disparities. 
As we think about improving SNAP our eye must remain on how we 
can reduce those disparities and not increase them by making 
harmful cuts.
    Finally, SNAP is an important support for workers. The 
majority of SNAP participants are children, older adults, and 
people with disabilities. Among SNAP participants who can work, 
the majority do so or will return in the future. Many of the 
jobs held by SNAP participants, such as service or sales 
positions, often pay low wages and do not offer regular work 
hours or benefits like paid sick leave. SNAP supplements low 
pay and helps smooth out income fluctuations due to irregular 
hours.
    Take, for example, the mother of two teenagers who was 
working two jobs at minimum wage but does not make enough to 
afford rising prices of food and housing. SNAP helps keep both 
her and her family fed.
    For millions of workers, work does not itself guarantee 
steady or sufficient income to provide for their families. As a 
legal aid attorney in Virginia I saw clients balance work, 
childcare, and caregiving demands, and SNAP provided a critical 
link when their income was not enough to feed their families. 
SNAP is a program that incentivizes work by providing critical 
food assistance for low-wage workers while they are working and 
during periods of unemployment.
    Given these realities of low-wage work, any attempt to 
expand SNAP's existing harsh work-reporting requirements rely 
on faulty assumptions. Research shows that taking SNAP benefits 
away from people does not help them find jobs or higher 
earnings. It just leaves them and their families with less 
money for food. No one can work when they are hungry.
    SNAP is an important but modest benefit at only six dollars 
per person per day, and SNAP spending did increase during the 
pandemic, when it greatly reduced hunger, but SNAP spending has 
begun to fall with the end of the emergency pandemic 
provisions. Families are already experiencing a cut as a 
result, which means less money for food at a time when food 
prices are high.
    SNAP is successful at reducing poverty and food insecurity 
and should be protected from cuts. Instead of making the 
program less effective by cutting it or creating more barriers 
for participants, we should make improvements so it does even 
more to combat hunger for everyone. For example, we must 
increase access. Some low-income food-insecure people are 
excluded from the program entirely, including those subject to 
the three-month time limit, people with drug-related felony 
convictions, and people living in certain U.S. territories.
    In conclusion, in 2018, this Committee showed you can find 
bipartisan agreement to protect and modestly strengthen SNAP 
with the farm bill that got 86 votes from Senators. As this 
Committee works to develop the 2023 Farm Bill, I urge you to 
work in that vein to shore up this program that has already 
proven to be so successful at reducing hunger among our most 
vulnerable and protect it from cuts that would take food away 
from the people who need it most.
    Thank you.

    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Mrs. Cox. Ms. Jones Brown, 
you are now recognized for five minutes.

   STATEMENT OF HEATHER REYNOLDS, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WILSON 
  SHEEHAN LAB FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES, UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE 
                   DAME, NOTRE DAME, INDIANA

    Ms. Reynolds. Thank you Chairman Fetterman, Ranking Member 
Braun, and members of the Committee. I serve at the Wilson 
Sheehan Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO), at the University 
of Notre Dame, where we work with providers across the country 
to build rigorous evidence around programs designed to move 
people out of poverty.
    Prior to joining LEO, I spent two decades as CEO of 
Catholic Charities Fort Worth. I will never forget meeting 
Marsha, a single mom working a full-time job that just did not 
cut it. She spent hours figuring out which bill to pay, because 
when you make $1,200 a month you spend a significant amount of 
your time making such choices. She came to us because the 
avalanche of poverty had just closed in around her. She had run 
out of food and was living in a place with no running water in 
the bathroom.
    We worked with Marsha, helping her with food via SNAP, and 
getting her into new housing. When Marsha moved into her new 
apartment she taught her daughter a life lesson that I pray I 
never have to teach mine. She took her hand and she held it 
under the warm running water. She squeezed it tightly and told 
her little girl never to take anything for granted. I struggle 
to tell this story without feeling sad, and if I am honest, 
kind of angry. How much potential did our country lose from 
this woman because she spent so much time figuring out how to 
feed her family, how behind were her children in school because 
she could not spend time reading to them, or they were hungry, 
which we know is not ideal for learning. Instead, this mom 
spent her energy trying to make sure her family survived in 
poverty.
    Today I want to use my time to suggest two points that I 
believe would have made her situation better.
    First, as we think about the farm bill we need to be less 
focused on work requirements and more focused on evidence-based 
reform that will give people a way out of poverty. Seventy-five 
percent of SNAP recipients who are not disabled or elderly 
already work. Our solution needs to be to give them solutions 
that work.
    That is why we at Notre Dame spend so much of our time 
working with providers across the country to understand what 
works for a path out of poverty. At LEO we have over 90 
research studies across the country, and our partners have 
solutions. Solutions in Texas. LEO completed a randomized 
controlled trial to understand the impact of the Padua program, 
a holistic case management program designed by Catholic 
Charities Fort Worth. Families get flexible financial 
assistance that case managers can use to incentivize clients. 
Clients were 25 percent more likely to be employed, 60 percent 
more likely to be stably housed, and experienced a sharp 
decline in credit card debt.
    Solutions in New York. The Bridges to Success program is 
designed by Action for a Better Community to provide working 
poor residents of Rochester with economic mobility mentors. 
Seventy-three percent of these participants utilized SNAP at 
the time of intake. They set explicit goals and worked to 
achieve self-sufficiency with financial incentives along the 
way. We have done a randomized controlled trial of this 
program, and the results show people are more likely to be 
employed.
    We have solutions in Indiana. The Goodwill Excel Center of 
Central and Southern Indiana operates 15 tuition-free, public 
charter high schools that support adult learnings in completing 
their State-certified high school diploma. The Excel Center 
provides small classes on a flexible schedule and wraparound 
services. LEO's rigorous study of this program shows adults 
increased their earnings by 38 percent.
    What if Marsha would have just had access to one of these 
proven programs five years before finding Catholic Charities? 
Would her daughter have had to learn about the joys of running 
water? Probably not. In our country we have the Employment and 
Training programs designed to increase the employment prospects 
of SNAP recipients. In 2016, only 3.3 percent of SNAP 
recipients who were subject work requirements participated. 
States are not incentivized to invest in these programs.
    Which brings me to my second point. We need to scale up 
evidence-based solutions.
    Senator, you have access to resources that Catholic 
Charities, Action for a Better Community, and Goodwill does 
not. They have already done the hard work for you. They have 
provided you with solutions that give people a path to upward 
mobility. They have given you the answers, they have allowed 
researchers into their business, and now we owe it to them to 
let their evidence scale about what works.
    Families first and Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood 
Home Visiting (MIECHV) laws give us good precedent for how we 
can put evidence first and make it actionable for providers. In 
both cases, Federal law now requires providers to either use an 
evidence-based program or to build rigorous evidence. The 
clearinghouses verify the validity and strength of the research 
proving a program is impactful. This combination of legislation 
requirements plus a well-run clearinghouse shows us a path 
forward.
    As policymakers, we need you allocating public policy 
dollars to allow these evidence-based services to scale, 
because they work. What bothers me most about Marsha's story is 
that while it is just one story, I know there are millions of 
others just like her. I am asking you to put this evidence to 
work. Thank you.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Reynolds can be found on 
page 63 in the appendix.]

    Senator Fetterman. Thank you.
    Mrs. Jones Brown.

  STATEMENT OF LOREE D. JONES BROWN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, 
           PHILABUNDENCE, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA

    Mrs. Jones Brown. Good afternoon, Chairman Fetterman, 
Ranking Member Braun, and members of the Committee. I am Loree 
Jones Brown, and I have the honor of serving as the Chief 
Executive Officer of Philabundance, a hunger relief 
organization serving five counties in southeastern Pennsylvania 
and four counties in southern New Jersey, and a member of 
Feeding America, a network of over 200 food banks in the 
country. I am here to share why passing a bipartisan farm bill 
is critical to the food security of our neighbors in need and 
the well-being of our Nation's economy and food system.
    Like all of you this morning, I did not make the difficult 
choice between breakfast or paying my light bill, but for many 
of our neighbors these are the tough choices they make every 
day, choosing between food and keeping the lights on. When I 
spend time visiting our 600-plus community partners and the 
neighbors we serve, what I see is that people are scared. They 
are worried about not having a basic thing like food.
    Margaux, the founder of our Sunday Love Project, one of our 
partners, said, ``We are noticing and incredible influx of new 
clients. We are serving 120 to 150 people per day. There is a 
sense of desperation that is heightened. People are lining up 
earlier. There is a feeling of scarcity that did not exist 
before. People are panicked.''
    It is important to understand that all of the Federal 
nutrition programs work together. Any cuts to The Emergency 
Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), Commodity Supplemental Food 
Program (CSFP), or SNAP, and any policies that make these 
programs inaccessible for the people who need them the most 
only puts pressure on food banks to fill the gap. We are seeing 
the pressure today, with increased demand at food banks as the 
SNAP emergency allotments and other temporary Federal supports 
have come to an end, and at a time of high inflation. This 
makes lines at our partners' pantries longer, and that is why 
we must increase funding for TEFAP, improve CSFP, and 
strengthen SNAP.
    At Philabundance we take a holistic approach to nourishing 
our communities. Through our BackPack program that helps kids 
have a healthy start, our work with seniors provides shelf-
stable food, and our partnerships with health care 
organizations, we know that access to good nutrition and food 
is vital to improving the health outcomes for low-income 
families. We must continue to support these critical nutrition 
programs to ensure that vulnerable populations have access to 
the food they need.
    We also run a culinary job training program that receives 
support from SNAP Employment and Training. What we have learned 
is that when you invest in people by providing training and 
support, that can lead to self-sufficiency. Then you can create 
a pathway out of poverty. I am here to tell you that it takes 
time, patience, and that critical investment to provide people 
with the tools needed to gain skills to find jobs. These 
investments, not partial work requirements, are what truly 
support work and financial stability.
    We see it every day, the struggle for working families to 
make ends meet when too often their pay is not enough to cover 
their basic needs. One neighbor told us, ``I work full-time, 
and by the time I pay my bills I have nothing left. I do not 
make a lot, and I am only eligible for $90 in SNAP benefits a 
month.'' People are cobbling together their take-home pay with 
SNAP and emergency food resources, and sometimes that is not 
even enough.
    During the pandemic, what we learned is that bipartisan 
leadership to address hunger works. Because the government made 
bold investments in addressing hunger, more people were fed at 
a time of high need, and according to the USDA, food insecurity 
did not increase.
    Here is what I am asking you to consider today, that you 
draft a bipartisan farm bill that strengthens the Federal 
nutrition programs, adopt policy changes that build on 
innovations and lessons learned during the pandemic, center the 
participant experience inequity, and remove red tape to 
simplify program access and operations.
    Specifically, I ask that you strengthen TEFAP funding. As 
demand for food remains high at food banks, a reliable, 
continuous stream of TEFAP food is essential. Congress should 
reauthorize increased funding to $500 million per year in 
mandatory funding for food purchases for TEFAP. This level of 
investment will ensure the flow of TEFAP foods remains steady 
throughout the food assistance network and support the U.S. 
agricultural economy as TEFAP bonus and other programs are 
dwindling.
    Protect SNAP's funding and structure while addressing 
systematic barriers to benefits. SNAP is our best defense 
against hunger. It is the most effective and efficient way to 
ensure people have access to the food they need and want. The 
farm bill must strengthen SNAP, and any cuts to its program 
cannot be made up by local food banks. We are already concerned 
with how we will meet the need with the emergency allotments 
coming to an end.
    Reauthorize, streamline, and expand access for CSFP. A 
program that serves our seniors should be much earlier to 
navigate. Support partnerships with growers and producers. We 
can help people who are hungry and farmers at the same time by 
strengthening the TEFAP Farm to Food Bank Program, which is 
based on a program that had great success in Pennsylvania.
    It is in our Nation's best interest that we have well-
nourished communities so they can thrive. That is why I am here 
asking you to work together to pass a strong bipartisan farm 
bill that ensure equitable and consistent access to food.
    I often quote Martin Luther King, Jr., and he said, 
``Life's most persistent and urgent question is, `What are you 
doing for others?' '' With this farm bill we can do something. 
We can feed people together.

    Mr. Whitford.

   STATEMENT OF JAMES WHITFORD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WATERED 
                   GARDENS, JOPLIN, MISSOURI

    Mr. Whitford. Chairman Fetterman, Ranking Member Braun, and 
Subcommittee members, thank you for allowing me to testify 
today.
    Twenty-three years ago my wife and I started a small 
ministry in southwest Missouri that has grown quite a bit over 
the last two decades. Today we offer emergency shelter 
services. We have a long-term recovery program for me, focused 
on character development and work readiness. We have a family 
center that helps moms and kids struggling with homelessness. 
We even have a respite unit where folks that are coming out of 
the hospital, discharging but do not have anywhere to go, they 
are able to come into our respite unit. We also have a robust 
food ministry where we are helping hundreds of families in our 
area with tens of thousands of pounds of food every year.
    The things that I want to communicate today, that I think 
is so important, is that a majority of the needs that are met 
through our mission are earned by people through our Worth 
Shop. This is a ministry that we run where people are crafting 
goods, that are creating things that go to market, and they are 
actually earning the very basics of food, shelter, clothing, 
and the like.
    Work awakens worth. That is why we call it a Worth Shop. 
What we have found is that you are either at work or you are in 
dependency. It is one or the other.
    I do not know if you have heard of the book Toxic Charity 
by Robert Lupton, but he talks about five steps to dependency. 
If you give something to somebody once they will appreciate it. 
If you give the same thing to that person again, they will 
anticipate that you are going to do it a third time. If you 
give it a third time, they are going to have an expectation 
that you will do it a fourth. If you give it a fourth time, 
they will feel entitled to it, and a fifth time, they will be 
dependent on you for it. It is appreciation, anticipation, 
expectation, entitlement, and dependency.
    I have seen that downward track for far too many people, 
and after more than 20 years of working among the poor, and now 
working with leaders across the Nation in various cities who 
are also fighting poverty, I am convince that we are in a 
national crisis of dependency. In fact, I would say that 
dependency is a national epidemic.
    Consider, for just a moment, that there are more people who 
are dependent on Federal anti-poverty programs than there are 
people living in poverty. Just in the food stamp program alone 
we have five million people dependent on it who are above the 
poverty line. Not to mention that if we look at those who are 
below the poverty line, which is about 37 million Americans, 
almost all of them are dependent on the government in some form 
or another, 96 percent. A Pew Charitable Foundation study found 
that about 70 percent of them will never escape. What that 
means is that we have about 24.8 million Americans today who 
are on a trajectory to die in dependent poverty. Dependency is 
a national epidemic.
    Marvin Olasky, in his book The Tragedy of American 
Compassion, he wrote, aptly, he said, ``Dependency is merely 
slavery with a smiling mask.''
    I believe that FDR would have agreed. In his 1935 State of 
the Union address he compared dependence on relief as a 
``subtle narcotic, a destroyer of the human spirit.''
    Now FDR said it, but I know a woman named Jocelyn who 
actually lived it. For 10 years, actually more than that, she 
was a needle drug addict living on the streets. She came into 
our mission, came to faith in Christ, got clean, but she did 
not give up her food stamps. It was a lot of work for us to 
convince her that she had the ability to provide for herself, 
and when she finally did voluntarily give up her food stamps 
card, her trajectory changed. She ended up going to college, 
got her master's degree, and now she runs one of our shelters.
    You can imagine reporters were interested in doing a story, 
and there before the camera, in an interview with a reporter, 
she said, ``It was harder for me to give up food stamps than it 
was for me to give up heroin.''
    Dependency is a form of slavery that is holding millions of 
Americans back from living the flourishing life that God 
intended. For Jocelyn, her dignity, her freedom, the 
flourishing life she lives, it did not come through welfare or 
food stamps. It came through faith, friendships, and work.
    Let me leave you with this last comment from a woman I met 
last week named Selena, who is also homeless. She said, ``I 
just want to thank you for doing the things the way that you do 
them. Allowing me to work for my bed and my meals has allowed 
me to feel like I can keep my dignity.'' For Selena it is the 
same. She also will step into the flourishing life through 
faith, friendship, and work. Thank you.

 STATEMENT OF WHITLEY HASTY, OUTREACH SPECIALIST, HUNGER FREE 
            AMERICA & FOODLINK, ROCHESTER, NEW YORK

    Ms. Hasty. Thank you. Hi, everyone. My name is Whitley 
Hasty and I am honored to be here today to share how the 
Supplemental Nutrition Program has positively impacted the 
lives of me and my children. I want to thank you, Chair 
Fetterman, Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Senator Braun for 
having the hearing and having me here to testify.
    I would like to thank my own Senator, Senator Gillibrand, 
for continuously championing solutions to end hunger.
    I am the proud mother of a seven-year-old daughter. She is 
sweet, protective, hilarious, and cautiously independent. My 
three-year-old son is the opposite of her. He is grounded, 
generally likes to follow the rules, and has such an unlimited 
curiosity about everything. They are the center of my world, 
and I do everything I can to be present and active in their 
lives, from going to gymnastics, to hosting sleepovers, to 
becoming the Vice President of the PTSO at our local school. I 
work really hard to model for my kids the importance of civic 
and community duty.
    I am raising my children the way my mother raised me. She 
never, almost never missed a day of work and still made time to 
support four children in multiple activities at three different 
schools. She earned a modest salary but would often bluntly, 
and still describes our upbringing as ``one flat tire away from 
an eviction.'' We often do not see the sacrifices our parents 
make until we grow up and make them ourselves.
    With the help of SNAP, we were able to shop for healthier 
foods rather than get by with just the basics. As the oldest, I 
learned how to grocery shop on a limited budget and still 
maximize the nutrition value of our meals.
    Working since the age of 13, I have always craved the 
independence that comes with making an honest income. Even 
during college, while on scholarship, I held down two jobs 
while I worked at the campus dining hall and at Wegmans. My 
resume is lengthy because I have always been willing, able, and 
ready to work. I am proud of my strong work ethic and career 
advancement, but also know that much of what I have 
accomplished could not have been achieved without SNAP.
    In 2015, I obtained both SNAP and WIC during my prenatal 
care. Applying for both was a really difficult. The two 
applications being separate meant that I missed work twice and 
lost wages to visit DHS at 8 a.m., only to wait in line for 
hours among other families. I am grateful to the caseworker who 
helped me navigate this process, and I know the staff were 
trying to make this process as seamless as possible, but I do 
understand why some eligible participants are too intimidated 
to apply.
    That is why I support Senator Gillibrand's proposal to make 
it easier for States and counties to enable eligible people to 
apply for multiple programs simultaneously online.
    Receiving SNAP absolutely helped my family eat healthier. 
We ate less processed foods, and I started making different 
recipes. I used SNAP to shop not only at grocery stores, but 
also at farmers and mobile markets like Foodlink's Curbside 
Mobile Market. I utilized incentive programs to maximize my 
budget and help prioritize fruits and vegetables through 
programs such as Double Up Food Bucks, which is funded 
partially through the USDA GusNIP grant.
    When the pandemic hit, I was grateful to receive an 
increase in my SNAP benefits. My son was born two months 
earlier, before the world turned upside down. The SNAP 
emergency allotments provided by Congress enabled me to stretch 
my food budget so that I could keep the heat and lights on. I 
am a perfect example of how legislation reduced poverty and 
hunger during one of the largest economic collapses of our 
lifetimes.
    My life refutes the most common SNAP myth. Receiving 
benefits was never a deterrent for me to work. I continually 
worked or sought work while receiving SNAP, and that is true of 
most SNAP recipients. A close, old friend of mine recently 
celebrated the achievement of financial security when she no 
longer qualified for SNAP, and I can relate to that. If 
Congress wants to reduce the use of SNAP, it should raise the 
minimum wage, increase the Earned Income Tax Credit, and boost 
wage, childcare, and transportation subsidies.
    I am proud that my work at Hunger Free America and Foodlink 
has meant not only that I no longer need SNAP benefits, but 
that I can now pay it forward by helping my community to access 
those benefits as well.
    Every day I witness how the recent end of the SNAP 
emergency allotments has impacted the diverse communities that 
I serve. Overnight, the minimum monthly benefit for many 
seniors fell from $281 to just $23. My hope is that this 
esteemed body again increases SNAP benefits to better help 
struggling Americans cope with skyrocketing costs for rent, 
utilities, childcare, and yes, food.
    I am thankful that SNAP and WIC helped my family through 
challenging times, and that I am now able to give my kids a 
bright future. I hope my story encourages you to strengthen 
SNAP in the farm bill.
    In my written testimony I have also included a few policy 
proposals supported by both Hunger Free America and Foodlink 
that would improve the lives of many in both my neighborhood 
and in the Nation, and it remains a vital truth that medicine 
is food, and it should still be regarded as such.
    Thank you again for this opportunity.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Hasty can be found on page 
92 in the appendix.]

    Senator Fetterman. Thank you very much. Thanks to all of 
you. Now we will begin the five-minute rounds of questions for 
each member, and I will begin with my own now.
    Mrs. Cox, currently States allow SNAP mostly to do what 
they see fit. I am concerned about proposals to limit this. My 
own State of Pennsylvania has the ability to seek waivers on 
work requirements and times, depending on employment metrics. 
This also includes tools to ensure that low-wage working 
households avoid a benefit cliff.
    Can you possibly explain the potential impact these 
proposals would have on States?
    Mrs. Jones Cox. Yes. Thank you for the question. When we 
think about the waivers, I think while unemployment has come 
down across the country there are still areas that have higher 
unemployment. Each State has experienced some crisis, whether 
it is a natural disaster, plant closing, some community 
conditions that have persistent high unemployment, specifically 
like a Native American community. That means people cannot find 
jobs where these waivers are needed. States can only request 
temporary waivers for areas with relatively high unemployment 
and a lack of sufficient jobs, and States are really in the 
best position to evaluate the needs of their communities. That 
is why it is really critical to maintain States' flexibility so 
that they can respond to their communities' needs.
    Then on the other hand, around flexibilities, for example, 
the asset limit, the broad-based categorical eligibility, a lot 
of States that have expanded the income limit, it is basically 
for working families. Families who are just above the poverty 
line but because of high shelter or childcare costs, at the end 
of the day they meet the eligibility for SNAP and they are able 
to receive benefits.
    Taking that away, we saw when the Trump administration 
sought to pursue these reforms it was going to estimate three 
million individuals were actually going to lose SNAP. When you 
look at income asset limits, so that mostly impacts older 
adults who have modest savings, so you would be asking them to 
not be able to have a savings in order to get SNAP.
    So, you know, the States' flexibility is super important 
because States are in the better position to tell what they 
need in their State.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Mrs. Cox. I actually have one 
more kind of a brief other question please. Many SNAP 
households have had benefits stolen through skimming. Victims 
face the serious challenge of losing their purchase power. When 
debit cards are skimmed there are protections for the 
cardholder. What needs to be done to ensure that families have 
that same kind of being protecting?
    Mrs. Jones Cox. Right. So there has been a lot of skimming 
over the last few years, and so what is really important is 
that SNAP participants have the same consumer protections that 
everyone else has. If you have a debit or a credit card and you 
have protections for your purchases, the same should happen for 
EBT card users.
    I do want to say I appreciate the quick action of Congress 
to restore stolen benefits, and that is over the next year or 
so. We really want to make sure that any new EBT protections 
and technology does not prevent participants from having access 
to their benefits.
    I do not know if there is one particular solution. There 
may be a few. It could be chip card technology, improving the 
detection and elimination of some of the skimming devices that 
are in stores, training retailers. Ultimately we want SNAP EBT 
cardholders to not be treated any differently than other 
consumers, any less protections than other consumers.
    Senator Fetterman. Mrs. Jones Brown, food banks are really 
critical for the support and foundation of SNAP. Would you 
agree with that?
    Mrs. Jones Brown. Absolutely.
    Senator Fetterman. The Emergency Food Assistance Program, 
or TEFAP, was established to provide emergency food assistance 
to low-income individuals, and these individuals may not 
qualify for SNAP but they might need additional support. Food 
banks, like Philabundance, and knowing personally the quality 
of the work that you do in my own State, they distribute 85 
percent of TEFAP foods nationwide.
    As Americans struggle with high food costs, how have you 
been able to allow you to continue to provide food support?
    Mrs. Jones Brown. Thank you for the question, and the 
reality is that food banks like Philabundance, our partners 
across the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and really 
across the country, we heavily rely on the government food 
programs that support farmers across this country that also end 
up supporting us, enabling us to ensure that our neighbors get 
access to the food that they need, and often it is produce that 
the folks are asking for.
    What we have seen over the last couple of years is that as 
inflation has increased and there have been challenges with the 
food supply, food banks have found it harder and harder to get 
donations of food from the private sector or even to purchase 
food, and so government food becomes that much more important.
    We also saw that, in the early days of the pandemic, the 
government providing additional supports that came through food 
banks, enabled us to really stave off that huge increase in 
food insecurity. That is why today we are calling on government 
to really increase the support for TEFAP to ensure that there 
are additional food supports that is coming through to our 
State, to our region, and across the country.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you.
    Now I recognize Ranking Member Braun for five minutes.
    Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    We measure, I think, food insecurity by trying to get it 
below 10 percent. We have not been able to do that. Families 
with children, without, it has been 20 years, and we spend 
more, there are more participants in it. That, to me, is 
something. It is such a good program. We have got to have 
metrics that honestly say what is happening. I am disappointed 
that we have not been able to do better with it.
    Ms. Reynolds and Mr. Whitford, take about 45 seconds each 
because I have got a second question. What are you seeing in 
the field? What are we doing wrong in Congress? Because it is 
stubbornly staying at a level where we cannot get it down any 
lower.
    Ms. Reynolds. We first have to recognize that we need to 
feed people in order to make sure that people can have upward 
mobility. We know cognitively if we do not have someone's basic 
needs cared for they cannot progress. We cannot stop there. 
Where we have to go next is making sure they have evidence-
based programs to get them on a pathway out of poverty.
    Examples I mentioned, like Bridges to Success, Goodwell 
Excel Center, Catholic Charities Padua, those are all proven by 
rigorous evidence that they work to give low-income Americans a 
pathway out of poverty so that they, five years from now, a few 
years from now, can be feeding their families and not needing 
SNAP benefits.
    Senator Braun. Mr. Whitford?
    Mr. Whitford. Senator Braun, I think that you are right. 
Things have continued to increase. In 1969, if we were going to 
look at the average food stamp allotment for a person, with 
dollars equated to today, it would be about $50, and now we are 
talking like $230 or something per person. It has just 
continued to increase. The numbers have continued to increase.
    I think really, going back to even something that Mrs. Cox 
was saying about State flexibility, we do need to see more 
local control, because truth be told, the people that are in my 
community, I know their needs much better than anyone else. 
There are some folks who would benefit and do well, just as Ms. 
Hasty did, and utilizing these benefits correctly, and there 
are some who do not. I am the one in my community and those 
like me who understand that.
    There is a 100-year-old adage that says ``intelligent 
giving and intelligent withholding are a like true charity.'' 
Sometimes it is compassionate to say, ``No, we are not going to 
move in that direction,'' but right now SNAP, TEFAP, they tie 
your hands and you do not have that ability.
    We need that ability. We need that local control so that 
communities can be effective in their charity work.
    Senator Braun. Thank you. Ms. Reynolds, in your written 
testimony you share the store of three charitable organizations 
that LEO has partnered with, including, down in my neck of the 
woods, the Goodwill Excel Center of Central and Southern 
Indiana, to study the effectiveness of holistic employment and 
training practices. In your testimony you also suggest that the 
USDA should leverage studies like yours to help move SNAP 
recipients out of poverty.
    I plan to introduce the HAND UP Act, which would direct 
USDA to maintain a clearinghouse for evidence-based practices 
for SNAP employment and training.
    Do you believe this clearinghouse would improve SNAP's 
success at connecting recipients with long-term employment and 
a path out of poverty?
    Ms. Reynolds. I believe if you and I walked into our 
doctor's office and are given a pill to handle an ailment we 
have, we deserve to make sure that that pill has undergone a 
certain level of testing where we are protected. Right now, in 
many cases, when a poor person walks into an organization to 
receive food, they are given food, but then when they are given 
some sort of employment and training program it does not have 
evidence behind it that it works.
    We need this evidence. If we do not have this evidence we 
cannot scratch our heads and wonder why are there still people 
not achieving upward mobility in our country. We have to give 
people in poverty programs that work, and one of the successful 
models for this has been MIECHV as well as Families First, 
where when you have Federal law requiring that people use 
evidence or are creating the usage of evidence where it does 
not exist, paired with clearinghouses that are set up that are 
actionable to all of us who are in the provider space as well, 
it can make a tremendous difference.
    Senator Braun. Thank you. Mr. Whitford, do you want to 
weigh in on how this might dovetail with what you are doing?
    Mr. Whitford. Yes. Sure. I think, again, measuring 
evidence-based practice is incredibly important, and so 
outcomes are incredibly important to measure. It is important 
among private charities. It is certainly going to be important 
among government programs. I think that is what we have got to 
look at, not thinking that the efficacy of a program is 
dependent upon the number of people that are enrolled in it but 
rather the efficacy of a program being how many people got off 
the rolls and ended up back into the work force.
    Senator Braun. Thank you. In wrapping up on my end of the 
questioning I think it is important because whatever we do here 
in the Federal Government, you have got to have metrics. If it 
is not producing the results--we all want the same end result--
you are going to have to look at maybe other ways of doing it.
    I would like to highlight to anyone listening out there, we 
currently are in peril because of everything we spend here in 
the Federal Government, just a little over four years ago when 
I got here, we were borrowing 20 cents on every dollar that we 
spend. Now it is up to 30 cents, and that is going to put in 
peril all the good things we do. Sooner or later we are going 
to have to figure out better ways of doing it and making sure 
we are getting a better bang for our buck.
    Chairwoman Stabenow.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well thank you very much, Senator 
Braun and Senator Boozman. Wonderful as always to see my 
partner her, and Senator Fetterman, thank you so much for your 
leadership. Senator Booker, our former Chair of the Nutrition 
Subcommittee, we have got a great team.
    Let me just echo what Senator Braun said in terms of 
evidence-based programs. I could not agree more. If that is 
what we do, we will get consensus. We will get bipartisan 
support, and keep it based on evidence. That is what we need to 
do.
    I also wanted to thank Ms. Hasty. Thank you so much for 
bringing a real-life perspective to what we are talking about, 
and for your leadership and being a great role model for your 
children. I appreciate you very much.
    You know, our nutrition programs in the farm bill provide a 
modest but incredibly important support for Americans who need 
to put food on their tables, and I appreciate all of you being 
here today to be involved in this discussion. We know there are 
children and seniors and working families and veterans, people 
with disabilities who rely on programs like SNAP, for an 
average of six dollars and ten cents a day to buy healthy food, 
and I am reminded every time I go buy a cup of coffee for six 
bucks. So six dollars and ten cents a day is what we are 
talking about. Over 41 million vulnerable Americans rely on 
these modest benefits, and most of them are temporary during 
tough times.
    I want to specifically address something that has been 
talked about a lot, particularly by House colleagues, House 
leadership, and just say news flash, SNAP has work 
requirements. As Senator Braun said, general work requirements 
have been a law since 1977. They were strengthened during 
President Clinton's time in 1996, as part of welfare reform. 
Time limits were added for adults without children, as we know, 
so that unless they are working 80 per month, or now we say in 
a job training program, that you can only receive three months 
of SNAP during three years. That is current law, suspended 
under COVID, just as we suspended other work requirements, now 
coming back in July.
    That is the basis from which we are operating, is that we 
have work requirements that have been supported on a bipartisan 
basis.
    The farm bill has always provided a safety net for our 
farmers and our families. Our farmers and our families, and I 
believe strongly that it is critical that both safety nets 
continue.
    Ms. Cox, I have a question for you. The Administration 
reevaluated the Thrifty Food Plan, which is the basis for the 
SNAP benefit, based on current food prices, which you know have 
been going up, not down, consumption patterns, food composition 
data, dietary guidelines, how much time we spend cooking from 
scratch--I do not know if people know what that is anymore, 
when you say that term. This was required as part of the 
bipartisan 2018 Farm Bill, the first comprehensive update since 
1975, to really look at all of it.
    What is the impact of the reevaluation and why was this 
meaningful to do?
    Mrs. Jones Cox. Thank you, Chairwoman Stabenow, for that 
question. The revision to the Thrifty Food Plan, which was a 
directive from the 2018 Farm Bill, it really served as a 
critical and much-needed, long-overdue revision, as you said, 
from 1975. It had not been reevaluated, and we really look 
differently at how much time families have to purchase food. We 
also look at dietary guidelines differently now than we did in 
the 1970's, so looking at green vegetables, orange vegetables, 
whole grains, buying lean proteins and seafood. That was also 
used and taken into account. As a result there was an increase.
    I think what is really important, as you mentioned, about 
the modest benefit amount, while it is modest it was a 
meaningful increase, and what we found is that that amount 
lifts some 2.4 million people, including 1 million children, 
above the poverty line, and it decreased food insecurity for 
tens of millions. While we made a modest increase, although 
important, we really showed what we can do and how we can lift 
people out of poverty by just making that revision, which was 
much needed.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thanks so much. Then finally, Mrs. 
Jones Brown, thank you for all your work. Food bank work is so 
important. You are on the front lines of fighting food 
insecurity, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit more 
about who you typically serve at your food bank, and whether 
that population has changed over time.
    Mrs. Jones Brown. Thank you very much for the question, 
Senator. What we saw over the last few years is that more and 
more of our neighbors found themselves accessing a charitable 
food network. In middle 2020, we saw 60 percent more people 
lining up to access food across our region, but across the 
country as well, and 40 percent of them were newly food 
insecure. Chances are somebody you know. If there was a 
restaurant you used to go to, if there was a service provider 
or small business owner, chances are, for the first time in 
their lives, they were accessing a charitable food network.
    We have seen the face of hunger change in our country. We 
know that, as we saw from the USDA study, that far too many 
families with children are food insecure. We know far too many 
of our seniors and our veterans are food insecure. We are 
seeing also, more and more, that working folks are.
    One of the last pantries I visited right before Easter, I 
walked in and I saw someone there who I thought was maybe 
donating food, who was actually in full uniform and was 
actually shopping for free food at the pantry. Days before, his 
company had actually donated to Philabundance.
    The reality is that more and more we are finding people 
that are working, that are just having a hard time making ends 
meet, particularly with the price of eggs, that they are coming 
to a charitable food network.
    I would dare say that everybody in this room knows somebody 
who at some point, probably in the last year or two, had to 
come to us to ask for help.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Thank you.
    Senator Braun. [Presiding.] Senator Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Thanks to Chairman Fetterman and Ranking 
Member Braun for holding the hearing.
    It is interesting. I think right now the base of the farm 
bill is $1.5 trillion, $1.2 trillion has to do with food 
assistance. This is something that is really very, very 
important; we appreciate you all being here and sharing your 
expertise.
    Ms. Hasty, thank you for sharing, as I said, your 
expertise, your experience with SNAP and WIC today. It is 
always good to hear directly from those that have been impacted 
by these programs. I am also glad to hear that SNAP helped you 
and your family bridge the gap, which is really what this is 
all about, and helped you advance in your career. That is 
exactly what the program is meant to do.
    In your time working towards your current career, what were 
the most important things that helped you move from making ends 
meet to stable employment? What aspects of the program were 
helpful, and maybe some areas that were not so helpful.
    Ms. Hasty. Thank you for the question and thanks again for 
allowing me to speak. Like I said in my testimony, I think one 
of the barriers would be the application process. I mean, 
having to take time off of work, losing wages to appear, and 
then if it is easier for me to leave my children at home, 
paying someone to watch my children while I go and stand in 
line for a long time and apply. I mean, everyone was really 
helpful in that process, but that was a difficulty.
    I think, as anyone will tell you, receiving SNAP, there is 
also living with the stigma of being labeled as someone who has 
failed. That was not an easy aspect of it, but I am proud of 
the fact that I was able to support my family with the help of 
SNAP. I think every time I earned a higher wage I could look 
back and reflect and see that I could attribute that to the way 
in which it helped me stretch my budget and keep paying my 
bills, and not have to continue to pay late rent fees and 
things like that. It has been progressive.
    Senator Boozman. Well, the other thing, too, I wanted to 
ask you about, and you touched on it, you have been an 
ambassador at the Curbside Market and truly have firsthand 
experience in reaching those who may be in need of assistance 
with WIC and SNAP. Tell me, you mentioned the paperwork, are 
there other barriers that you are finding, so that we can 
capture those folks that do need help, that have not signed up 
for WIC or SNAP?
    Ms. Hasty. Barriers to----
    Senator Boozman. To their participation. In other words, 
the participation is really under.
    Ms. Hasty. Although I know WIC is not part of the farm 
bill, but my experience is in helping people access benefits to 
WIC, and I know that there are barriers to participation in 
both of those programs. Particularly in the communities that I 
serve, the individuals that I try to help, barriers would be 
the application process, and----
    Senator Boozman. Well, I suppose so, I mean, the other 
aspect would be the fact that you are out telling people that 
it actually exists. It is hard for us to understand probably 
that there are people that do not really know, you know, what 
is going on and the program is available.
    Ms. Hasty. Right. Again, in my experience I work right now 
with helping people access WIC. Again, I know it is not part of 
the farm bill.
    Senator Boozman. Very good.
    Ms. Hasty. Sorry.
    Senator Boozman. No, no. Thank you.
    Real quickly, Ms. Reynolds, you emphasized the need to 
scale up programs, evidence-based programs like Padua, Bridges 
to Success, Goodwill Excel Center. What are the barriers to 
expanding programs in other regions while also keeping in mind 
that one size does not fit all? How do you think these types of 
programs might work in our rural areas that are desperately in 
need?
    Ms. Reynolds. Yes, thank you for your question. As a fellow 
Arkansan, I appreciate the rural nod as well.
    I would say a couple of things. The first thing I would say 
is that LEO has built a tremendous amount of evidence around 
individualized case management that is holistically focused on 
the family, and what that allows to have happen is the path 
forward is not just this is what you need and everybody gets 
this. The path forward is often understanding each family where 
they are at, understanding what their today needs are, what 
their tomorrow needs are, and maybe their needs a year from 
now, and doing life with them for a longer period of time, to 
get them into upward mobility, the living wage income, those 
sorts of things.
    What we have found is that these solutions, like Goodwill 
Excel Center, like Catholic Charities Fort Worth, they are 
showing solutions that are case management paired with flexible 
financial assistance plus wraparound services, and then tend to 
be then very customized within that, for getting toward upward 
mobility.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you.
    Senator Fetterman. [Presiding.] Thank you, Senator.
    Now I recognize Senator Klobuchar for five minutes.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Chair Fetterman. 
Thank you for holding this really important hearing.
    Ms. Brown, during the full Committee hearing on nutrition I 
asked Under Secretary Dean about her experience at a Minnesota 
SNAP Employment and Training site, and she spoke very 
positively about our model, and even suggested it could be good 
to bring out to the rest of the country. I understand you are 
also familiar with the collaborative work we are doing between 
Federal, State, and local. Can you talk about, in more detail, 
how this kind of programs helps participants overcome barriers 
to employment?
    Mrs. Jones Brown. Absolutely. Thank you for the question, 
Senator. At Philabundance we are operate a community kitchen 
that is supported by SNAP Employment and Training program. They 
are all adults. They are all either on SNAP or eligible for 
SNAP. It is a free, 16-week program. We have very positive 
results, people that stay in the program, the graduation rates, 
and then getting jobs.
    What we talk about is that we teach people, we say both 
knife skills and life skills. These are very limited, low 
barriers to entry. People have been through the criminal 
justice system or, in some cases, had a health issue, had an 
injury, and had to change opportunities or change trajectories.
    Through this program we also have a catering operation, 
production, like other Catalyst Kitchens across the country. 
What we have found with that is that our participants are 
learning not just to cook, they are also learning about 
nutrition, and they are also providing meals, much-needed 
healthy meals to people who are food insecure across the 
region.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Very good. The second questions, 
food banks in Minnesota, like Second Harvest, Heartland, which 
has seen a 40 percent reduction, about seven million fewer 
pounds in Federal commodities in the last year, it is very 
important that, as you know, the program remains responsive to 
access to supply and increased demand we are seeing, in part 
because of prices, to purchase bonus commodities at times of 
high need for emergency food relief.
    Ms. Brown--in addition to times of low commodity prices, it 
goes either way--Ms. Brown, could you speak to the importance 
of the USDA regular TEFAP spending and CCC purchases and their 
role in ensuring our food banks have consistent access to food?
    Mrs. Jones Brown. Thank you for the question. You are 
absolutely right. It is critically important for us to be able 
to meet the need of our neighbors, that we have access to 
government foods. We actually have seen that decrease, and we 
are seeing it decreasing now. At the height in the last two 
years we received about 19 million pounds of food from 
government that we were able to get out into our neighborhoods, 
to ensure that our neighbors had access to fresh, healthy food, 
primarily produce, which is really helpful for ensuring that 
they are healthy and providing nutritious food to them.
    This calendar year alone it looks like we are on track to 
get maybe five million pounds. At the same time, we are trying 
to purchase additional food. With the economy being what it is, 
it is costing us more.
    Really the TEFAP programs are a lifeline for us to ensure 
that our neighbors have access to food.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Very good. Last question. Ms. Cox, 
as you know, the 2018 Farm Bill authorized the Healthy Fluid 
Milk Incentives pilot to encourage the consumption of milk, 
which we all know is part of a well-rounded diet. The HFMI 
pilot builds on the success of previous incentive programs like 
GusNIP, which have been shown to positively impact purchasing 
decisions.
    With such a high demand for additional nutrient-rich dairy 
products like yogurt and cheese, what opportunities exist to 
expand the reach of the program to include more daily products 
nationwide?
    Mrs. Jones Cox. Thanks for the question, Senator. So yes, 
the GusNIP program, which, in the last farm bill, actually 
receive an increase, that is pretty much one of the strongest 
programs that we will be able to use or we can access for 
participants to have access to fresh fruits and vegetables, to 
healthy foods, as well as milk. I will have to probably get 
back to you a little bit on the Healthy Fluid because I do not 
think we know as much about that. I do know enough about the 
GusNIP that there was more money placed in it in the last farm 
bill, and that is really the place where we are seeing a lot of 
results. We are seeing the Double Up Bucks programs, and just 
the place where people are able to access fresh fruits and 
vegetable, even at farmers markets.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Thank you.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Senator.
    Let me now recognize Senator Booker for five minutes.
    Senator Booker. Thanks so much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
    I am really grateful to be here, and I loved the testimony 
that we heard today. I just want to say very clearly, first and 
foremost, it is important that we protect SNAP.
    I think I am one of the small handful of Senators that live 
in a very low-income neighborhood, and I see every day the 
profound difference that SNAP makes in the lives of people who 
are working hard, who are struggling to make it. We live in a 
country where just finding housing you have to make more than 
twice the minimum wage, in my State, just to be able to afford 
your housing needs.
    We are seeing, in my communities across New Jersey, how 
SNAP is a powerful program that needs to be protected, and 
frankly, needs to be expanded. I think in the United States of 
America it is outrageous that people who have drug convictions 
cannot get SNAP. People who admitted doing the same things that 
Presidents have now said they have done, Senators have said 
they have done. Privileged folks who do not get drug 
enforcement like we see in communities like mine do not lose 
their Federal eligibility for a lot of things. We believe in 
redemption in this country but yet we hold people, time and 
time again, who are formerly incarcerated, to higher levels 
than reflects that spirit and that value.
    There are places like Puerto Rico. Each and every one of 
those people are Americans, and they should have the same 
access to vital programs like this.
    We are facing, in this country, also, not just a hunger 
crisis but a nutrition crisis. We have an explosion of diet-
related diseases, and we know that if we want to try to save 
costs in this country, one out of every three government 
dollars right now is being spent on health care, and the 
overwhelming majority of that is diet-related diseases. What we 
are seeing is programs that I believe need to be expanded, like 
GusNIP, for example, or actually getting people off of their 
prescription drugs.
    We have an urban farm in the South Ward of Newark, New 
Jersey, that I was there filming the documentary, ``Food Inc. 
2,'' and you had just people volunteering, coming up, talking 
about how they had hundreds and hundreds of dollars' worth of 
prescription drugs. Their co-pay was $100. One woman was 
telling me it was $700. She was off of her prescriptions drugs 
when she started getting access to fresh, healthy food.
    I love, Ms. Reynolds, the evidence-based. We know what 
works in communities, but we are putting up artificial 
barriers, as was being said by Ms. Hasty, artificial barriers. 
We are making it really difficult for the people we need. These 
are our children. Ms. Cox, you said it so well. Nutritious, 
healthy diets help people in their brain development years. Not 
access to healthy, fresh foods actually undermines brain 
development.
    SNAP is great. It needs to become a nutrition program. That 
is one of the letters in SNAP stands for. And I believe we need 
to do a lot more, making diet, quality, and nutrition the core 
of SNAP objectives, scaling up programs like GusNIP, and more.
    Just really quick, in the little bit of time I have left, I 
just would like, say, can we talk about the challenges that are 
being faced by people at Philabundance, Ms. Brown, in getting 
access to those fresh, healthy foods are vital to the strength 
of our families and the potential competitiveness of them for 
the long term.
    Mrs. Jones Brown. Thank you very much, Senator, for the 
question, and we absolutely agree with you, and it is why in 
your State and in Pennsylvania we have actually challenged 
ourselves. We put out what we call our Good Food Policy. We are 
holding ourselves accountable to distribute even more 
nutritious food. And interestingly, research tells us that is 
what our neighbors want and what they need.
    Now, obviously, in the communities that we serve there is a 
dearth of grocery stores and sometimes farmers markets, and 
that is why we want to make sure that we are, through programs 
like TEFAP and other programs, getting more access to more 
produce that we are getting out to folks.
    Interestingly, it is what people are asking for. Each and 
every time I talk to a neighbor in need in a pantry, they are 
asking me for produce. They want fresh fruits and vegetables. 
There is a myth that people do not want that, and so people 
were asking for collard greens or sweet potatoes or carrots, so 
we are attempting to provide that.
    We also, in addition to providing the free food to folks, 
we are also working with member partnerships with grocery 
stores, with health care. We are providing healthy meals, 
medically tailored meals, and then working with grocery stores 
to see if there are other ways we can get people access to 
benefits, like SNAP, while also getting access to the food that 
they need.
    Senator Booker. Excellent. And can I just ask you--I want 
to stay with you, Ms. Brown. My time is out but I want to ask 
one last question. One out of every three women incarcerated on 
the Planet Earth is in the United States of America. We are the 
land of the free but we incarcerate women, overwhelmingly women 
who have been survivors of sexual violence, sexual trauma. 
Ninety-five to 98 percent of them coming home, they have got 
children that they have been separated from, that often end up 
in multiple different foster homes. And we know, against 
evidence-based, as Ms. Reynolds said, that when you do things 
to strengthen the connection with their children they have 
lower recidivism rates, and they are more successful.
    How does it make sense--and again, I am a man of faith so I 
believe in the story of the prodigal child--but how does it 
make sense in our society that we take that woman, a survivor 
of sexual trauma, overincarcerated with mandatory minimums for 
crimes, again, that many privileged people do every day, and 
then when they come home and they are trying to reconnect with 
their children, we deny them the basic benefits to get access 
to fresh, healthy foods?
    Does that make any sense, from not just a policy 
perspective or a moral perspective, but does it make sense from 
an economic perspective at all.
    Mrs. Jones Brown. It does not, and one of the things that 
we have found is that when we provide people additional 
supports, like SNAP, with the SNAP emergency allotments, I 
think in Pennsylvania that meant $200 million each month 
additionally going into grocery stores. Even if you think about 
the economic impact of these programs, the reality is that for 
every dollar we are investing in SNAP, $1.50 or $1.80 is coming 
back into our communities.
    Senator Booker. And that justice-involved woman, getting 
herself back on her feet to work, we found with the Child Tax 
Credit, Kenna's data shows that it actually increased work 
force participation for the women. Does SNAP for a justice-
involved woman, getting eligibility for that, empower them to 
be successful earners?
    Mrs. Jones Brown. I think that is right, and I think the 
reality is, you know, I appreciate the moral issue. I, too, am 
a person of faith, and really feel honored and privileged that 
we get to do this work every day. I fully believe we have 
learned a lot of lessons over the last several years. I 
appreciate your leadership, and Senator Braun's, with the White 
House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health.
    I believe we can solve hunger. I believe that we can take 
what works, and we have seen a lot of things that are working 
across the country. We have seen government work. I think the 
reality is we have so much in this country, we can ensure that 
our neighbors have what they need to thrive.
    Senator Booker. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, thanks 
for the indulgence.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now I recognize Senator Gillibrand for five minutes.
    Senator Gillibrand. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, 
Senator Booker, for your commitment to such an important issue.
    I would like to give the floor to Ms. Hasty a bit. I would 
like to hear a little bit more about your story, what work you 
were doing at the time, what work you were looking for, did 
SNAP improve your job security, did it improve your economic 
self-sufficiency, did you ever feel that SNAP created a cycle 
of benefit dependency, and what recommendations would you make 
to improve the SNAP program?
    Ms. Hasty. Thank you. In addition to raising my children 
during the time that I received SNAP I was consistently working 
an average of 34 hours a week. At that time, when I was able to 
work, and with the last full-time job I held while receiving 
SNAP, I actually had mandatory overtime. I had both full-time 
jobs and simultaneous part-time jobs, but I had a total of five 
different employers, so a variety of work.
    Without it I would not have been able to pay my rent, or I 
would it have been late. We did not miss a meal. We worked 
harder. I worked harder. My kids played harder. SNAP has helped 
me to earn more, I think, each time that I advance in my 
career, as modest as it was.
    In terms of a cycle of dependency, I think that is common 
language, but it feels like a deflection from the real economic 
problems that we are facing. I always sought to strengthen my 
skills and grow professionally, so I know what it feels like, 
like I had mentioned before, to kind of feel like you have done 
something wrong to have that type of help. I mean, even in the 
grocery line, using your SNAP card or using your WIC card, 
holding up the line, that is a real reality. I wonder how many 
people in this room or are watching have ever woken up and 
drank a bottle of water to make themselves feel full until they 
knew they were going to eat that one time at the kitchen that 
they worked at, because I have had to do that before.
    The truth is that SNAP and other programs designed to 
alleviate hunger and poverty are just proof that we all deserve 
a standard of living that lets us live healthier and happier. 
We know that SNAP works, but it needs to be expanded.
    I never thought that it was going to be permanent, and even 
when I did not understand the definition of what an entitlement 
program was, I understood that the more that my income 
increased, the less net benefits I got, and the reason I was 
happy about that is because I was, you know, like I said, it is 
almost celebrated when you are no longer receiving benefits. I 
was really proud to start earning a salary that exceeded those 
income limits.
    I think improvements to SNAP would obviously be 
streamlining application processes so that it makes it easier 
for people, better communication about what the program entails 
and who is eligible for it, and not imposing absurd extra work 
requirements, I suppose, or work reporting requirements, and 
allowing people to have a more diverse purchasing power with 
the things that they can purchase with it. Online retailers, 
farmers markets, and there is more detail about that in the 
written testimony that I prepared.
    Senator Gillibrand. Thank you. Ms. Hasty, the SNAP benefit 
today is only six dollars and ten cents a day. Obviously, you 
cannot feed yourself and two kids on six dollars and ten cents 
a day. Talk to me a little bit about how SNAP supplemented what 
you were able to buy from your income and from your earnings, 
and what difference SNAP actually made to being able to buy 
more healthy foods for your children and yourself.
    Ms. Hasty. Right. It is obviously a supplemental program. 
We know that it is not meant to be your entire food budget 
every month. I think the difference with and without SNAP, if 
you kind of picture going to the grocery store without SNAP, 
you have to think about how much money should be left so that 
utility bill could be paid. Without SNAP, you might only 
purchase bread, milk, and eggs, because you know that you can 
eat those things for the rest of the week.
    With SNAP it kind of just gives you more flexibility. You 
can buy fruits and vegetables and have raw fruits and 
vegetables in your house and not just have the basic staples. 
You can focus more on the nutrition instead of just kind of 
making these impossible choices.
    Senator Gillibrand. Thank you, Ms. Hasty.
    Just last, for Mrs. Jones, can you talk a little bit about 
students who need access to SNAP and also the importance of 
making sure that we move Puerto Ricans from NAP to SNAP.
    Mrs. Jones Brown. Actually, thank you very much for the 
question. What we see, we do our work at our food bank and the 
food banks like ours across the country, with agency partners. 
Those are churches, mosques, synagogues, schools, community 
service organizations that end up distributing the food. The 
reality is in our network we have a number of colleges and 
universities that also have food pantries. Right in Senator 
Booker's district we opened a food pantry at Rutgers Camden a 
couple of years ago.
    The reality is we have our college students, that as they 
are trying to get an education so they can get a great job, 
that they are also food and housing insecure. We are able to 
support them through food banks like ours.
    Mrs. Jones Brown. I did not. We ended up partnering with 
them. We are actually part of the same region, interestingly. 
Through the USDA region we are part of the same region. The 
Atlantic region includes them, so they are one of our partners 
in this work. They are a part of our network of 200 food banks, 
and so we are able to share best practices and ways that we can 
ensure that our neighbors have access to the food that they 
need, not just in the continental U.S. but also in Puerto Rico.
    Senator Gillibrand. Thank you.
    Senator Booker. Thanks for crossing the Delaware.
    Mrs. Jones Brown. I like Washington.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Senator.
    I now recognize Senator Warnock for five minutes.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Mr. Chair, and it 
is great to see you back.
    During the pandemic, Congress provided an emergency boost 
to food assistance programs called Emergency SNAP Allotments. 
This boost ended in a number of States last month, but my own 
State of Georgia and many other States already ended this 
increase months ago. After this emergency food assistance was 
cutoff in Georgia, the Atlanta Community Food Bank, which works 
very closely with my church, saw visits increase by about 34 
percent, 34 percent, when compared to the same period the 
previous year.
    I visited the Atlanta Food Bank. I have spent time with the 
volunteers and the workers over at Hosea Feed the Hungry and 
homeless and the work that they do. I have seen those lines get 
longer as our policies got harsher.
    Mrs. Brown, food banks work hard to be a safety net for our 
Federal nutrition programs but they are struggling to keep up 
with increasing need. How would further cutting Federal 
nutrition programs affect our food banks.
    Mrs. Jones Brown. Thank you very much for the question, 
Senator, and as you saw with my counterpart, Kyle, at the 
Atlanta Community Food Bank, who I was with just yesterday, 
across the country we have seen an increase. We saw an 
increase, obviously, early on in COVID in 2020, but then we 
also saw an increase with gas prices and inflation for food 
over the last year. We just had those emergency allotments go 
away in our States, and so we are anticipating increased need. 
We have seen 30 percent, 50 percent, even twice as many people 
access the charitable food network.
    We have a number of churches that are a part of our network 
as well. In fact, one of our churches that is a member is a 
church that I attend, Enon Tabernacle, which I believe that you 
were recently. We really could not do this work without our 
many partners.
    We are here today asking for a bipartisan bill that really 
asks government to partner with us. We are absolutely willing 
to raise the fund, get private donations, and leverage the 
thousands and thousands of volunteers that we have across the 
country. We really need government support. We need government 
support to really do what works. We saw what works. We saw how 
emergency allotments and other additional supports over the 
last couple of years helped our communities, so we are asking 
for those kinds of supports.
    Senator Warnock. I am going to ask an obvious question. You 
do not have the bandwidth to fill in the gap?
    Mrs. Jones Brown. We do not. We really do need help. We saw 
additional supports. Millions more pounds of food came through 
TEFAP to our food banks across the country during COVID. With 
that being pulled back, we are really concerned with how we are 
going to fill that. In the same way that everyday people are 
seeing prices go up in the grocery store, it is costing us more 
and more to purchase and transport for our neighbors in need.
    Senator Warnock. On top of that, some of my colleagues are 
talking about rolling back the Thrifty Food Plan update, which 
increased food benefits by less than two dollars per day, but 
is expected to keep one million children above the poverty 
line. It seems to me that we cannot go backward in this farm 
bill, and I will be doing everything I can to expand and 
protect Federal nutrition benefits.
    In the time that I still have, currently non-disabled 
adults without dependents are only eligible for SNAP for three 
months out of every three years unless then work 80 hours per 
month. Now I believe the vast majority of SNAP recipients who 
are able to work, do so. We need to bear in mind that most SNAP 
recipients are children, elderly, or disabled.
    Some of my colleagues in the House, and also in the Senate, 
have talked about expanding existing work requirements for 
SNAP. Ms. Cox, can you tell us about these proposals and what 
the research says about existing work requirements already in 
place, including whether they increase work force 
participation?
    Mrs. Jones Cox. Thank you, Senator Warnock, for the 
question. Studies consistently demonstrate that taking benefits 
away from people who are not working or not meeting a work 
requirement does little to improve their long-term employment 
outcomes, especially those with limited employment 
opportunities. Instead, it increases hardship, including among 
people who are not even expected to work, like children and 
people with disabilities.
    There was a recent peer-reviewed paper that showed that 
SNAP's time limit reduced participation in the program by 53 
percent for those who were subject to it, with no effect on 
employment. There was another recent paper about no evidence of 
improved employment earnings, but it did find that SNAP 
participation was cut by 7 to 32 percentage points a year after 
the time limit was reinstated.
    There have been consistent studies showing that it does not 
have an impact on earnings. It just takes away food.
    Senator Warnock. It takes away food from hungry people.
    Mrs. Jones Cox. Exactly, and you cannot work if you are 
hungry.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you so much. I hope we will keep 
this in mind, keep the research and the actual data in mind as 
we write this year's farm bill.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Senator.
    Let me now recognize Senator Marshall for five minutes.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate 
all of our witnesses hanging through this lunch hour.
    I do not know about you but I grew up every lunch in school 
that we got to drink whole milk. I would actually get two 
cartons of whole milk, and I hope that you all would support me 
that how important milk and the milk products are to the 
program that you run. Just bear with me a moment here.
    [Pause.]
    Let us start with Dr. Whitford. My first question should be 
how is Coach Self doing, but I assume you do not have any exact 
knowledge. I am glad to let you know that I did speak to the 
chancellor yesterday, and Coach Self is healing up very nicely 
and will be ready for next year's basketball season.
    You run the Watered Gardens Ministry, and I would just like 
to hear a little bit more about that. What is your mantra? What 
drives you to do it? Tell me about the success of it and what 
is that feel-good moment for you?
    Mr. Whitford. Thank you, Senator. There are many feel-good 
moments in this kind of work that we do, but certainly seeing 
people freed from poverty is the No. 1 thing that we are 
excited to see. Right now we are seeing a lot of folks who are 
really struggling and chronic homelessness, a lot of mental 
health issues, addiction issues, and these types of things.
    We have a very robust program where we are sitting down and 
getting to know people, very relational in nature, setting 
goals with them, and helping them up and out of poverty. You 
know, and we measure a lot. I think it is important that 
charities like mine are outcome driven and really doing a good 
job of measuring key performance indicators, and we do that.
    Interestingly, before the pandemic, we were seeing about 
63, 64 percent of folks who would come into our shelter with no 
job at all, leave with a job, and over the last couple of years 
that has changed. Now we are really struggling to see people 
get back into the work force. We are a little below 40 percent 
at this point of folks coming into the shelter and then not 
leaving with a job. What we track is successful exits out of 
our shelter have been dropping.
    Senator Marshall. You have got to tell us why. How come? 
What are the barriers?
    Mr. Whitford. Well, it really does seem that there is so 
much government largess that is pouring into our communities, 
and it is not just mine. I mean, I have 11 pages of testimony 
from leaders across the United States that are fighting poverty 
that really are seeing perverse incentives from the amount of 
government help that is coming into the community. It is not 
help that is able to discern. It is not a help that is 
investigative in nature. The very things we are doing with 
people on the ground in our own community, understanding the 
individual needs and what is really needed for that person, 
government programs are not able to do that kind of work.
    It creates a perverse incentive that draws people toward it 
rather than toward the challenging developmental programs that 
are actually going to help them up and out of poverty.
    Senator Marshall. You know, coming from the Midwest I think 
that a work ethic is part of our DNA. It is part of the values 
that I was raised on. Here in Joplin, Missouri--I will still 
call Missouri the Midwest, even though we kind of struggle with 
your basketball team a little bit over there, but I am sure you 
are still rooting for the Jayhawks.
    Tell me, do you still see that work ethic as a value that 
most of the people coming in to your facility with, that they 
want to get a job, or where are they on the work part of this?
    Mr. Whitford. No, no. I am seeing a lot of people coming in 
that do not have any intention or desire to work. There is an 
entitlement mentality that has become pervasive in our Nation, 
and we see it come through the doors of our mission every day. 
Then what we have to do is we have to be great sources of 
inspiration and to provide relational accountability, in order 
to help people realize that they are created in the image of 
God, created in the image of a maker, and are therefore built 
and intended to make, to produce, and to contribute, not to be 
stuck on the receiving end of someone's benevolence.
    Senator Marshall. In the long-term success, and you can 
define success how you want to, the folks that have a job, do 
they seem to be more fulfilled? Do they have purpose in life, 
or are they bouncing back sooner?
    Mr. Whitford. Yes, absolutely, and this is what we find. 
This is why we do work first. You come into our mission and we 
want to employ you right off the bag, because we do not just 
see a person who is disabled or a person who is lacking 
capacity, but people who have ability and capacity and 
potential. When we start with employment it begins to energize 
them, because we are built for that. That is what leads to more 
successful outcomes.
    Again, it is a fight. There is a great tension in what we 
are trying to do, and I think some of the larger, more 
bureaucratic forms of help coming into our community.
    Senator Marshall. Well, great. My time has wound down. We 
appreciate all the witnesses coming today.
    Mr. Chairman, I will yield back.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Senator.
    I now recognize Senator Bennet for five minutes.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it is good to 
see you in this role. Thank you for having me today. I am not 
on the Subcommittee but I know how important this is.
    Senator Fetterman. I thank you so much, Senator.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you. Senator Marshall, my mom is 
proud of you for drinking that milk.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you. Tell your mom ``hey.''
    Senator Bennet. I will. I will tell her. She is probably 
the only person--that is not true. I was going to say the only 
person watching this, but that is not true. She is not, 
actually. She is not watching because she did not know what you 
would be doing.
    I just wanted to come by because before I was in this job I 
was the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, and the 
vast majority of kids there were living in poverty. They still 
are. The problem there was not that people did not work. The 
problem was people were working two and three jobs, and no 
matter what they did they could not get their kids out of 
poverty.
    That is what is happening all over America, in a country 
where we are the richest country in the world, Mr. Chairman. It 
is true. And we have the worst income inequality that we have 
had since the 1920's in this country. We have the lowest 
economic mobility that we have had in generations, and lower 
economic mobility--I am sad to say this--than many other 
industrialized countries in the world that we compare ourselves 
to.
    Do I think there are some people that do not work, if given 
the opportunity to work? Probably. I think what is much more 
likely the case, based on the parents, the families that I have 
worked with, is that people are working. People are killing 
themselves. They are not just working. Their kids are working. 
When you are in a family's house and you are the 
superintendent, and you show up, and I did show up under these 
circumstances, when kids were not going to school on a morning 
after, on a morning they missed school.
    I would say, ``Well, why have you missed school?'' and they 
said, ``Because I was working until 12 last night, at 
McDonald's down the street.'' Because we do not have the sense 
to give kids in this country the opportunity to go to school 
when it makes sense for them. We have a one-size-fits-all 
approach to public education that makes it hard, I think, for 
working families to work in the ways that they want to work and 
be able to support their kids.
    I know Ms. Jones Cox knows that we spend a lot of time 
working on the Child Tax Credit a few years ago to cut 
childhood poverty in this country almost in half, which we did. 
When the Biden administration came in we cut childhood poverty 
by 50 percent, the most significant reduction in childhood 
poverty in American history. We reduced hunger in the United 
States by 30 percent, and we did not add a single bureaucrat to 
the Federal Government to do it. It was not a bureaucratic 
program. It was just putting money in the hands of families to 
be able to spend it, as Ms. Hasty was talking about, in the 
best interests of their kids.
    You know, you said that they could buy a little bit of 
extra relief at the end of the month when they are paying their 
rent, when they are paying their light bill, when they are 
paying for their food, or for school clothes, in the case of 
kids that I represented in Colorado, whose parents were saying, 
``This is the first time that we have actually been able to 
provide school clothes for our kids.''
    From my point of view, you know, we are living in the 
richest country in the world, and our level of childhood 
poverty is criminal. It is inexcusable. It is immoral. It is 
unacceptable. And I think we should end it. I think cutting it 
in half was a good start, and I am very sad that that came to 
an end. It worked. It did what we said it was going to do.
    You know, for me--and I am not talking about people over on 
this side of the aisle. I am talking about in the other house 
of Congress--to see people who blew up this deficit so that the 
wealthiest people in America could have tax cuts when we have 
the worst income inequity since the 1920's, that makes no sense 
to me. That is a handout that makes no sense to me, when we 
have a solution for the childhood poverty that we are facing. 
And the idea that we would be threatening to blow up our credit 
rating over the school lunch program or over SNAP does not make 
any sense to me.
    Ms. Cox, with my last 22 seconds--sorry to go on for so 
long--to the families in Colorado--and I guess what I would 
say, just two things. One, is it true that there are no work 
requirements when it comes to SNAP? And two, what is it going 
to mean to families? You know, two-thirds of the folks that get 
SNAP are living in families with children, in Colorado. What is 
it going to mean to those children if we cut these programs the 
way these folks have been talking about?
    Mrs. Jones Cox. Okay. Real quick, so no, it is not true 
that there are not current work requirements in SNAP. There 
are. We have been talking about them. There is the three-month 
time limit for individuals not working, out of three years. 
There are work requirements.
    The second, the proposal that was placed by Representative 
Johnson, for Colorado, in specific, it would be 115,000 SNAP 
participants in households that would be at risk of losing 
SNAP. If we are looking at those households with children seven 
and below, or we are looking at we are going from age 50 to 64. 
It is a lot of people in Colorado that would be at risk of 
losing benefits.
    Senator Bennet. I know my time is up, and I am done, but 
let me just say what I saw when the Child Tax Credit went away, 
the Enhanced Child Tax Credit went away, was lines at food 
pantries just, you know, go up like this, skyrocket like this, 
and I think we are going to see the same thing here. Ms. Hasty, 
I do not know if you had the benefit of the Child Tax Credit or 
not. Would you mind saying a word about that, and then I will 
stop.
    Ms. Hasty. In terms of----
    Senator Bennet. Just what that enhanced--I am sorry to 
surprise you with it.
    Ms. Hasty. No, I am sorry.
    Senator Bennet. What that extra money meant in terms of the 
Child Tax Credit during COVID.
    Ms. Hasty. The extra Child Tax Credit, I mean, me 
personally, in my own experience, allowed me to pay back rent, 
so it was extremely helpful. Like I said in my testimony, I 
mean, it is not an unfamiliar story that it helped just take a 
huge weight off my shoulders.
    Senator Bennet. That is what families say to me, is that 
the stress, the stress, the stress is what it relieved.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you, and I apologize to 
my colleague for going over.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Senator, and I especially 
want to thank, to every one of you, the witnesses today that 
came in, to hear from you all today, so thank you.
    You know, protecting SNAP and preventing fraud is not a 
Republican or a Democratic issue, though. I think everyone 
agrees on that. It is time for the USDA and State agencies to 
update their technology security to prevent fraud. I would hope 
we would all agree.
    I intend to strengthen the USDA's tools to existing mandate 
to do so. The USDA is already making significant efforts to 
modernize SNAP and its nutritional assistance. One of these 
efforts are updating the Thrifty Food Plan, which we have 
discussed today. This update is a modest investment with a 
significant impact for working Americans who need it.
    We have to work to protect SNAP for the 21st century, and I 
look forward to working with my colleagues to get it done.
    I heard one resounding theme during this hearing: that 
those who use SNAP do not want to use it forever. I have never 
met any American hoping that they can stay on SNAP for their 
whole lives, not at all. No one does. They only are on it 
because they need it.
    SNAP is a program that helps individuals like Ms. Hasty and 
people like Mrs. Jones Brown, and Ms. Reynolds that work it. It 
helps Americans who fall on hard times.
    I will end with this. We need to pass a farm bill that 
works for everyday Americans.
    The record will remain open for five more days. And now 
this hearing is adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 1:47 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
