           UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

           OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHRISTOPHER A. COONS

    Senator Coons. I call this hearing to order. Today, the 
Subcommittee on State, and Foreign Operations, Related Programs 
of the Senate Appropriations Committee, meets to review the 
fiscal year 2024 budget request, for the United States Agency 
for International Development.
    We are honored to have Administrator Samantha Power with 
us. Administrative Power, it is always an honor and a privilege 
to have you before us. We have a lot to cover. You have a lot 
going on and a lot of responsibilities, so we appreciate your 
making yourself available.
    It is unfortunate that we have two, at least two, other 
compelling hearings on similar or related topics. So please be 
understanding that a number of our colleagues intend to come in 
and out.
    I am grateful, the Vice Chair of the Full Committee, my 
friend and colleague from Maine, Susan Collins, is serving as 
the Ranking for this hearing, and will help open the hearing. I 
know that the Ranking Member of the subcommittee, Senator 
Graham, will join us in just a few minutes.
    The fiscal year 2024 request for this subcommittee's budget 
including staff and programs of, State, USAID, MCC, DFC, and 
other agencies, is in total $68.6 billion, 6.8 billion, or 11 
percent above the fiscal year 2023 enacted level, still not 
even one penny on the dollar of U.S. Defense spending. If you 
include the supplemental funding that was provided in 2023, to 
address Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, the fiscal year 
2024 request would actually be a 15 percent cut over the 
overall expenditures.
    With this relatively modest funding, Administrator Power, 
you are being asked to confront an historic confluence of 
complex global challenges. A record number of refugees, and 
internally displaced persons, more than 100 million people 
forcibly uprooted. Food insecurity steadily on the rise, with 
an expected 345 million people projected to experience intense 
food insecurity this year, more than double the level just 3 
years ago. Sustained democratic backsliding, marked by 
corruption and increased repression. A global debt crisis 
amongst the poorer countries coming out of COVID-19. Economic 
competition and coercion from authoritarian actors, like the 
PRC.
    And while we continue to focus on Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine, there are many other humanitarian crises around the 
world: the Horn of Africa, the Sahel, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, 
and many others.
    USAID is tasked with a leading role in the U.S. 
Government's response to these many challenges, which is also 
critical to bolstering U.S. national security, our reputation, 
and our place in the world. I am grateful for the service of 
all the development professionals at USAID, who I have had the 
opportunity to visit in a dozen countries in the last few 
months.
    I am proud of the work we have done here, on a bipartisan 
basis on this Subcommittee, and Full Committee, to help you 
better grow, equip, and support USAID's workforce, to apply 
lessons learned from your predecessors, and adapt the Agency to 
strengthen locally led development, and cooperation with the 
American private sector. I know we have a lot more to do 
together.
    I look forward to hearing from you this morning about your 
proposals for how we can best leverage our development tools to 
advance our national interests, how you define those interests, 
where USAID fits in, and what you are doing to better tell the 
story, globally, of USAID's vital work.
    I will say to you at the outset what I said in our previous 
hearing to Secretary Blinken. Your task is daunting, and this 
subcommittee must both rigorously oversee your work, and ensure 
you have the support and resources you need to protect and 
advance our national security and our national values. You 
cannot be asked to do more with less.
    That is why I am encouraged by the fiscal year 2024 budget 
request for your Agency, and the rest of the State and Foreign 
Operations budget, as the challenges of our time demand bold 
investments.
    Thank you Administrator Power, for joining us. I look 
forward to your testimony.
    And I will now turn to Vice Chair Collins.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR SUSAN M. COLLINS

    Senator Collins. Thank you very much, Chairman Coons. I am 
delighted to join you today. As is sometimes the case in the 
Senate, there is a conflict for the Ranking Member, Lindsey 
Graham, with the Judiciary Committee hearing this morning. He 
will be attending a little later, but in the meantime he has 
asked me to help open this hearing, and serve in the role as 
Ranking Member.
    I do want to welcome Administrator Power. I know that the 
subcommittee looks forward to hearing your testimony on USAID's 
fiscal year 2024 budget request, and moving quickly to 
questions on such a wide range of issues that you deal with.
    I will have questions for you regarding the Reach Every 
Mother and Child Act, which Chairman Coons and I intend to 
reintroduce soon, along with the others in the Senate. It sets 
a goal of the Ending Preventable Maternal and Child Deaths 
through such affordable and simple practices as nutritional 
supplements, clean birthing practices, and vaccines.
    I am also eager to hear your assessment of the situation 
for women and girls in Afghanistan, which I view as dire. And 
also, your comments on recent steps the Afghan Government has 
taken to exclude women from working in international aid 
programs and for NGOs. As I look at the situation in 
Afghanistan, it appears evident that we are on the verge of 
extreme food shortages, and we all know who will be most 
affected by that, and that is women and girls.
    I also think that there is a very interesting debate on the 
best way to help people around the world who are struggling 
with hunger: Is it to provide them with food, or is it to teach 
them how to grow their own food, so that they can become more 
sustained in meeting their needs?
    So thank you, again, for being with us today. And I 
appreciate the Chairman's leadership.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Vice Chair Collins. We just spent 
several days together, thinking about, talking about, and 
debating the future of food assistance and humanitarian relief, 
and how to make that more efficient. And the opportunity to 
work with Senator Collins on the REACH Act, is something that I 
welcome.
    We now look forward to your testimony, Administrator, and 
then we will move to 5-minute rounds of questioning.

STATEMENT OF HON. SAMANTHA POWER, ADMINISTRATOR, UNITED 
            STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
    Ms. Power. Thank you so much Chairman Coons. Thank you, 
Vice Chair Collins for your leadership of the entire 
Appropriations Committee, and for filling in here today. I look 
forward to seeing Ranking Member Graham, and other Members of 
the Committee.
    But I know how important, as well, the other activities are 
that are going on here today--in a way it is a metaphor for the 
world, the State of the world. The subjects of the other 
hearings that are underway are very near and dear to my heart 
and that of the Agency.
    Look, the challenge the world faces today is clear, that 
decades of development gains that have laid the foundation for 
an era of relative peace, stability, and prosperity, are now at 
serious risk. During our lifetimes, the U.S. has played an 
absolutely critical role in accelerating tremendous progress in 
reducing extreme poverty, in fighting disease, in addressing 
hunger, and getting kids, especially girls to school, and in 
fueling democracy's rise.
    But for now, at least, many of these trends have moved into 
reverse. The pandemic decimated health systems, leading to a 
resurgence in diseases, from measles, to tuberculosis. It also 
battered many countries' finances. And after a decade of heavy 
borrowing, and more recently rising inflation exacerbated by 
Putin's war, 60 percent of the world's poorest countries are at 
or near debt distress. And this is a phenomenon that really is 
a new, exacerbating dynamic in today's world.
    Natural disasters, of course, just as here in the United 
States, are increasing in frequency and intensity, leading to a 
sharp rise in humanitarian needs. The upshot of it all, is 
stark. For the first time in decades, human life expectancy is 
on the decline. And again, that is a composite indicator of all 
of the crises that are interlocking, for the first time since 
the 1950s, life expectancy is going down globally.
    At the same time, of course, democracies are under attack. 
Our rivals are using transnational corruption, digital 
repression, disinformation, and in Ukraine, actual artillery 
and missile fire to undermine freedom, and elevate autocrats.
    It is a daunting list of challenges. And I know some 
question whether the United States should be taking on these 
challenges through our development investments, or whether the 
scope of these challenges is just too great to make a 
meaningful dent.
    But the fact is, our national security hinges on this work. 
Deprivation and indignity abroad can fuel resource competition, 
political fragility, and extremism that endanger us here at 
home. Disease outbreaks, as we well know, can cross oceans, and 
recessions in foreign markets can threaten our own economic 
growth.
    If we don't lead efforts to take on these challenges, the 
People's Republic of China and Putin are ready to step in, 
whether through opaque loans on unfavorable terms, or with 
mercenaries in tow.
    An international order that values democracy and human 
rights, and respects international borders is not a given. 
Indeed, authoritarian actors are challenging and aiming to 
reshape it. We have to invest in the stable and humane world 
that we know the American people need.
    USAID is privileged to have a leading role in tackling the 
most significant challenges of our time, in close coordination 
with our interagency partners, advancing diplomacy and defense. 
And we are very, very grateful to the American people, and to 
you, for giving us the resources to make such a difference.
    That said, we know that to drive progress on the scale we 
need, we have got to be catalytic. We have got to bring other 
donors, including non-traditional donors, we have to use our 
resources to bring in the private sector, we have to work with 
and through multilateral institutions, foundations, and local 
organizations in our partner countries.
    So USAID has set a new reform agenda aimed at delivering 
progress beyond our development programs, beyond the resources 
that you all provide. That means using our expertise, our 
convening power, our hustle, our advocacy to draw in others, to 
leverage additional resources, to spark innovation, and to 
inspire broader movements for change.
    The Biden-Harris Administration's fiscal year 2024 request 
of $32 billion for USAID's fully- and partially managed 
accounts will allow us to make more of that transformative 
impact.
    We will invest in countries experiencing democratic 
openings, helping them show that democracy delivers tangible 
economic results for citizens. We will work with nations to 
attract private sector investment, and drive broadly shared 
economic growth. We will support countries that are rebuilding 
their decimated health systems, and we will meet growing 
humanitarian needs, not just with emergency assistance, as Vice 
Chair Collins was speaking to, but longer term investments in 
resilience, and with their--in their ability to grow for 
themselves.
    And crucially, we will invest in USAID's workforce to carry 
out this ambitious agenda. Since 2019, our Operating Expenses 
funds have increased at half the rate that our programming has 
grown, giving us more to do with fewer people and resources. 
But this budget will help us invest in the people and the 
systems that we need to power an Agency that is nimble, and 
responsive, and critical for our foreign policy.
    We know that with the United States leading the way, the 
world can drive meaningful progress against our toughest 
challenges, because we have decades of gains in global health, 
in education, and in fueling prosperity to prove it. It is on 
us now to resume that progress.
    And with that, I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

           Prepared Statement of Administrator Samantha Power
    Thank you Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, and distinguished 
members of the subcommittee.

    A few months ago, President George W. Bush posed a question. 
``What's the role of a great country in the world? Is it to look 
inward? Is it to think about how to solve big problems?'' As he said, 
``We all decided to work together to solve big problems.'' Let's 
continue that legacy. Thank you.

   Prepared Statement of Acting Inspector, Nicole L. Angarella, U.S. 
                  Agency for International Development
Chairman Coons, Ranking Member Graham, and Members of the Subcommittee:

    Thank you for the opportunity to provide a written statement for 
the subcommittee's hearing on USAID's fiscal year 2024 budget request. 
The USAID Office of Inspector General's (OIG) mission is to safeguard 
and strengthen U.S. foreign assistance through timely, relevant, and 
impactful oversight. We appreciate the opportunity to share our views 
on challenges facing USAID's programs and operations.
    USAID is called upon more than ever to deliver worldwide support on 
behalf of the American people. It has been the primary agency providing 
non-security assistance to Ukraine, while continuing its mission of 
providing humanitarian and development assistance in over 100 countries 
across five continents. In fiscal year 2022, USAID processed grants and 
contracts with $36.4 billion obligated through more than 22,000 
acquisition and assistance actions.
    USAID OIG's independent audits, evaluations, inspections, and 
investigations help identify USAID's current challenges in 
administering programs and operations. This statement draws from our 
annual Top Management Challenges report and aligns with our priority 
oversight areas.\1\ The following four Top Management Challenges that 
we identified for USAID in November 2022 ring true today:

    1. Establishing optimal conditions for Agency staff and programs to 
succeed;
    2. Mitigating risk in Agency operations;
    3. Countering corruption, abuse, and malign influence; and
    4. Maximizing the impact of monitoring and quality data. Each of 
these challenges is expanded upon below.

    \1\ USAID OIG, Top Management Challenges Facing USAID in Fiscal 
Year 2023, November 16, 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   establishing optimal conditions for agency staff and programs to 
                                succeed
    Strategic workforce planning is a challenge for USAID and has been 
noted by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) as a high-risk 
issue across the U.S. government.\2\ Our recent oversight work 
highlights constraints within USAID operations that inhibit adequate 
staffing and workforce support for humanitarian and development 
assistance programming.
    These constraints include hiring impediments, increased reliance on 
contractors, and various skills gaps among staff. USAID faces a 
critical shortage of contracting and agreement officers that adds risk 
to awards management. In addition, our work has shown that the Agency 
lacks guidance and tools for a comprehensive approach to human capital 
management and needs an effective central mechanism to track and close 
skills gaps.\3\
    USAID's reliance on short-term, limited-capacity contract staff is 
of particular concern in the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance and 
Office of Transition Initiatives.\4\ While the Agency has expanded its 
humanitarian assistance programming in recent years to respond to 
disasters and other catastrophes worldwide, USAID's staffing levels 
have not kept pace with the shift. The long-lasting nature of the 
crises these offices respond to would benefit from staffing stability 
and longer-term personnel. Still, efforts to address these staffing 
challenges are hindered by budget constraints, lack of data, and the 
absence of human capital metrics for managing contractors.
    Another aspect of strategic workforce planning is initiatives to 
improve diversity. USAID's diversity, equity, inclusion, and 
accessibility efforts aim to improve diversity in its workforce, but 
current processes do not include data on contract staff. The required 
diversity reporting only includes civil service and Foreign Service 
staff, making up just 40 percent of USAID's workforce. Capturing 
additional data could inform efforts to improve diversity in the 
Agency's workforce and cultivate more positive outcomes for its staff 
and beneficiaries around the world.
    We have provided the Agency with recommendations to improve its 
strategic workforce planning, contract staff management, and diversity 
efforts, including the need for USAID to conduct an assessment and 
develop a comprehensive plan to create a sustainable workforce. In 
response to this audit, the Agency has provided a multi-year plan to 
address our recommendations in strategic workforce planning.
                  mitigating risk in agency operations
    Our oversight work has highlighted the importance of USAID 
identifying, documenting, and responding to risks to its programming. 
This is particularly relevant as the Agency attempts to provide more 
funds through local organizations and respond to complex emergencies. 
In addition, continued vigilance is required to address risks tied to 
information technology (IT) and further supply chain management.

Responses: USAID Is Constrained by Funding Structure but Better Data 
Collection Could Improve Workforce Planning'' (E-000-22-002-M), 
September 29, 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    While localization remains a top priority for USAID, the pool of 
capable, eligible local partners must grow for the Agency to achieve 
its goals. For example, our recent audit of the U.S. President's 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) programs found that only a 
limited number of local partners were ready to implement USAID 
programs, which delayed the benefits of transitioning HIV programming 
to these partners.\5\ Bureaucratic hurdles, budget cuts in capacity 
development for local partners, and inconsistent compliance with award 
provisions are also challenges to localization efforts. In addition, 
managing risks in localization requires metrics for tracking success, 
increased staff capacity, and more oversight and support than currently 
provided via large and established international nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs).\6\
    USAID must also address risk from the outset of complex 
emergencies. Our oversight work on USAID's humanitarian responses 
highlights the need for greater attention to planning for and managing 
risks in its programming. Past audits of programming in Yemen\7\ and 
the response to the Venezuela migrant crisis\8\ found the Agency lacked 
a process to respond to diversions to sanctioned groups, environmental 
hazards, partner safety and theft, and misuse of cash assistance. Time 
and again, we have seen new and dynamic complex emergencies and 
conflict environments pose challenges for USAID, including in 
Afghanistan and recently in Ukraine, where lessons learned from 
previous complex emergencies should better prepare USAID to plan for 
continuity of operations in the complex environments in which they 
operate with small, rotational staff.
    IT and supply chain management pose other risks to the Agency that 
require further vigilance. Our previous audit work points to issues 
such as the use of unauthorized applications on mobile devices.\9\ GAO 
noted that risks of reliance on IT include attacks by foreign 
adversaries and the introduction of counterfeit products in the supply 
chain.
           countering corruption, abuse, and malign influence
    Corruption, sexual exploitation and abuse, and malign influence 
threaten to undermine USAID's objectives as it provides assistance in 
challenging environments. This is especially relevant as the Agency 
increasingly uses multi-donor mechanisms, such as UN agencies, with 
fewer safeguards than traditional assistance programming. The Agency 
can address these threats by tightening controls, strengthening 
processes that facilitate reporting of possible criminal activity, and 
ensuring accountability of Agency partners, whether NGOs, contractors, 
or multilateral organizations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Corruption and abuse by bad actors are a risk in USAID programs 
with a large outflow of assistance, such as in Ukraine. To safeguard 
programming, USAID can improve its pre-award certification process\10\ 
to capture whether prospective award recipients have engaged with 
actors sanctioned by the U.S. government for corrupt activity. In a 
recent audit, USAID made progress in mechanisms to prevent the risk of 
sexual exploitation and abuse in their development activities but has 
yet to take action on several related recommendations.\11\
    USAID increasingly relies on UN agencies and other international 
organizations to furnish assistance to beneficiaries. To date, the 
Agency has appropriated $22.9 billion in direct budget support via the 
World Bank's multi-donor trust fund to the government of Ukraine to 
support non-security general budget expenses, including salaries for 
civil servants, teachers, healthcare workers, and other government 
employees, and social spending needs, including pension expenses and 
payments to internally displaced persons. Our January and March 
evaluations found that the agreement between the World Bank and the 
Ukrainian government contained provisions enabling the World Bank to 
respond to credible and material allegations of fraud and corruption 
and to request reimbursement for expenditures that were used in a 
manner inconsistent with the grant agreement.\12\ We will continue to 
test the effectiveness of these established mechanisms.
    To ensure accountability and prevent criminal activity and abuse, 
USAID needs to improve its processes for obtaining timely and 
transparent reporting by its implementing partners, including UN 
agencies. Inconsistent and infrequent reporting of allegations of fraud 
and abuse despite increases in Agency support in high-risk areas 
indicate the need for more oversight and additional outreach to educate 
partners about reporting tools. Additionally, the Agency should take 
actions to strengthen the government's ability to prosecute foreign-
based NGOs; particularly by creating a forum consent clause in its 
awards that enhance USAID's ability to recover taxpayer funds misused 
or fraudulently obtained.\13\
    USAID also faces challenges within its programming to UN agencies. 
USAID OIG's access rights to UN documents, records, and other 
information extend only so far as USAID's contractual agreements. 
Access limitations to information held by the UN can delay or restrict 
our audit and investigative work and preclude USAID from making 
informed decisions regarding ongoing or future funding to UN agencies. 
With one quarter of USAID's program funds going to the UN World Food 
Programme, and significant funding through other UN agencies, such 
programs must be subject to oversight by my office.
    Finally, USAID is challenged to counter influence from foreign 
actors such as Russia and the People's Republic of China. From our 
audit work in countering malign Kremlin influence, we recommended the 
Agency implement a process for monitoring risks and engaging with 
relevant stakeholders.\14\ USAID continues efforts to counter 
increasing levels of China's influence in developing countries, given 
concerns of conflict with U.S. values. We have an ongoing audit that 
will assess the extent that the Agency has shifted programming to 
counter China's influence in Africa.

          maximizing the impact of monitoring and quality data
    Gathering, reporting, and acting on reliable data represents an 
ongoing challenge for USAID, particularly in locations with access 
limitations. Improving data quality is critical to keeping programs on 
track and ensuring top-notch, data-driven decisionmaking.
    USAID can address vulnerabilities by monitoring programming 
throughout the development lifecycle, particularly in complex operating 
environments. Monitoring helps USAID track progress towards meeting the 
development goals of its programs, but the process is constrained and 
sometimes not as effective as intended. Recent oversight work 
highlights shortfalls with third-party monitors, such as concerns with 
the quality of their products and lack of guidance on how to use their 
services. Additionally, USAID access to sites in non-permissive 
environments, such as Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iraq, constrains the 
capacity to monitor effectively.
    Recent audit work also illustrates the need for USAID to ensure 
reliable financial and performance data. Specifically, the reports 
noted weaknesses with reporting data to USAspending.gov and 
PaymentAccuracy.gov, and the need to take corrective action related to 
validating data between its Development Information System (DIS) and 
the State Department's foreign assistance data system.\15\ 
Additionally, we noted weaknesses in quality control measures in 
PEPFAR's data system in select African missions.
                        concluding observations
    As this Committee considers USAID's fiscal year 2024 budget 
request, USAID OIG remains committed to briefing Congress on its 
independent oversight of USAID's programming. Our planned and ongoing 
audits, evaluations, inspections, and investigations are designed to 
improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability in USAID's 
foreign assistance programs, and deter fraud, waste, and abuse that can 
jeopardize program success. We appreciate the opportunity to provide 
this statement.

    Senator Coons. Thank you, Administrator Power. Without 
objection, I am going to actually have 7-minute rounds here, 
and that means we may do one round. We will see how many 
members come back from the other hearings.
    Let me start, Administrator, if I could with a comment you 
just made about the reform agenda at USAID, with a goal I think 
I am quoting, ``To leverage resources and spark innovation.'' 
Private sector engagement is something many of us have urged 
that USAID take more seriously, engage more actively on, 
whether it is in food security, global health, conservation.
    There is, today, a huge amount of philanthropic and private 
sector funding, a big change from 50 years ago when the vast 
majority of development was direct U.S. Government grants. 
Today, we have got iconic foundations, we have got significant 
private sector investment, and many of the countries in the 
Global South would welcome U.S. private sector engagement and 
investment as much as direct assistance through USAID.
    Something the Ranking Member and I are working on, the U.S. 
Foundation for International Conservation, would leverage and 
mobilize philanthropic and private sector investment. The 
Development Finance Corporation is, of course, another way that 
we are trying to crowd in private sector investment. Your 
budget request includes some specific programs intended to 
enhance your engagement with the private sector, but I would be 
interested--sort of more broadly speaking, you are the Vice 
Chair of the DFC Board: What more could we be doing to unlock 
the DFC and to use its leveraging power?
    Give us a little more detail on this reform agenda, and 
what are the areas where you think you have been most 
successful? Where are there some lessons learned in terms of 
partnering with the private sector? What are the reasons the 
private sector might be hesitant or resistant to partner with 
USAID? And what, if any, issues are there that we could help 
address around your authorities, your staffing, culture, other 
issues?
    Ms. Power. Thank you so much. Well, I think as you and I 
have discussed, there is probably the most substantial gap 
right now, between what countries are asking for and what we 
provide is in the economic growth domain. And if you contrast, 
for example, the resources that we invest with the tremendously 
impactful PEPFAR program, where, you know, you are looking at 
billions of dollars every year, more than $6 billion, you know, 
spread across a number of countries, again, doing enormous 
good.
    Contrast that with the fairly modest investments in 
economic growth and economic development. And every time you 
travel around you hear from leaders, what do we want: we want 
to go from aid to trade, we want jobs, jobs, jobs for our 
burgeoning young populations, and so forth.
    And I think there is--I don't want to speak for everybody, 
but I think this is a broad view--a broad embrace, broad 
support for investments in economic growth, and economic 
investment in trade facilitation, in assistance right now for 
debt, you know, debt technical assistance as countries seek to 
restructure debt at very vulnerable times.
    So I don't sense a lot of opposition to this agenda, but 
because USAID now, is more than 90 percent earmarked, it 
doesn't leave a lot of give for that kind of programming, and 
there is not the same constituency for economic growth, 
economic development, trade facilitation, banging down the door 
up here, as there is for some of these other incredibly 
important programs that we have, like Feed the Future, like 
PEPFAR, et cetera.
    So I think that as we move to a progress beyond programs' 
mindset, one that also looks to bring to USAID people who have 
experience either in the private sector or working with the 
private sector, as we seek to take advantage of being the Vice 
Chair of the Board of the DFC, as we work with Treasury, for 
example, on MDB reform or evolution, to try to get more out of 
those institutions to manage, for example, agricultural 
resilience, climate resilience and the like, that USAID really 
needs to build out its capacity in this domain, and we have 
taken modest steps.
    With your support, we created this year, an EDGE Fund which 
is just $50 million, $50 million is a lot of money, but I think 
we could do a lot more in that space. EDGE is, the idea is that 
instead of looking to the private sector to do philanthropic or 
corporate social responsibility work, we are actually thinking: 
What is their comparative advantage?
    You know, are they, in fact, a bank that could provide 
microfinance to a young female smallholder farmer? Is it a 
tourism business that might go to a very underdeveloped area 
where indigenous people are living and where development gains 
are very far behind elsewhere in the country?
    But they are a little nervous that it won't be productive, 
so maybe USAID can work with that tourism operator to do the 
assessment to show that, in fact, that investment will be 
worthwhile. So modest infusions of resources in order to de-
risk, in order to provide loan guarantees, in order to do 
assessments that private sector actors that--where the barriers 
to entry may be ones that weaken lower, in essence.
    So I think this is a really exciting area for us to go, it 
is also again, probably the most aligned with where the United 
States is interested in advancing its standing, as well as it 
is stability and prosperity, it is what we are hearing the most 
about. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. I am about to run out of time, apparently. 
So I am just going to pose a second question. We will come back 
to it. I suspect others will be interested in the same topic.
    If what we hear in country after country is: we welcome 
U.S. investment, we welcome U.S. companies, we want help 
transforming our economy--the agriculture sector is one that is 
particularly critical, particularly in Africa. There is a huge 
amount of potential for future growth, but in many countries 
they are net food importers. You are requesting a significant 
amount, again for humanitarian aid, there are hundreds of 
millions of people knocking on famine's door.
    I am interested in talking at some point about Feed the 
Future, and how we strengthen its resiliency, and its Ag system 
transformation capabilities. And in Food for Peace which is 
going to be part of the Farm Bill, we have other folks who I 
suspect are also interested in the topic. But in general, I 
want us to, by the end of this hearing have had a conversation 
about the future of Feed the Future.
    I am going to defer now to my Vice Chair--the Vice Chair of 
the Full Committee, and my Ranking for this hearing, Senator 
Collins.
    Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to return to the issue I mentioned in my opening 
statement about the fact that millions of lives are 
unnecessarily lost each year, globally, due to preventable 
maternal and child deaths. While progress has been made in 
reducing maternal mortality rates, recent data suggests that 
these improvements are slowing.
    In response, the Chairman and I, in the last Congress, 
introduced the REACH Act, the Reach Every Mother and Child Act. 
We are going to be, shortly, reintroducing that bipartisan 
bill. It proposes critical reforms to increase the 
effectiveness and impact of USAID's maternal and child survival 
programs.
    It would require a clear, coordinated, government-wide 
strategy for ending these preventable deaths and ensuring that 
USAID focuses quickly on scaling up the highest impact, 
evidence-based interventions. I mentioned three of those: clean 
birthing practices, vaccines, and nutritional supplements. The 
bill would also require the appointment of a maternal and child 
health coordinator.
    My question is: Do you support those goals? Do you think 
legislation along the lines of the REACH Act would be helpful?
    Ms. Power. Thank you, Senator. Let me add to just something 
I said in my opening comment about debt, and the devastating 
effects of debt, just with one statistic. African countries are 
going to spend $70 billion in debt service payments this year, 
which is more than the total that they will receive in 
development assistance.
    Which, why do I mention that in the context of your 
question? That is not a non sequitur. It means that, again, 
these health systems that have been decimated by COVID, it is 
precisely on areas like maternal and child health, that we see 
that their inability now, to have the budget space to restore 
those systems, or to make more substantial investments, it is 
precisely on areas like maternal and child health where we see 
the effects on lives lost.
    In the fiscal year 2024 request, there is $910 million 
included specifically for cost-effective and proven life-saving 
interventions to strengthen delivery systems, to accelerate the 
reduction of maternal newborn and child health. This, unlike 
some areas in development, is a very gratifying one to work in 
because you really see the impact. We know what works. Your 
bill, I think speaks to much of this. It is a question of 
resourcing those investments, scaling them, getting to the 
``Last Mile'', and to more remote areas.
    I think the bill, we are very grateful to you for your 
leadership in this domain; thankful, not only for your 
introducing this legislation, but your whole career of really 
being emphasizing maternal, and child survival.
    Our Bureau for Global Health is looking at the bill. We 
think it is broadly aligned with our efforts. We are taking a 
close look at the idea of the coordinator position, sometimes 
we can layer our efforts in a way that actually slows us down, 
but we would love to just work with you and your staff to see 
this through. And you know, anything we do that deepens our 
work in a domain where we know, dollar-for-dollar that we can 
save lives in this way, is very worthwhile. So thank you.
    Senator Collins. Thank you. Turning to Afghanistan, since 
the United States' disastrous withdrawal, and the Taliban 
takeover in August of 2021, the United States has provided 
Afghanistan with an estimated $1 billion in humanitarian 
assistance through international organizations and to aid 
implementers.
    The President's budget request includes a total of $143 
million for health, education, and demining programs for 
Afghanistan. My concern is this: is that money really going to 
get to women and children?
    Senator Shaheen, Senator Ernst, and I, went to the U.N. 
shortly after the Taliban prohibited education for girls past 
the sixth grade, and believe it or not, one of the officials we 
met with said that she was shocked, shocked that the Taliban 
broke its promise. How anyone could be shocked that the Taliban 
resumed its extraordinary harsh measures against children, and 
against girls and women, is beyond me.
    But it has gotten worse since then. The Taliban issued an 
edict last year to prohibit women's participation in the 
delivery of assistance in Afghanistan, and last week took a 
step further by saying that female Afghan staffers employed 
with the U.N. can no longer report for work.
    What does all this mean for the delivery of assistance to 
women and girls in Afghanistan? Are we really going to be able 
to reach them?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, obviously our assistance 
posture in Afghanistan is radically different today, even 
before these edicts, it was radically different than it was 
when the Ghani government ran large parts of the country, or 
controlled large parts of the country.
    So we have moved, you know, much more into an emergency 
assistance posture. We are still the largest humanitarian 
donor, you know, especially with all of the investments that 
the American people, and American soldiers, and others have 
made over the years, not wanting to see full-scale famine in 
Afghanistan was a major objective of ours over the course of 
last year, and we have had broad support up here for that.
    We have worked through international partners so that the 
benefits do not accrue to the Taliban, and that the resource--
the food, particularly, goes directly to the Afghan people. But 
that is not--really, the direction of your question is on 
educational gains, on health. I think what we see with these 
edicts, it is just how unbelievably counterproductive they are, 
particularly in the health sector.
    So many of the partners that USAID and the U.S. Government 
support, rely on women to be providing health services, that is 
actually required because of Taliban laws, and so when you then 
say health--you know, females can't be health workers, what 
does that mean for health services altogether.
    So I will say this. We are in the health sector, working 
where women are still able to serve their clientele, 
enforcement and implementation of these edicts has been uneven 
across the country, so there are still provinces where we have 
been able to maintain our programs but a number of our partners 
have suspended programs because, again, they don't work without 
women actually being able to do--to perform those services.
    In the education area it is even more tortured, but we are 
ramping up our online programs for girls who are not able to 
attend school in person, and I do think that can be a major 
growth area for USAID over time.
    Senator Collins. Thank you.
    Ms. Power. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Vice Chair Collins.
    Senator Merkley.
    Senator Merkley. Thank you. And welcome to you 
Administrator Power. And thank you for your assistance in 
lobbying for us to complete a trip to look at USAID programs in 
Vietnam and in Indonesia. The delegation had a powerful 
experience and I will ask a couple questions related to that.
    In Vietnam we really wanted to reinforce support for the 
Leahy programs to heal the wounds of war. And in the 
President's budget, it has a $197 million, potentially, to be 
used for remediation of dioxin. And this would really be the 
Bien Hoa Base, where there is a huge hotspot, and it is a 
massive, massive cleanup effort. And if anyone has seen the 
pictures of the mountains of barrels of Agent Orange, and how 
they leaked into the land there, would understand the 
importance of this.
    And also when we have a program for children with 
disabilities that stemmed from dioxin effects, and it is a 
moral responsibility, it is a big program. But also, later in 
the President's budget, it says that there will be $20 million 
for dioxin remediation, and it is a little confusing. Is the 
President's team planning to or proposing that we allocate $197 
million? Or proposing that we are allocating $20 million?
    Ms. Power. I would have to get back to you on those two----
    Senator Merkley. Okay. We will follow up.
    Ms. Power [continuing]. Line items in the Excel sheet, but 
certainly our investments are much more substantial than $20 
million, I mean, given that the air base that you and I both 
visited, the part that we have remediated, is a very small part 
of what we intend to remediate, we are bringing in very heavy 
machinery, it is a multi-year effort.
    So I think it is the first number, but maybe it is a 
combination. But we will get back to you.
    Senator Merkley. I really salute the administration's 
commitment to those--to the four programs: So one is the dioxin 
cleanup, one is the disabilities with children, and a third is 
continuing the demining, and the fourth is the Wartime 
Accounting Initiative, in which we bring the best data 
management and the best DNA analysis to help return martyrs to 
Vietnamese families.
    These four programs are so deeply valued in Vietnam and 
they have created a foundation for a relationship where we work 
on many other missions--other economic missions, and so forth, 
so, well done.
    It is exciting, as someone who grew up during the Vietnam 
War, to see the positive relationship that we now have with 
Vietnam, and hoping to build on that.
    I want to turn to Indonesia, the palm oil plantations and 
the coal companies are engaging in pretty steady deforestation. 
The Government doesn't really like to talk about that, and 
tells us not to worry, but there is iconic species there, 
including our very close cousins, the orangutans. And they 
could be a powerful economic development instrument for 
Indonesia, in terms of drawing the world to visit these 
amazing, amazing creatures, and ensuring that they are saved.
    And so I just want to encourage USAID who is trying to 
negotiate with Indonesian Government to secure more support for 
those programs. It has been a tough negotiation. I am hoping 
that it can be completed.
    But I want to turn to a different piece, which is the 
USAID's Climate Strategy says it seeks to promote a safe and 
secure political environment for indigenous peoples, human 
rights, and environmental defenders. We have seen more and more 
environmental defenders slaughtered across the globe, 1,733 
environmental defenders killed in the last decade.
    And how do we actually weigh in, in a positive way, to 
enhance safety for environmental defenders?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. And just on your first point about 
the orangutan in Indonesia. I mean, this is something USA tries 
to do in every country. If we see, and do a market analysis 
about tourism potential, particularly as a way of diversifying 
economies that are often dependent on particular commodities, 
or resources, or services, we leap, and I think that you have 
given a great example of that.
    I think we are working on the MOU with the Ministry, I 
think that you all might have met with on your trip. It is not 
there yet. It has been a little bit bureaucratic and a little 
bit slower than it should be, given the opportunity and the 
need to conserve that population. But we are on it.
    On environmental defenders, couldn't agree more. The trend 
lines are devastating. I think, as you see, the environmental 
movement gain even more traction, globally, and more and more 
people want to defend the land, want to conserve nature; that 
poses a threat to people who are often well armed, and well 
resourced in their own right.
    All I can really say is that, depending on the country, we 
sometimes have dedicated Human Rights Defender funds under 
which environmental defenders would fall, because sometimes it 
is not just physical threats, but also legal injunctions, and 
so forth.
    Our diplomacy here is key, the work that INL does with 
court systems, often in partnership with USAID is key, when you 
have judicial integrity, when you have legal systems that work, 
then that is when you actually see a deterrent to this kind of 
vigilante violence against people who are standing up for 
nature. But needless to say, again, the rule of law in so many 
of the countries in which we work lags far behind what it needs 
to be. And so those environmental defenders are taking their 
lives into their own hands in some cases, and there is not the 
punishment and the accountability that is needed for them to 
feel security in many countries in the work that they do. And 
that is also true in this hemisphere, obviously in Brazil, in 
Central America, and beyond.
    Senator Merkley. I have submitted a request for this budget 
to include some dedicated funds for supporting folks who 
advocate for, and support environmental defenders, we are just 
trying to understand better how it can be most effective.
    I have a lot of other questions. It is a big, complicated 
world, and there is a million programs USAID is involved in, 
but so I will just use my remaining seconds to note on the 
orangutan front.
    The more you know about their behavior, the more you feel 
connected to them. They spend 8 years raising their children; 
which is extraordinary in the world of animals, they have 
powerful mothering instincts. I remember the first time I saw 
an orangutan it was leaning against a wall looking up and 
holding its hand up, and spotting its baby that was just 
learning to climb, and making sure that if the baby fell she 
would catch it.
    And there have been so many powerful stories about our 
cousins, the orangutans, and we cannot be the last generation 
that sees them having a real life in real forests, and so I 
keep hoping we can work closely with Indonesia to seize that 
responsibility for the human race. And thank you for all the 
great work USAID does.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Merkley.
    Ranking Member Graham.
    Senator Graham. Thank you. I think the best thing we can do 
to help the orangutans is make sure they don't watch cable news 
to change all of their instincts. So count me in for helping 
the orangutans.
    Senator Merkley. We will pass that on to the researchers.
    Senator Graham. Very good.
    Senator Merkley. So thank you.
    Senator Graham. How many people are receiving some form of 
food assistance due to food insecurity in the world; do you 
know, Ms. Power?
    Ms. Power. At this moment I am not going to venture an 
answer to that.
    Senator Graham. Well, I have that number.
    Ms. Power. Your staff is better--better than me.
    Senator Graham. It is not a trick. There are 345.2 million 
people that participate in some food program because of food 
insecurity. That number has doubled since 2020. And I have my 
friend from Kansas next to me, and they know how to grow food 
in Kansas, for sure.
    Senator Coons and I really want to get ahead of this 
problem. Do you believe the Global Fund has been effective in 
combating AIDS and malaria?
    Ms. Power. It has been effective, sir.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Would you be willing to entertain a 
public-private partnership akin to the Global Fund for food 
security, where we bring the best and brightest minds 
throughout the world to work with our government and hopefully 
others, to increase food production? This would not be the 
World Food Program, but a more focused approach to increase 
food production in unstable regions.
    Ms. Power. I think, Senator, you and I have talked about 
this a little bit, and would love to go into a more detailed 
discussion with you. In principle, more resources, yes, in 
principle, private sector involvement at a scale that we don't 
yet see, absolutely for it.
    Senator Graham. Okay.
    Ms. Power. But if I could just--you know, we do have a 
number of multilateral funds for food that exist that Treasury 
mans.
    Senator Graham. Are they working?
    Ms. Power. Yes. I mean, here what--yes, in fact. I think 
working, but when one looks and sees so many hungry people, and 
when one looks and sees, what I think we would all agree, is an 
overweighting of resources toward emergency food assistance, 
instead of food security resilience which is what you are 
getting at.
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Ms. Power. Yes, but----
    Senator Graham. Why has it doubled since 2020?
    Ms. Power. Well, I don't think it is a question of there 
not being a global fund, there is a set of factors that depend 
on----
    Senator Graham. No. No. I am saying: Why has the problem of 
food insecurity doubled? Why are there 345 million people 
needing food assistance? That is twice what it was in 2020.
    Ms. Power. Well, first of all, there is more conflict 
happening in the world since the end of the Cold War. The 
second, we are coming out of a once-in-a-century, if not more, 
pandemic. Third, the intensity of climate shocks, and so forth, 
and our resources are not keeping up. I mean our Feed the 
Future----
    Senator Graham. That is my point.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham. What I want the Committee to understand, 
and Senator Coons has been a great partner on this, we have a 
crisis in the world that is really challenging to put your arms 
around. You know, there are more people receiving food 
assistance because they can't feed themselves than exist in the 
United States as a whole.
    It has doubled since 2020, and it is going to double again. 
So what I would like to do with Senator Coons, in a bipartisan 
fashion, is to add capability we don't have today, and tap into 
the private sector--there are so many bright minds thinking 
about how to improve crop yields in different parts of the 
world that could go to unstable regions, fragile states.
    What I want is a global food security program that has 
metrics. In 5 years how much can we increase production in 
Zambia? Just pick your own country and have a focus of where we 
can set metrics for ourselves and try to achieve them; that we 
use private-public money; and we have more flexibility, more 
like the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the U.S. 
International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), and the 
Global Fragility Act.
    The one thing I am proud of in this Committee is that we 
have put new programs on the table that are more metric based. 
Has the MCC been a successful program?
    Ms. Power. Absolutely.
    Senator Graham. The DFC?
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham. The Global Fragility Act.
    Ms. Power. We are working on it----
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Ms. Power [continuing]. Its implementation, yes.
    Senator Graham. Yes. Okay. That is right. ``We are working 
on it.'' So what this Committee has done... and I want to thank 
you for your leadership, and I want to thank everyone at 
USAID,--you are literally doing the Lord's work--and it is 
national security in another form. But in the food insecurity 
space--somebody asked Elon Musk: Would you give a billion 
dollars to the World Food Program? And he said: Will that solve 
world hunger? No.
    But I can tell Mr. Musk: If you and some of your friends 
came up with some cash, and if we created a global food 
security fund, it would make a lot of difference. We could 
conduct research at Oxford University, at the Universities of 
Kansas, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and come up with an 
approach that is focused on the most vulnerable areas, 
particularly in Africa, and set metrics and use private-public 
money--get partners throughout the world to participate--and 
drive to better food production. Does that make sense to you?
    Ms. Power. It does. If I may, though, make just a plea as 
well, for bilateral programs. You see those on your travels, in 
an age where the PRC is coming in and causing countries to 
incur future debt----
    Senator Graham. It is not exclusive, yes, we can----
    Ms. Power. But given that resources do not seem to be 
expanding at the pace of food insecurity, except in the 
emergency area.
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Ms. Power. What you are talking about is much more 
fundamental, and much more important in the long run, which is 
these investments in people's own ability to grow, unless the 
pie gets bigger, you are going to see something that is a 
global public good come at the expense, potentially, of some of 
the bilateral programs.
    Senator Graham. Right.
    Ms. Power. So that is what I would love to work with you 
on, making sure that doesn't happen.
    Senator Graham. The bottom line is that the bilateral 
approach needs to be supplemented with something new because it 
is not working. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and 
Malaria worked, right?
    Ms. Power. But look at the difference between the 
investments that the United States has made in the global 
health domain, versus those in food. If we would wish to 
increase our investments, I assure you, even bilaterally, we 
could bring about far more substantial results.
    Senator Graham. Yes. But what I am saying is----
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. I would like to leverage our 
money.
    Ms. Power. Yes, I am for leveraging it too----
    Senator Graham. And I would like the Global Fund approach--
--
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. Because it just wasn't all 
American dollars.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Graham. Contributions to the Global Fund came from 
the public sector and other countries. So what I want to do is 
create a global food security fund, modeled after the Global 
Fund, so we can get other countries helping us and helping 
people who are literally starving. We can get the private 
sector more involved, not less involved, and we can get 
outcomes that we can measure.
    So Mr. Chairman, no matter what happens the next election, 
who is in charge of this place, I want to try to get everybody 
on this Committee working together--and working with the Biden 
administration, private sector organizations, and academic 
institutions throughout the world--to establish the 
infrastructure this year or early next year for a global food 
security fund. If we don't do something, the 345 million can 
double in the next 4 or 5 years.
    Senator Coons. Thank you. If I could just respond to the 
Ranking Member; I agree with you that we need to get ahead of 
this problem, we need to strengthen productivity in the 
agricultural sector and employment in the agricultural sector. 
In the countries you and I recently visited, in Niger, in Cote 
d'Ivoire, in Botswana, South Africa, in Zambia, in particular, 
we have real potential.
    Feed the Future, which has expanded from 12 to 20 
countries, I think deserves a deep dive from us. There are 
other organizations the FAO, the World Food Program, AGRA. I 
think Feed the Future and finding a way to create a fund that 
helps incentivize agricultural transformation of systems, 
comparable to what we have accomplished through PEPFAR, are 
well worth an additional meeting, conversation, or even a 
hearing. We will see.
    Thank you, Administrator.
    Senator Van Hollen.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
    Administrator Power, great to see you. Let me start by 
thanking you your team, both in Washington and your team 
overseas, for all your good work. I know Senator Merkley 
mentioned to you our recent trip to Vietnam and Indonesia. 
Thank you for your trip, not that long ago, to Vietnam to 
reinforce our support for many of the War Legacy programs that 
Senator Leahy championed when he served on this Committee and 
in the Senate, including at Bien Hoa Air Force, and I know you 
were you were there.
    One of the things that came up in our meetings in Indonesia 
was the fact that we are trying to finalize this report to help 
assist with our biodiversity efforts, to prevent deforestation, 
which of course contributes to global climate change. And there 
was an agreement, as you know, which is being finalized. I know 
there are some issues on the Indonesian side. They did tell us 
that the agreement was also in your office awaiting your sign 
off. So I just wanted to get an update from you as to where 
that was, on our side, with respect to your sign off?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. It is in my office awaiting my sign 
off. That is my update. But nothing like a trip to Capitol Hill 
to focus the mind. So I think that it is more working through 
with the Indonesians. You know, I think there is some 
bureaucracy, and some permissions on that side. I don't think 
that we are holding it back. But I will get on this and get 
back to you.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you. Right, it wasn't clear. 
There seemed to be a dance. And we just want to make sure that 
we are doing our part. So thank you for your efforts there.
    Let me also applaud you and the Biden administration for 
your help in providing human rights and other assistance to 
folks in the West Bank in Gaza under very, very difficult 
circumstances.
    I did want to ask you about a proposed law that is being 
discussed by the new very right-wing, extreme government, 
including by some of the most extreme members of that 
government, which is to essentially apply a very big tax to 
contributions from foreign governments to NGOs. Obviously some 
of the assistance that we provide flows through NGOs.
    I just want to quote to you from a Haaretz article, as to 
the impact that it would have. I am quoting Michael Sfard, who 
is human rights lawyer, an Israeli, there saying, quote, ``If 
this section passes, it will be a fatal blow to the human 
rights community in Israel.'' And points out that similar 
measures had been taken in other countries, where the United 
States has been strongly critical of efforts of other countries 
to clamp down on these kind of NGOs that do work in civil 
society.
    Number one, are you aware of this pending proposal? And 
two, does it concern you? And if so, have you communicated your 
concerns?
    Ms. Power. Thank you, Senator. I would say a couple things. 
I mean, first I think we have seen in recent weeks just the 
vibrancy of civil society, we have seen other things as well, 
very worrying developments including an uptick, a very 
significant uptick in violence, but NGOs are a critical part of 
the fabric of that that part of the world. We have seen NGO 
laws, so-called, all around the world and, you know, these 
are--this is part of a broader phenomenon of not ``rule of 
law'', but ``rule by law''.
    And it can deter. It can make operating in a country 
financially prohibitive. NGOs in Israel have raised their 
concerns about what this would mean, along the lines of what 
you have just described. And Ambassador Nides, I know has 
engaged on this in Israel. So you know, at this point I don't 
an update on the progress or the status of those laws, but we 
very much believe that a civil society able to operate is going 
to make for a healthier and more stable democracy over time.
    Senator Van Hollen. Well, as you know, the U.S. Government, 
the Biden administration, has spoken out strongly when other 
countries attempt to pass laws that clamp down on civil 
society, including through NGOs. So I know Ambassador Nides is 
aware of this. Since a lot of our assistance flows through 
USAID, I would just ask that you also communicate your concerns 
to our counterparts in the Government of Israel. Can you do 
that?
    Ms. Power. Yes, sir.
    Senator Van Hollen. I appreciate that. Now, let me ask you 
about--I know one of our long-term objectives, and one of your 
personal objectives, has been to make more of our assistance 
accessible, equitable, and responsive, including going to local 
partners.
    More and more effort to transfer assistance to those who 
are on the ground, so that we can have a sustainable effort, so 
that at some point in time, obviously, we don't want AID to 
having to be, you know, continuing funding the same programs 
over and over, we want to build capacity of local partners.
    And I know that you have set a goal of 25 percent of 
USAID's funding going to local partners by 2025. I know it is 
an ambitious goal. I think in fiscal year 2021 it was 7 
percent, that is the baseline. So either now, or in follow-up, 
if you could just provide us with an update on how we are doing 
in achieving your goal?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. I know we don't have a lot of time. I 
would say we are, this year, going to be at 10.2 percent, that 
is a very small number compared to the 89.8 percent on the 
other side--let me not do the math--but it is 90 percent. But 
it is a 38 percent increase in investments in local 
organizations.
    You might say: Why can't we just turn a switch and change 
the way we do things? Working with USAID is hard, compliance 
with some of the requirements that come from here, that come 
from our own desire to stamp out and ensure we don't have 
fraud, waste, or abuse, requires lawyers, it requires 
infrastructure, sometimes accounting firms, contracts can run 
100-150 pages long.
    So we are trying to lower those barriers to entry, 
streamline our processes while not in any way sliding our 
compliance obligations. And so that is one of the reasons we 
have been so grateful for the staffing increases as we 
replenish our workforce, as we hire more contracting officers, 
we will have more people to work side by side, with these local 
organizations to get those numbers up toward our 25 percent 
target by 2025.
    I will also say that we have set a 50 percent target by the 
end of the decade, to be co-designing, co-evaluating, in a 
sense where, you know, even if the money isn't going directly 
to a local contracting partner or local grantee, there are 
still all kinds of ways where we can, you know, change the 
power dynamics, and really be following the lead of people who 
know best in the communities in which we work. So I want to 
keep an eye, again, on making progress in both directions.
    Senator Van Hollen. Okay. Thank you.
    Ms. Power. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.
    Administrator, at some point I am going to slip out to the 
PEPFAR hearing, that being such a significant part of the work 
that we do together, but I will return for the rest of this, if 
I can.
    Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Chairman, thank you.
    Administrator, thank you for your presence this morning; I 
would reinstitute an invitation, in fact we came close to 
having a visit together to Kansas, and I would re-up that in 
your world. We would love to show you certainly things about 
production agriculture, but Feed the Future is a significant 
component of our university system, and we would welcome you to 
our State.
    I want to highlight just a couple of things and then ask a 
question. You indicated the importance, in the conversation 
with Senator Graham, about bilateral, and you also mentioned in 
your testimony about the desire of many countries to have a 
trade agreement or trade relationship with us. I would 
encourage you within the Biden administration, to encourage the 
Biden administration to be interested in trade agreements with 
countries.
    And we are we are not negotiating around the globe, and 
that long-term relationship in an economic trading circumstance 
has significant value, and value beyond food aid, and in some 
ways value beyond sustainability within that country. So just 
an opportunity for me to use this moment to highlight, perhaps 
to my colleagues, but to whoever is listening that we need to 
negotiate around the globe, for agreements to trade with 
countries, and even in a bilateral, if not a multilateral 
fashion.
    Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine of course 
was a key supplier, and met many of the needs, particularly in 
Africa and Asia, in food supply, I wanted to check in with you 
and find out what you could tell me about the Black Sea Grain 
Initiative, and what its status is. Is Russia abiding by it? Is 
Turkey helpful? What is the United States doing?
    And in the circumstance we find ourselves in with this lack 
of Ukrainian and Russian grain, any suggestions that you would 
provide to me into the subcommittee for how we can best promote 
and encourage the opportunity for American farmers and ranchers 
to help fill that gap? And--I will leave it there. And then I 
have one follow-up.
    Ms. Power. Thank you so much. So first let me say that what 
we are--and on your first comment: that USAID is very active, 
notwithstanding maybe the absence of a Free Trade Agreement, 
there is still a lot of trade going on, both vis-a-vis the 
United States, and regionally in many of the countries we work. 
And we do think there is still a ton to do in the area of trade 
facilitation. And that is one of the components of the economic 
growth and economic development initiative that we are trying 
to spearhead at USAID.
    And I think there is also a whole set of questions about 
the enabling environment, the regulatory environment, deeper 
bureaucratization, that would make it easier, and more 
attractive for whether American agricultural companies, or 
others in the private sector to invest. And so I do think USAID 
can be doing a lot more in that domain, and that will benefit 
American businesses, including agribusinesses.
    With regard to the Black Sea Grain Initiative, you know, 
signed back in July of 2022, I would say it is a mixed picture. 
It is the fact that it has basically freed the 20- to 25 
million metric tons of grains that were backed up at that time, 
has been incredibly helpful to the other countries, like 
Somalia, Egypt, Lebanon, that are dependent on grain from 
Ukraine.
    We just have a shipment going from Ukraine, in fact I think 
it arrived yesterday, or it will arrive today, to Yemen. Just a 
reminder again of Ukraine as the breadbasket of the world. The 
fact that Putin is not only killing Ukrainians, but weaponizing 
food for developing countries, is just a complete outrage. I 
think Turkey's diplomatic role, the UN's Diplomatic role was 
pivotal. We, of course, supported it behind the scenes. The 
voices from leaders in the Global South proved pivotal with 
Putin as well. I think that pressure from the Global South.
    And you now see, as you probably know better than anybody, 
you know, cereal price is down, I think for the fifteenth 
straight month. And you know, that there are many factors to 
that, but certainly getting more grain on the open market is 
going to be better for food inflation, writ large.
    Right now, Russia is saying that it only agreed to a 60-day 
extension, they are saying that publicly. We are hopeful that 
the agreement will proceed, as it is meant to, there really 
should be an infinite extension that should not be time bound. 
This is about food that needs to get to Hungry people all 
around the world.
    The last thing I would say, Senator, is USAID launched 
something called AGRI-Ukraine, that I am incredibly proud of, 
which is basically about expanding storage capacity, getting 
seeds to farmers, getting micro loans to farmers to replace 
equipment that might have been destroyed, but also enhancing 
use of rail, road, the Danube, to also be more diversified in 
terms of exports, and the means of export.
    So it isn't at all a solution, because the Black Sea is 
where material and commodities move at scale. But I do think, 
you know, on the--at the end of this war, Ukraine is going to 
end up much more integrated by road, rail, and river, than it 
would have been, had Putin not put in place this blockade. So 
this idea of building back better and greater resilience in the 
long term, I think is very important.
    Senator Moran. That raises--that at least reminds me of 
my--the most recent visit to Poland to take a look at Ukraine, 
and the Ukrainian plea was for support of infrastructure to get 
grain moving in other directions as you, I think, are 
describing. And secondly, the need for diesel fuel to get their 
equipment to be able to operate in to plant, and to harvest.
    And I don't know whether USAID is involved in assisting in 
the actual production and harvesting of crops in Ukraine, but 
you are shaking your head, yes, and it is encouraging.
    The final point I would make is, we have a new Ambassador, 
Ambassador McCain to the World Food Program. We wish Ambassador 
Beasley well, who I think did an exceptionally fine and 
wonderful job, a great human being. Is there anything that is 
changing in the relationship between USAID and the World Food 
Program, as a result in the change of leadership?
    Ms. Power. USAID is WFP's largest funder, thanks to you we 
are--I have already been in touch with Cindy last week and will 
again this week. Tragically, three WFP aid workers were 
murdered in Sudan with the latest outbreak of violence. And, 
you know, we look forward to having just the kind of 
relationship we had with Ambassador McCain as we did with 
Executive Director Beasley.
    I don't think we can say enough about the job that he did. 
Senator Graham mentioned the doubling of hungry people just in 
the last couple years. Well, this Congress stepped up, 
heroically, with these Ukraine supplementals and with the 
flexibility in those supplementals to be able to reach people 
in sub-Saharan Africa. Anybody who was indirectly affected by 
the Ukraine War, we were able to use some of those supplemental 
resources to reach.
    And I just, you know, will remain permanently grateful, 
forevermore, to David Beasley for his--for the relationships he 
built up here, the advocacy, and the partnership that we had, 
and we expect it to be just as strong with Ambassador McCain. 
Thank you.
    Senator Moran. We share that view of Ambassador Beasley, 
and we hope that is exactly the same with Ambassador McCain.
    Ms. Power. Should be, yes.
    Senator Moran. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Power. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Moran.
    And I will join those comments. I just had a chance to be 
with David Beasley, along with the Vice Chair, the group of us 
who spent last week looking at food security--this is a 
daunting prospect this year, humanitarian relief, sustaining it 
is going to be challenging, and then improving food systems to 
meet these needs. So I look forward to working with you, 
Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Related and not lengthy, is the drought 
situation across the grain producing portions of the United 
States of America. We have tremendous challenges. A farmer 
yesterday in the office: one-tenth of one-inch of rain in the 
last 223 days. And it is not just isolated, it is broad, and it 
has another consequence to our ability to feed the world.
    Senator Coons. We do have real challenges. I look forward 
to working with you on them.
    Senator Schatz. And I will return after going to the PEPFAR 
Hearing.
    Senator Schatz. Thank you, Chair Coons.
    Administrator Power, thank you for being here; thank you 
for your good work; I am glad to see more foreign assistance 
invested in the Pacific Islands, and look forward to hearing 
about the work that you plan to do with the larger program 
budget and more U.S. Government facilities in the region.
    But I do notice that the administration's roughly $80-
million fiscal year 2024 request for the Pacific Islands is far 
short of the appropriated amount from fiscal year 2023. Why did 
you request so much less than we appropriated in the last 
fiscal year?
    Ms. Power. Well, I mean certainly the direction that the 
President has sent is: more, more, more. We are trying to 
leverage our resources given the scarcity, globally, and given, 
you know, just what was just described in terms of drought, and 
in the case of the Pacific, of course, it is flooding and 
extreme weather events, more than drought. So we are opening up 
a mission in Fiji, reopening a mission in September probably. 
We are surging our staff presence in Papua New Guinea.
    And we have programs like the Climate Ready Program which, 
basically, allows us to help those countries apply, for 
example, for Green Climate Fund money, work with the DFC, and 
the MDBs, and others. So my understanding of our requests, as 
it relates to the Pacific is that it is more substantial than 
what you have just described, more than $122 million.
    But it may be that I am combining our climate requests, and 
that some of the money is coming into that rather than just our 
bilateral, but coming together, certainly we are going to end 
up with a much more--with, I think it is a 40 percent increase 
from where we were a year ago.
    Senator Schatz. So is it 80, or is it 100 or----
    Ms. Power. I will have to get back to you. I am not 
familiar with that number, but it may be again, that we are 
amalgamating our climate investments----
    Senator Schatz. Yes. And as you know, I am all for climate 
spending.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. But helping people to apply for other money 
is a little bit different. I guess the question I have is: Is 
this just a question of finite resources available for a very 
challenging program, or are there problems with the ability of 
our Pacific Island friends and neighbors to expend the money 
responsibly; is that the issue?
    Ms. Power. As you know, that we work through implementing 
partners in the countries in which we work, so partly, it is 
that you can't go from 0 to 60, or from, you know, 30 to 120 
overnight. But you know, we also need the--we are building the 
staff on the ground. A lot of the Pacific Island countries, 
USAID doesn't have any presence at all, so we have to hire 
local staff, Foreign Service Nationals, at the very least, 
which we are in the process of doing. We manage all these 
programs right now out of the Philippines. So some of it is 
that it is--you know, it is not going to be----
    Senator Schatz. Throughput capacity problem?
    Ms. Power. Yes. The human capacity, but I wouldn't diminish 
the climate-ready approach, because I think that is why we are 
working with Australia, and New Zealand, Japan, other countries 
that are also surging investments, because if we can build out 
the capacity of the governments themselves, there are 
resources, at scale, available, there are private-sector 
partnerships, available, but without that staffing capacity, or 
human capacity, that ability to put forward a bankable project 
or a bankable deal, these countries are not going to be able to 
compete.
    Senator Schatz. Right.
    Ms. Power. So I actually think that program is very 
important.
    Senator Schatz. Let me move to telehealth; and I have a 
rather complicated question, but I am going to simplify it for 
you. What is going on with telehealth? You and I have had 
multiple conversations about telehealth, there is not a mention 
of it in your budget testimony, which I yes I am not trying to 
``gotcha you'' here.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. But I would like to be reassured that we 
are moving forward. And I do, I am deeply sympathetic to the 
idea that you wake up every morning and telehealth sounds like 
a longer lead time item, a less urgent item than the 350-odd 
million people who are experiencing food insecurity. So I get 
that.
    However, we have seen a revolution in telehealth that that 
really does leverage the Federal taxpayer dollar, as well as 
private sector resources, and it seems to me in far-flung, 
places you can really provide high quality care for a lower 
cost, if we make the investment, and it is sort of never the 
right time to do these investments because there is always 
something more urgent on deck.
    So can you just sort of tell me where we are with 
telehealth, and how you sort out the immediate and urgent 
versus the long term, and sort of theoretically smart thing to 
do.
    Ms. Power. Yes.
    Senator Schatz. But given your day-to-day, it sort of--it 
may get pushed off your calendar every week.
    Ms. Power. Thank you. I think the last time we had an 
exchange on this, I pivoted a little bit to talking about 
health workers, and investments in health workers, and that 
seemed unresponsive I gather. But part of what is true about 
USAID's work in the global health area is that by virtue of 
earmarks, we are disease-based, by and large, in our 
orientation.
    That is we have our PEPFAR allocation, we have our HIV/AIDS 
allocation, we have our TB allocation, we have our malaria 
allocation, we have our Global Health Security, mercifully, 
that has gone up in terms of pandemic preparedness. So what we 
need to do is we need to integrate attention to telehealth 
across these kinds of programs, and that is what Atul Gawande, 
you know, again where appropriate, who is our Global Health 
leader at USAID, is working to do.
    But as well, we are shifting in order to have more of an 
emphasis on primary health systems, including healthcare worker 
training, who are the foundation for all of this. Now, to be 
more responsive, let me say that I will give you a couple 
examples of things that we are actually doing in telemedicine 
already. In the Middle East and North Africa we have just 
launched a program where, in circumstances where stigmatized 
populations may not feel comfortable coming into a health 
facility, we are piloting our program, for example, for LGBTQI+ 
individuals who might be stigmatized to be able to secure 
online health care, or online consultation. It is just a pilot. 
It is not at scale. We are not there yet.
    Second, in order to do digital health, you know, a lot of 
the areas we work are super remote, don't have 5G, don't have 
the--you know, everyone has a smartphone, or a cell phone at 
the very least, but we also have what is called the digital--
USAID's Digital Health Vision, which is creating digital 
health-enabling environments that are kind of a precursor for 
being in a position to actually have health workers care for 
patients, or at least consult with patients online.
    So I hope, next time I see you at a hearing, that I will 
have more to report, but I think mainstreaming this through 
our, what amounts to, again, highly earmarked disease-based, 
very important life-saving programming is where we need to take 
this next.
    Senator Schatz. Yes. I understand this is hard, but the one 
thing I would add for your--or the people who run these various 
programs is, they don't actually have to invent or curate 
something brand new now, telehealth is all across the country, 
all across the planet. Hospital systems are doing it, 
healthcare systems are doing it. And so they don't need to 
invent anything at all, they just need to adopt what is already 
occurring, and systems, and software, and training, already 
exists for telehealth, so it is no longer a mystery on how to 
integrate it into an existing program. And that is what we are 
going to need to do. Thank you.
    Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Senator Schatz.
    And welcome, Ambassador, it is good to see you again. A 
couple of points to cover with you today, Ambassador Power; 
first, I would like to just start out with a point of concern 
that I have regarding USAID funding to Palestinian 
organizations that foment hate, that celebrate terrorism, and I 
would like to come back to a GAO report, that in March 2021, 
found significant gaps in USAID's counterterrorism vetting of 
Palestinian groups.
    USAID agreed with the report's recommendation, and agreed 
to address the shortcomings there. I just wanted to ask you: 
what steps you have taken to implement the GAO's 
recommendations, and to ensure that USAID funds don't go to 
support the activity of Palestinian terrorist groups, or anti-
Semitic organizations?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, we take very seriously our 
stewardship of taxpayer resources, and the generous allocations 
that you all have made to USAID. We have very elaborate vetting 
systems in place, including working with an FBI-run terrorism 
center to run through all the databases to make sure no 
connection between the organizations that we are considering 
funding and, you know, terrorism or terrorists.
    You know, I think if you have something specific in mind, 
which it sounds like you might, happy to talk about it 
specifically.
    In terms of additional measures put in place we now, as you 
know, USAID often works through a contractor, and then a 
subcontractor, and sometimes there is a sub to the sub. In this 
region we also run our subs to the subs, you know, through this 
third layer of verification to make sure, again, no extremist 
or terrorist affiliation.
    Senator Hagerty. I do think we can do better. I have got a 
couple of examples I would like to share with you and perhaps 
we can get them addressed. USAID has awarded a grant to a 
Palestinian group, whose leaders have attended an anniversary 
event celebrating the founding of a terrorist group. USAID has 
ordered a grant to a Palestinian group whose leaders praised 
the murderer of the U.S. Military attache, called that 
murderer, ``a hero fighter''. We are funding them.
    USAID has awarded a grant to a Palestinian group whose 
Board Members have publicly lauded convicted terrorists as 
heroes, and applauded the missile attacks on Israel by Hamas. 
Again, these are areas where I can't imagine you would be 
supportive of it, but I hope that we can take a deeper dive and 
a more critical look.
    Ms. Power. Let me just get on the record in condemning and 
deploring comments, and actions like that in the strongest 
terms. And if you, again, could come back to us and we could 
talk about this in detail. I can describe our system in detail, 
walk you through the process, and then we can talk about those 
specific organizations and what might be afoot.
    Senator Hagerty. Yes. It is the vetting process that I am 
concerned about. I feel like the vetting process remains 
seriously flawed. A couple of other activities that, November 
2022, USAID announced a $78,000 grant to a Palestinian activist 
group, it is called the Community Development and Continuing 
Education Institute. Their leaders have done all the things 
that we talked about just a moment ago.
    Terrorist glorification of USAID-funded Palestinian 
institutions at schools, and other organizations, it is just, 
it is happening, and it needs to come to an end. And I 
appreciate your focus on that. Specifically, Section 7039(b) of 
the annual SFOPS Appropriations, all mandates that USAID take 
appropriate steps to ensure that foreign assistance is not 
provided to any individual or entity that has a principal 
officer who has advocated for terrorism. So it is happening, 
and I think there are opportunities to do better here.
    And let us turn now, to the broader approach that AID takes 
to development. In my view, I think we really need to talk 
about getting back to basics. I have traveled and visited with 
leaders in developing countries. They are struggling 
significantly right now to overcome the impact of the COVID-19 
shutdowns. Their economies are struggling, crime is through the 
roof in many of these countries, they are seriously challenged.
    And as I ask myself: What are we doing to alleviate global 
poverty, particularly in these situations? What are we doing to 
put these countries on a pathway to some sort of sustainable 
economic growth? I see a real disconnect between what I feel 
like these countries need, and what we are doing.
    And what I would like to refer to is this Climate Strategy 
Program that has been put out by USAID. It seems to be matters 
that are focused on issues that are not the priorities of these 
countries. I think about the best and highest use of our 
taxpayer dollars to help these countries where they are today.
    And I find myself really scratching my head about what this 
document calls for. We specifically have included in this 
document using U.S. taxpayers to address--I am going to use a 
few quotes here, ``The growing importance of young people 
suffering from eco-anxiety.'' And I just wondered, if you 
support using U.S. taxpayer funds to alleviate climate anxiety 
among foreign children activists.
    Ms. Power. Well, first let me say that--I am not sure if 
you were here when we had--I had with Chairman Coons, an 
exchange about the demand signal we get from other countries 
around economic growth and economic development, including 
agricultural development, which you and I have talked about in 
the past.
    Senator Hagerty. Mm-hmm.
    Ms. Power. That and climate adaptation resourcing are the 
number one and number two asks, often in competition with each 
other, and often related since economies around the world are 
being so threatened, and in some cases decimated, including 
agricultural economies, by extreme weather events, along the 
lines of what Senator Moran was talking about here in the 
United States.
    Senator Hagerty. Climate anxiety by children though. I 
mean, I am trying to get to the best----
    Ms. Power. Well, I mean, we are not talking about--we are 
not talking about, yes, first of all the balance of our 
resources goes, for example, to help health clinics get 
electrified in places where they are getting to leapfrog other 
forms of energy. We are talking about, again, adaptation, 
climate adaptation, seeds that are drought resistant, drip 
irrigation systems that can work in light of. So the lion's 
share of our funding, again, is going to help countries adapt. 
And the demand signals are coming from them.
    Senator Hagerty. And to, because I am running out of time--
--
    Ms. Power. If I may, just on--just because you talked about 
that single program; if I may say, again, the investment in 
something like that would be extremely modest, but we are not--
this threat is existential for many of the communities in which 
we are working. So it actually is the case that when 
pastoralists can no longer raise livestock, we are seeing 
massive spikes in suicide, if you can believe it. In those 
families, in the Horn of Africa, 9 million livestock have died. 
What do those pastoralists do, who have been doing that for 
generations?
    Senator Hagerty. My suggestion is, we focus on how we help 
the pastoralists directly, rather than trying----
    Ms. Power. Well, I think we----
    Senator Hagerty [continuing]. To fight this with some 
psychiatric program.
    Ms. Power [continuing]. Well, we also don't want them to 
commit suicide in the meantime.
    Senator Hagerty. Absolutely, we don't want them to do that, 
but focus on the basics.
    Ms. Power. Right. So actually, working with communities who 
are suffering life and death consequences of climate change, it 
matters to us, in the same way that life and death food 
insecurity matters to us.
    Senator Hagerty. Children anxiety programs over climate 
anxiety, I just don't get the connection between the basic 
fundamental platform--the bottom part of Maslow's hierarchy of 
needs, is trying to be addressed here. That is what we should 
be focused on.
    Ms. Power. We are very active----
    Senator Hagerty. How could the best----
    Ms. Power [continuing]. At the bottom as well.
    Senator Hagerty [continuing]. Way to use taxpayers' funds 
be on providing programs like this. And when we have a void 
China steps in to fill that void, Ambassador. We need to be in 
the game, we need to be looking at the basic needs. That is 
what I am encouraging you to do.
    Ms. Power. Understood. Thank you.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Administrator Power.
    Senator Shaheen.
    Senator Shaheen. Thank you, Administrator, so nice to have 
you here. Thank you for what you; and everyone at USAID--does 
on a daily basis to help people around the world.
    I just returned from a trip, with a number of other 
senators, to Panama, Colombia, Argentina, and Brazil. One of 
the things we were trying to assess is the Chinese influence in 
that region. We heard a lot of concerns, in Panama 
particularly, about migrants, and the Darien Gap, in Colombia 
about refugees from Venezuela. But can you speak to how--what 
USAID does, helps to counter that Chinese influence in the 
region. And do you have any specific examples in those four 
countries that you think we should particularly be aware of?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, let me say that as is happening 
in many parts of the world, there is a fair amount of buyer's 
remorse that is growing as well, in our own hemisphere.
    Senator Shaheen. We have heard that.
    Ms. Power. I am sure you did hear that. And there is 
actually a barometer survey, a Latin American survey that shows 
that trust, in fact, in the PRC has dropped 20 percent in the 
last decade, and is below 38 percent last year; trust in the 
U.S. has gone up actually, comparably, 20 percent, up to 57 
percent, according to the latest survey, and we will get more 
data on that.
    I think that stems from--those numbers stem from the fact 
that our objective, as USAID, is to help countries work 
themselves out of an assistance relationship, and out of any 
dependence, our investments are people-to-people investments, 
they are about working with, for example, those Venezuelan 
refugees or migrants in Colombia to help both them and the 
Colombian communities who host them, get access to livelihoods.
    There is no faking that, you know, whether you actually 
care about the communities, whether you are in the communities, 
in northern Central America, working with women who have been 
subjected to gender-based violence at the community level, 
working with youth who are at risk of being recruited into 
gangs at the community level.
    So just the contrast I think between these large 
infrastructure investments which can matter, of course, 
provision of infrastructure is very important. The United 
States Government is going to be doing more and more of that 
with the DFC, and millennium--multilateral development banks, 
and others.
    But it is these investments in dignity, in independence, in 
the environment in a non-extractive approach. And of course, in 
a climate-smart approach, given that that is what the 
communities most need, given the changing elements. You know, I 
think all of these points of distinction really register with 
communities. And we are trying to ensure that jobs get created 
for the communities in which we work, rather than bringing in 
our own workers in, you know, kind of development bubbles along 
the lines of what our competitors are doing.
    Senator Shaheen. Well, certainly, I think South America 
offers a tremendous opportunity for us, and it is a place where 
we should pay more attention in the future than we have in 
recent past. So I am pleased to hear that that is an area of 
focus for USAID.
    Last spring, Senator Murphy, Tillis, and I, were in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, and we visited one of the USAID development 
efforts with a small business, and saw the impact that that was 
having. We also heard about corruption, and good governance, 
and the issues that they present for the people of--not only 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, but the entire region.
    So can you talk about what USAID is doing to address 
corruption, and good governance, particularly in the Western 
Balkans?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, USAID has done an awful lot in 
the independent media sector over the years as you know. Again 
thanks, in part, to your support. That work has now shifted a 
little bit, also to an effort to really dig in on media 
viability, because again we want these independent newspapers 
like Oslobodenje, or whomever, to be viable in a digital age.
    So working with them, and they are the leading exposures, 
often, of corruption, not just that newspaper, but many of the 
others that USAID has supported, similarly, civil society 
organizations. But the heartbreaking aspect, as you know, of 
the situation--there are many, many heartbreaking aspects in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina--but is the poor governance, and 
paralyzed governance, and governance in which individuals look 
out more for themselves, and more for self-dealing than they do 
for the young people in the country who continue to flee in 
droves.
    And here, I think we have shifted in the last year or two 
toward looking to see whether there is more to be done, less at 
the central or Federation level, and more at the local level. 
You know, working with auditors, working with prosecutors, 
working in fact with clean governments that, you know, 
themselves are putting in place checks and balance--checks and 
balances are responsive to them.
    So it is sad in a way that one has to forum shop to find 
willing partners, but I do think we have made progress; and I 
will commend, also, the State Department and Treasury because I 
think the sanctions designations taking advantage of the 
corruption prong, of the Magnitsky Sanctions, and other 
mechanisms. But those have made a real difference, I think, in 
deterring this kind of conduct.
    Senator Shaheen. I certainly agree, and I hope we will 
continue to stay focused on other areas where--on individuals 
where sanctions can help make a difference.
    Finally, I wanted to ask you about Women, Peace and 
Security because that makes it a priority, legislation to 
protect and support women's roles in peace negotiations, and 
conflict resolution. And I know that this is something that 
USAID is still implementing. What else do you need in order to 
successfully implement that legislation, and how do you see 
that helping with the work that you are doing?
    Ms. Power. Thank you. Well, I think, or the budget request 
includes $16 million in order to help implement the Women, 
Peace and Security Plan and its modalities around the world, 
but if you actually, you know, look more broadly at Women, 
Peace and Security, broadly, define less about the plan, per 
se, but are programs that are responsive.
    I think we are, you know, spending somewhere around $250 
million in, I think, we have 80,000 females that we have 
brought into mediation roles, peace building roles, you know, 
through that programming. It is also something I again credit 
the State Department and DOD.
    Now, really pushing that the results remain elusive in many 
domains, but as a design feature of any negotiation for women 
to be involved, you know, we are both heartbroken by events in 
Sudan. Those discussions, again, pushing even now for women to 
be involved in discussing, first the ceasefire, and then the 
longer term transition.
    So just whenever something unfolds, you know, it isn't just 
a program that lives over here, it has to be a design feature 
of our diplomacy, and our engagement. And I think that is at 
least what we are trying to put in place.
    Senator Shaheen. Good. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Coons. Thank you, Senator Shaheen, and thank you 
Administrator. I am going to go question at the end of the 
PEPFAR hearing. So I may or may not return.
    Senator Murphy, to you. And if I don't return before you 
conclude questioning, if you would close out the hearing I 
would appreciate it.
    Senator Murphy. Will do. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Good to see you, Administrator. Administrator Power, I 
wanted to turn your attention to Tunisia, a small country in 
North Africa, but one that has had outsized attention, and 
importance given the fact that it was one of the few relative 
democratic success stories coming out of the Arab Spring. I 
have a specific question, and then a more general question.
    The specific one is this. The budget suggests preserving, 
military aid for Tunisia, but also a pretty dramatic cut to 
economic aid and to--aid to civil society groups. That is 
worrying, because as you know, this is a moment of real crisis 
in Tunisia. President Saied has turned his back on democratic 
norms, has engaged in a pretty repressive and overwhelming 
crackdown on dissent.
    And this seems like a moment where it would be important 
for us to send a signal to civil society that we are, you know, 
going to increase our support for their work, not decrease it. 
And so I wondered if, just on the specific question of how we 
look at our aid budget, trying to help give some oxygen to 
those that are trying to fight back against this slide away 
from democracy in Tunisia, how this budget is going to do that? 
And why we envision a cut to civil society money for Tunisia?
    Ms. Power. Well, I think the 2024 request is for $14.5 
million, but that is a lower number, in part, again because so 
many of the avenues in which we were engaging, the government 
at least, 2 years ago, have been for foreclosed by the actions 
by the government. So I would want to dig into whether or not 
your premise is right about actual cuts to civil society. I 
would certainly agree with you that even when governments are 
backsliding, that that can become cause just to shift resources 
from what you might have wished to do with a judicial body, or 
with a ministry, you know, to make sure that accountability, 
you know, doesn't suffer as well. Or at least doesn't suffer a 
shortage of resources, it is certainly suffering.
    The other thing I would note, Senator, is that for the 
first time this administration is coming forward with a 
proposal for an ``Opportunity Fund for the Middle East and 
North Africa.'' I don't know if that caught your attention. I 
think it is a $90-million fund, and the idea there is to be 
more opportunistic. Again we don't see right now, the 
likelihood of a democratic opening, or reverse of the 
backsliding in Tunisia; but if that were to happen, to be in a 
position to draw from that fund to meet the moment, whether 
through support for civil society, or for the government.
    But let me get back to you on the specifics of what the cut 
from the $22.5 million fiscal year 2022 level, to a $14.5 
million request, sort of what the modalities of that would be.
    Senator Murphy. Yes. Listen I worry that--I think you are 
right, some of it was driven by a lack of avenue. You have got 
a Minister of Interior who, you know, is working hand in hand 
with Saied's crackdown. But I worry that this is kind of an 
excuse to not get thoughtful and creative about how to find 
avenues to support civil society, and look forward to hearing 
back.
    Here is my more general question. You know, I have been a 
critic of continuing the level of aid to Saied's Government, 
and one of the answers I get back is, China, right. That 
becomes the excuse as to why we should be heavily invested in 
repressive regimes all over North Africa, and the Middle East: 
that if we are not there, China will be.
    I know you have talked a lot about China here today, but on 
this sort of specific question, about what I think many people 
here are inviting, a human rights and democracy race to the 
bottom with China, in which, just because they are willing to 
fund repressive regimes, and economically backwards regimes we 
should as well.
    And my sense is that the way that we compete with China 
successfully, is to not be China. Is to bring our values and 
our standards to these conversations, and to have a walk away 
moment, where the cost is just too high if a government is 
engaged in massive repression, or their economy is such a mess 
that it doesn't make sense for us to be involved in the long 
run.
    We haven't done that much despite, you know--despite the 
President talking about putting human rights and democracy 
first, you know, we still stay engaged with a lot of countries 
that have been moving the wrong way pretty fast. But not 
litigating that specific question of policy, what do you think 
about this idea that there is a risk of being engaged in a 
human rights, democracy race to the bottom with China? There 
has got to be a point at which we walk away.
    Ms. Power. Well, let me just take that question if I could 
from my vantage point as Administrator of USAID, where we have 
significantly increased our investments in democracy and human 
rights, where I very much agree with you that those investments 
that support, including by voice, but also by programming, is a 
key distinguishing feature, you know.
    The PRC does government-to-government this and that, the 
PRC brings its own workers in to make substantial investments, 
the debt distress that so many countries are suffering, it 
comes about in part because they are so busy servicing debt, 
and don't have an ability to invest those revenue in the 
livelihoods of their citizens, the lives of their citizens.
    You know, we are, under President Biden, very significantly 
expanding those investments in these distinguishing features, 
our attention to marginalized people, our attention to 
indigenous communities, our attention to LGBTQI individuals who 
are being persecuted across Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle 
East, and beyond.
    So you know, I actually think that governments are seeing, 
across the board, much more substantial investments, not only 
than the previous administration, which may not be unexpected, 
but even then the Obama administration. I mean, I think the 
years of underinvestment in those groups that are holding 
governments accountable, you know, we are trying to make up for 
lost time.
    That 17 years of democratic backsliding occurred, you know, 
without an effort to really buck, you know, or halt the 
momentum that the autocrats and others were having. You know, I 
will say putting to one side the--you know, the walk away 
aspect of your question if I may. You know, we are doing a lot 
of business with a lot of countries. I mean, if there are 
places where there is democratic backsliding, where we are 
dramatically, expanding our civil society programming 
resources, but we are also urgently working with them to curb 
emissions at the same time.
    And so, you know, for USAID, you know, even in a place like 
Afghanistan where the Taliban is doing, you know, one week just 
something just more monstrous than the thing that was done 
before, and more self-defeating from the standpoint of the 
economy of the country, even there, we are not walking away 
because we want to help citizens meet basic needs.
    We want to support girls through online learning if we 
can't reach them in the classroom like we were able to do a 
couple years ago. So, you know, it is this question of walking 
away, versus engaging, and continuing to be in the scrum, even 
in governments that are repressive, to find reformist elements 
who want to liberalize. Maybe they want to liberalize aspects 
of the economy, and not yet liberalize independent--you know, 
press freedom.
    But sometimes, you know, history shows that you get a 
foothold in there, you open things up, the private sector comes 
in, and that can, you know, create openings that might not have 
existed otherwise.
    So I think on a case-by-case basis, one can discuss, you 
know, again, whether taking our marbles and going home is the 
right strategy. But I find that there is a real hunger right 
now for the American alternative, and that includes support for 
civil society, raising our voice for those who are being 
repressed, raising our voice for marginalized populations. And 
to lose that aspect of our foreign policy, really, would be to 
lose a comparative advantage.
    Senator Murphy. I don't know that I disagree with any of 
that. I think often the rationale for our continued economic, 
and security assistance, and maybe I am, you know, talking to 
the wrong person about security assistance, is often connected 
to our need to have a foothold inside these countries to 
compete with China. It is not always connected to our efforts 
to lift up democracy, and human rights.
    And that is why Tunisia, for me, is an interesting example. 
A place where we have, you know, continued the same level of 
military assistance, despite the fact that the military is 
engaged in this crackdown, and we are cutting aid that, you 
know, arguably is channeled through to civil society. And my 
guess is, the reason we have done that is to try to have some 
influence with the Tunisian regime because, China is knocking 
at the door. And the way we get that influence is through 
economic aid, and military aid that the government has a role 
in. That troubles me side-by-side with these reductions, and in 
support for civil society. But I will look forward to 
continuing the conversation.
    All right; and I have got more questions, but I am going to 
stay on time, given that I am already over. And I am going to 
do my duty and close out the hearing.

                     ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE QUESTIONS

    [The following questions were not asked at the hearing, but 
were submitted to the agencies for response subsequent to the 
hearing:]
          Questions Submitted to Administrator Samantha Power
             Questions Submitted by Senator Jeanne Shaheen
    Question. Despite the Biden-Harris Administration's prioritization 
of the repeal of the Global Gag Rule shortly after taking office, I 
remained concerned by reports over the last 2 years that some 
implementing partners are still restricting the services that they 
provide. When we discussed this last year, you called it a 
``conservative application of this Administration's policies.'' 
According to a Government Accountability Office report issued last 
June, even after the policy has been rescinded, implementing partners 
struggle to rebuild lost partnerships, networks and programs while 
government and non-governmental organization stakeholders continue to 
experience confusion about what is permissible.

  --Can you describe what USAID is doing to ensure that all partners 
        and stakeholders understand that the global gag rule is not 
        currently in effect? How are you working to proactively rebuild 
        partnerships and communities harmed by the global gag rule?
  --Will you commit to meeting with organizations and communities 
        impacted by the global gag rule on future travel?

    Answer. USAID is committed to continuing to partner with 
governments, the private sector, and international and nongovernmental 
organizations to improve health outcomes and the empowerment of women 
and girls so that they can realize their full potential.
    USAID regularly communicates with Missions and partners on the 
longstanding requirements and statutory restrictions applicable to 
their programs. In addition to communicating the revocation of the 
Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy through the 
Agency's Implementing Partner Notices (IPN) Portal, the Bureau for 
Global Health has conducted outreach to USAID/Washington, Mission, and 
implementing partner staff to communicate directly that the PLGHA 
requirements were no longer in effect for prime awards and all existing 
and future subawards.

    Question. According to the most recent U.S. Government Strategy on 
International Basic Education, girls are more likely to be out of 
school than boys. The problem of keeping girls in school is especially 
challenging in conflict-affected countries where girls are 90% more 
likely to be out of secondary school than girls in stable countries.
    The U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls addresses the 
barriers that prevent girls from staying in school to ensure adolescent 
girls are educated, healthy, economically and socially empowered and 
free from violence and discrimination. Does USAID have any plans to 
update the implementation plans for this 2016 strategy or to publicly 
report on the implementation of this strategy?

    Answer. USAID has been involved in interagency discussions on the 
U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls (the Strategy) and 
will continue to focus on implementation of the Strategy rather than 
revision of the implementation plans. A publicly available report on 
the progress under the Strategy was released in April 2023 and is 
available on the U.S. Department of State website. The Department of 
State is the interagency lead on the Strategy.

    Question. In the last 5 years, how have USAID programs increased 
access to education for girls in both conflict-affected and stable 
countries?

    Answer. USAID remains committed to advancing gender equality in and 
through education around the world and to strengthening resilient 
education systems that support access to quality education, 
particularly for the most marginalized. In FY 2022, USAID programs in 
more than 50 countries worked to advance gender equality in and through 
education, reaching more than 11.8 million girls and women across the 
education continuum.
    Over the last 5 years, the COVID-19 pandemic, conflict and crises 
have negatively impacted access to education for girls and women. USAID 
programs have worked to address barriers to quality education by 
supporting programs that prevent and respond to school-related gender-
based violence, ensure educational materials and instruction empower 
all learners, provide safe learning opportunities for women and girls 
facing adversity, and holistically support adolescent girls to overcome 
their unique set of challenges.
    USAID is committed to this programming and has pledged under the 
National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality to reach 15 million 
girls and young women across the education continuum with education 
assistance by 2025.
    Examples of USAID's programs that have increased access to 
education for girls in both conflict-affected and stable countries over 
the past 5 years include:

  --Pakistan.--In September 2022, USAID launched the Improving Girls' 
        Education Activity to support public-private partnerships that 
        will improve school management in public girls' schools in 
        Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, boost school enrollment, and 
        strengthen the quality of education. On March 7, the U.S. 
        Ambassador to Pakistan also announced 500 university 
        scholarships for flood-affected students, with 50 percent of 
        the scholarships reserved for women.
  --Mali.--USAID's Girls Leadership and Empowerment through Education 
        program creates tangible opportunities for adolescent girls to 
        pursue their academic goals. It decreases educational barriers 
        for adolescent girls, improves their safety in schools and 
        communities, and increases knowledge of positive health 
        behaviors amongst them and their families. Programming provides 
        accelerated learning to girls, and supports their transition to 
        Mali public schools to continue their formal education.
  --Mozambique.--USAID's Advancing Girls' Education activity empowers 
        adolescent girls and promotes girls' school attendance in 
        Zambezia and Nampula where girls' school enrollment is low. In 
        addition to equipping learners with literacy, numeracy, social, 
        and life skills, the activity also expands girls' safe access 
        to quality education and improves learning outcomes by 
        educating learners about malnutrition, menstrual hygiene 
        management, and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.

    Question. The FY23 omnibus included report language encouraging 
USAID to allocate resources through the International Disaster 
Assistance account to provide safe, inclusive, and quality education 
for refugee and internally displaced children.

    What is the Biden administration's FY24 plan to support education 
and flexible learning to maintain continuity across situations of 
crisis?

    Answer. USAID supports child protection and education in crisis and 
conflict along the humanitarian development continuum with both 
International Disaster Assistance and Development Assistance funds. In 
fiscal year 2024, USAID's programs, leveraged with resources from 
bilateral and multilateral partnerships, the private sector, and 
external stakeholders, will build on the foundation set by the U.S. 
Government Strategy on International Basic Education and continue to 
help partner countries to strengthen the resilience of education 
systems, mitigate disruptions to education, prepare for heightened 
uncertainty and instability, provide safe spaces to learn, and improve 
educational outcomes.
    USAID is the largest bilateral donor of basic education development 
assistance in the world and is uniquely positioned to support learners, 
educators, and education systems in partner countries to prepare for, 
respond to, and recover from crises quickly and efficiently. In fiscal 
year 2022, USAID basic education programs reached 28 million children 
and youth in 56 countries, including 31 countries affected by conflict 
or crisis.
    USAID's education programs in crisis- and conflict-affected 
environments work to provide safe learning opportunities for students 
and teachers, rebuild education systems, and prevent and mitigate 
further conflict and crisis through conflict-sensitive education 
programs, community engagement, and disaster-risk reduction activities. 
Programs also work with national government leadership in the education 
sector to support integration of refugees into host country systems, 
serve internally-displaced children and youth, and support external 
coordination groups to increase coherence between humanitarian and 
development efforts in education.
    As one of its original contributors, USAID is also proud to 
continue to support Education Cannot Wait, the only global fund for 
education in emergencies. ECW ensures that the most marginalized child 
and youth in experiencing emergencies and protracted crises have access 
to lifesaving and life-sustaining education services. USAID's 
contributions also support ECW in its role to coordinate among donors, 
the private sector, and humanitarian and development actors to meet the 
needs of the next generation and ensure this growing population has the 
skills and abilities to sustain themselves while engaging as productive 
citizens in their communities. The United States, through USAID and the 
Department of State's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration, 
plans to contribute $25 million to ECW in FY 2023, bringing the total 
of U.S. government contributions to ECW to $145.3 million to date since 
2017.
    USAID's International Disaster Assistance funding is intended to 
save lives, alleviate human suffering, and reduce the impact of 
humanitarian crises. USAID recognizes education is protective and life-
saving in crises. Humanitarian child protection programs support 
education in emergencies through the Safe Healing and Learning Spaces 
methodology, psychosocial support and coping tools for caregivers and 
teachers, temporary shelters to enable damaged schools to resume 
education, and contextualized learning materials for displaced 
children. USAID child protection and education in emergencies experts 
collaborate closely to maintain continuity across the humanitarian-
development nexus.

            Questions Submitted by Senator Susan M. Collins
    Question. Recent years have truly been historic for Israel's 
relationships with regional Arab neighbors. The UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, 
and Sudan joined Egypt and Jordan in establishing diplomatic relations 
with Israel--paving the path to peace through recognition and 
engagement rather than isolation and boycotts of Israel.

  --Please describe the work USAID is undertaking to further expand and 
        strengthen the Arab world's normalization of relations with 
        Israel.
  --Is there more that USAID can do on this front?

    Answer. Advancing Middle East peace, regional integration, and 
normalization between Israel and its neighbors is a priority of this 
Administration and this agency. USAID continues to advance trilateral 
and regional USAID-Israel cooperation, particularly with Israel's 
neighbors and with Abraham Accords countries. USAID actively 
participates in five of the six Negev Forum Working Groups aimed at 
improving Israel's integration into the region. USAID serves as the USG 
lead for the Negev Forum's Tourism and Food Security and Water 
Technology Working Groups. Working closely with the interagency, USAID 
continues engaging international counterparts to achieve tangible 
progress in each Working Group it is a part of.
    In August 2019, USAID and MASHAV--the Israeli government's 
international development agency within its Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs--signed a global Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for 
development cooperation to identify opportunities for collaboration and 
partnership. Most recently, USAID utilized $2 million in FY 21 funding 
to partner with MASHAV in Albania, Northern Central America, and 
through a special call for agriculture, climate, and water 
sustainability proposals with the agency's Middle East Regional 
Cooperation (MERC) program.
    In addition, through MERC, USAID manages a portfolio of over 40 
active Arab-Israeli applied research grants focused on topics crucial 
to the region, such as natural resources management and public health. 
Examples of those projects include:

  --Israeli and Jordanian scientists are developing advanced methods to 
        treat municipal wastewater that may assist with irrigation in 
        Israel and Jordan.
  --Palestinian and Israeli scientists are generating evidence of the 
        presence, transport, and effects of lead on soils, plants, 
        water, animals, and individuals near sites in the West Bank 
        where electronics waste and cables are burned for recycling and 
        disposal. This research is informing how this issue is managed, 
        and is promoting recycling.

    Question. To enhance regional prosperity and stability, the United 
States joined Israel, Egypt, the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco in 
establishing the Negev Forum. I understand USAID has been an active 
participant in the Working Groups established by the Forum.

  --Can you update us on what USAID is doing with regard to the Forum 
        and what outcomes you hope to achieve?

    Answer. USAID continues to advance trilateral and regional 
cooperation with Israel, particularly with Israel's neighbors and 
Abraham Accords countries. USAID's support to the Negev Forum is a 
prime example of these efforts. USAID serves as the U.S. government 
lead for two of the Negev Forum Working Groups--Food Security and Water 
Technology (FSWT) and Tourism, and also provides expertise to the 
Health, Clean Energy, and Education and Coexistence Working Groups.
    A USAID delegation attended the inaugural Working Group meetings in 
Abu Dhabi in January of 2023, and Agency experts continue to work 
closely coordinating with interagency and regional partners ahead of an 
upcoming Ministerial expected in early summer 2023 in Morocco. For 
example, USAID is working with other Negev members to advance joint 
tourism projects to boost economic development, improve capacity of 
tourism operators, and convene experts to share best practices and 
opportunities as determined by the Tourism Working Group. The FSWT 
plans to gather at the working level in the coming months to further 
hone its deliverables for the Ministerial. USAID hopes that the 
deliverables identified and announced at the Ministerial will promote 
further regional integration between Israel and all involved countries.

    Question. The World Food Program is actively investigating the 
large-scale theft of USAID-provided humanitarian food aid in Ethiopia, 
where protracted conflict and drought have left more than 20 million 
people reliant on aid. The amount of food aid stolen is reportedly 
enough to feed 100,000 people. Meanwhile, Secretary Blinken announced 
an additional $331 million in new humanitarian assistance for Ethiopia 
last month.

    Can you provide an update on the investigation into this situation 
and tell us what steps are you taking to ensure that U.S.-funded 
humanitarian assistance is not stolen or diverted from its intended 
recipients?

    Answer. USAID recently uncovered that food aid intended for the 
people of Tigray suffering under famine-like conditions was being 
diverted post-distribution and sold on the local market by 
beneficiaries who were either coerced or misled into selling their food 
aid at cut-rate prices. Immediately upon discovery of this post-
distribution diversion in Ethiopia, USAID reported the incident to 
USAID's Office of Inspector General (OIG). It is our understanding that 
both the USAID OIG and investigatory units from USAID implementing 
partners in Ethiopia are investigating the matter. As of March 21, when 
the post-distribution diversion was initially discovered, nearly $315 
million (out of $319.5 million allocated to BHA) of the announced 
funding had been obligated. In response to this situation and in 
cooperation with implementing partners, USAID has proactively 
implemented strong mitigating measures against further diversion.
    Effective April 20, 2023, we have decided to pause all USAID-
supported humanitarian food assistance to Tigray until we can work with 
our partners to ensure that this assistance can be provided without 
further diversion. USAID humanitarian food assistance is continuing in 
other regions of Ethiopia at this time. The pause is limited to food 
assistance and is intended to immediately resume once we are assured 
that safeguards are in place to ensure that aid is reaching and being 
utilized by its intended recipients in order to minimize humanitarian 
impact to the extent possible. Pausing food assistance is not a 
decision we take lightly given the immense suffering in the region. 
However, USAID believes that upholding the integrity of humanitarian 
assistance is critical to meeting needs and reaching the most 
vulnerable, both in Northern Ethiopia and around the world. USAID 
Administrator Samantha Power met with WFP Executive Director Cindy 
McCain on April 6 and directly raised the concerns surrounding this 
diversion.
    USAID is exploring all viable programmatic options in Ethiopia as 
part of global efforts to mitigate waste, fraud, or diversion of 
assistance. USAID will also continue pressing for system-wide changes 
throughout the country, such as enhanced beneficiary identification, 
improved targeting, and strengthened monitoring of assistance.
    Wherever we work, USAID continually reviews the risks associated 
with our programming to ensure that our partners are able to 
effectively carry out USAID-supported activities in line with 
humanitarian principles, while also acting in compliance with the terms 
and conditions of their awards. In parallel, we work closely with our 
food assistance partners to ensure they have robust risk mitigation 
systems in place. We are committed to ensuring U.S. taxpayer-funded 
humanitarian assistance is reaching and being utilized by the intended 
beneficiaries and commit to informing Congress as more information 
becomes available.

    Question. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction 
John Sopko recently testified that he cannot assure Congress ``that we 
are not currently funding the Taliban.''

  --Are USAID implementers providing funding to the Taliban, including 
        through government registration, customs, or other fees? If so, 
        under what specific authority?

    Answer. USAID does not provide assistance to the Taliban. All USAID 
humanitarian and development assistance funds the work of UN agencies 
and experienced, carefully chosen international NGOs and local Afghan 
partners. In some cases, USAID partners may be required to conduct 
incidental transactions with the Taliban that are necessary for the 
provision of assistance, such as fees, import duties, purchase or 
receipt of permits or licenses, purchase of fuel, or payment for public 
utility or telecommunication services. These types of critical 
transactions are authorized under General Licenses issued by the 
Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). 
Direct financial transfers to the Taliban (or Haqqani Network) are 
prohibited.

    Question. How does USAID ensure that its humanitarian assistance is 
reaching intended recipients, namely ``the poor Afghan people,'' and 
what is your response to SIGAR's concerns that the Taliban is profiting 
or benefiting from such assistance?

    Answer. USAID has a track record of ensuring that our assistance 
does not benefit terrorists or other blocked persons. USAID utilized 
robust anti-terrorism vetting to mitigate the risk of diversion of our 
funds and resources to terrorist entities during program 
implementation. USAID also employs risk analytic processes that include 
an examination of the risks associated with the diversion of assistance 
to the Taliban and Haqqani Network in Afghanistan. We require our 
humanitarian and development partners to have proper safeguards and 
risk-mitigation systems in place to ensure that principled development 
and humanitarian aid reaches those who need it most. When there is any 
cause for concern related to the delivery of this assistance, we have 
plans and protocols in place to respond.
    USAID and our implementing partners have extensive experience 
working in challenging operating environments and we have systems to 
enable aid to reach its intended recipients--over 17 million people in 
FY 2022--through numerous monitoring methods, including remote, post-
distribution, and third-party monitoring, to provide continuous 
oversight of awards. Over the last 20 years, the security situation in 
Afghanistan has often required remote and third-party monitoring 
methods. The Taliban takeover in August 2021 has required more frequent 
use of these methods. USAID partners are also required to report all 
incidents of fraud, waste, and abuse, including diversion, to USAID's 
Office of Inspector General (OIG).
    USAID staff continually communicate and coordinate with our 
implementing partners and our third-party monitoring contractor to 
ensure both that our assistance is reaching those for which it is 
intended and that our partners have effective systems and mitigation 
measures in place to help safeguard against and promptly report and 
respond to fraud, waste, and abuse, including Taliban attempts to 
influence or interfere with the provision of assistance. USAID staff 
regularly meet with partners, as well as review programmatic and 
financial reports corresponding with their respective awards, to obtain 
key contextual and programmatic updates, including updates related to 
their access to beneficiary populations, safety and security, and any 
attempted Taliban interference.

    Question. Are you aware of any U.S. taxpayer funds being diverted 
by the Taliban, including away from specific ethnic groups the Taliban 
does not support or to the families of Taliban local leaders? How does 
USAID ensure that no U.S. taxpayer funds are diverted by the Taliban?

    Answer. The Taliban has occasionally tried to divert humanitarian 
assistance in various geographic areas for personal gain or towards 
public works projects such as road construction. In these cases, 
humanitarian organizations have decided, on their own, to suspend 
assistance until local Taliban authorities agree to abide by 
humanitarian principles and not seek to influence or interfere with 
programming.
    USAID has risk management systems in place to safeguard against 
diversion of U.S. taxpayer funds to the Taliban. As part of funding 
applications, USAID requires that partners develop Risk Assessment and 
Management Plans (RAMPs), which USAID uses to inform its internal 
assessments on how applicants will mitigate the risk of assistance 
benefiting sanctioned entities, among other risks.
    The Taliban's December 24, 2022, edict and April 4, 2023, verbal 
declaration prohibiting Afghan female staff from working in NGOs and 
the UN in Afghanistan has further complicated the fragile operational 
climate in Afghanistan. To date, USAID partners report that they are 
able to continue providing principled humanitarian assistance to 
Afghans in need but are increasingly confronted with access challenges 
as these edicts are not uniformly enforced. USAID is continuing to 
engage with partners to understand these challenges and how they impact 
access for different regions, individuals, and groups.

              Questions Submitted by Senator John Boozman
    Question. Coffee is incredibly important to the U.S. economy. The 
coffee industry supports nearly 1.7 million American jobs and adds $225 
billion in economic activity every year according to the National 
Coffee Association. Coffee is also important to Arkansas. Arkansas 
companies in the coffee industry depend on a steady supply of coffee 
grown by smallholders mostly in low-income countries, some of which are 
countries where Feed the Future operates.

  --As the risk to coffee production grows, from things including soil 
        fertility issues and pests and disease, what is USAID doing to 
        help smallholder coffee producers in low-income countries 
        become more resilient to the challenges they are facing growing 
        coffee?

    Answer. USAID works in partnership with U.S. and international 
coffee companies, other sector actors and non-profit organizations to 
enable the world's at-risk coffee producers to improve their 
livelihoods while providing a reliable supply of high-quality coffee. 
USAID's work in coffee spans many countries on three continents. 
Together with our partners, we are combating threats posed by the 
climate crisis that endanger global coffee crops while ensuring that 
coffee production protects forests and the climate. Through 
partnerships with the private sector, we are working to drive 
investment in sustainable production, and improve the environmental and 
economic benefits of conservation for local communities.

  --USAID has funded numerous activities that help smallholder coffee 
        producers become more resilient to production challenges 
        (including soil infertility and increased pest and disease 
        pressure). To cite two examples, one from Mexico and one from 
        Peru:

    --Cooperative Development Project.--(2018-2024) Equal Exchange's 
            Cooperative Development Project, funded by USAID, is 
            working with the coffee association Finca Triunfo Verde 
            coffee association in Mexico to improve the quality and 
            productivity of organic, specialty coffee. Equal Exchange 
            is supporting the association in facilitating exchanges 
            between producers to model best practices in shade 
            diversification, soil conservation, and pest and disease 
            control. Additionally, Equal Exchange is working with Finca 
            Triunfo Verde to foster young people's interest in coffee 
            production by extending technical training to youth and 
            assisting them in establishing their own model farms.
    --In September 2020, USAID and Conservation International signed an 
            agreement in partnership with Starbucks to implement the 
            Amazon Business Alliance (2020-2027) to facilitate and 
            promote sustainable investments in the Peruvian Amazon by 
            scaling-out and scaling-up their impact to support 
            conservation business models and enabling conditions. The 
            purpose of the activity is to ensure that families in the 
            short term improve their incomes and help restore and 
            conserve forests on their farms and in the broader 
            landscape. The project is promoting agroforestry systems 
            and increasing shade-tree densities in existing coffee and 
            cacao plots and diversifying production through non-timber 
            species such as peppers, bananas, among others; likewise, 
            families are installing plantations and managing timber 
            species in secondary forests as well as restoring degraded 
            soils with organic fertilizers made from farm residues and 
            composting.

    Question. Are there any long-term solutions and innovations USAID 
is investing in, such as agricultural research in the development of 
coffee?

    Answer. Yes, USAID investments in soil health research are 
generating improved practices which could readily be applicable in 
coffee-producing regions. Coffee producers also face challenges around 
soil fertility and diversified production within coffee-based systems.
    USAID also invests in the long-term sustainability of coffee 
through initiatives that create economic opportunities for producers--
including access to markets, connections with buyers, and access to 
finance. The Farmfit Fund, for which coffee is an important commodity, 
offers affordable financial resources to start, sustain, and grow 
businesses that sustainably engage with smallholders. Farmfit Fund 
transactions benefit from a USAID sponsored DFC guarantee facility (up 
to USD $250 million). The fund runs until 2036.
    USAID also supported Green Invest Asia, an innovative project 
targeting mid-growth agriculture and forestry companies in Indonesia 
and Vietnam with business strategies, environmental assessments, and 
advice to improve their sustainable commodity production and business 
practices. The focus of GIA was on key commodities linked to 
deforestation in Southeast Asia, including coffee. Green Invest Asia 
facilitates increased sustainability in the transforming coffee sector 
through a carbon baseline study. The results influenced companies to 
strategically develop plans and policies that contribute to global 
sustainability and reduced emissions. Through GIA, USAID supported top 
global buyers JDE Peet's and Nestle to meet their corporate carbon 
commitments to source carbon-neutral coffee from their regional supply 
chains, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the entire sector. 
These systemic industry shifts improve smallholder supplier 
livelihoods, supply chain transparency and traceability while 
mitigating climate change impacts and preventing deforestation.

    Question. The war in Ukraine is causing widespread destruction to 
both civilians and infrastructure. At the same time, Russia's invasion 
of Ukraine has led to the worst food crisis since WWII. Grain and 
fertilizer exports remain low, leading to higher costs of food 
production and less food to consume. Addressing the global food crisis 
remains a top issue, especially in the Horn of Africa where hunger and 
starvation is driving conflict.

    How will USAID's FY24 budget address the global food crisis and 
help ensure that we are efficiently aiding starving countries and food 
scarcity is not driving conflicts in these regions?

    Answer. USAID remains deeply committed to providing lifesaving 
humanitarian assistance to populations affected by the global food 
security crisis. Underscoring the historic proportions of the current 
crisis, USAID's Famine Early Warning Systems Network estimates that 
acute food insecurity has increased by 70 percent when compared to pre-
pandemic levels. This crisis will be a long-term one--thus, we need to 
prepare ourselves for a long-term response. The powerful, combined 
effects of climate change, the COVID-19 post-pandemic effect, 
protracted complex emergencies, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine will 
create elevated levels of emergency needs for years to come.
    Generous funding from Congress and the American people, including 
through supplemental appropriations, allowed the United States to scale 
up humanitarian assistance to meet unprecedented needs--especially in 
Ukraine and in the Horn of Africa--during FY 2022 and FY 2023. The FY 
2024 request includes $6.5 billion in humanitarian assistance for 
USAID.
    To prioritize USG humanitarian resources, USAID will focus on 
addressing the most life-threatening needs in each context. In 
addition, USAID will work with partners to deliver assistance in the 
most efficient way possible. In some cases, this means potentially 
switching or re-emphasizing a particular modality such as cash, local 
purchase, or U.S. Food for Peace Title II in-kind assistance to find 
the optimal mix within and between partners to reach the most people we 
can with the resources available.
    While we will continue to prioritize available resources for the 
most acute emergencies and needs, significant resources are needed to 
address unprecedented humanitarian needs worldwide. Humanitarian needs 
are far outpacing global resources and face difficult trade-offs for 
concurrent emergencies. As a result, USAID will continue to advocate 
with other donors to increase their contributions to responses, with a 
particular focus on the Horn of Africa.

    Question. What is USAID doing to promote the growth of sustainable 
agriculture in these vulnerable regions given the global food crisis, 
and is there more you need from us?

    Answer. USAID is leveraging the full weight of its Bureau for 
Resilience and Food Security to address this crisis. USAID recently 
expanded the number of target countries within Feed the Future from 12 
to 20, in light of growing need and growing demand for food security 
investments that address the underlying weaknesses in food systems. 
When selected as a target country, USAID aims to prioritize Feed the 
Future funding to go to that country. Target countries also create 
country plans which are written in conjunction with USAID missions and 
partner governments. This includes much more robust monitoring and 
evaluation reporting than is required in non-target Feed the Future 
countries.
    In addition, we have a set of resilience focus countries, and zones 
within countries that are areas of chronic poverty and recurrent 
shocks, (for example, the arid lands of Kenya which are now 
experiencing historic drought.) Our programs in these areas are 
designed to build the capacities of communities to withstand climate 
and other related shocks and help avert the need for year-on-year 
humanitarian assistance.
    These programs are bearing fruit. We have seen the reduction of 
poverty and malnutrition by 20-25 percent in areas where we work, the 
improvement in children's diets and the doubling of women's empowerment 
as measured by our innovative Women's Empower in Agriculture Index. 
Data also indicates that even without access to additional resources, 
according to the World Bank, Feed the Future zones of influence were 
more resilient to the economic impacts of COVID-19 than households 
living outside of these areas. Our programs doubled the number of 
people we reached with access to finance during that period, 
demonstrating our ability to pivot even without additional resources.
    In response to the current crisis, USAID scaled up and accelerated 
such Feed the Future activities, building on our strong global 
platform, to respond to immediate, rising food insecurity within three 
lines of effort: mitigating the fertilizer shortage, increasing 
investments in agricultural capacity and resilience to sustain crop 
production in spite of rising input costs; and cushioning the 
macroeconomic shocks and impact on vulnerable communities. We 
accelerated farmer's access to improved seed in order to ensure 
harvests are productive as farmers face difficult markets and USAID is 
supporting, at scale, fertilizer use efficiency and other agronomic 
practices to reduce the impact of fertilizer shortfalls.
    In order to address this crisis, USAID both pivoted existing 
investments and also rapidly distributed supplemental funds to meet 
these objectives. Funds were used on a variety of critical programming. 
In particular, it was used to launch a unique market-based response to 
the crisis called the Accelerated Innovation Delivery Initiative.
    The Accelerated Innovation Delivery Initiative (AID-I) is a $117-
million, two-year rapid response effort that connects farmers to 
innovative tools and information they need to manage the high input 
costs and supply disruptions over the coming seasons. AID-I works with 
and through market actors such as the private sector and local 
extension to drive efficiency and scale, an approach that also will 
help sustain this work and build long-term resilience. AID-I focuses on 
areas where the need and potential is greatest: Southern Africa 
(Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia) and the Great Lakes region (Burundi, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda). It provides 
targeted assistance to up to six million African smallholder farmers by 
improving soil health and fertilizer management, strengthening local 
seed systems, connecting to financial products and services, and 
delivering extension and advisory services.
    Response options made possible with the supplemental funds to Feed 
the Future demonstrated both the power of the platform to rapidly 
respond to the crisis and the potential to do more for smallholder 
farmers to build their resilience. Funding for Feed the Future 
investments have been relatively the same since 2009 at roughly $1 
billion per year. Recognizing these needs, the President's budget 
requests an increase to $1.2 billion in FY2024.

    Question. Virginia Tech released its 2022 Global Agricultural 
Productivity report last Fall, and found ag productivity growing at 
only 1.12% annually, falling short of the annual global rate of 1.73% 
needed to feed our projected global population approaching 10 billion 
by 2050.

    If this shortfall in agricultural productivity continues in the 
coming years, what will it mean for global food security?

    Answer. The impact of sustained declines in agricultural 
productivity could mean an increasingly hungry world if output 
continues to stagnate as well. Investments in global agriculture 
production continue to fall short of the need. The world--public, 
private, and civil society sectors alike--must take far more aggressive 
action and make deeper investments to accelerate agricultural 
transformation. As the report points out, current efforts are 
inadequate to the challenges faced, including climate and other shocks. 
As an example, the U.S. government global hunger initiative, Feed the 
Future, has had the same base appropriation since its creation, and 
that funding goes considerably less far than it did 13 years ago.
    Like you, USAID is concerned about the slow pace of agricultural 
transformation in certain parts of the world and the report revealed 
important regional differences in agricultural productivity growth. 
Most troubling is that agricultural productivity declined, on average, 
across Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). To clarify, while agricultural output 
grew a healthy 2.98 percent per year (2011-2020) in SSA, most of the 
growth was driven by opening up new land for cultivation and pasture. 
Land productivity therefore contracted by 0.12 percent, meaning that 
gains were made through ``extensification'', or expansion on to new 
lands, rather than on improved productivity on the land already under 
cultivation. Converting grasslands, forests, and other wildlands to 
agricultural production can decrease biodiversity and wildlife habitat 
and increase soil degradation and erosion and is not a sustainable way 
to feed a growing global population.
    To accelerate agricultural productivity growth, investments are 
needed to address fundamental constraints limiting gains in Africa. 
These include investments in climate smart innovations such as improved 
seed, soil health, resource use efficiency (e.g., on farm water 
management) and sustainable intensification of the major farming 
systems that contribute up to 80% of the continent's food supplies. 
Through its extensive agricultural research portfolio, USAID is 
investing in the development of improved crop varieties more resilient 
to extreme weather, soil health and fertilizer management 
recommendations, water management strategies (including small-scale 
irrigation), and nutrient-dense horticulture and livestock production 
systems. These areas of investment have been proven to increase 
agricultural productivity and increase resilience to the many shocks 
farmers face.
    In addition, extreme and unpredictable weather has required 
expanded access to, and adoption of, innovations that are derived from 
recent advances in crop and livestock improvement, including resistance 
to pests and diseases as well as higher temperatures. Along with 
development of new innovations (technologies and climate-smart 
management practices), African countries and regional organizations 
need to embrace and implement policies that provide positive incentives 
for investment by both the public and private sectors, on-farm and 
across the food system. There are bright spots in Sub Saharan Africa 
where countries are advancing business-enabling environment policies 
and technological innovations that would drive agricultural 
productivity gains. For example, through the Zambia Growth 
Opportunities (ZAMGRO) Program, a US$300 million effort funded by the 
World Bank, the Government of Zambia is prioritizing policy and 
institutional reforms to increase growth in the agri-food sector. 
Zambia is redirecting public expenditures on agricultural subsidies to 
expanding agricultural infrastructure and extension to increase 
productivity and growth in the sector. Zambia is also committed to 
expanding private sector-led, market-driven reforms in grain marketing 
and increasing regional food trade.

    Question. What more can be done to address this issue?

    Answer. USAID agrees with the key policy recommendations in this 
report. In fact, Feed the Future currently invests in a majority of the 
solutions it identifies, from investing in research and innovation as 
well as commercialization of solutions, championing science informed 
policy reforms, improving access to markets for agricultural inputs and 
outputs, and boosting regional trade. The US government's Feed the 
Future Initiative has increased its attention as well to many forms of 
investments that focus not just on efficiency, but also the resilience 
of the food system. Recently, the Initiative has evolved to do more in 
early warning systems to mitigate agricultural risks from climate 
change and emerging pests and diseases, for example, and food loss and 
waste (especially post-harvest loss) to ensure that the food we do grow 
reaches the table.
    The urgency of the food crisis demands more creative strategic 
partnerships, as USAID and USDA have promoted through the ongoing 
Agricultural Innovation Mission for Climate Initiative which to date 
has generated $13 billion of public and private investment in climate 
smart research and innovation in agriculture. Increasingly, USAID with 
its public sector investments, works through broad public and private 
partnerships to achieve results that promote increased productivity 
(more output from the same or fewer inputs), making farming more 
profitable and food more affordable and nutritious for low-income 
households.
    Key to utilizing these broad public and private partnerships are 
rigorous analyses identifying the priority areas where the development 
community, working hand in hand with national government partners, can 
have the greatest impact on poverty and hunger through agricultural led 
economic growth.

    Question. In recent decades, nutritious, biofortified products such 
as orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and iron-fortified green beans were 
introduced into the African and Asian agricultural sectors to address 
nutrient deficiencies. As of late 2019, it is estimated that more than 
6 million households in 15 Sub-Saharan African countries were regularly 
producing and consuming orange-fleshed sweet potatoes.

  --What has USAID been doing to support agricultural research efforts 
        like these to improve nutritious outcomes and boost smallholder 
        farmers in countries where the Feed the Future Initiative is 
        active?
  --Are there any new biofortified products or other nutrition-related 
        interventions that are expected to be ready for introduction 
        soon in USAID's programming?

    Answer. Improving nutrition outcomes in Feed the Future (FTF) Zones 
of Influence is a key part of the Global Food Security Strategy, which 
the Administration updated in 2021. The new strategy elevates nutrition 
to a key pillar for FTF activities. This includes the agricultural 
research we do on biofortification. In addition, USAID prioritizes 
large-scale food fortification (LSFF) of staple foods and condiments as 
a proven low-cost, high-impact intervention to ensure that vulnerable 
populations are able to consume a diet with the necessary vitamins and 
minerals. Launched in September 2022, USAID Advancing Food 
Fortification Opportunities to Reinforce Diets (USAID AFFORD) will 
program up to $75m in funding to increase the scale and quality of LSFF 
to provide a dietary safety net to vulnerable populations by addressing 
rising dietary inadequacies.
    USAID and some of its missions funded work done by HarvestPlus and 
the CGIAR Research Program on Agriculture for Nutrition and Health 
(A4NH) which created the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes. USAID also 
supports the development and deployment of biofortified nutritious crop 
varieties, as well as legumes as protein source.
    For example, smallholder farmers are growing biofortified maize and 
wheat varieties developed by CGIAR centers. Seven seed companies in 
four countries in Eastern and Southern Africa (Zambia, Zimbabwe, 
Malawi, and Tanzania) are commercializing 10 pro-vitamin A (PVA) maize 
hybrid varieties, benefitting 52,705 households (approx. 331,600 
people) alone in 2022. In Guatemala, 20,500 families used biofortified 
(high-Zn) maize seed in 2022, and it is expected that high-Zn maize 
will cover at least 10% of the improved maize market in 2023. Twenty 
high zinc wheat varieties have been released in South Asia and Latin 
America, and early generation seed production is taking place in Nepal 
and India. In Pakistan, the number of households growing zinc-enriched 
wheat has risen rapidly across the country from 218,000 in 2018 to over 
2.1 million in 2022.
    One tool to combat Vitamin A malnutrition, Golden Rice 
(biofortified with higher levels of pro-vitamin A using Genetic 
Engineering), received biosafety regulatory approval for farmer 
cultivation in the Philippines in July 2021. Initial seed production 
has started, and preliminary market research suggests that golden rice 
is accepted by local markets. Within the next 5-7 years, the project 
aims for Golden Rice to meet the rice requirement of vitamin A 
deficient households in the Philippines--and ultimately its developers 
aim to provide 30 to 50 percent of the estimated average requirement 
(EAR) of vitamin A for pregnant women and young children in Southeast 
Asia.
    In addition to CGIAR centers, Feed the Future (FTF) Innovation Labs 
on Sorghum and Millets, and Crop Improvement are also contributing to 
biofortified/nutrition related activities. USAID/RFS is also supporting 
the improvements of legume crops such as soybean, beans, cowpeas and 
peanut, which are a source of low-cost protein and minerals, and also 
improve soil health. For instance, the Soybean Innovation Lab has 
developed the Complementary Food for Africa (COMFA) that combines the 
high-quality protein of soybean with the high-energy of orange flesh 
sweet potato as an early childhood nutritious food.

    Question. The U.S. has provided aid to the Palestinians over the 
years through humanitarian assistance. Congress has insisted on 
oversight of any funds to ensure that they are properly spent and do 
not go to support terrorism. The Taylor Force Act prohibits assistance 
to the Palestinian Authority until they stop the inexcusable practice 
of paying convicted terrorists and their families.

  --What are you doing to ensure strict oversight of USAID projects and 
        grantees, and ensuring no funds are directed to terrorists and 
        their supporters?
  --It has been widely reported that Palestinian schools funded by U.S. 
        taxpayers through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
        promote hatred in their schoolbooks. What has the 
        Administration done to ensure these materials are not present 
        at these schools, and has the Palestinian Authority taken any 
        meaningful steps?

    Answer. USAID takes the Taylor Force Act very seriously and 
provides all U.S. assistance in a manner compliant with all relevant 
laws, including the Taylor Force Act.
    USAID also takes counterterrorism vetting of programmatic partners 
and beneficiaries in the West Bank and Gaza very seriously to prevent 
American taxpayer funds, and the activities we finance, from providing 
support to entities or individuals that pose a risk to our national 
security.
    USAID West Bank and Gaza's Mission Order 21 requires the vetting of 
key individuals of partner organizations at the prime and first-tier 
sub-awardee levels regardless of nationality, including U.S. citizens. 
USAID also requires the vetting of individual beneficiaries/trainees at 
specific thresholds, as outlined in Mission Order 21. Vetting typically 
covers the directors, officers, or other employees considered ``key 
individuals,'' of non-Federal entities and for-profit entities that 
apply for contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other funding 
from USAID. USAID also requires vetting of recipients and beneficiaries 
(including trainees) of assistance funds meeting certain thresholds.
    Vetting is conducted by trained counterterrorism experts at the 
National Terrorist Screening Center (TSC). The TSC is a FBI-managed 
facility that permits the sharing of terrorism-related information 
across the U.S. government and with other law enforcement agencies. The 
TSC manages the consolidated watchlist, which has information on people 
reasonably suspected to be involved in terrorism or related activities. 
All vetting requests submitted to USAID undergo a thorough review by 
trained counterterrorism experts at the TSC. This review includes both 
public and non-public database searches against the personally 
identifiable information provided. The vetting process is rooted in 
intelligence and complemented, as applicable, by other data points.
    In WBG, the counterterrorism partner vetting program also includes 
an additional ``second-step'' level of scrutiny whereby recipients of 
assistance awards or beneficiaries of cash or in-kind assistance are 
reviewed by the Office of Palestinian Affairs at Embassy Jerusalem.
    USAID does not fund the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and 
would refer you to the Department of State, which manages related 
funding.

    Question. Iranians continue to protest the death of Mahsa Amini, 
calling for freedom and human rights all while facing violence from the 
Iranian regime. As you know, the U.S. has a proud history of supporting 
those who are struggling for freedom.

    Has USAID played any role in helping the Iranian protesters, and is 
there anything we can do more of to support them?

    Answer. USAID stands with the brave women of Iran calling for 
change and standing up to the repressive Iranian regime. While USAID 
does not fund any activities in Iran or in support of Iranian protests, 
USAID has made public statements expressing solidarity and support in 
media interviews, public remarks, and social media For example, in 
Lebanon, Administrator Power said ``Let me just take this occasion to 
express great, great admiration for the courage of the young people, 
and the Iranian people really of all generations who have come out, 
wanting for themselves the same things all of us want and every human 
deserves, which is basic dignity, freedom, economic opportunity. And it 
has been both inspiring to see that courage and the bravery in the face 
of such repression, but also just heartbreaking to see so many lives 
snuffed out with such promise, and again, snuffed out for no other 
reason than seeking to live as they choose, live with just basic 
freedom.''
    Together with allies and partners, through multilateral measures 
and UN mechanisms, we continue to hold Iran accountable for employing 
violence against its own population, particularly women and girls.

                          SUBCOMMITTEE RECESS

    So thank you very much, Administrator Power, for joining 
us. We are going to keep the hearing record open for written 
questions until 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, April 26.
    [Whereupon, at 11:40 a.m., Wednesday, April 19, the 
subcommittee was recessed, to reconvene subject to the call of 
the Chair.]
