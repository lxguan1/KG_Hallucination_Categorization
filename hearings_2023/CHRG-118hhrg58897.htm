    FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime 
Transportation
    RE:      LCoast Guard and Maritime Transportation 
Subcommittee Hearing on ``Review of Fiscal Year 2024 Budget 
Request for the Coast Guard''
_______________________________________________________________________


                               I. PURPOSE

    The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation 
will hold a hearing on Tuesday, April 18, 2023, at 2:00 p.m. ET 
in 2253 Rayburn House Office Building to receive testimony on 
the President's Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Budget Request for the 
Coast Guard in preparation for consideration of annual 
authorizing legislation for the Coast Guard. The Subcommittee 
will hear testimony from representatives of the United States 
Coast Guard (Coast Guard or Service).

                             II. BACKGROUND

    The Coast Guard was established on January 28, 1915, 
through the consolidation of the Revenue Cutter Service 
(established in 1790) and the Lifesaving Service (established 
in 1848).\1\ The Coast Guard later assumed the duties of three 
other agencies: the Lighthouse Service (established in 1789), 
the Steamboat Inspection Service (established in 1838), and the 
Bureau of Navigation (established in 1884).\2\

FY 2024 COAST GUARD BUDGET REQUEST:

    The President requests $13.5 billion for FY 2024 for the 
activities of the Coast Guard, including $12.1 billion in total 
discretionary funding.\7\ The FY 2024 request for discretionary 
funding represents an increase of $421 million (3.6 percent) 
from the FY 2023 enacted level.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Budget Justification, supra note 6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPERATIONS AND SUPPORT (O&S):

    The President requests $10.2 billion for the O&S account 
for FY 2024, a $523 million (5.4 percent) increase from the FY 
2023 enacted level.\8\ The O&S account supports the day-to-day 
activities of the Coast Guard including administrative 
expenses, support costs, travel, lease payments, and the 
operation and maintenance of infrastructure and assets. The O&S 
account also funds personnel compensation and benefits for 
approximately 44,000 military personnel and 9,000 civilian 
employees.\9\ Included in this request is $5.4 billion for 
military pay and personnel support; $433 million for mission 
support, including enterprise management and environmental 
compliance and restoration; and $4.4 billion for field 
operations.\10\

Statement_FINAL.pdf [hereinafter 2024 Budget Overview: Posture 
Statement].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The O&S budget request includes increases in funding to 
cover follow-on costs for the operation and maintenance of 
newly acquired assets and technology and increases in other 
administrative expenses such as an increase to cover the cost 
of the 2023 military pay raise (4.6 percent), 2023 civilian pay 
raise (4.6 percent), 2024 proposed military pay raise (5.2 
percent), and 2024 proposed civilian pay raise (5.2 
percent).\11\ Like other military services, the Coast Guard has 
fallen short of its recruiting targets and is approximately 
4,800 members short across its workforce.\12\ To address these 
challenges, the Coast Guard requests $12 million to fund 
additional personnel and offices to augment the Coast Guard's 
recruiting efforts.\13\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The President requests $24.7 million within O&S for 
environmental compliance and restoration (EC&R) funding in FY 
2024, a $358,000 increase from the FY 2023 enacted level.\14\ 
The EC&R funding provides for the clean-up and restoration of 
contaminated Coast Guard facilities, and for the remediation of 
Coast Guard assets to ensure they are safe to operate or can be 
decommissioned in compliance with environmental laws. The 
requested funding for EC&R continues long-term monitoring at 29 
sites and begins or continues investigation and remediation 
site work at 33 sites.\15\

    \14\ Budget Justification, supra note 6.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The proposed O&S increases are offset in part by proposed 
cuts derived through decommissioning certain legacy assets that 
will result in a total cost savings of $29.1 million and 167 
full-time equivalent positions.\16\ Specifically, the FY 2024 
budget request proposes the decommissioning of:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ 2024 Budget Overview: Posture Statement, supra note 10.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <bullet> LFive HC-130H Long Range Surveillance Aircraft 
($9.8 million);
    <bullet> LOne 210-foot Reliance Class Medium Endurance 
Cutter ($4.2 million);
    <bullet> LTwo 110-foot legacy Island Class Patrol Boats 
($1.7 million); and
    <bullet> LSix MH-65 helicopters ($13.4 million).\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ Budget Justification, supra note 6.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND IMPROVEMENTS (PC&I):

    The President requests $1.6 billion for the PC&I account, a 
$120 million (7.2 percent) decrease over the FY 2023 enacted 
level.\18\ The PC&I account funds the acquisition, procurement, 
construction, rebuilding, and physical improvements of Coast 
Guard owned and operated vessels, aircraft, facilities, aids-
to-navigation (AtoN), communications and information technology 
systems, and related equipment.\19\ Specifically, the budget 
request includes funding requests for sustainment and 
acquisition for several assets under PC&I which are broken down 
below.\20\

IN-SERVICE VESSEL SUSTAINMENT:

    Major Maintenance Availabilities (MMA) ensure in-service 
vessels continue to meet their designed service life through 
the recapitalization of hull, mechanical, electrical and 
electronic systems that have been identified as the highest 
contributors to maintenance costs and operational availability 
degradation.\21\ Service Life Extension Programs (SLEPs) 
increase the service life of in-service vessels without 
significantly modifying capabilities. The budget requests: $43 
million for 47-ft Motor Life Boat SLEP; $46.2 million for 270-
ft Medium Endurance Cutter SLEP; $17.8 million for 175-ft 
Coastal Buoy Tender MMA; and $13 million for CGC Healy 
SLEP.\22\

NATIONAL SECURITY CUTTER (NSC):

    The budget requests $17.1 million for class wide 
activities, post-delivery of an 11th NSC and program close-out 
costs.\23\ The Coast Guard's Program of Record (POR) originally 
called for eight NSCs to replace the Service's fleet of twelve 
high endurance cutters. The NSCs were originally intended to 
operate in excess of 185 days per year to maximize operational 
capability, but based on crewing and maintenance concerns, the 
Coast Guard now intends to operate the vessels for a maximum of 
185 days per year.\24\ Congress has funded eleven vessels. The 
tenth vessel is scheduled for delivery later this year.\25\

OFFSHORE PATROL CUTTER (OPC):

    The budget requests $579 million for the construction of 
OPC #6, and Long Lead Time Materials (LLTMs) for OPC #7.\26\ 
The Coast Guard's POR calls for 25 OPCs to replace the 
Service's aging fleet of 29 Medium Endurance Cutters

for a total of 65 FRCs to replace the Service's fleet of 110-ft 
Island Class Patrol Boats (WPBs). To date, 50 vessels have been 
commissioned into service.\28\ Delivery of hulls 51 through 54 
is anticipated to occur in FY 2023.\29\ Funding for an 
additional four FRCs is included in the Coast Guard's Unfunded 
Priority List (UPL), which would be hulls 66 through 69.\30\

the service's two heavy icebreakers--only one of which is still 
operational. The first PSC is expected to be delivered between 
2026 and 2027. The program has been subject to significant 
delays. At the end of last year, V.T. Halter Marine, the yard 
that was awarded the contract, was purchased by Bollinger 
Shipyards.\33\

approximately $271 million from the FY 2023 enacted level.\43\ 
The Coast Guard estimates that there is a $1 billion deferred 
shore facility maintenance backlog, while the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) approximated that number at $2.6 
billion in February 2019 (likely higher today), according to 
Coast Guard information.\44\ As of 2018, the deferred 
maintenance backlog included more than 5,600 projects, while 
the recapitalization and new construction backlog included 125 
projects.\45\ GAO's analysis of Coast Guard data found that as 
of November 2018, there were hundreds of recapitalization 
projects without cost estimates--representing a majority of 
recapitalization projects.\46\ Coast Guard officials told GAO 
that these projects were in the preliminary stages of 
development.\47\ From that report, the GAO recommended that the 
Commandant of the Coast Guard employ models for its asset lines 
to predict the outcome of investments, analyze trade-offs, and 
optimize decisions among competing investments.\48\ In addition 
to the amount included in their budget request, the Coast Guard 
included $694.3 million in their FY 2024 UPL for shore facility 
maintenance.\49\

     REVIEW OF FISCAL YEAR 2024 BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE COAST GUARD

                              ----------                              


                        TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 2023

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DANIEL WEBSTER OF FLORIDA, CHAIRMAN, 
    SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME TRANSPORTATION

    Mr. Webster of Florida. Today, we are convened to receive 
testimony from the Coast Guard on the fiscal year 2024 budget 
request. I would like to welcome our witnesses, Admiral Linda 
Fagan, the Commandant of the Coast Guard; and Master Chief 
Heath B. Jones, the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast 
Guard.
    Commandant, I certainly appreciated the trip through 
Florida and points south. I really had a great time, it was 
good, along with those that came with us during the district 
work week.
    Both of our witnesses actually started their tenure here 
just this last year. So, we welcome you both.
    As we examine the Coast Guard's fiscal year 2024 budget 
request, the Coast Guard continues to be spread thin. At a time 
when the Coast Guard has seen an ever-increasing demand for its 
services, I fear the headwinds of recruiting challenges and 
insufficient budget requests jeopardize the Service's ability 
to meet their mission's needs.
    While the President's budget includes an increase in 
operations and support, the procurement, construction, and 
improvements account--which pays for the new vessels, IT, and 
shoreside infrastructure investments you need to meet future 
missions--would be funded at less than half the level that 
Congress authorized last year if we were to enact the 
administration's request. The committee is deeply concerned 
about what it would mean to the future of mission capabilities.
    At the same time, like other Armed Forces, the Coast Guard 
is facing recruitment challenges. Those challenges are only 
expected to get worse in the coming years. This year, the 
expected shortfall is about 4,800 members. I look forward to 
hearing from you on what you are doing to address those 
challenges.
    As the Biden administration continues to pursue expansion 
of offshore wind energy production off our coast, I want to 
ensure the Coast Guard is taking its role as the primary 
Federal agency responsible for maritime navigation safety 
seriously, and that it is not merely being a rubber stamp for 
the Department of the Interior. Regrettably, it appears that 
the Coast Guard continues to implement the recommendation of 
the Atlantic Coast Port Route Study at a glacial pace, even 
after being directed by Congress to implement those 
recommendations.
    I am sure some of my colleagues will have questions about 
these efforts and whether we can expect any resolution in the 
near term.
    I also remain concerned about the security of our ports' 
infrastructure, especially as it relates to the Chinese cranes 
at our marine terminals and continued cyber intrusions that 
threaten our port operations. I look forward to hearing what 
the Coast Guard is doing to counter those threats from 
cyberattacks, transnational crime organizations, and bad state 
actors.
    Commandant Fagan, I understand that, per the Don Young 
Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022, the Department of 
Transportation has been given 90 days to request a transfer of 
LORAN towers from the Coast Guard. If no request is received, 
then the Coast Guard can proceed with disposition of the 
towers. I urge you not to provide DOT with any extension of 
this 90-day period. LORAN ceased operation in 2008. In fact, 
DOT has had not 90 days to make this decision, but they have 
had 15 years and 90 days, a long time. Time is not what is 
lacking, the ability to make a decision by DOT is what is 
lacking.
    On the final note, in 2016, Congress directed the Coast 
Guard to determine the portion of track 43 on St. Paul Island, 
Alaska, that the Service needed to be retained in order to 
carry out its reduced operational role on the island after the 
2008 closure of the LORAN facility on the island. The 
legislation further directed the Service to transfer the 
remainder of track 43 to the local Alaska Native Village 
Corporation.
    On June 13, 2017, within the statutory timeframe, the Coast 
Guard submitted to Congress a map of the portion of track 43 to 
be retained, and the portion which would be transferred. The 
statutory deadline for the transfer was August 13, 2017, 
roughly--a lot of days ago. The committee was surprised to 
learn recently that, only after asking the Service for a status 
of the transfer, that the transfer had never occurred, and the 
Coast Guard now intends to amend the boundary of the portion of 
track 43 to be transferred.
    The committee has no objection to amending the boundaries, 
assuming the amendment meets an operational Coast Guard need. 
However, by the close of business day, Friday, April 28th, I 
ask the Coast Guard to please provide committee staff with a 
briefing on the transfer, including a map showing the amended 
boundaries of the parcel proposed to be transferred. Do you 
think that could be accommodated?
    Admiral Fagan. Absolutely, Mr. Chairman. We look forward to 
accommodating that request.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you. Thank you for your 
participation today. I look forward to your testimony.
    [Mr. Webster of Florida's prepared statement follows:]

    Prepared Statement of Hon. Daniel Webster of Florida, Chairman, 
        Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
    Today we convene to receive testimony from the Coast Guard on its 
Fiscal Year 2024 budget request.
    I'd like to welcome our witnesses--Admiral Linda L. Fagan, the 
Commandant of the Coast Guard, and Master Chief Heath B. Jones, the 
Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard. Commandant, I certainly 
appreciated the opportunity to travel to Key West with you over the 
recent District Work Period. Both of our witnesses assumed their roles 
last year, and we welcome them both.

the Coast Guard continues to be spread thin. At a time when the Coast

    Mr. Webster of Florida. I now recognize Ranking Member 
Carbajal for an opening statement.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Chair Webster, for calling today's 
hearing on the fiscal year 2024 budget request for the U.S. 
Coast Guard.
    Before I provide my remarks, I want to ask for unanimous 
consent that Ranking Member Larsen's written statement be 
included in the record.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. So ordered.
    [Mr. Larsen of Washington's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen of Washington, Ranking Member, 
             Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
    Thank you, Chair Webster. The U.S. Coast Guard plays a vital role 
in safeguarding the efficient movement of goods in our marine 
transportation system and so much more. The women and men of the Coast 
Guard conduct search and rescue operations at sea, prevent the shipment 
of drugs across our maritime borders, and protect sovereignty in the 
Arctic and across the world.
    The Coast Guard is a lifesaving agency, a regulatory agency, a law 
enforcement agency, and a military agency. Each aspect is critical to 
our national and economic security.
    I would like to welcome Admiral Fagan and Master Chief Jones and 
commend you both for your leadership at the Coast Guard. I know 
Coasties pride themselves for doing a lot with a little but that needs 
to change.
    For fiscal year 2024 the Coast Guard has requested $13.5 billion, 
which represents a 3.6 percent increase over the 2023 enacted budget. 
While this may put the Coast Guard on a better path, we must do better. 
We cannot expect to have a big-league Coast Guard with little league 
funding.
    Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested 
reverting back to FY22 funding levels. Doing so would severely impact 
the Coast Guard causing them to halt their two highest priority 
acquisitions--the Offshore Patrol Cutter and Polar Security Cutter--
putting them further behind. Cutting Coast Guard funding would reduce 
operational readiness along our maritime borders and impact national 
security. We cannot allow this to happen.
    Fortunately, I believe that my Committee colleagues understand the 
importance of robust Coast Guard funding and I look forward to marking 
up a strong Coast Guard Authorization Act next week.
    Coast Guard members and their families are too often forced to live 
and work in dilapidated buildings and Coasties often work on cutters 
with out-of-date technology.
    Coasties stationed on cutters at sea should be able to call their 
families, Coast Guard cadets at the Coast Guard Academy should be able 
to sleep in rooms that are free of asbestos, and Coasties across the 
Service should have access to gender appropriate bathrooms.
    While I applaud the Coast Guard's efforts to modernize its 
recruitment plan, the best way to recruit and retain more service 
members is to support our Coasties.
    My primary concern is the deplorable, dilapidated buildings 
servicemembers must work and live in on a daily basis. Inadequate 
housing and childcare are a persistent complaint amongst 
servicemembers. If we want to increase retention and diversity, we must 
do more to support our Coast Guard members.
    I am concerned about the downward trend in recruiting. The Coast 
Guard needs to recruit over 4,000 service members in order to reach its 
recruiting goal. I look forward to an update on progress made to meet 
the 2023 recruitment goal.
    I am also concerned about the 35.6 percent decrease in funding 
requested for shore facilities and aids to navigation. This is 
particularly alarming considering the Coast Guard's estimated $3 
billion shoreside infrastructure maintenance backlog.
    This deficit has grown after many years of underfunding, and I want 
to know how the Coast Guard arrived at just $180 million needed to 
address the backlog.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses how the President's 
budget will ensure adequate resources for the Coast Guard, MARAD, the 
FMC, and all the programs that support and regulate the U.S. maritime 
industry.
    Finally, I'd like to take a minute to recognize the work the Coast 
Guard has done to help address sexual assault and sexual harassment in 
the commercial maritime industry. Since Congress enacted the Safer Seas 
Act in December, the Coast Guard has taken immediate action to ensure 
prompt implementation.
    The Service has created a centralized location for reporting of 
incidents, distributed information to industry on reporting 
requirements and associated penalties, and opened new investigations 
and prosecutions under the new authority. The Coast Guard has to be 
candid with its needs and Congress must provide the necessary 
resources.
    I will be watching closely as the Coast Guard completes 
implementation of the Safer Seas Act.
    Thank you and I yield back.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL OF CALIFORNIA, 
   RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON COAST GUARD AND MARITIME 
                         TRANSPORTATION

    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
    Admiral Fagan and Master Chief Jones, thank you for being 
here today, and thank you for your service. Your leadership is 
instrumental in supporting Coasties, and you have done an 
outstanding job leading the Service. I am confident that the 
Coast Guard has a bright future ahead under your experienced 
guidance.
    As has been mentioned, the Coast Guard performs many 
important roles that are critical for maintaining our national 
and economic security. From ensuring navigable waterways to 
securing our borders and the safety of life at sea, the Coast 
Guard's mission set is very diverse. We expect a lot from our 
Coasties, and this oftentimes requires them to wear multiple 
hats. For instance, a drug interdiction can quickly turn into a 
search and rescue mission. While the Coast Guard's 
responsibilities have expanded, its budget has not.
    I was pleased that the fiscal year 2024 budget request 
included a slight increase in the discretionary funding, but 
more resources are still needed to support the Service.
    I am pleased that the Coast Guard has been able to replace 
much of its 40-year-old surface fleet and aircraft. Last 
Congress, I was proud to support the Don Young Coast Guard 
Authorization Act of 2022, which authorized substantial funding 
to address long-overdue vessel and equipment replacement, as 
well as shoreside infrastructure repair. Unfortunately, these 
levels were not matched in the fiscal year 2022 budget.
    Aside from the new assets and upgraded facilities, there 
are other ways to improve the lives of servicemembers, both on 
land and at sea. I have heard from servicemembers across the 
country about mental health concerns. Their job can take a 
physical and mental toll, which is only exacerbated by a 4,000 
servicemember deficit. We must do more not only to expand 
mental health services, but also to improve the quality of life 
for servicemembers, especially those in isolated locations, 
some of which I have visited.
    Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention the Coast 
Guard's efforts to address sexual assault and harassment in the 
commercial maritime industry. I was an original cosponsor of 
the Safer Seas Act, and I am glad to see that the Coast Guard 
has acted swiftly to implement the important reforms passed 
last Congress. We have a long way to go, but I believe under 
Admiral Fagan's leadership, we will bring justice to victims 
and help protect future mariners from harm.
    I look forward to today's testimonies and discussions about 
how Congress can support a robust Coast Guard.

                                 <F-dash>
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Salud O. Carbajal of California, Ranking 
    Member, Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation
    Thank you, Chair Webster, for calling today's hearing on the fiscal 
year 2024 budget request for the U.S. Coast Guard.
    Admiral Fagan and Master Chief Jones, thank you for being here 
today and thank you for your service. Your leadership is instrumental 
in supporting Coasties and you've done an outstanding job leading the 
Service. I'm confident that the Coast Guard has a bright future ahead 
under your experienced guidance.
    As has been mentioned, the Coast Guard performs many important 
roles that are critical for maintaining our national and economic 
security. From ensuring navigable waterways to securing our borders and 
the safety of life at sea, the Coast Guard's mission set is diverse.
    We expect a lot from our Coasties and this often requires them to 
wear multiple hats--for instance, a drug interdiction can quickly turn 
into a search and rescue mission. While the Coast Guard's 
responsibilities have expanded, its budget has not.
    I was pleased that the fiscal year 2024 budget request included a 
slight increase in discretionary funding, but more resources are still 
needed to support the Service.
    I'm pleased that the Coast Guard has been able to replace much of 
its 40-year-old surface fleet and aircraft. Last Congress, I was proud 
to support the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022, which 
authorized substantial funding to address long overdue vessel and 
equipment replacement, as well as shoreside infrastructure repair. 
Unfortunately, these levels were not matched in the final FY22 budget.
    Aside from new assets and upgraded facilities, there are other ways 
to improve the lives of servicemembers, both on land and at sea. I've 
heard from servicemembers across the country about mental health 
concerns. Their job can take a physical and mental toll which is only 
exacerbated by 4,000 service member deficit.
    We must do more not only to expand mental health services, but also 
to improve the quality of life for service members, especially those in 
isolated locations.
    Finally, I'd be remiss if I did not mention the Coast Guard's 
efforts to address sexual assault and sexual harassment in the 
commercial maritime industry.
    I was an original cosponsor of the Safer Seas Act and am glad to 
see that the Coast Guard has acted swiftly to implement the important 
reforms passed last Congress. We have a long way to go, but I believe 
under Admiral Fagan's leadership, we will bring justice to victims and 
help protect future mariners from harm.
    I look forward to today's testimonies and discussions about how 
Congress can support a robust Coast Guard.

    Mr. Carbajal. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. I would now like to welcome our 
witnesses and thank them for being here today.
    I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements 
be included in the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    As your written testimony has been made part of the record, 
the committee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5 
minutes.
    With that, Admiral Fagan, you are recognized for 5 minutes 
of testimony.

  TESTIMONY OF ADMIRAL LINDA L. FAGAN, COMMANDANT, U.S. COAST 
  GUARD; AND MASTER CHIEF HEATH B. JONES, MASTER CHIEF PETTY 
          OFFICER OF THE COAST GUARD, U.S. COAST GUARD

        TESTIMONY OF ADMIRAL LINDA L. FAGAN, COMMANDANT,
                        U.S. COAST GUARD

    Admiral Fagan. Good afternoon, Chairman Webster. Thank you, 
Ranking Member Carbajal, distinguished members of the 
subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, 
and thank you for entering my written testimony into the 
record.
    On behalf of the entire Service, thank you for your 
continued support of the United States Coast Guard. With the 
funding provided in 2023 appropriation, we are continuing our 
largest fleet recapitalization in decades, building vital shore 
infrastructure and supporting our workforce and their families.
    The world is changing, and the pace of that change is 
accelerating. Our commitments to defend, protect, and save grow 
every day, and demand for the Service around the globe has 
never been higher. In these challenges, there is an 
opportunity, and we must invest in 2024 and beyond to generate 
sustained readiness, resilience, and capability to build the 
Coast Guard of the future.
    The Coast Guard workforce is my highest priority. But like 
other branches of the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard is 
experiencing a workforce shortage. We are struggling to recruit 
the people we need to hire into our ranks every year. Our 
recruiting shortfall threatens our readiness, threatens our 
ability to serve the American people. We must invest not just 
in workforce recruiting capacity, but in support initiatives to 
meet mission: healthcare, childcare, and housing.
    We are a global Coast Guard. And as we continue to invest 
in the homeland, we also serve to counter strategic competition 
around the world. The Coast Guard serves as the Nation's 
surface presence in the Arctic and Antarctica, and our fleet of 
only two polar icebreakers does not deliver the high-latitude 
presence we require as an Arctic nation. The fiscal year 2024 
budget requests funding to grow the Coast Guard's icebreaking 
capacity to enable a shift from episodic presence to year-round 
presence in the high latitudes.
    Every Coast Guard mission begins and ends at a shore 
facility. To generate readiness, retain our workforce, and 
support our families, we must maintain and modernize our 
buildings, piers, housing, and other infrastructure. The Coast 
Guard requires stable, predictable shore infrastructure funding 
to ensure facilities are ready when new assets arrive, and 
personnel have the space they need to support the recapitalized 
fleet.
    Consistent funding is vital for us to recapitalize our many 
antiquated stations, sectors, training centers, air stations, 
and housing, some of which were built in the late 1800s. The 
fiscal year 2024 budget includes funding to build out Base 
Charleston and to complete construction of future cutter home 
ports in Washington and Alaska.
    My vision of a $20 billion Coast Guard in 2033 includes 
$400 to $500 million a year to accomplish this infrastructure 
work. And I am certain you will not find a better return on 
investment for the American people than the United States Coast 
Guard. I ask for your continued support to ensure that the 
Nation's Coast Guard, like every U.S. Armed Force, has the 
resources necessary to safeguard the Nation.
    I appreciate the committee's enduring support. Thank you 
for the opportunity to testify this afternoon, and I look 
forward to your questions. Thank you.
    [Admiral Fagan's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
       Prepared Statement of Admiral Linda L. Fagan, Commandant,
                            U.S. Coast Guard
                              Introduction
    Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and distinguished 
Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify and I 
am grateful for your continuing support of the United States Coast 
Guard. Today, I look forward to discussing how the Administration's FY 
2024 Budget request positions the Service to generate sustained 
readiness, resilience, and capability while building the Coast Guard of 
the future.
    As the world's premier, multi-mission, maritime service responsible 
for the safety, security and stewardship of the Nation's waters, the 
Coast Guard offers a unique and enduring value to the American public. 
At all times a military service and branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, a 
federal law enforcement agency, a first responder, a regulatory body, 
and a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community, the Coast Guard serves 
on the front lines for a Nation whose economic prosperity and national 
security are inextricably linked to the sea.
    Last year, your Coast Guard navigated unique challenges presented 
by our increasingly connected and rapidly changing world. Throughout 
the course of FY 2022, the Service saved or assisted over 24,000 
people, removed over 335,000 pounds of cocaine and 60,000 pounds of 
marijuana with an approximate wholesale value of $4.2 billion, provided 
humanitarian assistance to over 12,500 non-citizens intercepted at sea, 
inspected over 15,000 shipping containers for structural and hazardous 
material compliance, maintained nearly 45,000 buoys and beacons across 
the Marine Transportation System, conducted over 10,000 waterborne 
patrols to protect critical infrastructure and key resources, and 
provided nearly 21,000 hours of support to U.S. Central Command to 
advance security cooperation, maritime security, and counter-piracy 
objectives in the Arabian Gulf.
    In the aftermath of Hurricanes Ian, Fiona, and Nicole, Coast Guard 
personnel from across the country surged to Puerto Rico, Florida, 
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia where we saved or 
assisted nearly 1,000 persons in distress, responded to pollution 
incidents, and reopened vital ports and waterways to help communities 
recover.
    In the Antarctic, Coast Guard Cutter (CGC) Polar Star, the Nation's 
only heavy polar icebreaker, created a navigable path through thick ice 
to enable the annual replenishment of America's McMurdo Station. In the 
Great Lakes, CGC Mackinaw--the Coast Guard's only heavy domestic 
icebreaker--opened passages to facilitate commercial shipping across 
the region.
    In the Indo-Pacific, 418-foot National Security Cutters and 154-
foot Fast Response Cutters conducted combined operations and exercises 
with allied and partner nations to counter Illegal, Unreported, and 
Unregulated fishing and facilitate interoperability with like-minded 
nations throughout the region. In the Caribbean, the Coast Guard surged 
assets from across the Atlantic seaboard to respond, in coordination 
with other federal agencies, to historic irregular maritime migration 
on our southern maritime border.
    While I remain incredibly proud of our Coast Guard Active Duty, 
Reserve, Civilian, and Auxiliary workforce, we must adapt to ensure the 
accelerating pace of change does not overtake our ability to protect, 
defend, and save the American public we serve. Geopolitical 
competition, economic volatility, climate change impacts, shifting 
workforce expectations, evolving technologies, and new enterprises at 
sea are converging and driving changes we must make for our Service.
    The FY 2024 President's Budget is the first step in advancing our 
efforts to transform our total workforce, sharpen our competitive edge, 
and advance our mission excellence as we build the Coast Guard of the 
future. These investments are vital to ensuring the Service has the 
assets, systems, infrastructure, and support needed to further the 
Nation's maritime safety, security, and prosperity.
        Generate Sustained Readiness, Resilience, and Capability
Transform our Total Workforce
    A shrinking American workforce combined with changing expectations 
by both employees and employers is driving significant challenges in 
recruiting and hiring. American workers seek flexibility, innovation, 
purpose, and desire employers who foster a workplace where all people 
are respected and empowered.
    My highest priority is to modernize our talent management system, 
which has not significantly changed in 75 years, to best recruit and 
retain our workforce in the 21st century. I am committed to deploying 
innovative recruiting practices; revolutionizing talent management 
policies; developing individually tailored, on-demand, and modernized 
learning; and delivering point of need healthcare and family services.
    The FY 2024 budget requests $273 million in military and civilian 
pay and benefits; $21 million to increase retention, bolster medical 
services, improve the Service's training systems, and better support 
the workforce; as well as $12 million to enhance the Coast Guard's 
recruiting capability by funding additional recruiting personnel and 
nine new recruiting offices.
Sharpen our Competitive Edge
    New and rapid advancements are making access to technology 
ubiquitous. These technological advancements expose global systems and 
people to modern threats, including growing cybersecurity concerns, 
supply chain disruptions, and navigation vulnerabilities. However, 
emerging technologies also present novel opportunities to maintain a 
competitive edge over malign actors.
    To accomplish the broad spectrum of Coast Guard missions, we will 
leverage new technology to enable rapid information sharing and provide 
decision advantage to our operational commanders. Smart application of 
advanced data analysis capabilities will enable us to make the best 
decisions as we inspect new commercial vessels, search for overdue 
recreational boaters, bolster our talent management system, and seek to 
disrupt the flow of illicit drugs across our maritime border.
    The FY 2024 budget requests $49 million to sustain enterprise 
collaboration tools, search and rescue IT systems, and C5I capabilities 
on board operational assets. Additionally, the budget includes $15 
million for data analytic technology development, improving how data is 
collected, analyzed, and leveraged to empower operations and support 
the workforce. Requested funding also supports the rapid development of 
mobile applications and bolsters telework capabilities.
Advance our Mission Excellence
    The Coast Guard operates in dynamic conditions, and changes in the 
strategic environment impact our missions every day. Given evolving 
national security threats, we must prepare now for the challenges of 
tomorrow.
    We will employ our assets and resources to the highest priority 
missions that we are uniquely capable to perform, build on our ability 
to lead in crisis, strengthen existing and forge new partnerships to 
improve global maritime governance, and safeguard a rapidly changing 
Marine Transportation System.
    The FY 2024 budget requests $77 million for the operations, 
maintenance, crew, and mission support elements for four Fast Response 
Cutters; operations and maintenance for the second Offshore Patrol 
Cutter; crew, operations, and maintenance for a commercially available 
polar icebreaker; crew for the first Waterways Commerce Cutter; and 
crew, operations, and maintenance for four MH-60T helicopters, one HC-
130J aircraft, and one HC-27J aircraft. Additionally, the budget 
includes $18 million for the operations and maintenance of newly 
acquired or recapitalized shore facilities.
                  Build the Coast Guard of the Future
    The Service continues our largest recapitalization effort since 
World War II--vital to providing the capable, modern assets necessary 
to meet the unprecedented demand for Coast Guard services. 
Additionally, the Coast Guard continues to prioritize investments in 
our shore infrastructure because our facilities, piers, runways, and 
the buildings where our people eat and sleep while standing duty are as 
critical for operations as our ships and aircraft.
Surface
    With the continued strong support of both the Administration and 
Congress, we are acquiring the Nation's first new heavy polar 
icebreakers in almost half a century. The FY 2024 request of $170 
million sustains the program and procures an additional portion of 
long-lead time materials for the third Polar Security Cutter (PSC). 
When fully operational, PSCs will provide the global reach and 
icebreaking capability necessary to advance our national interests in 
the Arctic and Antarctic regions, projecting U.S. sovereignty and 
influence while conducting Coast Guard statutory missions in the high 
latitudes.
    The FY 2024 request also funds the acquisition of a commercially 
available polar icebreaker, including the modifications and integrated 
logistics support required to reach initial operating capability for 
Coast Guard missions. The purchase and modification of a commercially 
available polar icebreaker represents an effective strategy to increase 
near-term presence in the Arctic until the PSC fleet is operational and 
to add regional capacity in the long-term.
    The Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC) is one of the Service's highest 
acquisition priorities and is absolutely vital to recapitalizing the 
capability provided by our legacy fleet of 210-foot and 270-foot Medium 
Endurance Cutters (MEC). The FY 2024 request provides $579 million for 
construction of the sixth OPC and long lead time materials for the 
seventh of a program of record for 25 hulls. The legacy assets the 
OPC's will replace have been workhorses for decades and continue to 
serve the Nation with distinction. With 13 of these cutters exceeding 
50 years of Service, the MEC fleet is becoming more difficult and 
expensive to maintain, and we continue to see degradation in its 
operational availability.
    Some of our inland tenders have been in service since the 1940s, 
maintaining both fixed and floating aids to navigation for the U.S. 
Marine Transportation System--the 25,000 miles of rivers and navigable 
channels that support $5.4 trillion in annual commerce and 31 million 
jobs. The FY 2024 request for $98 million supports program management, 
long lead time material for future hulls, and construction of the first 
article of the Waterways Commerce Cutter fleet. These cutters--which 
will replace our legacy inland tender fleet--will feature modern 
designs for propulsion and crew habitability to enable men and women to 
serve in the heartland.
Aviation Assets
    The FY 2024 request includes $115M to recapitalize and sustain 
fixed and rotary-wing aircraft, including: sustainment of the current 
MH-60T helicopter fleet; modernization and sustainment of the Coast 
Guard's MH-65 helicopter fleet to improve reliability into the 2030s, 
align recapitalization efforts with DoD's Future Vertical Lift program 
and transition to an all MH-60 fleet; and continued missionization of 
HC-27J medium-range surveillance aircraft.
Shore Infrastructure
    Shore facility maintenance and recapitalization is critical to 
mission success. As the Service deploys new, more capable assets, 
infrastructure projects like pier construction and workforce facilities 
are equally vital. The FY 2024 request includes targeted investments to 
continue the buildout of Base Charleston, South Carolina, funds the 
construction of a Fast Response Cutter homeport in Seward, Alaska, and 
funds construction of a Waterways Commerce Cutter homeport.
    Given the Coast Guard's broad infrastructure needs, these 
investments and a modern approach to project planning, prioritizing, 
and execution are necessary to ensure the Service has the adequately 
maintained and resilient infrastructure required to meet the 
operational demands of today and tomorrow.
                               Conclusion
    The Coast Guard is the only military Service outside the Department 
of Defense and the only Armed Force that is primarily funded via non-
defense appropriations. Not funding the Coast Guard at the levels 
requested in this budget could jeopardize the long-term readiness of 
the Service, putting American lives, national security, and the U.S. 
Marine Transportation System at risk. I ask for your support to ensure 
the Coast Guard--like every U.S. Armed Force--has the resources 
necessary to safeguard the Nation.
    Now is the time to move the U.S. Coast Guard forward. Our 
commitments at home to protect, defend, and save--grow every day, while 
demand for the Service around the globe has never been higher. To meet 
the rising challenges, we must invest to secure the homeland and 
counter strategic competitors.
    With the support of the Administration and Congress, your Coast 
Guard will continue to live up to our motto--Semper Paratus--Always 
Ready. Thank you for your enduring support.

    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you. Next we have Master 
Chief Jones.
    You are recognized.

 TESTIMONY OF MASTER CHIEF HEATH B. JONES, MASTER CHIEF PETTY 
          OFFICER OF THE COAST GUARD, U.S. COAST GUARD

    Master Chief Jones. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good 
afternoon, Chairman Webster, Ranking Member Carbajal, and 
distinguished subcommittee members. It is an honor to appear 
before you as a Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard.
    As I begin, I would like to express my sincere appreciation 
alongside Admiral Fagan and on behalf of our dedicated Coast 
Guard personnel for your unwavering support.
    The Coast Guard workforce is the heart and soul of our 
organization, and their dedication and sacrifice keep our 
Nation safe and secure. Every day, Coast Guard sentinels put 
their lives on the line to protect our Nation's maritime 
borders, respond to emergencies, and ensure the safety of all 
Marine Transportation System users. These highly skilled 
members execute a broad array of missions which require modern 
resources to recruit, train, and to retain them.
    As we discuss the future of the Coast Guard, my primary 
focus is on our sentinels, specifically the Service's ability 
to attract and retain the talented individuals necessary to 
effectively carry out the critical missions our Nation demands 
and our Nation deserves. The Coast Guard is a relatively small 
force, and we compete with other branches of the military and 
Federal agencies to attract and retain talented individuals.
    The Coast Guard's recent recruiting initiatives include 
opening 10 new recruiting offices, leveraging innovative 
technology to reach potential recruits, initiating 4 new JROTC 
programs, and developing the Scout Talent and Refer program to 
incentivize servicemembers to tell the Coast Guard story. We 
are applying a comprehensive workforce approach to this effort.
    The fiscal year 2024 recruiting request will enhance the 
Coast Guard's recruiting ability, while ensuring our members 
continue to excel at their demanding missions.
    The Coast Guard is more than a military service. We are a 
closely bonded community. Our Coast Guard families are 
paramount. Their altruistic sacrifices and constant support are 
imperative to achieving our missions. The Coast Guard can 
continue to retain our members and their families by providing 
affordable housing, access to quality mental and physical 
healthcare, competitive compensation, and modernized 
infrastructure. These issues are vital to our workforce and 
vital to their families.
    I want to express my sincere gratitude to Congress for 
enacting the Veterans Auto and Education Improvement Act, 
mandating that States recognize the professional licenses of 
military members and their spouses from other States, 
alleviating the burden of relocating every 3 to 4 years. This 
initiative is a key example of Congress' support of our 
military and of their families.
    While I acknowledge that those that join the Service are 
not primarily motivated by financial gain, it is essential to 
recognize that they may be more likely to leave for a better 
compensation elsewhere. The fiscal year 2024 pay raise is a 
good step in the right direction and is the largest increase 
since 2002. To ensure that we continue to be an employer of 
choice, we must continue to invest in the basic pay scale.
    The birthplace of our enlisted workforce is Training Center 
Cape May. While we are thankful for the recent support of 
Congress to recapitalize the first barracks, the current 
facilities inhibit the ability to continuously train recruits 
to a significant service standard throughout the year. 
Therefore, the Service needs a modernized training facility to 
develop the most resilient and fleet-ready sentinels. To this 
end, the Coast Guard has included a multipurpose training 
facility at Cape May as part of our unfunded priorities list in 
fiscal year 2024.
    Rest assured that your Coast Guard remains steadfast in its 
dedication to attracting and retaining skilled sentinels that 
are empowered to protect, to defend, and to save.
    Again, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you, 
and I look forward to answering your questions.
    [Master Chief Jones did not submit a prepared statement.]
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you so much. And we now turn 
to questions from the panel. I get to be first, so, I will ask 
my first question to the Commandant.
    What are the capability or resource gaps that exist? Which 
ones, or which one, even, is the most important to you? And how 
are you working with DHS to address those?
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I remain committed 
to increasing the capacity and capabilities of the Coast Guard, 
and remain focused around workforce and, again, acknowledge and 
appreciate the enduring support of the committee.
    When you look at the fiscal year 2024 budget, President's 
budget, there is great support for frontline operating capacity 
in the budget and investment in infrastructure, piers, 
buildings, IT. The President's budget, 2024 budget, in 
conjunction with our unfunded priority list request, does a 
good job capturing the infrastructure and investments needed 
across the organization.
    Ensuring that Coast Guard members, as we field these state-
of-the-art new cutters and aircraft, that Coast Guard members 
have adequate facilities to return to. Every Coast Guard 
operation starts and stops at a piece of shore infrastructure. 
So, ensuring that not only are we building the new capacity 
docks to field those cutters, that we are updating the aging 
capacity at stations and otherwise, so that our Coast Guard men 
and women can operate from state-of-the-art facilities. Thank 
you.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Until this past time we were down 
there in Key West, I didn't realize they also were passenger 
ships, the cutters. They were saying hauled over 125, 115--
something like that--people. So, maybe there needs to be some 
slight modification for that. I don't know.
    But anyway, the budget request includes $98 million in 
procurement funding for the Waterways Commerce Cutter program 
to replace the Coast Guard's aging inland tender fleet, some of 
which are approaching 80 years old. Do you expect the first WCC 
to be operational by 2025?
    Admiral Fagan. We appreciate the funding and support in the 
fiscal year 2024 President's budget. Ninety-eight million 
dollars will provide for two Waterways Commerce Cutters with 
long lead-time funding for an additional two. This begins to 
help us replace, as you said, those aging cutters.
    We also have on our UPL an additional $48 million for home 
port investments that will be needed as we field those cutters. 
We are on contract, and look forward to begin building the 
Waterways Commerce Cutters. They are not a particularly 
complicated cutter, and should begin to come into operation 
fairly quickly. They are critical to our Nation's economic 
security, the $5.4 trillion of maritime commerce, economic 
prosperity that the Nation enjoys, and the engine for much of 
that is the internal waterways, the rivers and the countries, 
in addition to our ports.
    So, getting that Waterways Commerce Cutter built and into 
operation is a priority, and we appreciate the budget support 
for that. Thank you.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Commandant, the Port of Los Angeles 
has stated that they face over 40 million cyberattacks per 
month. At the same time, Chinese-manufactured cranes have the 
potential to do some sort of surveillance--not that I know what 
it would be, but they could gather information on the goods and 
services being performed at the ports.
    So, do you see an additional resource for cyber, including 
R&D funds, to improve capabilities? Can you talk about that?
    Admiral Fagan. The U.S. Coast Guard, in our regulatory 
agency role, as we work with port facilities, ships in our 
ports, cyber is part of that remit and oversight.
    We have been on a path of investment as an organization, 
both in cyber experts--we have recently established a cyber 
specialty in our enlisted ranks. We have been hiring civilian 
professionals at the district level who not only understand the 
maritime transportation industry, but are also experts in cyber 
as we work alongside our CISA counterparts within DHS to ensure 
that the Nation has the cyber expertise and cybersecurity 
needed, and we are focused in our role in the maritime realm in 
that regard. Thank you.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. OK, so, my time is gone, so, I will 
yield back nothing.
    I recognize you, Mr. Carbajal.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thought you were 
going to yield the chairmanship, so, I got excited there for a 
minute.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Carbajal. Admiral Fagan, June will mark 1 year since 
you assumed the Commandant position. At that time, you vowed to 
do a thorough review of the Coast Guard's policies in an effort 
to attract more servicemembers, increase diversity, address 
mental health, and generally make life better for our Coasties. 
Can you share how that is going and any policy changes that you 
have made or are working on making?
    Admiral Fagan. We have embarked on a substantial review and 
update of many of our workforce and talent management systems 
and processes. We currently operate an up or an out system, as 
the other Services do, where you take junior people with no 
experience in at the bottom, and progress them through a career 
to gain experience and professional requirements.
    We have begun doing things like agile ``A'' school. We 
recently had a member join the Coast Guard who was a 
credentialed paramedic, so, substantial medical training, 
licensing credential. That individual came to us, completed 
boot camp, and when we sent them to our medical training 
school, we worked to develop a customized program to 
acknowledge the substantial experience the individual already 
had, and speed them out to the fleet. The member is currently 
serving the clinic in Station New York much sooner than we 
would have been able to, otherwise.
    So, that is just one example of increasing flexibility, 
nimbleness, and recognizing the talent pool that we are drawing 
into the Service as we continue to focus on our recruiting 
needs. Thank you.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
    Master Chief Jones, issues faced by enlisted Coasties are 
often different from those of officers. I was an enlisted in 
the Marine Corps. What are the top three concerns or issues you 
hear from enlisted members, and what is the Coast Guard doing 
to address those issues?
    Master Chief Jones. Congressman, routinely, no matter where 
we travel in the Coast Guard, the top three issues that I hear 
are: access to available and affordable housing; access to 
mental and physical healthcare; and then just kind of lumped in 
on the third is just general overall cost of living, whether it 
be base pay, whether it be affordable childcare, and those 
types of approaches.
    So, we have many things that we are working on when it 
comes to the housing. There are some areas, smaller, more 
remote areas where we are investing in Coast Guard-owned 
housing. There are areas where we do have the availability of 
access to DoD base housing, working in cooperation with access 
there. And the other areas where it is not available, there is 
not military housing there, working with DoD to ensure that we 
have comparable housing allowance rates to afford our members 
the housing they deserve.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
    Admiral Fagan, with the passage of the Safer Seas Act, the 
Coast Guard is tasked with implementing several new authorities 
and requirements for industry. Prompt implementation and 
enforcement is extremely important.
    Separately, the Coast Guard has yet to implement the man-
overboard requirements included in the CVSSA 13 years ago. I 
know that was before your time assuming the Commandant 
position.
    When should we expect to see these regulations?
    And can you commit to an expeditious implementation of the 
Safer Seas requirements? I would say 13 years is a long time.
    Admiral Fagan. I commit to continuing to work through the 
regulatory process. I know how challenging regulatory work is. 
It is important work. We have a role in it. I commit to you to 
continue to advance that important work.
    Passenger vessel safety and ship safety is critical, and 
the Coast Guard absolutely has a role in moving critical 
issues, such as the one you mentioned, forward.
    Mr. Carbajal. Is there any way to expedite that a little 
bit to see the end of the tunnel?
    Admiral Fagan. So, I will ask my staff to come back and 
give you a more realistic timeline on when we could expect to 
see that come to a closure. But I agree, we have been at it for 
some time, and we need to continue to move that regulatory 
project forward.
    Mr. Carbajal. Great. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Babin, you are recognized for 5 
minutes.
    Dr. Babin. Thank you very much.
    And thank you, Admiral.
    And Mr. Jones, thank you so much for being here, Master 
Chief.
    From protecting our ports and waterways to assisting our 
communities during hurricanes, the Coast Guard is a well-known, 
vital component of my district in southeast Texas and the gulf 
coast. I proudly represent both Coast Guard Sector Houston-
Galveston and Air Station Houston, each housed at Ellington 
Field in southeast Houston.
    Admiral Fagan, my first few questions are for you. If we 
can't get through everything, I hope you don't mind that I will 
have them submitted.
    As the Coast Guard looks to transition to an MH-60 rotary-
wing fleet, I understand that the Coast Guard is slowly phasing 
out many of its aging MH-65s, with the intention of reducing 
its overall rotary-wing fleet from 146 to 126 aircraft.
    Air Station Houston currently hosts three MH-65 Dolphin 
helicopters. I understand the current plan is to phase these 
three helicopters out and replace them with just two MH-60s. 
While I recognize that the MH-60 is a very capable platform 
compared with the MH-65, I have concerns that reducing the 
number of airframes in service may impact the Coast Guard's 
operational capabilities.
    Presumably, with fewer aircraft at an air station, it would 
be more challenging to respond to multiple search and rescue 
missions, drug interdictions, or patrols, given that a single 
helicopter can only be in one place at one time. And I don't 
anticipate drug runners will be idling their boats while they 
wait for the helicopters to arrive. We can't ask folks to just 
tread water while they await assistance.
    How does the Coast Guard plan to maintain its operational 
capabilities with less operational assets?
    Admiral Fagan. We are in the process of transitioning away 
from the H-65 fleet of aircraft. They have definitely reached 
their age limits. And so, there is an imperative around moving 
to a single fleet of H-60 helicopters. These aircraft have far 
more range and speed than the helicopters that they are 
replacing. And so, continuing the funding support necessary to 
field 60s becomes critical, and we appreciate where we are with 
it.
    We have got a request in the UPL for $113 million to field 
additional 60s. Right now, we have indicated a transition to at 
least 127, but we continue to look at the helicopter fleet we 
have in place now, what the capabilities are that the new 60s 
bring into the mix, and then understand that we do have an 
obligation to continue to meet response times, search and 
rescue requirements for the American public. This is lifesaving 
work, and we are committed to meeting those requirements. We 
continue to work towards identifying what that right number and 
mix looks like.
    Dr. Babin. OK. In a report shared with the committee last 
May regarding the Coast Guard's interdiction of illicit drugs 
in transit zones, the report shares that the Coast Guard was 
able to intercept about 10 percent of the cocaine flow coming 
into the United States. In the report, the Coast Guard notes 
that the level of effort toward this mission is assessed as 
adequate, given the boundary conditions of balancing the 
execution of other statutory missions and workforce and 
material readiness.
    I assume the Coast Guard is not satisfied with a 10-percent 
interdiction rate. My takeaway from that is that you have too 
few resources to adequately carry out your growing mission set. 
What are some of the factors that would improve the Coast 
Guard's ability to carry out its drug interdiction mission, and 
would you acknowledge that additional surface assets could help 
the Coast Guard improve its mission effectiveness?
    And if so, why does the President's budget not include 
resources for additional FRCs?
    Admiral Fagan. The counternarcotics mission that the Coast 
Guard conducts on behalf of the Nation requires a force package 
of asset types: ship, over-the-horizon pursuit boat, helicopter 
with airborne use of force capacity. Fielding new assets that 
are more reliable and don't experience the unplanned 
maintenance periods that the current aging fleet of helicopters 
and ships are experiencing is a priority for the Service, that 
the ships and equipment we have out on vector are more 
reliable.
    We continue to partner with other international partners in 
engagement to ensure that we are meeting that mission demand. 
The FRCs have been an incredibly helpful platform as we meet 
our counternarcotics mission.
    Dr. Babin. OK, thank you.
    We are going to have two rounds today, is that right, two 
rounds of questions? OK. Well, because I have got some for the 
master chief, too. Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Garamendi.
    Mr. Garamendi. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations, 
this being your first--not your first hearing, but your first 
one on readiness and the state of the Coast Guard.
    When we were chatting a couple of months ago, we covered a 
whole series of issues. In my previous tenure on this I got to 
be known as somebody that was concerned about icebreakers. 
Could you bring me up to date on the status of the heavy 
icebreaker that presumably is being built?
    Admiral Fagan. We are on budget, on contract for a Polar 
Security Cutter. The 2024 budget includes $170 million, which 
will be long lead-time material for a third Polar Security 
Cutter.
    The yard that we contracted with was recently purchased. It 
is now Bollinger Mississippi. We continue to work closely with 
the yard to get to the correct level of maturity on detailed 
design.
    Mr. Garamendi. You are being--excuse me for interrupting. 
Tell me exactly what is happening. Put the happy talk aside. 
This is not going well.
    Admiral Fagan. We are----
    Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. The original contractor went 
belly up. You have got a new contractor in. There are all kinds 
of design problems. Lay it out here so that we can participate 
in solving the problem.
    Admiral Fagan. I am confident in the design, and I am 
confident in the yard.
    We have got work to do to mature that design. We have not 
built an icebreaker in this Nation since the mid-1970s. This is 
an incredibly complex ship to build. The steel thicknesses, the 
scantlings will take effort to ensure that the design is at the 
right level of maturity.
    If we begin constructing before there is an appropriate 
level of design, that will continue to delay reaching full 
operating capacity with the vessel downstream. We are engaged 
with that yard, and in the planning process through the 
Integrated Planning Office with the Navy. This is a weekly 
conversation. Everyone understands the sense of urgency. This 
is a critical national security need for the country. We need 
icebreaking capacity as a Nation. We are an Arctic nation, we 
need that icebreaking capacity in the Arctic, and we are 
committed to working with the yard.
    I am 100 percent confident in the design as we begin to 
build it, that it will be the capability that the Nation needs.
    Mr. Garamendi. So, when will the design be completed?
    Admiral Fagan. I continue to--I don't have a--I would give 
you a date if I had one. I don't have a definitive date from my 
team. I am hopeful we will have one soon. As soon as we have 
that, I will share it with the committee. And once we have got 
that level of design maturity, we will begin to put estimates 
around what the actual----
    Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. So, we don't know when the 
design is going to be completed. Do you have some idea in which 
decade it might actually be built?
    Admiral Fagan. The design will be completed soon. I am 
optimistic. Once we begin to build the ship, it is a complex 
ship, and it will take a number of years to build.
    Mr. Garamendi. So, which decade?
    Admiral Fagan. I do not want to put a date out there. Once 
we have the detailed design, it will be several years, 3-plus, 
to get the completion on that ship.
    Mr. Garamendi. So, what is your interim plan?
    Admiral Fagan. We have money, if it is appropriated in the 
President's budget, for $125 million for a commercially 
available icebreaker. If it is appropriated, we are excited 
about what that capability brings to the Nation. We would 
operate it on--we would operate that icebreaker, and look 
forward to working with the committee for bringing that----
    Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. So, you have identified an 
icebreaker that is out there for sale?
    Admiral Fagan. There is an icebreaker available. Should we 
receive an appropriation, we will continue to work to see what 
is required to acquire that.
    Mr. Garamendi. We have been at this a long time in this 
committee, and the inability of the Coast Guard to get this 
even started is a major national security problem. And frankly, 
your answers are not satisfactory. I would hope that this 
committee would be given specific detail.
    You didn't tell us where that ship is. Have you looked at 
renting, leasing long-term icebreakers?
    Admiral Fagan. There is one U.S.-constructed, commercially 
available icebreaker. We have worked with the committee for 
language to ease the acquisition of that icebreaker. When we 
have considered leasing of other icebreakers, it does not 
create either greater speed or reduced cost. And so, with an 
appropriation, working to acquire a commercially available 
icebreaker is the most, sort of, cost and time expeditious way 
forward for the Nation.
    Mr. Garamendi. How many icebreakers do we need?
    Admiral Fagan. I recently signed out a fleet mix analysis 
that indicates we need eight to nine icebreakers.
    Mr. Garamendi. And you have one under construction, the 
design of which is not yet complete. You are talking about 
purchasing another icebreaker from--and we happen to know the 
company, so, no secrets around here.
    Do you have any idea what it will take to make that 
purchased icebreaker useful for the Coast Guard?
    Admiral Fagan. The budget reflects $25 million to bring 
that vessel into initial operating capacity. We continue to 
work to estimate what out-year cost will be to support----
    Mr. Garamendi [interrupting]. So, the need is somewhat near 
10 icebreakers.
    Admiral Fagan. So, we have a polar security contract, 
commercially available icebreaker Healy, which is the medium 
icebreaker currently in operation, and Polar Star, which is our 
heavy icebreaker. Those two are in full operation now.
    Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Mast.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you, Chairman.
    Thank you, Admiral and Master Chief, for being here today. 
I look forward to asking you all a few questions. And I want to 
get into the idea of ``equitable'' to begin with.
    And so, Admiral, I would just start with a question in this 
way. As you are onboarding new Coasties, would you say that it 
would be equitable if the goal was three males for every one 
female? Would you say that would be equitable for onboarding?
    Admiral Fagan. I am onboarding talent. I am onboarding the 
best talent that I can hire. I would like that talent to be 
diverse, but I am hiring talent that meets the requirements to 
serve the Nation. There is not----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. I commend you for it. Best man, 
best woman for the job. Absolutely.
    Admiral Fagan. Best individual for the job, absolutely.
    Mr. Mast. But in terms of goal for number?
    Admiral Fagan. There is no goal for number. I want the best 
talent, the most diverse talent that I can field. I have a 
number----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. OK, I am going to----
    Admiral Fagan [continuing]. That I need to meet for my 
readiness----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. I am going to ask this slightly 
differently then, because my goal really isn't talking about 
the equity of your force right now. It is about the equity of 
this bridge and this waterway that you are looking at here.
    [Slide]
    Mr. Mast. I will start with my colleagues, then. Let me ask 
my colleagues. If I got 5 minutes and you all got 2 minutes, 
would that be equitable? Mr. Garamendi.
    Mr. Garamendi. Your questions have always been so 
brilliant. I am happy to yield.
    Mr. Mast. But would me getting 5 minutes and you getting 2 
minutes, would that be equitable for our timeframe on this 
committee?
    Mr. Garamendi. As long as you are asking the questions, I 
am willing to give you the time.
    Mr. Mast. You are willing to give me more time, make it 
more equitable for me? I appreciate it. Thanks for working with 
equity for me.
    Chairman, you care to weigh in? Would half of us getting 5 
minutes and others getting 3 minutes, would that be equitable 
for time usage?
    Mr. Webster of Florida. I don't think you have enough 
variables.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Mast. I don't know what that means.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. I don't know what yours mean.
    Mr. Mast. Mr. Babin, you chimed in.
    Dr. Babin. It wouldn't be equitable.
    Mr. Mast. No.
    Dr. Babin. Somebody would squawk.
    Mr. Mast. They would. This is Washington, DC, and we have a 
habit of not being common sense here. Equitable is 50/50. Would 
you agree?
    Admiral Fagan. In the context that we are talking----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. What are we talking about, ma'am?
    Admiral Fagan. So, I am committed to a full and transparent 
process. I am committed to ensuring that the equities of the 
users are considered as we work to create opportunity for both 
user groups.
    Mr. Mast. Ma'am, equity is 50/50. And what we are looking 
at with this railroad bridge and this waterway is that you have 
a train company, a for-profit train company looking to run 32 
trains a day over that bridge. And it takes a minimum of 18 
minutes just to get that bridge to go from open, where boats 
can go through, to closed to back open again, when boats can go 
through again.
    And if you do the math on that--and they are looking to do 
that over a 15-hour window of the day--then what they are doing 
is they are closing off the waterway 9\1/2\ hours of the day, 
9\1/2\ hours out of 15 hours. Is that equitable to the 
community whose resource that is?
    Admiral Fagan. We are in a rulemaking process with regard 
to the permitting on this bridge.
    Mr. Mast. But is it equitable, ma'am, that a community gets 
5 hours out of 10 hours? Is that equitable?
    Admiral Fagan. The waterway users----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. Ma'am, let's be common sense here. 
Don't filibuster my time, and let's be common sense. Is it 
equitable that the community that lives in and around this 
waterway, this very busy waterway, gets 5 hours out of 15 
hours? Is that equitable?
    Admiral Fagan. The waterway users are entitled to their 
access to navigation.
    Mr. Mast. Yes.
    Admiral Fagan. The bridge user is entitled to their access 
to the bridge. How that schedule is created will matter. The 
waterway users may have higher demand during certain periods of 
the day. And the----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. But I will mention right now you 
are not doing a study to determine that. You did a Waterway 
Access Management Study back in 2017, which you all have chosen 
to ignore. I will throw that in right now.
    I am very glad that we are doing a second round, because we 
are going to talk more about this. But would it be equitable--
maybe we could answer this. Let's do it a little bit more on 
the numbers. If the community got 1 hour of time and the trains 
got 14 hours of time, would that be considered to you 
nonequitable? Can we at least say that, 1 versus 14 is 
nonequitable?
    Admiral Fagan. We are committed to a fully transparent 
process----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. That is not an answer to my 
question, ma'am. Can you at least agree that the community only 
getting 1 hour out of a 15-hour timeframe would not be 
equitable for that community? You can't agree to that?
    Admiral Fagan. I want to understand the use pattern and 
data so that we can create a dynamic schedule that allows both 
user groups the access they need.
    Mr. Mast. Would that include doing a Waterway Access 
Management Study?
    Admiral Fagan. The test deviation will create that data for 
us. We will simultaneously--it will be a 6-month time period. 
We will understand how many of the recreational users, and what 
the train schedule is, and will work to incorporate that----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. So, Mr. Chairman, just to be clear 
here, I would ask your assistance in getting an answer. Would 1 
hour out of 15 be considered not equitable? Can we at least 
agree on that? That is not equitable, 1 out of 15 is not 
equitable. Can you help me get an answer, Mr. Chairman?
    Mr. Webster of Florida. No.
    Mr. Mast. No?
    Mr. Webster of Florida. No.
    Mr. Mast. I am not surprised. Well, I am happy to keep 
going. I am enjoying it. How about 2 hours? Would 2----
    Mr. Webster of Florida [interrupting]. OK, time is expired.
    Mr. Mast. OK. All right. You didn't say that before.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Auchincloss.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Chairman.
    Admiral, welcome. Foreign Policy recently published an 
article entitled, ``U.S. Coast Guard is Helping Southeast 
Asians Protect Their Seas,'' which states that the economic 
activities of all of Southeast Asia's waters are claimed as 
coastal state jurisdictions, there is little the Coast Guard 
can do to provide direct enforcement activities, and its 
maritime security activities are pretty much limited to 
capacity building and diplomatic actions.
    We have seen elsewhere that the Coast Guard's assistance 
with maritime surveillance and law enforcement in the Indo-
Pacific has solidified partnerships with nations in the region 
as the Chinese Communist Party and the PLA look to militarize 
the South China Sea and otherwise interdict eastbound 
transpacific shipments.
    How can the Coast Guard work with Southeast Asian allies or 
nonallied nations to increase your presence and the utility of 
your ships there?
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you. We work closely with a number of 
key partners and allies throughout the Indo-Pacific and 
Oceania. One of the great benefits of the Coast Guard is our 
people-to-people engagement beyond--and I will talk to the 
large ships here in a minute.
    Mobile and maritime training teams sent to a nation to help 
them, whether it is small engine repair, learning how to repair 
small engines, conduct fisheries operations in their own 
exclusive economic zone, or ship rider agreements where we take 
an individual from that nation--recently, Fiji would be an 
example, we have a bilateral ship rider agreement with Fiji, 
our ship in the area, a Fijian ship rider who brings their 
authority and expertise. And so, there are a number of key 
engagements that we do in the region.
    We have asked for in the UPL--there is an ask for four 
additional FRCs that would increase----
    Mr. Auchincloss [interrupting]. FRCs?
    Admiral Fagan. Fast Response Cutters, more persistent 
presence into the Indo-Pacific theater as a signal of where 
investment opportunities might be with regard to the Coast 
Guard as we counter those threats.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Good. Well, as someone who once commanded 
a military-to-military training mission, I can attest that 
those can have huge leverage in the host countries' forces and 
training, and they can be highly effective.
    What are you hearing from your sentinels overseas about the 
reception that the Coast Guard is getting in these activities?
    Admiral Fagan. The reception the Coast Guard gets is really 
exceptional. There is a far greater demand for those kinds of 
services than we have got capacity to provide. And it is not 
just true in the Pacific. Off the coast of Africa, our European 
partners and nation, this is one of the value propositions of 
the Coast Guard, are those kinds of engagements and that kind 
of partnership building.
    Mr. Auchincloss. And are you working with or do you have a 
conception of how you fit into the Marine Corps Force Design 
2030 for their first island chain stand-in forces?
    Admiral Fagan. So, we are part of the Maritime Force. Tri-
Service Maritime Strategy was jointly signed out by my 
predecessor and the other Service Chiefs. We are committed to 
being part of the maritime arm of the U.S. Government.
    Mr. Auchincloss. And you support Force Design 2030?
    Admiral Fagan. I am going to talk to it from the Coast 
Guard's perspective, which is our contribution is in that 
partnership capacity building. The work we do in the 
competitive space, short of conflict, we field ships that are 
operationally ready and at the same level of readiness as the 
Navy, particularly as we operate in the Pacific.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Final question for you also related to the 
Indo-Pacific--slightly different, though. If I understand 
correctly, Admiral, earlier in your career, you helped put 
together the International Ship and Port Facility Code. Do you 
see any ability for that code to be applied or updated to help 
with ports screening for gray market or other illicit imports 
of Russian oil in violation of the price cap that has been put 
into place, particularly Indian ports?
    Admiral Fagan. That is an interesting question. It is not 
one that I have considered. We will come back to you on what 
might be possible with regard to the current ISPS code and that 
particular problem set.
    Mr. Auchincloss. I would welcome your thoughts on that. It 
sounds like you have got a rich history in working on it.
    In the final 30 seconds, Master Chief, for you in terms of 
workforce and recruitment, how much have you explored, given 
this new generation's, maybe, skepticism of 30-year-long 
careers in one organization, helping them envision the skills 
that they get in just 4 to 5 years of working in the Coast 
Guard, and how that can translate into the private sector. Is 
that part of the value prop you are trying to put out there?
    Master Chief Jones. Yes, sir. Thank you for that. And it 
is--something that we talk to is, the same studies would tell 
you that an older generation values that 30 years with one 
company, the value that that leads, and that the younger 
workforce coming in today likes something new and exciting 
every few years.
    What I talk to a lot is the fact that don't we, as the U.S. 
Coast Guard, offer both? We offer the opportunity to come in 
and have to do something new and exciting every few years, as 
well as that invested into that 30- to 34-year career.
    Mr. Auchincloss. I yield back, Chairman.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Ezell.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank 
everybody for being here today.
    I know the Coast Guard plays a vital role in hurricane 
response and port security.
    I am also proud of the work that the shipbuilding industry 
does to modernize the fleet on the Mississippi gulf coast.
    The Coast Guard continues to be asked to do more than ever. 
I want to ensure that the 2024 budget addresses the concerns 
with the security of our maritime borders, the challenges to 
our national sovereignty in the Arctic, and the growing threats 
in the Indo-Pacific.
    Admiral Fagan, infrastructure continues to be an issue 
within the Coast Guard. Does the Coast Guard have the resources 
needed to replace aging and inadequate buildings, hangars, and 
assets?
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you. The infrastructure backlog needs 
of the Service are well known. My predecessors have spoken to 
them. The infrastructure investments reflected in the 2024 
President's budget, coupled with our 2024 UPL, identified the 
areas of infrastructure greatest need. It totals about $3 
billion.
    The organization, the force needs, reliable $400 to $500 
million a year growth, 3 to 5 percent in that infrastructure 
investment to begin to enable time for planning and then 
execution in a way that allows investments for the new assets 
coming online, and also updates the backlog of aging and older 
infrastructure that we are operating some of the force from.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    Master Chief Jones, another issue--it is no secret, we have 
talked about that a little bit--is the workforce. A 2022 GAO 
study showed that the Coast Guard has a shortage of 400 marine 
inspectors. This lack of a workforce has affected its ability 
to conduct gas carrier compliance exams. The same report 
recommended the Coast Guard conduct an assessment of adopting a 
risk-based approach for conducting these exams.
    Is the Coast Guard still experiencing a shortage of marine 
inspectors, and do you believe the Coast Guard compliance 
program would benefit from applying a risk-based approach for 
petroleum and gas compliance exams?
    Master Chief Jones. Mr. Congressman, across our workforce 
in every community we have, we face a workforce shortage. There 
is no one community that is 100 percent full, to include marine 
inspectors. And we are applying a risk-based approach, where we 
are starting to develop as we apply a risk-based approach to 
how we staff our units to perform the multitude of missions.
    Mr. Ezell. Very good. So, you believe it would be helpful 
for Congress to make some changes to the law that would allow 
the establishment and implementation of a risk-based program 
for these inspectors to help address this issue?
    Master Chief Jones. I would defer that expertise to 
somewhere else in the Coast Guard for that answer, sir.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, sir, for your willingness to testify.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Ranking Member Larsen, you are 
recognized for some questions.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I 
apologize for being late. I was on the floor, managing a piece 
of legislation. So, we will see everyone at 5 o'clock for one 
vote.
    Admiral, good to see you again. We have talked a lot up at 
the Academy, and I know that I have a lot of things to repeat 
on that. But some things have happened since, including a 
discussion here on Capitol Hill about reverting back to fiscal 
year 2022 funding levels, which would have impact on a lot of 
things in the budget. And I was curious if the Coast Guard has 
done any analysis of what that would mean, if you had an fiscal 
year 2022 funding level, versus what was proposed in the 
President's budget?
    Admiral Fagan. If we were held in a fiscal year 2022 
funding level, we would start with a $500 million shortfall. 
With inflation, increased costs, that immediately begins to 
impact our ability to provide frontline operating services.
    As we make budget choices and decisions, we prioritize that 
frontline operating capacity for the Service. And so, an 
ability to continue to field the major acquisitions, begin to 
work through some of the infrastructure backlog, all of that 
gets put at risk if we are held to a 2022 budget level. And 
frankly, it impacts readiness almost immediately for the 
Service.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes. So--but to put it another 
way, you can't point to a specific thing, but the fact is, you 
just will have that much less--fewer resources to do what we 
are asking you to do today.
    Admiral Fagan. We will be forced to make very difficult 
tradeoffs. The investments, the acquisition investments, these 
are step functions. You can't phase a little bit. It is an all 
or nothing. And very quickly, we will be faced with difficult 
tradeoffs, but we will work to preserve people, workforce, and 
frontline operating capacity. But that all gets put into 
question if we are held at that level.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, OK. Thank you. Thanks. And 
then one of the questions I did ask is--and this impacts 
Washington State, if I could be parochial, even though I am the 
ranking member, if you don't mind, Mr. Chair--detrimental to 
mariners across the country, but certainly in my district and 
the State, is the crewing for the State ferry system and the 
backlog of mariner credentialing.
    It is a core responsibility of the Coast Guard, but there 
wasn't money put in for a necessary upgrade to the system, so 
that the credentialing activities can happen sooner. Can you 
talk a little bit about what your plan is there?
    Admiral Fagan. Yes, we take our role credentialing and 
licensing mariners seriously. It is critical, not just to the 
operation of the Washington State ferry system, but, frankly, 
it is critical for national security that we have licensed and 
credentialed mariners.
    We have signaled some money needs in the UPL. We continue 
to work forward to invest in a new state-of-the-art IT system, 
which will bring some efficiency into that licensing and 
credentialing. And we continue to move forward to be responsive 
to that need.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. OK. And finally, I had a great 
opportunity at the Academy to sit with many of your cadets, 
including eight, I think, from the great State of Washington, 
and I very much enjoyed it. But what struck me is that the 
various groups on campus at the Academy, it is cadet-driven 
discussions, and cadet-driven actions on the need for 
diversity. It is not coming from the top. It is not coming--I 
am sure you are supportive, but these are cadet-driven 
activities who--they all recognize the need for a more diverse 
workforce, and certainly a more diverse workforce within the 
Coast Guard.
    But still, there is a--probably now that we are catching up 
to this, it is going to be a couple of years before that 
diversity is reflected in the leadership. But how do you 
foresee that diversity that exists clearly at the Academy 
eventually working its way up into the broader leadership in 
the U.S. Coast Guard to reflect the face of the United States?
    Admiral Fagan. The Coast Guard Academy, you saw it when you 
interacted with the cadets, we are about 45 percent women in 
the cadet corps. And part of the reason that matters, one, 
diverse workforces outperform nondiverse workforces.
    One of the studies we have done recently reflected that 
there had been a disparity rate between--graduation between men 
and women graduates at the Coast Guard Academy. When we crossed 
the 25-percent threshold, that disparity rate in graduation 
diminished.
    So, now, as an organization, and as I focus on workforce 
management, talent management, it is in eliminating barriers 
for those who have joined us to continue to serve: women, 
minority males. What is good for women is good for the 
workforce, and it creates opportunity for anyone that sees 
themselves serving in the Coast Guard.
    And I have got a sense of urgency around some of the human 
relations talent management work that we have got in front of 
us to ensure we retain that talent that is at the Academy.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you.
    And just one more note, if you don't mind, Mr. Chair.
    Please apologize to Cadet King for the grilling I gave him 
when I inspected his room, if he is recovered. I hope he has. 
If he hasn't, I apologize.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you so much. I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Van Drew.
    Dr. Van Drew. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank both of you 
for being here. It is good to see both of you again.
    And I just would tell the committee that we have a 
wonderful relationship in Cape May with the Coast Guard. It is 
integral and actually woven into the thread of our society in 
Cape May County. And people truly do love you down there. And 
it is good to see you again. And we are a Coast Guard 
community, which is also a big deal down there, which is a 
special designation given to certain communities, which we 
appreciate.
    So, my focus on this first round of questions today will be 
on our continued investment in the United States Coast Guard 
Training Center Cape May--and yes, I want to be a little 
parochial, too--and the Coast Guard's new recruitment campaign. 
My questions are directed both to the admiral and to the master 
chief. Thank you both for your service to our country, by the 
way.
    In 2022, Congress appropriated $60 million to construct new 
barracks at Training Center Cape May. Can you please provide a 
status update on the design and on the engineering of the 
barracks, and when we might expect to break ground on phase 1 
of the project?
    Admiral Fagan. Yes, thank you. We appreciate the enduring 
support and all of the support that the community of Cape May 
gives to us and our recruits as they go through our single 
session source for our enlisted workforce.
    And we are working to break ground, hopefully in late 2025, 
on that first barracks project that we have been appropriated 
for. The next priority after that is the multimission building. 
And then there will be additional needs. We have done an 
infrastructure development plan that will help to lay out the 
way ahead for the investments that we need in Cape May, but we 
should break ground on that barracks in late 2025.
    Dr. Van Drew. Great. And everything seems to be going 
pretty well?
    Admiral Fagan. I have not heard otherwise; everything seems 
to be on track. It is critical that we provide a safe, state-
of-the-art environment for our young recruits as they come 
through that training program there, and we are looking forward 
to it, to doing that for them.
    Dr. Van Drew. Thank you. Last year, Congress authorized the 
second phase of the barracks project for an additional $60 
million. In the fiscal year 2024 budget request, the Coast 
Guard also highlighted the need for an indoor training facility 
at the training center. Both this committee and I have 
supported appropriating these projects this fiscal year.
    Can you please state your case for why these projects are 
priorities for the Coast Guard and why Congress should move to 
fund them now?
    Admiral Fagan. Cape May is our sole entry point for the 
enlisted force, and we owe them a safe environment to train and 
become young Coast Guard members. The need for the multipurpose 
training facility is really an acknowledgment to: it can get 
very hot in Cape May, and it can get very cold in Cape May. And 
40 percent of the year, those weather extremes impact our 
ability to train. You can still run 1\1/2\ miles indoors in the 
facility we have, but it is 90 laps around that gym. This is 
not a state-of-the-art experience for young people that are 
coming in to the world's best coast guard.
    After the multipurpose building, barracks so that, again, 
people have a safe, state-of-the-art place to sleep as they 
work through their training.
    Dr. Van Drew. And it is the only training center, correct?
    Admiral Fagan. It is our only training----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. In the country.
    Admiral Fagan [continuing during interruption]. Force, yes.
    Dr. Van Drew. In the United States of America.
    Admiral Fagan. The Navy operates a similar facility in the 
Great Lakes, but this is our sole source.
    Dr. Van Drew. OK, thank you. Finally, I would like to give 
you the opportunity to speak on the Coast Guard's new 
``Protect, Defend, and Save'' campaign. Can you please describe 
how this is different from past recruitment efforts, what the 
changes are?
    Admiral Fagan. The Protect, Defend, Save, and the new logo, 
it is a tertiary logo. There is no intent to change the shield, 
the anchor and shield, the racing stripe, the iconic----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. That was the concern, right?
    Admiral Fagan. No, those are primary and secondary symbols 
that will remain and really speak to the core of our heritage 
and who we are.
    The new symbol is targeted to young people, the 18- to 25-
year-olds who we are looking to recruit. We did a lot of 
marketing towards that group of people with that particular 
symbol. As we have gained support for marketing dollars, 
advertising dollars, we are going to the young people on gaming 
websites and other--this is not a large commercial on night-
time TV. That is not where the young people are. And so, that 
symbol--a more focused targeting of our advertising dollars and 
strategic dollars, it is really designed at the workforce we 
are trying to recruit.
    Dr. Van Drew. Is there anything you would like to see in 
the next authorization to help with recruitment?
    Admiral Fagan. We appreciate the support that we have 
continued to get, and will continue to signal where our 
investment needs are. Increasing recruiter capacity, opening 
recruiting offices, expanding the JROTC program, marketing and 
reaching young people where they are are all things that we 
have had support on, and will likely need additional support, 
and appreciate what the committee has been doing.
    Dr. Van Drew. Thank you.
    I yield back, Chairman.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Ms. Scholten.
    Ms. Scholten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Admiral Fagan, Master Chief Jones, thank you so much for 
joining us here today.
    I represent miles of beautiful Lake Michigan shoreline that 
has an installation of the U.S. Coast Guard in Muskegon and 
Grand Haven. I recently had a chance to tour the facility. It 
was great speaking with the members and understanding a little 
bit more about the challenges that come with serving, including 
a 50-year-old cutter and drysuits desperately in need of 
replacing. The issues highlight the need for a robust Coast 
Guard budget to ensure our Coast Guard's men and women have 
what they need to keep people safe.
    Another issue that Station Grand Haven highlighted was 
recruitment and retention. While this was before my time in 
Congress, one thing that I understand had a severe impact on 
the ability to recruit and retain was the 2019 partial 
Government shutdown. Master Chief Jones, how severely were 
Coast Guard families, particularly the enlisted members, 
affected by the 35-day shutdown? I understand the impact was 
fairly severe, but if you can talk to what it did for morale 
amongst servicemembers, knowing that they weren't going to be 
able to support their families, the uncertainty of that month, 
particularly while the other branches of the military were 
being paid?
    Master Chief Jones. Thank you for that question, 
Congresswoman. It had a severe impact on the morale of the 
workforce.
    More concerning is the potential mission impact that it 
has. When our sentinels come to work every day, if they know 
that things are taken care of at home, and they know that their 
families are safe and secure, they are able to focus on the job 
at hand and be more mission effective. And it was a tremendous 
impact.
    We learned that one thing that will take our workforce to 
its knees is the unknown, and that unknown is what was scary 
for them.
    Ms. Scholten. And do you continue to see it have an impact 
on recruitment and retention today, particularly around the 
stability issues?
    Master Chief Jones. I don't know if I could draw a parallel 
to that to our recruitment today. I think in the immediate 
aftermath, it may have, but I cannot tell you definitively 
whether it does today or not.
    Ms. Scholten. Yes. One thing that we know is that stability 
is so important to the mission all around. Thank you for 
answering that question.
    Today Representative Gonzalez-Colon and I will be 
reintroducing the Pay Our Coast Guard Parity Act of 2023, 
previously introduced by former Chair Peter DeFazio during the 
2019 shutdown. This bill would ensure that the Coast Guard 
continues to be paid if other branches of the military are paid 
in the event of a shutdown.
    Protecting our Nation both at home and on our coasts 
overseas, away from their families, is critical. Coast Guard 
members continued to show up every day for those 35 days, 
despite not knowing if their paycheck would be coming. For 35 
days, almost 1,000 families did not receive childcare 
subsidies. Death benefits were not paid to survivors of Coast 
Guard members who died while on Active Duty. And leasing for 
personnel housing--you mentioned earlier one of the most 
critical issues for Coast Guard men and women in Government-
leased housing--were not paid. This simply cannot stand, and we 
are taking action to stop it. Thank you.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon.
    Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am happy to 
be here today. And yes, I am proud to be joining Congresswoman 
Scholten to introduce that bill, so, I am happy that she 
brought it down today.
    I want to say thank you, Admiral Fagan and Master Chief--it 
is great to see you both--and, of course, the men and women who 
are part of the Coast Guard. And thank you for your service to 
our Nation.
    In the case of Puerto Rico, we are no strangers to the 
Coast Guard's important role and mission, and we truly value 
the relationship with our Coasties at Sector San Juan, and all 
they do to keep us safe.
    So, I want to focus on one of the issues that I am really 
concerned about, and that is specifically the maritime border 
security issues, specifically to the waters of Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. Over the last few years, we have seen 
an increase in drug and migrant activity around our islands.
    In fiscal year 2022, the Coast Guard interdicted more than 
2,300 migrants in the Mona Passage in the waters near Puerto 
Rico, a 200-percent increase when compared to fiscal year 2021 
for the same area. And according to the data the Coast Guard 
shared with my office from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 
2020, the known cocaine flow to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, either coming directly from South America or via the 
Dominican Republic, increased 115 percent, from 51 metric tons 
to 110 metric tons.
    We have also seen a rise in violence associated with these 
events. In a recent Homeland Security Committee hearing, CBP 
AMO executive director of operations testified that Puerto Rico 
is now--I would like to quote him--``the most violent maritime 
threat vector of any location we patrol.''
    And as you are probably aware, last November, a CBP marine 
interdiction agent was shot and killed and two others were 
gravely injured during an interdiction of a drug smuggling 
vessel off of the western coast of Puerto Rico. Just 2 months 
later, another gunfight during a vessel interdiction off the 
coast of Fajardo in the eastern part of the island resulted in 
the death of two drug smugglers.
    And the reason I bring those issues here is just to 
highlight the significant threats we face in the Caribbean area 
from transnational criminal organizations and smugglers 
operating in the Caribbean, and the need to ensure a robust 
Coast Guard and Federal law enforcement presence in the region. 
For example, recently the island has been advocating for the 
Coast Guard to establish a formal permanent presence on the 
island, western and eastern part of the island, through new 
boat stations or sub-units. I think this is something we should 
look at closely.
    And my question today will be, could you discuss the Coast 
Guard efforts to tackle transnational threats and smuggling 
activity in waters in the Caribbean jurisdiction, including 
whether any consideration has been given to deploy additional 
assets in the region or establish a formal presence in those 
areas beyond the current boat station in San Juan?
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you. And we are absolutely committed 
to countering the TCOs and the illegal flows of drugs and 
migrants. And, certainly, as you have highlighted, the flows 
have changed as with regard to what is coming towards Puerto 
Rico.
    We are working to build a more robust capacity at Base San 
Juan, which is a key hub for the region, and as we support 
ships and boats and aircraft. We have got Fast Response Cutters 
now in Puerto Rico. Those are newer assets, game changing for 
us in the vectors that you have talked about; fielding the new 
MH-60 helicopters we have talked about earlier; and boats, as 
well. And we look forward to continuing to work with you and 
our team at D7 to ensure that the Coast Guard assets are 
appropriately postured for the risk.
    As risks change, often it is much more dynamic than we are 
able--and so, we will move ships and boats towards where the 
increased threat may be. We do that in the Florida Straits now, 
and we will continue to do that to ensure that Puerto Rico has 
the appropriate level of maritime safety and security that the 
Coast Guard can provide.
    Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you. And one of the last 
questions that I have is that, according to the most recent 
annual performance report, the Coast Guard was only able to 
remove 5.4 percent of the total known cocaine flow in the 
maritime transit zone, well below the target of 10 percent. And 
those numbers are coming down. What is the biggest challenge 
the Coast Guard is confronting that prevents it from meeting 
the target drug removal rate, and has the increase in migrant 
activities impacted that resource?
    Admiral Fagan. It is a team effort, the counternarcotics 
effort. As we move to field the new ship assets that will be 
more reliable, the new helicopter assets that will be more 
reliable, it will help us stay on station more reliably.
    Now, we experience unplanned maintenance days that take us 
off vector, and we are focused on the lifesaving work that we 
are doing in the maritime migration, particularly in the 
Florida Straits. Thank you.
    Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon. Thank you.
    Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Let's see. Mrs. Peltola.
    Mrs. Peltola. Thank you, Chairman Webster.
    Good afternoon. It is very good to meet both of you. Thank 
you for being here. I am the Member representing the State of 
Alaska, which, I don't have to tell you how enormous Alaska is, 
or all of the good work that you do there, especially with 
search and rescue and, really, just being a national security 
presence. And I know that that is not really your wheelhouse, 
but I think your presence is really critical in Alaska, with 
our adversaries being so close, and I understand doing missions 
in our waters, practice missions in our waters, so, I really 
appreciate all the work that you are doing.
    Master Chief Jones, the fiscal year 2024 budget proposal 
includes--and I apologize if this question has already been 
asked--it includes an increase of 80 positions, 42 full-time 
positions, and $15.5 million to enhance retention and support 
of your workforce. And I just was wondering if you could 
provide some more details on that budget proposal.
    Master Chief Jones. Thank you for that question, 
Congresswoman.
    Those positions, we were investing in shore-based personnel 
that support our cutter operations for our maintenance assist 
teams and our weapons assist teams.
    We are investing in bolstering our modern training 
capability to where we--sometimes the best training is brick 
and mortar, sometimes it is delivered in a virtual format. It 
is delivering the training that the units need on time where 
they are for the mission they are addressing.
    We are continuing our efforts to transition to our 
electronic health record, which is a welcome transition, as 
well as those funds also fund the special trial counsel that 
was directed as per the 2022 NDAA.
    Mrs. Peltola. OK. Thank you. Thank you so much. I am 
wondering if either one of you could answer what the Coast 
Guard is doing now to ensure mental health of your workforce 
and how that is reflected in your budget.
    Admiral Fagan. We continue to invest in medical capacity to 
improve access for mental healthcare. At every unit we visit, 
at every all-hands, the concern over access to mental 
healthcare is raised by our members and by their families.
    We have signed an MOU with DoD to improve our access to 
mental health capacity and training for our own medical 
corpsmen. We have a Coast Guard support system, but we are 
working to update that contract so that it provides easier 
access for telehealth and mental screening, particularly around 
mental health. And we continue to leverage all tools that are 
available to us, and invest in the capacity that is needed to 
ensure the mental and emotional well-being of our force.
    Mrs. Peltola. OK. The last thing I wanted to mention, there 
is a young man who serves as a AET-2 who wanted to remain 
anonymous, but I just wanted to share some sentiments that he 
shared with me. He said that, under your leadership, there has 
been an increase in baby leave for both parents for up to 3 
months. There have been funds allocated for new childcare 
centers, and you have made it possible for new members with 
degrees to come into the Coast Guard at a higher rank. And the 
last sentiment here is that you are truly taking a new approach 
and changing things for the better.
    So, I really want to commend you and your very professional 
team, and all the good work that you are doing for our Nation. 
Thank you so much.
    Admiral Fagan. Thank you.
    Mrs. Peltola. I yield my time back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you. So, we have time for a 
little bit more questions, so, I will ask the first.
    Master Chief, like other Services, the Coast Guard has 
fallen short--we have been talking about that--of recruiting 
targets of approximately 4,800 members. What is the major 
problem you see in enlisted ranks in the deficit of nearly 20 
percent expected by 2025?
    Master Chief Jones. Mr. Chairman, the major issue is just 
that the mission hasn't gone away. The mission is always there. 
And our sentinels each and every day are dedicated to getting 
the mission done. And we need more people to help them get that 
mission done to ease the burden on each individual person.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Can you talk about some of the ways 
the Coast Guard is working to attract qualified personnel, 
other than the ones that have been mentioned?
    Master Chief Jones. Yes, sir. As the Commandant spoke to, 
it is investing in how we advertise. We are advertising in 
different ways, meeting people where they are for the workforce 
that we are trying to attract, getting into gaming communities, 
which is a large portion of the young generation that is out 
there, attracting them.
    And what we are really doing internal to the Coast Guard 
with the workforce is really and truly a push to simply tell 
our story. What we have learned is when people learn about the 
United States Coast Guard, they want to be part of the United 
States Coast Guard. They see the value we offer. They truly 
fall in love with our mission. They are passionate about doing 
it.
    We just have to do a better job of telling our story. And 
that is one charge that I have given to our chiefs throughout 
the Coast Guard, and I have given to each and every sentinel 
every day is to tell the story when--they are already out in 
the communities. They are involved in their communities. They 
are doing great things every day in their communities. And I 
ask them to almost not be quite so humble sometimes, to get out 
there and tell everybody, ``Here is what I do every single 
day,'' and I think that story will help us resonate.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Do you think the deficit in any way 
affects--how does it affect the readiness and the ability to 
perform the mission?
    Master Chief Jones. Just with the simple numbers. Like I 
said, we need more people to help us. But what I will tell you 
is--and we get to see this everywhere we go--the quality of 
people we have coming in through Training Center Cape May and 
the quality of people we have coming through New London are 
second to none. They are absolutely the best of what our 
country offers. We just have to double down on efforts to find 
more of them to come through.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Good testimony. OK, Mr. Mast.
    Mr. Mast. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.
    Master Chief, you just spoke about telling a story. And I 
have nothing but love for the Coast Guard men and women in my 
community. But I am going to tell you a story about what has 
been happening with Washington, DC, Coast Guard and Coast Guard 
Sector Miami.
    Just now, ma'am, you committed to an equitable process, but 
you are unwilling to even acknowledge situations that would be 
not equitable at all, that literally just happened. Your folks 
from DC came into my office and made some of the most unfounded 
statements that anybody could make. They said, ``Well, we 
believe that if we gave your boaters a 15-minute access to that 
waterway, they could squeeze 75 boats through that waterway in 
15 minutes.'' Truly one of the most unfounded statements that--
and when I told anybody back in my community that statement, 
every one of them, their response was the exact same. They were 
using some version of swear words to say, ``What in the world 
are they thinking about that?''
    You all put forward a questionnaire about management of 
this waterway in which you asked, ``Is a 15-minute hourly 
opening schedule sufficient for the community?'' You didn't ask 
if 45 minutes would be sufficient for the community. You only 
asked if 15 minutes would be acceptable to the community.
    You took the Waterway Access Management Study, something 
that was very substantial, done with a great amount of purpose, 
and you all said that you want to ignore the recommendations 
that are in that. That is a part of the story of the Coast 
Guard in my community right now.
    I want to try some of these questions again for a moment. 
Maybe you will answer them.
    If the Coast Guard--because the Coast Guard is deciding 
this--decides that they are going to say, ``Brightline train, 
you can close down that waterway for 14 hours of a 15-hour 
window, and community that lives around there, you can have 1 
hour of the 15 hours,'' would that be equitable?
    Admiral Fagan. I am committed to a full and transparent 
process. We need to let the data speak to understand how to 
ensure both users are able----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. Ma'am, you are ignoring your own 
data, are you not? You are ignoring the Waterway Access 
Management Study that you all did.
    Admiral Fagan. The----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. Yes or no? Yes or no?
    Admiral Fagan. I am not familiar with that study. I will--
--
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. You are familiar with this case, 
but you are not familiar with the study that you all did on it. 
Let that tell you about where the process is.
    You won't look at the stuff--you knew you were coming in 
here, you knew that I was going to ask about this, and you are 
not familiar with the study that you all did? Think about that.
    And you are telling me that you are going to do a study, 
but where are you getting the information from? Your folks told 
us. You are getting your information from the train company. 
You are not even getting your own information.
    After your folks told us, ``No, listen, we are going to 
ignore this study because we are going to do another study that 
is more recent. We want more accurate information.'' But you 
all changed your tune and you said, no, you are not going to do 
that, you are just going to get the information from the train.
    Now, I have talked about the 32 trains that the Brightline 
is going to run. Again, it doesn't even count the 15 freight 
trains that already go over those tracks every single day. So, 
now you are talking about, what, 47 trains a day going over 
that bridge, largely in a 15-hour window of time, taking no 
less than 18 minutes. I was in the Army, but I can do simple 
Army math, and I can tell you that only leaves about 30 minutes 
of access for mariners in that community with those kind of 
numbers. Is that equitable?
    Admiral Fagan. We have a public comment process. I am 
committed to taking in all of the data, all of the public 
comments, and----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. And was that public comment 
process where you all put forward skewed questions? And you 
even acknowledged that they were skewed questions, and went 
back and changed them because you acknowledged that they were 
skewed. That is not a fair and equitable process.
    So, let's just try it one more time. Can you acknowledge 
that any situation of time management between the local 
community that you are looking at up there and the train 
company would be inequitable? Is there any version that you 
could say, listen, that would reach the level of not equitable 
for the community?
    Admiral Fagan. I am committed to access for both user 
groups, and will work with you and our team----
    Mr. Mast [interrupting]. But access is not equitable. 
Having access is not being equitable. Having access, great. You 
got to come out on the waterway, you got some time there. You 
got 15 minutes out of an hour to get through there. That is not 
the same thing as equitable, ma'am.
    And Mr. Chairman, I thank you for the time.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Mr. Van Drew.
    Dr. Van Drew. My second round of questions will focus on 
offshore wind and maritime navigation safety.
    In 2011, the Coast Guard established the Atlantic Coast 
Port Access Route Study Workgroup. The group was to determine 
whether the Coast Guard should create navigational fairways to 
mitigate maritime safety impacts of anticipated offshore energy 
leases.
    In 2012, the workgroup published an interim report stating 
that they were ``developing tools critical to evaluating the 
navigational safety risk resulting from different scenarios.''
    Admiral Fagan, do you stand by the Coast Guard's 2012 
assessment that the tools and recommendations of the Port 
Access Route Study are important to mitigating navigational 
safety risk?
    Admiral Fagan. I am committed to a predictable, safe, 
transparent way forward. I acknowledge the frustration in the 
length of time it has taken for the rulemaking to come to 
completion, and we are working to do exactly that.
    I am committed to fulfilling our responsibility to preserve 
safety of navigation as we work to balance the offshore wind 
energy leases, and safe, transparent operation of the fleet of 
vessels that also enjoy access offshore. And we are working 
hard to get the notice of proposed rulemaking over the finish 
line.
    Dr. Van Drew. It is not easy. The Coast Guard's modeling 
concluded in the fall of 2014, but ``did not produce a model 
capable of determining the risk to navigational safety,'' which 
you know already.
    As of 2014, there was still work to be done in developing a 
safety plan. In November--this is a timeline; if I go too 
quick, stop me. In November of 2015, the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management, BOEM, auctioned two lease areas off the coast of 
New Jersey to offshore wind energy developers. They finalized 
this lease on February 4, 2016, and it went into effect on 
March 1st of that year. It was only on March 14th of that year, 
of 2016, that the Coast Guard published the final rule for the 
Port Access Study.
    Admiral Fagan, did BOEM select that lease area auction 
itself and put that lease area into effect before the U.S. 
Coast Guard finalized its Atlantic Coast Port Access Route 
Study Safety Recommendations?
    Admiral Fagan. We have an advisory role with BOEM. I will 
ask the staff to come out. I don't have the step-by-step 
process. I am committed to the process, committed to being 
responsive and transparent in that process. And I will ask the 
staff----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. This is--just so you know, I 
am not trying to catch you or anybody on this, but that study 
should have been done before the lease was done to make sure it 
is appropriate to do what they want to do.
    Specifically on the timeline, is this timeline accurate 
based on the dates that I described to you? And what you are 
telling me is you are going to have to go back and look.
    Admiral Fagan. Yes, I want to make sure I give you a 
technically accurate answer with regard to----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. If BOEM decided to auction--
and this is why this is so important--if BOEM decided to 
auction the New Jersey offshore wind leases before the Coast 
Guard finalized its recommendations--no criticism of you, but 
if they did, it is them I am looking at--then it is impossible 
that BOEM fully considered safety in their leasing decisions. 
And that is obvious; if they did this before you were done, how 
can they do that?
    And in all honesty, this means that the offshore wind 
leases off the coast of New Jersey are actually illegal. And 
there is a real possibility here. Again, nothing on the Coast 
Guard. I just want to know the dates. And we have checked this 
out and investigated.
    The fact will be of little comfort to the projects that are 
constructed. Navigating offshore wind will be difficult and 
dangerous. Both BOEM and the Coast Guard have determined that 
the offshore wind projects will--and I am quoting both the 
Coast Guard and BOEM--``potentially increase frequency of 
collision as shipping traffic maneuvers around offshore wind 
development.'' And that is a quote from both. The Coast Guard 
stated this direct in its Atlantic Coast Port Access Route 
Study, and it is in there. I have looked at it with my own 
eyes.
    Can you confirm the Coast Guard's determination that 
offshore wind structures present potentially dangerous risks to 
maritime operators, a conclusion reached in recent Coast Guard 
Port Access Route studies?
    Admiral Fagan. Any time a fixed structure is put into the 
sea, it increases the potential for risk with ships and 
movement. Our role is to continue to ensure access and 
navigation, safety of navigation. We will continue to work to 
advise in that realm----
    Dr. Van Drew [interrupting]. But it is a challenge. I mean, 
this is over 3,000 wind turbines, and it is over 2 million 
acres. I mean, this is a big project that is going to affect us 
forever. So, I would appreciate if you could get back to me 
with those specifics.
    I will think you will find that everything I told you was 
accurate, which is problematic for this company that went 
forward before they knew whether it would be safe or not, or 
what the ramifications would be.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Thank you for your time.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. That concludes the hearing for 
today. Thank you to the witnesses for appearing. We appreciate 
that and look forward to talking to you in the future.
    I ask unanimous consent that the record be open for 15 
days.
    [Whereupon, at 3:49 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

                              ----------                              


   Questions from Hon. Salud O. Carbajal to Admiral Linda L. Fagan, 
                      Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard

    Question 1. Admiral Fagan, during the hearing I asked about the 
status of regulations for the new sexual assault and sexual harassment 
provisions in the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022 and 
the long overdue Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act. Please provide 
clarity to the timeframe mentioned at the hearing including as to when 
are you starting.
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1 (con't). In addition, please answer the following 
questions:
    Question 1.a. If you need outside consultation, who are you 
consulting with?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.b. Do you think your rulemaking will delay the 
statutorily mandated timeline for vessel implementation?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 1.c. Can vessel operators move forward with confidence 
that their technology will comply?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 2. The MH-60s require more personnel to operate than other 
USCG helicopters. Will the USCG have enough personnel to operate an all 
MH-60 fleet?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 3. Can the MH-60 operate on ALL of the USCG ships? Does it 
fit in all of the USCG land and ship hangars? If not, what are the USCG 
plans for those ships and air station hangers that cannot accommodate 
the MH-60 helicopter?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 4. Do both the MH-60 and the USCG's Unmanned Aircraft 
System (UAS), ScanEagle, fit on board USCG ships together? Has the 
National Security Cutter deployed and operated with a MH-60 helicopter 
and ScanEagle UAS? If not, what equipment will be left onshore and what 
would be the impact to a cutter that is not fully mission capable?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 5. Occasionally aviation fleets are grounded due to safety 
or maintenance concerns. Does the USCG have a plan to cover all 
statutory missions Coast Guard helicopters are used to support if the 
single helicopter fleet is grounded?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

Questions from Hon. Brian Babin to Admiral Linda L. Fagan, Commandant, 
                            U.S. Coast Guard

    Question 1. As the Coast Guard looks to transition to an MH-60 
rotary-wing fleet, I understand that the Coast Guard is slowly phasing 
out many of its aging MH-65s, with the intention of reducing its 
overall rotary wing fleet from 146 to 126 aircraft.
    Air Station Houston currently hosts three MH-65 ``Dolphin'' 
helicopters, and I understand the current plan is to phase these three 
helicopters out and replace them with just two MH-60's.
    While I recognize that the MH-60 is a very capable platform 
compared with the MH-65, I have concerns that reducing the number of 
airframes in service may impact the Coast Guard's operational 
capabilities.
    Presumably, with fewer aircraft at an air station, it would be more 
challenging to respond to multiple search and rescue missions, drug 
interdictions, or patrols, given that a single helicopter can only be 
in one place at one time.
    I don't anticipate drug runners will idle their boats while they 
wait for helicopters, and we can't ask folks to just tread water while 
they await assistance. Given that reality, how does the Coast Guard 
plan to maintain its operational capabilities with less operational 
assets?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 2. In a report shared with the Committee last May 
regarding the Coast Guard's Interdiction of Illicit Drugs in Transit 
Zones, the report shares that the Coast Guard was able to intercept 
about 10 percent of the cocaine flow coming into the United States.
    In the report, the Coast Guard notes that the ``level of effort 
toward this mission is assessed as adequate, given the boundary 
conditions of balancing the execution of other statutory missions and 
workforce and material readiness.''
    I assume the Coast Guard is not satisfied with a 10 percent 
interdiction rate. My takeaway from that is you have too few resources 
to adequately carry out your growing mission set.
    Question 2.a. What are some of the factors that would improve the 
Coast Guard's ability to carry out its drug interdiction mission?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 2.b. Would you acknowledge that additional surface assets 
could help the Coast Guard improve its mission effectiveness? And if 
so, why does the President's Budget not include resources for 
additional FRCs?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 3. The Coast Guard and Navy are planning to invest up to 
$11.8 billion to build and maintain three Polar Security Cutter heavy 
polar icebreakers to conduct missions in the Antarctic and Arctic. The 
first ship is ``scheduled'' for delivery in 2025-2026, but is expected 
to be delivered, at best, in 2028.
    Can you provide a status update on our icebreakers? What is being 
done to address continued delays in completing the design of the Polar 
Security Cutters to begin construction?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

   Questions from Hon. Jefferson Van Drew to Admiral Linda L. Fagan, 
                      Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard

    Question 1. May you provide a detailed timeline of activities which 
occurred under the Atlantic Coast Port Access Route Study from 2011 to

    Question 2. On what dates did USCG communicate both preliminary and 
final conclusions and recommendations of the Atlantic Coast Port Access 
Route Study to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 3. Did the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's November 
2015 auction for the New Jersey Wind Energy Area, as well as the 
finalization of the lease area on March 1st, occur chronologically 
before the U.S. Coast Guard finalized the Atlantic Coast Port Access 
Route Study on March 14th of 2016?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 4. May you provide an account of interagency 
communications and coordination between USCG and BOEM from 2011-2016 
related to the New Jersey Wind Energy Area?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

    Question 5. When does USCG anticipate the finalization of the 
Delaware Bay PARS?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.

 Question from Hon. Brian Babin to Master Chief Heath B. Jones, Master 
        Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard, U.S. Coast Guard

    Question 1. Master Chief, the Coast Guard faces recruiting 
challenges, most notably in its enlisted ranks. Can you talk about some 
of the lessons learned from other services in addressing this 
challenge? What is the Coast Guard doing to improve its recruiting 
efforts?
    Answer. A response was not received at the time of publication.
