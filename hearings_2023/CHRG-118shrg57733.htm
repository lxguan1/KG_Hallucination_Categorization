           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. Good morning. The Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation will come to order.
    We are having a hearing this morning on Advancing the Next 
Generation of Aviation Technologies.
    Before I start with my statement, I just want to make a 
point to again thank the Chair of the Subcommittee for all her 
hard work in chairing the series of hearings that we're having 
and obviously my colleague, the Ranking Member, for our 
discussions.
    It's our hope that during the recess members will submit 
their ideas about things that they would like included in the 
FAA Reauthorization Bill. We may not be done with all of our 
work, but we certainly want to use this period during the 
recess to surface the ideas that people want to see included 
and continue that discussion.
    This morning the hearing is focused on the United States 
leadership in sustainable aviation technologies and innovation 
that will define the next chapter of generation of commercial 
airplanes and I believe critical export opportunities for the 
United States.
    This is about winning a competitive race for the future and 
to meet these new challenges, we must enhance research 
partnerships, expertise between the FAA and NASA, and FAA 
standards on certification of novel aviation technologies.
    We will hear from Associate Administrator Bob Pearce about 
NASA's work to make this a reality. Today's research will get 
Americans moving faster and I'm excited that this year NASA 
will conduct the first flight of its low-boom supersonic 
aircraft. Moving America one step closer to supersonic air 
travel is what the Commerce Committee envisioned when they 
authorized this program to begin with.
    NASA's Sustainable Flight Demonstrator Project will disrupt 
traditional airframe technology through novel wing design and 
shape the next generation of single aisle aircraft.
    This has real world commercial outcomes for America's 
competitiveness. Single aisle aircraft are projected to 
represent 70 percent of the global airline fleet by 2024.
    Sustainable aviation is good for the bottom line, enabling 
airlines to save money and operating costs and maximize fuel 
efficiencies. The FAA's Continuous Low-Energy Emissions and 
Noise, CLEEN, Program will save $36 billion in fuel by 2050, 
with savings of about $90 billion for airlines.
    These emissions cuts are equal to removing three million 
cars from the road between 2020 and 2050. We should triple 
funding in my opinion for CLEEN in its next phase of focusing 
on zero emission aircraft innovation. Start-ups and local 
governments should have access to Federal technology 
investments.
    Yesterday, Snohomish County in my state, along with the 
Washington State University, announced plans for an applied 
research and development center to produce and store 
sustainable aviation fuel.
    U.S.-based projects, like these, are why it was important 
in the Inflation Reduction Act to secure funding for developing 
low-emission aviation technologies, known as Fast Tech, and 
build the infrastructure needed to scale up sustainable 
aviation fuel, SAF, and I'm glad to see that that program is 
getting launched this year.
    The FAA's Kevin Walsh will tell us how we can expand its 
impact in this reauthorization bill.
    Since the beginning of CLEEN's program, GE has partnered 
with the FAA to introduce technologies, like LEAP, a family of 
engines powering today's narrow bodied planes. Three out of the 
four aircraft departures today across the globe are powered by 
these engines built by GE in its joint ventures. So I'm glad 
they are here today to talk about that.
    This kind of success does not go unnoticed in the 
Information Age. We must work harder to keep America's 
competitive edge.
    We will hear from Arjan Hegeman about GE's work to develop 
more efficient open fan engines and 1 day these propulsion 
systems will power commercial flights around the world.
    The FAA authorization bill, I believe, can bolster research 
and development and innovation technologies, but there's also a 
lot going on in the private sector.
    Earlier this month at Aerotech Flight Test Center in Moses 
Lake, Washington, Universal Hydrogen flew a regional airliner, 
an 84-foot-8 aircraft, equipped with engines powered by 
hydrogen fuel cells. This was the largest aircraft ever to fly 
principally on hydrogen power.
    In January, ZeroAvia, with a growing presence in Everett, 
Washington, flew what was at the time the world's largest 
retrofitted commercial hydrogen electric aircraft to date. So I 
welcome both Jon Gordon from Universal Hydrogen and Val 
Miftakhov from ZeroAviation, and I'm proud that these 
companies, along with Aviation Magnecs, that are in Washington 
State, are continuing to build the next generation of aviation 
technology.
    These technologies can provide new access to thousands of 
local municipal airports on lower fuel costs and maintenance 
costs. That's why we want to see this develop. So 
congratulations to both of you for bringing these new products 
to us and in the future one step closer.
    Achieving that zero aviation emissions by 2050, a target 
shared by the industry and the Federal Government, will require 
shifts in commercial aviation development and different fuel 
sources. So this means building aircraft made from lighter 
weight thermal plastics and composites that are so important 
and we want to continue to see leadership on that issue, 
particularly in the state of Washington.
    We feel like we must seize on the opportunity with this FAA 
reauthorization to strengthen America's competitiveness in 
aerospace.
    I look forward to hearing from all the witnesses and 
helping us meet this challenge.
    I now recognize Ranking Member Cruz for his opening 
statement.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Welcome to each of the witnesses. Now's an exciting time to 
be involved in aviation. Americans are developing new 
technologies, like the air taxis, hypersonic planes, rockets, 
and better fuels, all of which have the potential to transform 
air travel.
    The benefits of these new technologies are wide-ranging. 
They may enable more adaptable and comprehensive safety 
inspections for keeping the flying public safe. They may allow 
aircraft to fly more efficient routes, reducing emissions, and 
cutting time off the trip. In fact, many aircraft, as we'll 
hear today, may be able to fly using less fuel or new 
propulsion technologies.
    The FAA must move quickly to keep up with this innovation 
or risk stifling the progress made by the private sector. I've 
heard more than once that better aviation technologies exist 
but aren't used today because they're incompatible with the 
FAA's legacy systems or the FAA has yet to certify them.
    We'll hear today that innovative companies are going 
elsewhere because of FAA red tape. For example, some are 
leaving the U.S. for regulatory sandboxes in Australia or 
certification frameworks in the U.K. This is antithetical to 
America's ethos of innovation and it's frankly embarrassing for 
businesses to be lost to other countries when we can't get our 
act together.
    We must hold the FAA accountable for its role in certifying 
new aircraft and its failure to give clear and consistent 
regulatory guidelines to nascent industries that rely on the 
FAA for direction.
    A key component of being ready for new entrants is having a 
national airspace system capable of handling the sheer number 
of these aircraft, large and small. We need to ensure that our 
air traffic system has the capability to integrate these new 
aircraft.
    The FAA has spent nearly 20 years attempting to implement 
their latest air traffic control modernization effort, next 
gen. What was once supposed to be a transformative upgrade to 
our air traffic systems has become a tech refresh effort, 
plagued by delays and cost overruns, with limited benefit to 
the flying public.
    The conversation about what is required to integrate all 
these great new technologies is an important one, but we also 
need to have a conversation about whether we have a modern air 
traffic system that can meet the needs of not just new entrants 
but of current users which, given that Transportation Secretary 
Buttigieg just last week asked airlines to cut their summer 
schedules by 10 percent in New York due to staffing shortages, 
seems doubtful.
    I want to underscore that point for the listening public at 
home. Just last week, Secretary Buttigieg asked airlines to cut 
their schedules in New York by 10 percent because the FAA 
couldn't keep up with the traffic. That's a failure of the job 
given to the department.
    Our priorities in aviation must be safety, reliability, and 
affordability. Two of today's witnesses will discuss hydrogen 
and other forms of advanced propulsion. While these can be 
exciting technologies, we should be wary of calls to provide 
taxpayer subsidies for them. When anything is subsidized by the 
government, the risk of wasting taxpayer dollars is profound.
    We're already seeing this happening with sustainable 
aviation fuel or SAF. In last year's wasteful tax and spend 
reconciliation bill, congressional Democrats provided nearly 
$300 million in grants and a special tax credit varying between 
a $1.25 and a $1.75 per gallon for the SAF.
    Without these government handouts, SAF would not be 
commercially viable. Today, SAF costs up to eight times the 
cost of traditional jet fuel. If the economies of all SAF air 
travel were fully shifted to the flying public, very few could 
afford a plane ticket.
    SAF risks becoming the new sylindra or cellulostic fuel. 
Cellulostic biofuels, which are different from traditional corn 
or soy ethanol, were supposed to be the future of gasoline. 
Even though they benefited from hundreds of billions of dollars 
of Federal support and waived production requirements over 15 
years, they're still not commercially viable today.
    Here's one example of SAF's cost for taxpayers. A Boeing 
737 MAX 8 holds 6,800 gallons of fuel and carries 175 
passengers. Assuming 10 percent of the fuel is SAF, which is in 
line with the President's stated goal, subsidized at $1.75 per 
gallon, that comes to $7 per passenger per trip. Those numbers 
add up and even worse could be used in time if SAF cannot be 
commercially viable to justify a Federal mandate.
    ESG goals driven by politics should not be used to harm the 
American consumer.
    I look forward to the testimony.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Cruz, for that statement.
    I'll now turn over the hearing to the Chair of the 
Subcommittee Senator Duckworth, and again thank you for 
chairing all these meetings. We greatly appreciate it.

              STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY DUCKWORTH,

         STATEMENT OF KEVIN WELSH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,

               OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY,

                FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION

    Mr. Welsh. Thank you.
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here today to 
discuss the Federal Aviation Administration's work related to 
Advancing Next Generation Aviation Technologies.
    My name is Kevin Welsh. I'm the Executive Director of FAA's 
Office of Environment and Energy.
    The FAA's core mission is to provide the safest and most 
efficient aerospace system in the world. We also work to 
address the environmental impacts of aviation, such as climate 
change, local air quality, and noise in a safe manner.
    As laid out in the U.S. Aviation Climate Action Plan, this 
Administration is committed to achieving net zero greenhouse 
gas emissions in the aviation sector by 2050. To achieve this, 
we are working to develop new technologies, enable increased 
production of sustainable aviation fuels, explore new energy 
solutions, and increase the efficiency of air traffic 
operations.
    Our work in these areas not only helps address 
environmental impacts but can also reduce costs, support job 
growth, and economic developments.
    Improvements in aircraft technology have long played a 
central role in reducing aviation's environmental impacts. FAA 
investment in aircraft technology research focuses on 
accelerating the introduction of new technologies to reduce 
emissions and noise while improving efficiency.
    Through the Continuous Lower Energy Emissions and Noise 
Program or CLEEN, the FAA provides funding to aerospace 
manufacturers to develop and accelerate the introduction of 
these technologies.
    Funding for CLEEN, including industry cost share, has 
exceeded $500 million since its inception in 2010. 
Cumulatively, the technologies developed during the first two 
phases of CLEEN are estimated to have the potential to save 36 
billion gallons of fuel by 2050, reducing CO<INF>2</INF> 
emissions by over 400 million metric tons, resulting in a cost 
savings of over $90 billion.
    Through the FAA's Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet 
Fuels and Environments, a university-led center of excellence 
known as ASCENT, work is also underway to investigate and 
develop innovative technological solutions.
    ASCENT's research spans partnerships with 16 universities, 
covering a breadth of technical areas, including noise 
reduction technologies, system level modeling and design, 
propulsion airframe integration, combustion, and supersonics.
    In addition to the CLEEN and ASCENT programs, the Inflation 
Reduction Act provided over $46 million for a new Low-Emission 
Technology Grant Program. This program will support projects 
that are designing, prototyping, and testing new low-emission 
aviation technologies.
    The FAA also continues to demonstrate international 
leadership on aviation technology, innovation, and environment, 
including our leadership setting international aviation 
environmental standards.
    Adoption of these standards not only advances global 
environmental protection but also helps set a level playing 
field and facilitates the export of U.S.-developed and 
manufactured aerospace technology.
    Sustainable aviation fuel present the most promising near-
term tool to dramatically reduce aviation emissions and will be 
critical to longer-term efforts to decarbonize aviation.
    In September 2021, the Departments of Transportation, 
Energy, and Agriculture announced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel 
Grant Challenge, an initiative to reduce cost, enhance the 
sustainability, and expand production use of sustainable 
aviation fuel, with a goal of achieving three billion gallons 
of sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.
    In addition to the Low-Emissions Grant Program I mentioned 
earlier, the Inflation Reduction Act also provided $245 million 
for a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grant Program which we're 
now moving quickly to implement.
    An important aspect of developing new technologies, 
including new energy sources, such as hydrogen or electric 
propulsion systems, is ensuring the certification of these new 
technologies, and safety will always be the FAA's first 
priority.
    The FAA's Aircraft Certification Service engages with 
companies to identify policy and certification issues and 
address them early in the application process for type 
certification.
    The FAA will continue to support the development and 
deployment of innovative technologies and sustainable aviation 
fuels and other new sources to reduce aviation's environmental 
impacts.
    In short, global leadership and innovation in aviation and 
support continued economic growth and job creation.
    Thank you and I will be happy to answer any of your 
questions today.

office conducts research, develops policy, and collaborates across the 
U.S. government, with the aviation community, and internationally to 
address the environmental impacts of aviation. The FAA's core mission 
is to provide the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world. 
This mission also includes addressing the environmental impacts of 
aviation, such as climate change, local air quality, and noise. As laid 
out in the National Aeronautics Science and Technology Priorities and 
U.S. Aviation Climate Action Plan, this administration is committed to 
net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector by 2050. To 
achieve this, we are working with industry and other important aviation 
stakeholders to develop new technologies, enable increased production 
of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), increase the energy efficiency of 
air traffic operations, and conduct research and develop tools to 
support the FAA's mission. Our work in these areas not only helps 
address environmental impacts, but can also reduce costs, such as 
through reduced fuel burn, and supports job growth and economic 
development.
TECHNOLOGY
    Improvements in aircraft technology have long played a central role 
in reducing aviation's environmental impact. Continued FAA investment 
in aircraft technology research and development is focused on 
accelerating the development and introduction of new aircraft 
technologies that reduce emissions and noise while improving fuel 
efficiency. For example, the FAA, aircraft manufacturers, and airlines 
collectively work toward further reducing aircraft noise and emissions 
at the source through efforts like the Continuous Lower Energy, 
Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) Program, which began in 2010. The FAA's 
CLEEN program provides funding to develop and accelerate the 
introduction of technologies that will reduce noise, emissions, and 
fuel burn. CLEEN is implemented in 5-year phases, and we are currently 
in the third phase of the program. Funding for the CLEEN program, 
including the industry cost share component, has exceeded $500 million 
since its inception. Cumulatively, CLEEN Phases I and II are estimated 
to save the aviation industry 36 billion gallons of fuel through 2050, 
reducing CO<INF>2</INF> emissions by 420 million metric tons over this 
period. These fuel savings would reduce airline costs by over 90 
billion dollars at current jet fuel prices. These savings would also 
benefit passengers. These CO<INF>2</INF> reductions are equivalent to 
removing three million cars from the road from 2020 to 2050. These 
technologies, as well as the use of SAF, will also dramatically reduce 
nitrogen oxide and soot emissions from aircraft operations. 
Technologies from Phases I and II are estimated to eliminate over 997 
kilotons of nitrogen oxide emissions during landing and takeoff through 
2050. Phase III will continue to target further reductions in aviation 
noise, emissions, and fuel burn.
    A few examples of the accomplishments from the FAA's investments in 
the CLEEN program include:

  <bullet> Under CLEEN Phases I and II, GE Aerospace has developed new 
        low-emissions jet engine combustion systems. The enhanced 
        ``TAPS'' combustion system is used in aircraft engines, 
        reducing nitrogen oxide emissions for over 500 aircraft in 
        service and over 5,000 on order. A further improved TAPS 
        combustor was developed under CLEEN Phase II to reduce 
        emissions for the forthcoming Boeing 777X aircraft.

  <bullet> Under CLEEN Phase II, Boeing has developed and demonstrated 
        advanced aircraft wings made of stronger and lighter-weight 
        materials to support innovative development of current and 
        future aircraft. This technology alone is expected to reduce 
        fuel consumption by 3.5 percent.

  <bullet> In addition to the technologies being developed by the CLEEN 
        Program, our industry partners are using the knowledge gained 
        through the program to enhance other systems. For example, 
        Pratt & Whitney leveraged the CLEEN Program to demonstrate new 
        engine fan technologies to further reduce fuel consumption and 
        noise from their geared turbofan engines. This knowledge has 
        also resulted in improvements to the design software that Pratt 
        & Whitney uses to design all of their engines. As such, CLEEN 
        has an impact that is far greater than the individual 
        technologies that we are working to mature.

  <bullet> Finally, data from CLEEN Program tests have contributed to 
        the approval of a number of alternative jet fuels for safe use.

    Through the FAA Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels & 
Environment, also known as the Aviation Sustainability Center, or 
``ASCENT,'' work is also underway to develop innovative technological 
solutions to reduce noise, emissions, and fuel burn from subsonic and 
supersonic aircraft. ASCENT technology research is complementary to 
CLEEN, partnering with academia, rather than industry, to advance the 
state of the art knowledge broadly within the aviation community. 
Whereas CLEEN research focuses on a higher maturity for the technology 
and a direct path to product application, ASCENT research can cover a 
wider range of ideas and different maturity levels. Further, ASCENT is 
using its research efforts to develop analytical tools that can be used 
by industry to develop quieter, cleaner, and more efficient products. 
This research spans partnerships with sixteen universities, covering a 
breadth of technical areas, including noise reduction technologies, 
system-level modeling and design, propulsion-airframe integration, 
combustion, turbomachinery, and supersonics.
    The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 provided over $46 million for a 
new Low Emissions Technology grant program that the FAA calls ``FAST-
TECH.'' The FAA will launch the program this year, which will support 
projects to develop, demonstrate, or apply low-emission aviation 
technologies. This grant program is expected to support projects that 
are designing, prototyping, and testing new low-emission aviation 
technologies, as well as projects enhancing technology testing and 
demonstration capabilities that will accelerate a broad range of low-
emission aviation technologies. FAST-TECH will play a complementary 
role to CLEEN and ASCENT by providing a focus specifically on low-
emission aviation technologies and building up not only individual 
technologies, but also testing capabilities to drive a new generation 
of low-emissions aircraft.
    The FAA also continues to demonstrate international leadership on 
aviation and climate change, including our leadership in setting 
international environmental standards for aviation at the International 
Civil Aviation Organization. Adoption of international environmental 
standards not only advances environmental protection globally, but also 
helps to set a level playing field and facilitates the export of Unites 
States-developed and manufactured aerospace technology.
SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL
    SAF presents the most promising near-to-medium-term tool to 
dramatically reduce aviation emissions and will be critical to longer-
term efforts to decarbonize aviation. Creation of good jobs is a 
priority for this administration, and SAF production is expected to 
enhance the creation of jobs related to agricultural production, 
municipal solid waste reduction, fuel refining, and engineering. Over 
the last 15 years, the FAA has led efforts to support SAF development 
through testing, analysis, and coordination across government, 
academia, and the private sector. The FAA supports SAF development 
through a robust research program that spans the breadth of fuel 
testing and qualification to environmental and economic analysis. 
Through ASCENT, the FAA advances new research on SAF production and 
supply chain analysis and enables streamlined fuel approval via ASTM 
International. Since 2006, the FAA has partnered with industry to 
support broad engagement of SAF stakeholders through the Commercial 
Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative. Additionally, under the CLEEN 
Program, the FAA partners with industry to support critical SAF testing 
to ensure safety and performance. This administration is broadly 
committed to the development of SAF. In September 2021, the Departments 
of Transportation, Energy, and Agriculture entered into a memorandum of 
understanding launching a government-wide Sustainable Aviation Fuel 
Grand Challenge (the SAF Grand Challenge). The objective of this effort 
is to reduce the cost, enhance the sustainability, and expand the 
production and use of SAF that achieves a minimum of 50 percent 
reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas compared to conventional fuel to 
meet a goal of supplying 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 
(approximately 10 percent of projected jet fuel use) and sufficient SAF 
to meet 100 percent of domestic aviation fuel demand by 2050. The FAA 
is coordinating closely and collaborating with the other agencies on 
the SAF Grand Challenge to effectively use resources and accelerate the 
increased production of SAF. At the FAA we are, among other things, 
coordinating SAF testing and analysis, working with standards 
organizations to ensure the safety and sustainability of SAF, providing 
international technical leadership, and seeking opportunities to 
support the development of infrastructure to connect SAF producers with 
aviation users.
    Finally, in addition to the FAST-TECH grant funding noted earlier, 
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 also provided $244.5M to support 
the development of a new SAF-focused grant program that the FAA calls 
Fueling Aviation's Sustainable Transition via SAF (``FAST-SAF''). The 
program aims to support rapid SAF deployment, focusing on domestic 
projects that enable SAF production, transportation, storage, and 
blending. The objectives of this grant program are in line with the 
goals of the Administration's SAF Grand Challenge, with a primary focus 
on enabling the rapid scale-up of the domestic production of SAF that 
provides significant lifecycle greenhouse gas reductions.
CERTIFICATION OF NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES
    An important aspect of the quest to reduce aviation emissions and 
noise is the development of new technologies to power aircraft, such as 
hydrogen or electric propulsion systems. As the FAA works to certify 
aircraft that seek to use these technologies, safety will always be the 
agency's first priority. As a mechanism to help facilitate the safe 
introduction of new, innovative products, including new propulsion 
technologies, the FAA's Aircraft Certification Service established a 
structure and process to facilitate the introduction of new technology 
through early engagement with companies to identify policy and 
certification issues and to develop strategies to address them early in 
the application process for type certification.
    Although current regulations may not have been drafted with these 
technologies in mind, our regulatory framework has the flexibility 
necessary to certify them. Where necessary, FAA technical specialists 
are developing performance-based requirements to address novel or 
unusual design features that current requirements do not address. In 
addition to applying the extensive technical knowledge and experience 
of our own specialists, the FAA is also leveraging the work of NASA, 
industry standards committees, research organizations, and other 
industry working groups to broaden our understanding of the technical 
issues that new technologies like electric and hydrogen propulsion 
systems pose.
    As the technology matures and the FAA and industry gain experience 
in the certification of these new technologies, we expect the 
regulatory structure to evolve. In the meantime, however, current 
processes are effective in ensuring the technologies meet the expected 
level of safety.
CONCLUSION
    The FAA will continue to support the development and deployment of 
innovative technologies, SAF, and other new energy sources to reduce 
aviation's environmental impact, ensure continued global leadership in 
innovation and aviation, and support continued economic growth and job 
creation. We are focused on continuing to pursue and support cutting-
edge research and development, and establishing and maintaining close 
partnerships within government, industry, and academia, as the safest 
and most efficient airspace system in the world evolves to meet the 
needs of the future. I would be happy to answer any questions you may 
have.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    Mr. Pearce.

                  STATEMENT OF ROBERT PEARCE,

                 ASSOCIATE ADMINISTRATOR, NASA

            AERONAUTICS RESEARCH MISSION DIRECTORATE

    Mr. Pearce. Thank you.
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, Senator Duckworth, and 
distinguished members of the Committee, I want to thank you for 
the opportunity to appear here today and discuss how NASA 
Aeronautics will help usher in the next generation of aviation 
innovation and competitiveness in the United States.
    The aeronautics portfolio focuses on research, development 
and testing of aviation technology advancements that will 
benefit humankind and retain U.S. leadership in a vital 
manufacturing transportation sector.
    The President's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Request proposes 
$996 million for NASA Aeronautics efforts that will transform 
aviation in four key areas: ultra-vision aircraft, high-speed 
commercial flight, advanced air mobility, and a safe national 
airspace system that will be more sustainable to collaborative 
digital technologies.
    In addition, we continue to advance beyond next generation 
ideas to ensure there's always a new horizon for aviation.
    The history of modern aviation is one of continuously 
reducing fuel burn noise emissions while improving safety. 
NASA's Sustainable Flight National Partnership, a cost-sharing 
industry partnership, aims to continue this trend by making it 
largely by reducing fuel burn and enabling U.S. industry 
competitiveness, coupled with sustainable aviation fuels and 
improved operations, NASA Research will help the aviation 
sector to meet its goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions.
    I would just mention that one of the industrial 
partnerships we have is with GE. Mr. Hegeman is with us on the 
panel today.
    We're working on technologies for improved thermal 
efficiency of turbine engines as well as the flight 
demonstration of megawatt class electric power trains, and 
we're also doing another project with MagDX to do the same 
thing in electric power trains.
    NASA's enabling more rapid global connections through 
sustainable high-speed commercial flight. We're removing 
barriers to commercial supersonic flight over land by proving 
that we can reduce the enroute noise associated with supersonic 
flight to accept other levels.
    To that end, this year marks the first flight of NASA's X59 
Quiet Supersonic Technology aircraft as a first step in 
measuring community response to the sonic thump.
    I was just out at Lockheed last week out in Palmdale and we 
have basically completed manufacture and assembly of the X59 
and we're getting it ready to go to the flight line. So we're 
really excited about the status of the X59.
    We'll then tackle the next challenges, reducing landing and 
take-off noise, reducing harmful emissions in the upper 
atmosphere, and improving overall aircraft efficiency.
    We'll also investigate the potential airspeed at higher 
speed flight and along those lines, NASA is conducting 
fundamental research to advance the core capabilities and 
critical technologies for a more broad spectrum of hypersonic 
systems emissions.
    NASA's also enabling a transformation of how people and 
goods move around communities and regions and the research and 
demonstration of advanced durability and concepts and 
technologies.
    With more than 80 industry partners and close engagement 
with the FAA, NASA's exploring new vehicles and vehicle 
operations, airspace design and operations, safety management 
and community integration solutions.
    We seek to enable a sustainable advanced air mobility 
system that supports U.S. economic growth and benefits the 
public through emissions, such as carbon medical deliveries, 
disaster response, and scheduled and on-demand passenger 
service.
    I note that starting this year, advanced capabilities for 
emergency response operations project, which is to take these 
technologies and work with what the wildfire fighting community 
to enable better aviation response to wildfires.
    NASA's broadly sharing knowledge gained through the 
development and testing of the all-electric X57 Maxwell 
Aircraft to inform standards and regulations for small electric 
aircraft that will be common in the AM environment.
    With the continuous transformation of aviation over the 
years, NASA looks to cultivate the future generation of 
explorers and innovators. We're expanding partnerships with 
universities to leverage their insights and capabilities while 
training and inspiring the strong diverse future aerospace work 
force.
    We are creating the tools, models, and knowledge needed to 
make the next great leaps in aviation. I'll just make a note. 
We recently at the Glenn Research Center developed a new alloy 
called the GRX-810. This alloy was generated through a 
computational means and then built with Abbott Manufacturing.
    The material property is that it's exceptionally 
incredible. It's a new material that yields incredible 
improvements in strength and durability at very high 
temperatures. We have over 20 licenses pending for this 
material. It's just an example of the kind of work that NASA 
does on a daily basis.
    In summary, NASA's work in aeronautics is critical to 
meeting the Nation's and aviation industry goal of net zero 
aviation greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 by accelerating 
research and development of aircraft technologies that are more 
efficient and quieter without compromising safety.
    Achieving this goal is also critical to the competitiveness 
of the U.S. aviation industry. Our vision and partnerships 
don't stop there. Through ambitious experimental programs, 
including the X57 electric aircraft, X59 low balloon flight, 
supersonic aircraft, the sustainable flight demonstrator, NASA 
is showing the world what is possible and is poised to 
revolutionize the future of air travel.
    Thank you for allowing me to address you today. I'd also 
like to thank the Committee for your continued support of 
NASA's Aeronautics Research and I look forward to answering 
your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Pearce follows:]

     Prepared Statement of Robert Pearce, Associate Administrator, 
             NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and distinguished members of 
the Committee, I want to thank you for the opportunity to appear here 
today and discuss NASA aeronautics and how it will help usher in the 
next generation of aviation innovation and competitiveness in the 
United States.
    NASA's Aeronautics programs focus on research, development, and 
testing of aviation technology advancements that will benefit humankind 
and retain U.S. leadership in a vital manufacturing and transportation 
sector. The President's Fiscal Year 2024 budget request proposes $996 
million for NASA Aeronautics efforts that will transform aviation in 
four key areas: ultra-efficient aircraft, high-speed commercial flight, 
advanced air mobility, and a safe national airspace system made more 
sustainable through collaborative digital technologies.
    The history of modern aviation is one of continuously reducing fuel 
burn, noise, and emissions, while improving safety. NASA's Sustainable 
Flight National Partnership, a cost-sharing industry partnership, aims 
to continue this trend by making a large leap in reducing fuel burn and 
enabling U.S. industry competitiveness. Coupled with Sustainable 
Aviation Fuels and improved operations, NASA research will help the 
aviation sector to meet its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.
    NASA's Sustainable Flight National Partnership seeks to achieve 
critical milestones that accelerate U.S. progress toward net-zero 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, such as:

  <bullet> 2025: First flight tests, by industry partners, of megawatt-
        class electrified powertrain systems and components to reduce 
        fuel burn by up to 5 percent.

  <bullet> 2027: Demonstration, with industry partners, of a full-scale 
        fuselage section and/or wing section made from lightweight 
        composites at an economical production rate four to six times 
        faster than today's rate.

  <bullet> 2027: Ground tests of advanced small core gas turbine 
        engines that achieve a 5 to 10 percent fuel burn reduction 
        compared to current best-in-class engines.

  <bullet> Through 2027: Field demonstrations with the Federal Aviation 
        Administration (FAA), airline, and airport partners of digital 
        departure and oceanic airborne rerouting tools that reduce 
        delays, fuel burn, and emissions.

  <bullet> 2028: Flight tests of the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator, a 
        large-scale aircraft with a transonic truss-braced wing 
        configuration that can reduce fuel burn by up to 10 percent. 
        When combined with additional technologies, the ultra-efficient 
        design could reduce fuel burn up to 30 percent compared to 
        today's best in class aircraft.

    We are demonstrating these efforts at a sufficiently high 
technology readiness level in the late 2020s so that industry can take 
the next steps to bring them to commercial application in the mid-
2030s.
    Concurrently, we are leveraging our highly successful University 
Leadership Initiative to explore concepts for aircraft that can achieve 
zero emissions overall for mid-century application. Later this year we 
will solicit ideas from industry to inform which technology 
advancements we will pursue for the next generation of aircraft.
    NASA is enabling more rapid global connections through high-speed 
commercial flight. We are removing barriers to commercial supersonic 
flight over land by proving that we can reduce the enroute noise 
associated with supersonic flight to acceptable levels, tackling the 
next challenges in local noise and emissions, and investigating the 
potential of even higher speed flight. This year marks the first 
flights of NASA's X-59 quiet supersonic technologies aircraft. This 
program will allow U.S. industry to lead the development of a new 
commercial supersonic market. NASA has developed guidelines for 
supersonic vehicle design that, when followed, significantly reduce the 
annoyance factors associated with supersonic flight. NASA will complete 
flight acoustics testing of the X-59 quiet supersonic technologies 
aircraft, and then fly it over a diverse set of communities, collecting 
noise and community response data, and provide the data to U.S. and 
international regulators. This data will be used by the domestic and 
global regulatory communities to reassess the current prohibition on 
commercial supersonic flight over land.
    NASA is enabling a transformation in how people and goods move 
around communities and regions through research and demonstration of 
Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) concepts and technologies. With more than 
80 industry partners, and close engagement with the FAA, NASA is 
exploring new vehicles and vehicle operations, airspace design and 
operations, and community integration solutions to enable a sustainable 
advanced air mobility system that supports U.S. economic growth and 
benefits the public through missions including cargo/medical 
deliveries, disaster response, and on-demand passenger service.
    NASA is broadly sharing knowledge gained through development and 
testing of the all-electric X-57 Maxwell aircraft to inform standards 
and regulations for small electric aircraft that will be common in the 
AAM environment.
    We have an opportunity to apply Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and 
AAM technology to a current critical challenge--wildland fires. Through 
workshops and studies, we have identified opportunities to apply 
existing NASA technology in and near flight restricted areas during 
active wildland fires to enhance safety, enable expanded operations, 
and improve communication. We successfully demonstrated initial 
capabilities in active wildland fire management operations with the 
United States Forest Service and CAL FIRE, and we continue to explore 
how to further the use of these technologies during firefighting 
training sessions. NASA is also working with other government agencies 
to create an interagency concept of operations to describe how advances 
in Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management (UTM), AAM, remote 
sensing, satellite, and other technologies could be leveraged for 
wildland fire management.
    NASA is transforming the efficiency and safety of the entire global 
aviation system through future airspace tools and system design that 
supports traditional operators as well as new market entrants. NASA is 
partnering with the FAA and the aviation community to build a vision 
for a ``Sky for All''--a mid-21st century airspace that is highly 
automated, safe, scalable, and accommodating to an increasingly diverse 
fleet of air vehicles.
    To continue this transformation of aviation over the years to come, 
NASA looks to cultivate the future generation of explorers and 
innovators. We are expanding partnerships with universities to leverage 
their insights and capabilities while training and inspiring a strong, 
diverse future aerospace workforce. We have just announced the sixth 
round of awards through our University Leadership Initiative (ULI), in 
which we challenge universities to partner across academia and industry 
to provide their solutions to aviation's toughest challenges, with 
special focus on building capacities among underrepresented students 
and organizations. Through ULI grants and student research challenges 
we have directly engaged 95 universities in NASA's aeronautics research 
mission. NASA conducts foundational research on cross-cutting ideas and 
technologies, models, and engineering tools critical to innovation, 
while developing the next generation of scientists, researchers, and 
engineers. The resulting capabilities are critical enablers for these 
transformations in aviation and the broader aerospace community.
    NASA is also conducting fundamental research on reducing the 
barriers to reusable hypersonic systems (speed of greater than Mach 5). 
This fundamental research will enable a broad spectrum of hypersonic 
systems and missions by advancing the core capabilities and critical 
technologies for hypersonic flight. The resulting technology 
advancements will be a benefit to national hypersonic programs both 
within NASA and in collaboration with the Department of Defense. We are 
working with a variety of government and industry partners to 
understand the challenges and evaluate the viability of a commercial 
high-speed market from supersonic through hypersonic speed regimes.
    NASA sets the vision of what is possible based on deep insight into 
the goals and needs of the aviation community and engages with U.S. 
industry early in the technology development cycle. We invest in 
aeronautics research to address the most critical challenges and 
collaborate with our partners to develop and demonstrate the most 
promising technologies. We then share the results of our research with 
the broader community to support further development and 
commercialization.
    NASA works closely with the FAA to align our research to their 
long-term needs so the results can be transitioned to the FAA to 
support certification or implementation. Data from the results of our 
research is used to develop standards and regulations by rulemaking 
committees and domestic and international standards bodies. 
Collaboration with other Federal agencies, such as Departments of 
Defense, Energy, and Transportation, enables us to leverage 
complementary research to the greatest benefit to taxpayers and the 
aerospace industry.
    These collaborations with industry, academia, and other Federal 
agencies translate directly into economic strength and high-skilled, 
high paying jobs. Innovation is the foundation of an aviation sector 
that annually generates more than $1.9 trillion of total U.S. economic 
activity \1\ and contributes a positive trade balance totaling nearly 
$41 billion \2\.

Nations and aviation industry's goal of net zero greenhouse emissions 
in the aviation industry by 2050 by accelerating research and 
development of aircraft technologies that are more efficient and 
quieter without compromising safety. Achieving this goal is also 
critical to the competitiveness of the U.S. aviation industry. Our 
vision and partnerships don't stop there. Through ambitious 
experimental programs, including the X-57 electric aircraft, X-59 low 
boom supersonic aircraft, and the Sustainable Flight Demonstrator, NASA 
is poised to revolutionize the future of air travel.
    Thank you once again for allowing me to address you today. I would 
also like to thank this Committee for your continued support of NASA's 
aeronautics research, and I look forward to answering your questions.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. Pearce.
    We now recognize Mr. Gordon for his remarks.

   STATEMENT OF JON GORDON, CO-FOUNDER AND GENERAL COUNSEL, 
                       UNIVERSAL HYDROGEN

    Mr. Gordon. Thank you, Chair.
    I am Ron Gordon. I am the Co-Founder of Universal Hydrogen.
    Just a few weeks ago, only 3 years after our founding, my 
company achieved the historic first flight of a 40-passenger 
Dash-8 regional aircraft powered with a hydrogen fuel cell.
    This is the largest aircraft ever to fly powered with a 
hydrogen fuel cell and the largest aircraft ever to fly 
principally on hydrogen.
    To some, the promise of a mission-free flight may seem a 
distant vision, but I hope our first flight brings that reality 
to each of you today.
    Airline interest in our power trains has been overwhelming. 
We now have firm commitments from 16 airlines across 12 
countries, for over 250 aircraft. Within a decade, you will see 
our hydrogen-powered aircraft flying in nearly every region of 
the globe.
    Furthermore, we have made our hydrogen fuel tanks modular. 
This allows us to fill them up offsite, transport them to the 
airport, and load them on and off aircraft, all with the 
existing infrastructure. Every airport in the world is now 
ready to support hydrogen-powered flight.
    The simple fact is we are on the verge of a revolution on 
how we power aircraft. This is good for the economy as well as 
the environment. We must take the right steps now to ensure 
that the United States is prepared.
    I have three suggestions. First, the FAA needs more 
resources. We've enjoyed a supportive, if at times rigorous, 
relationship with the FAA and we welcome it. This 
transformation is too important for there to be any question as 
to the safety of new platforms.
    We invite the strongest and most comprehensive 
certification process possible. One of the most sacred 
responsibilities of aviation is preserving the trust of the 
American people. So the FAA needs all available resources to 
ensure that the door to certification is only open to those 
upholding the highest safety standards.
    My second ask is parity. At a recent aviation conference 
participants were asked what technology will fuel the future of 
flight. The clear winner was hydrogen and yet the recent White 
House Report on National Aeronautics priorities dismisses 
hydrogen-powered aviation in favor of so-called sustainable 
aviation fuels or SAFs, which, as the Senator pointed out, are 
expensive to produce and emit the same amount of carbon as jet 
fuel.
    Much like automobile manufacturers in the 1980s, large U.S. 
aerospace companies are invested in not having to change their 
engines or operations. That is why the aviation status quo is 
so supportive of SAFs. They don't have to do much different.
    When adopting SAFs, which have a carbon footprint no better 
than the fossil fuels they displace, gives us a false sense of 
accomplishment. This mindset is especially risky given that the 
EU, U.K., and China are all developing hydrogen-powered 
aviation.
    The recent announcement of Rolls Royce's hydrogen-burning 
jet engine is a sign of things to come. If we limit our 
innovation to our industry's tolerance for change, we will be 
continuously falling behind.
    DOT, DOE, and NASA must be directed to allocate resources 
equally to hydrogen, electric, and hybrid aviation and not just 
SAF.
    Third, we need a voice in D.C. I've had numerous 
conversations with various offices in DOE, DOT, and NASA. They 
listen with interest, ask some questions, but there's no 
followup. No department, agency, or division is directed to 
focus on hydrogen aviation.
    If the U.S. is to remain a global leader in the future of 
aviation, then all relevant Federal agencies must work together 
to create the proper safety, certification, and operational 
frameworks to ensure its success. Right now we are desperately 
far behind.
    In Japan, the Ministry of Economy and Civil Aviation Bureau 
have established a working group that brings together all 
relevant Japanese agencies as well as commercial interests. I 
would like to suggest such a framework here.
    We need a hydrogen hybrid and electric aviation task force 
that can work together to prepare for future aviation platforms 
and that will be isolated from the entrenched status quo 
interests who only see SAF as worthy of consideration.
    In conclusion, this is an exciting transformative time to 
be in aviation. Fueled by concerns about aviation's impact on 
climate change and competition from the EU, U.K., and China, 
our industry faces a tipping point. We must either innovate or 
fall behind.
    I thank you for your time today and on behalf of the over 
one million people working in aircraft manufacturing today, I 
thank you for your continued devotion to our industry, our 
families, and our future.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Gordon follows:]

  Prepared Statement of Jon Gordon, Co-Founder, Universal Hydrogen Co.
    Thank you Committee Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and 
members of the Committee.
    My name is Jon Gordon, and I am the co-founder and general counsel 
of Universal Hydrogen.
    I am truly grateful for the opportunity to testify today and share 
our experiences as one of the companies at the forefront of making true 
zero emission flight via hydrogen power a reality.
    As you may know, earlier this month, Universal Hydrogen achieved 
the historic first flight of a 40 seat Dash-8 regional aircraft. This 
flight represents the largest aircraft ever to fly powered with a 
hydrogen fuel cell powertrain, and is also the largest aircraft ever to 
fly principally on hydrogen power.
    With our first flight, Universal Hydrogen is on track to enter 
commercial service as early as 2025.
    One of the unique aspects of our business model is that we do not 
require any new and expensive infrastructure. This is because we have 
made the hydrogen fuel tanks modular, allowing us to fill them offsite 
and transport them to and from the airport with standard delivery 
trucks. They also load on and off the plane with existing ground 
handling equipment. Every airport in the world is now ready to support 
zero emission hydrogen-powered flight.
    Airline interest in our aircraft retrofits has been overwhelming. 
We now have partnerships with 16 different airlines across 12 different 
countries, and commitments for over 250 aircraft. Within a decade you 
will see our hydrogen powered aircraft flying in nearly every region on 
Earth.
    In addition, the cost to passengers for flying our planes should 
not change, as the cost per available seat mile for airlines, or CASM, 
is on track to remain the same as jet fuel by the time we enter into 
commercial service. There is thus no green premium, no hidden costs or 
fees, for flying our true zero emission aircraft.
    Our aircraft will not only provide the world's first zero emission 
flight solution, they will also improve air quality as well as noise 
pollution for the communities, many disadvantaged, that live near and 
around airports.
    Our initial launch customer, Connect Airlines, will be flying our 
true zero emission aircraft between northeast cities, including 
Washington, DC, as early as 2025. Imagine that, being able to fly to 
and from Washington, DC or within your states, on green hydrogen 
produced from sunlight, emitting only pure water.
    To some, this promise of emission-free flight could seem like a 
distant vision, but I hope our first flight brings that reality to each 
and every one of you today.
    The truth is, we are on the verge of a revolution on how we power 
aircraft, and other heavy transportation. This is good for the economy 
as well as the environment. We must take the right steps now to ensure 
the United States is prepared to win the clean transportation race.
    And what might those steps be?
First the FAA needs more resources.
    We have enjoyed a supportive, and also very critical and 
analytical, relationship with the FAA. We welcome it.
    This transformation is too important for there to be any question 
as to the safety and validity of new aviation platforms. We invite the 
strongest and most comprehensive certification process possible. There 
can be no shortcuts, no stones left unturned.
    Our operational team has collectively taken over a dozen models of 
aircraft through certification. We hold ourselves to the highest 
standard, and invite the highest level of rigor and scrutiny from the 
FAA. One of the most important parts of aircraft innovation is 
preserving the trust of the American people, so the FAA needs all 
available resources to ensure that the door to certification is only 
open to those upholding superior safety standards.
My second ask is parity.
    At a recent Clean Aviation conference in Europe, participants were 
asked what technology will fuel the future of flight: electric, hybrid, 
hydrogen, or so-called Sustainable Aviation Fuels or ``SAFs''. The 
clear winner was hydrogen.
    And yet, when the White House this month released its report on 
``National Aeronautics Science & Technology Priorities'', the report 
dismissed hydrogen-powered aviation, in favor of SAFs, which are 
exponentially more expensive to produce than hydrogen, and will 
continue to emit the same amount of carbon and other greenhouse gasses 
at altitude as ordinary jet fuel.
    Much like automobile manufacturers in the 1980s, large U.S. 
aerospace companies are highly invested in not having to change their 
engines or operations, which is why the airline status quo is so 
supportive of SAFs. They don't have to do anything different. But 
blending in small amounts of synthetic fuels that have a carbon 
footprint that is no better than the fossil fuels they displace, gives 
us a false sense of accomplishment.
    This is especially risky because the EU, the UK, and China are all 
developing hydrogen-powered aviation. The recent announcement of Rolls 
Royce's hydrogen burning jet engine is a sign of more things to come. 
If we limit innovation to our industry's tolerance for change, we will 
be continuously falling behind.
    DOT, DOE, and NASA must be directed to allocate resources equally 
to hydrogen, electric and hybrid aviation programs as well as SAF.
Third, and finally, we need a voice in DC.
    Over the past three years I have had numerous conversations with 
various offices in the DOE, DOT, and even NASA. They listen with 
interest, and ask questions sincerely. But no department, agency or 
division is directed to focus on hydrogen aviation.
    If the United States is to maintain its prominence in the future of 
aviation, all relevant Federal agencies must work together to prepare 
for it, and lay the proper safety, certification and operational 
regulatory frameworks to ensure its success. Right now we are nowhere 
near where we need to be as a country.
    I recently visited Japan, where the Ministry of Economy, Trade and 
Industry, and the Civil Aviation Bureau, have established a working 
group that brings together all relevant agencies in Japan, including 
commercial interests from airlines, Hydrogen producers, manufacturers, 
and suppliers, to discuss and formulate new policies for the future of 
aviation. I would like to suggest such a framework here.
    We need a hydrogen, hybrid and electric aviation task force that 
can work together to prepare for future aviation platforms, and will be 
isolated from the entrenched status quo interests who only see SAF as 
worthy of consideration and funding.
    In conclusion, this is an exciting and transformative time to be in 
aviation. Fueled by concerns about aviation's impact on climate change, 
and ever increasing competition from Europe, the UK and China, our 
industry faces a tipping point: we must either innovate or we will fall 
behind.
    I thank you for your time today, and on behalf of the over one 
million people working in aircraft manufacturing today, I thank you for 
your continued devotion to our industry, our families, and our future.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    We'll now recognize Dr. Miftakhov for his comments.

   STATEMENT OF DR. VAL MIFTAKHOV, FOUNDER AND CEO, ZEROAVIA

    Dr. Miftakhov. I'm Val Miftakhov, CEO and Founder of 
ZeroAvia.
    We are a hydrogen electronic power plant manufacturer and 
infrastructure provider for hydrogen electric flights. I 
started the company about 5 years ago, after building my 
previous company was in the zero emissions transportation 
space, already builds the world's largest charging 
infrastructure, smart charging infrastructure company with 
great integration off electric vehicles. I am a pilot myself. 
So this industry is very, very exciting for me, as well.
    I wanted to see the great future for this aviation industry 
which is sustainable and has very exciting technologies in it.
    The large amount of excitement from this is also not just 
about sustainability but also about the economic advantage that 
these new technologies can bring.
    Ranking Member Cruz mentioned the economic affordability 
and this is quite important for these new technologies. The 
hydrogen electric can actually drive lower costs for flying 
public than today's fossil fuel and that cost is continuing to 
decrease because we're actively flying on sunshine or other 
renewable power which goes down and down, down in cost.
    So how is hydrogen electric aircraft operated? We use 
hydrogen aboard the aircraft, zero emission, green hydrogen 
converted to electricity and running of electric motors that 
produce thrust.
    We as a company, ZeroAvia, we have all the technologies 
required in house from high temperature fuel cells to power 
electronics to motors. We have presence in California, 
Washington State, and looking at manufacturing facilities now 
across the Nation.
    This represents a huge opportunity for the United States on 
the business side. We already have orders from four of the top 
10 airlines worldwide, 1,500 engines, $10 billion worth of pre-
orders for our engines and fuel.
    This is a real, real opportunity in our pipeline and 
another $20 billion in pre-orders from major airlines. So this 
is not just an opportunity to make aviation cleaner, it's also 
opportunity to make a lot of affordable flying available to 
more and more people.
    Aviation is a great societal good. It connects people. It 
connects communities. We're here today in person and it's 
great.
    We can connect significantly more people with more local 
aviation if the aviation is clean. It does not produce health 
effects. It's not just about climate. There is well understood 
research out there that shows health connection off ground 
level aviation emissions and health outcomes. With these new 
propulsion technologies, we can address all of that.
    So as you're out here, we're starting with small aircraft. 
As Chair Cantwell mentioned, we had our historic flight earlier 
this year in January and progressing now to larger aircraft. 
We're already demonstrating technology and it's a 
multi=megawatt level and our propulsion systems R&D is located 
in the state of Washington and footprint in other states, as 
well.
    We are undergoing these flight tests in a very rigorous 
manner. We are working with regulators. We think that the 
regulatory environment needs to be advanced for these zero 
emission technologies. FAA needs a lot more resources dedicated 
to these new technologies.
    We find a lot of times that there are a lot of projects 
we're competing for resources and there are not enough people 
on the regulatory sides to really help us push technology 
faster forward.
    So things like perhaps zero emission technology center can 
be established specifically for the zero emission technologies, 
new aviation that would allow us more bandwidth.
    We also are looking forward to working with government on 
setting up the level playing field around these new 
technologies. This is talking about the right metrics of merit 
for technologies. We don't want the government to make 
technological favorites. We want a metric that would organize 
the response of the industry and optimize the outcome, whether 
it's a carbon coolant inspection specific for aviation because 
a lot of climate impacts aviation. It's not just carbon-based.
    There are a lot of other sources and, finally, we want to 
see more cross-departmental cooperation for departments, DOT, 
DOE, FAA, NASA. There are a lot of opportunities to bring U.S. 
leadership to the forefront.
    Thank you very much.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Miftakhov follows:]

   Prepared Statement of DR. Val Miftakhov, Founder and CEO, ZeroAvia
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and Members of the Committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. My name is Val 
Miftakhov, and I am the Founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, the U.S.-
headquartered leader in designing and building zero-emission, hydrogen-
electric aircraft propulsion systems for aircraft. It is my privilege 
to speak to you about advancing next generation aviation technologies, 
the work we are doing at ZeroAvia, and the steps we can take to 
facilitate the transition to hydrogen fuel-cell aviation and ensure 
continued U.S. leadership in aerospace innovation.
    ZeroAvia is developing hydrogen-electric engines--essentially fuel 
cell systems which use hydrogen to create electricity and power 
electric motors, with the only emission being water vapor. We 
anticipate this to be the most environmentally friendly and most 
economically attractive solution for operators long-term. As I intend 
to make clear, with many leading nations focused on tackling climate 
change, advanced and sustainable propulsion systems will be the 
technology that the world will come to depend on for powering aviation 
and, therefore, an important strategic opportunity.
    The United States has led the world in aerospace innovation since 
the Wright Brothers began their journey toward powered flight nearly 
120 years ago. Those of us working to advance next generation aviation 
technologies in the U.S. today are doing our best to extend that 
history of leadership. As the aviation industry has changed during the 
last 120 years, and innovators no longer bring new technologies to 
market in a vacuum, it is imperative that the regulatory environment 
keeps passengers and crew safe and remains an essential driver of 
progress.
Zero-emission aviation is happening
    Aviation is responsible for around 2.4 percent of global carbon 
emissions, but its footprint goes much deeper than just carbon.\1\ 
Climate modeling techniques suggest that total aviation emissions could 
be warming the climate at about three times the rate of CO<INF>2</INF> 
aviation emissions alone.\2\ In addition, the FAA predicts enplanements 
to increase by 189 percent between 2021 and 2041.\3\ As more and more 
people travel by air and other industries abate their emissions, 
aviation's share of emissions will only increase.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are an important starting 
point, and have rightly been supported by Congress, the FAA, and NASA 
for more than a decade, but they do not eliminate carbon emissions in 
flight, nor do they significantly reduce other noxious and climate 
warming emissions. Combustion, even of SAFs, creates and releases 
airborne nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), sulfur oxides 
(CO<INF>X</INF>), and other particulates like soot. These non-
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions, as well as contrails, are known to have a 
`multiplier effect' on climate change.\4\ For communities living in and 
around busy airports, the air quality impact is also significant. 
Around 10 percent of aircraft emissions come during taxi, takeoff, 
initial climb, and during the approach and landing.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    With the demand growth in aviation predicted by the FAA, total 
carbon emissions will not reduce significantly overall if drop-in fuels 
are the only solution, and non-CO<INF>2</INF> emissions may increase 
significantly. Fostering zero-emission technology for short-haul 
initially will have the added value of preserving SAF volumes for 
longer haul flights.
    Combustion technologies, such as new hydrogen-burning engines which 
are in development, offer some further impact. However, while hydrogen 
combustion eliminates carbon emissions, it does not eliminate many of 
the non-CO<INF>2</INF> emissions, the wider effects of which I have 
mentioned. Battery-electric propulsion, which is currently leading the 
energy transition in the vehicle sector, can eliminate emissions, but 
batteries are too heavy for commercial-scale aircraft, and battery-life 
constraints mean frequent replacement, with prohibitive costs, as well 
as further environmental damage.
    For a holistic solution, the answer must be electric propulsion 
powered cleanly and effectively through hydrogen fuel cells. This 
technology eliminates CO<INF>2</INF>, NO<INF>2</INF>, CO<INF>X</INF>, 
and soot; its only emission is the water vapor by-product of the fuel-
cell. And, it is scalable, as ZeroAvia has been demonstrating.
    A study published in June 2020 by Clean Sky, the largest European 
research program, estimated that direct-burn hydrogen systems can 
reduce the global warming effect of flying by between 50 and 75 
percent; SAFs can reduce it by between 30 and 60 percent; and the fuel 
cell has the potential to reduce full climate impact by 75 to 90 
percent.\6\

    The technology for true zero-emission aviation exists today and 
promises an economically attractive model. We will see commercial 
hydrogen fuel-cell air service before this decade is halfway through.
    In September 2020, ZeroAvia flew a 6-seat aircraft equipped with a 
250-kilowatt powertrain, the largest hydrogen-electric aircraft ever 
flown at that time. In January of this year, we flew a 19-seat aircraft 
with our ZA600 engine. At nearly 600 kilowatts, we have more than 
doubled our previous power output in less than three years. Earlier 
this month, ZeroAvia achieved record-breaking power generation from our 
proprietary HTPEM fuel cells. This is the key that unlocks hydrogen 
fuel cell powertrains for use in the narrow-body jets--like Boeing 737s 
and Airbus 320s--that account for more than 50 percent of aviation's 
total emissions. By 2025, we anticipate commercial service with 
aircraft powered by ZA600 powertrains, delivering zero-emission cargo 
and passenger flights.
    At the same time, we have already begun ground-testing our next 
step forward, the 2-to-5 megawatt ZA2000 for larger aircraft. By 2027, 
you can expect to see 40-80 passenger commercial aircraft flying with 
these powertrains. The same ZA2000 powertrain will be quickly adapted 
to power regional jets.
    ZeroAvia is not alone in this space. We have competitors, some of 
whom are sharing this very hearing, who are also demonstrating the 
near-term viability of hydrogen fuel cell aviation. We have significant 
investors whose capital is a testament to the technology's promise. 
And, we have an order book with airlines like United, American, Alaska, 
and others who recognize not just the sustainability benefits we offer, 
but also the tremendous cost savings of our technology. To get a sense 
of how seriously airlines are taking this, note that American Airlines 
has invested in both ZeroAvia and Universal Hydrogen. That is beyond a 
box-checking corporate gesture; it is a vote of confidence in the 
hydrogen fuel-cell technology pathway.
    The driver of these advancements is not limited to environmental 
factors--it is matched with a strong, attractive business case, with 
emission-abating technology saving carriers on operating expenses. As a 
lower intensity system, major overhaul and repair frequency will be 
significantly lower than for traditional combustion engines. And, 
previous Federal investments in the hydrogen economy, like those 
Congress included in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 
and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, will reduce the cost of clean 
hydrogen to a price that makes it quickly at parity with gray hydrogen 
and kerosene-based jet fuel, and ultimately a lower cost fuel. 
According to a report from McKinsey and Clean Aviation, hydrogen, even 
in liquid form, is predicted to be five times more cost-effective than 
Synthetic Fuel by 2050.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A kilogram of clean hydrogen today can have a cost as low as $3, 
the power density of which translates to a $1.50 per gallon price on 
jet fuel. The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics reports that, in 
January 2023, one gallon of jet fuel cost an average of $3.28 \8\. For 
hydrogen, we calculate rapidly falling prices in the future as the 
ecosystem scales up, with $2.2/kg in the near term and, as major 
governments continue to invest in hydrogen, $1/kg by the end of this 
decade. It's this business case that is also driving major investments 
in hydrogen by the world's leading fuel producers.

cost-gallon-43-december-2022-aviation-fuel-consumption-down
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At an estimated $9.23 per gallon in January, sustainable aviation 
fuel (SAF) prices are nearly triple that of Jet-A and, notably, moving 
higher not lower. For smaller operators in sub-regional and regional 
sectors, today's fuel economics are even worse because these carriers 
lack the purchasing power to command an economical price even if they 
are able to get access to SAF after the major airlines have claimed 
what little is available.
    Perhaps one of the most promising near-term benefits of hydrogen 
fuel-cell aviation is changing the economic models for routes to small 
and rural communities that were once less than cost-effective for 
airlines, a subject this Committee examined just last week. Small 
airports that have lost service or suffered reduced service could see 
service improvements because of the efficiencies brought by hydrogen-
electric aircraft, reconnecting underserved communities to hub airports 
and saving residents from increasingly long drives to access air 
travel.
Roadblocks toward zero-emission aviation
    The transition that we envision to zero-emission aviation driven by 
U.S. innovation is not without its challenges. The new technologies we 
are introducing require FAA certification, an uphill climb for an 
already resource-challenged program office. The use of hydrogen will 
require the FAA to provide guidance and standards to U.S. airports. 
And, both of those pain points beg the question of whether these new 
technologies can be developed quickly enough given the imbalance of R&D 
funding flows to alternative combustion fuel development. Only by 
resolving these three issues can we enter the market, realize the 
potential economic and environmental benefits of advanced aviation 
technology, and defend U.S. aerospace leadership against inroads being 
financed by other nations.
Entry-into-service requires FAA certification
    One critical part of bringing sustainable products and technologies 
into service is the FAA's certification process. Certification is also 
integral to fulfilling the environmental commitments the aviation 
industry and the FAA have already made. For the aviation manufacturing 
industry to introduce innovative technologies and more sustainable and 
economical products into the global market, an effective, reliable FAA 
certification process -with new and updated regulations, policy, and 
guidance- is vital.
    We all recognize that the FAA is already operating with a large 
backlog under the current authorization. The combination of several 
factors, including the rapid arrival of the electric vertical takeoff 
and landing (eVTOL) segment, the Boeing 737 Max and 777X 
certifications, the pandemic, and a loss of personnel, has set back the 
FAA's Aircraft Certification Office (AIR) considerably. But, the 
prospect of innovators having to get in line behind an already daunting 
backlog and proceed through an uncertain certification path is gravely 
concerning. It could well defer the climate improvements we are working 
so hard to implement and the U.S. aerospace leadership we are trying to 
extend. These are the aviation technologies the world will come to 
depend on, and efficient and safe certification is one strong plank in 
building a thriving sector in the U.S.
    We believe the FAA is doing what it can, but the AIR program is 
severely resource-constrained. If the next FAA Authorization Bill 
directs the certification program to increase and upskill staff, we 
believe we can work closely with the agency to craft a clear, rigorous 
path to certification. Without such a standardized way forward, 
ZeroAvia and others developing hydrogen fuel-cell aviation will face an 
unpredictable path to market full of FAA Special Conditions that will 
deter investment and dampen adoption.
Airports need support to build infrastructure for sustainable aviation
    The transition to hydrogen-electric aircraft presents U.S. airports 
with the challenge of preparing their infrastructure for a more 
sustainable future. However, the concentration of commercial service 
airports in the U.S. makes the overall infrastructure challenge less 
daunting.
    In some ways, airports present a valuable opportunity for the 
hydrogen economy. Because of the hydrogen volume required by hydrogen-
electric aircraft propulsion, airports will likely serve as centralized 
hydrogen demand hubs. ZeroAvia calculates, for example, that George 
Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston (IAH) would require 30 metric 
tonnes of hydrogen per week to operate just 25 percent of its sub-250 
nautical mile flights. Given the volumes required as the system 
converts to hydrogen propulsion at scale, the case for on-site 
production becomes compelling. And, economies of scale can deliver low 
hydrogen production costs, creating a big opportunity to convert ground 
operation vehicles, onward transportation, and proximate industry to 
hydrogen fuel where it can deliver emissions reductions. This further 
reduces the climate change impact of the aviation sector at large and 
improves air quality for the airport and its neighboring residents.
    ZeroAvia is already demonstrating this potential on a small scale. 
We operate multiple hydrogen fuel-cell road vehicles as part of our 
operations at Cotswold Airport in the U.K. and at Hollister Municipal 
Airport in California, demonstrating the value of hydrogen fuel cells 
for ground transport and ground operations. Airports that leverage this 
opportunity by producing low-carbon hydrogen on-site will create a new 
and valuable airport revenue stream and set the stage for true zero-
emission aviation in the United States.
    This transition to a clean-hydrogen economy will require support. 
Airport funding programs in their current incarnation do not help 
airports make these investments. While the Department of Energy 
Hydrogen Hub program is anticipated to develop hydrogen at a handful of 
airports, that program alone will not be enough to facilitate 
widespread adoption of this game-changing technology. Modifying 
existing FAA airport funding and financing programs can make a 
significant difference, encouraging adoption and helping restore U.S. 
leadership.
    Amending aspects of the Passenger Facility Charge (PFC), Airport 
Improvement Program (AIP), and Voluntary Airport Low-Emission (VALE) 
tools to include hydrogen production and refueling projects that 
support airport vehicles and aircraft will be a great step forward. For 
example, in the current VALE Technical Report (version 7), published 12 
years ago, both fuel-cell technology and transport of hydrogen are 
labeled as being, ``in the R&D stage and not yet commercially viable.'' 
Given the advances we and others are making technically and 
commercially, this urgently requires revision. Bringing program 
guidelines up-to-date will result in tools that better serve today's 
airports and their new infrastructure needs.
    Credit programs like the U.S. Department of Transportation's TIFIA 
program can also help. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 
2021 (IIJA) defined airport landside projects as TIFIA-eligible, but 
the language does not encourage an airport project that supports ground 
support equipment (GSE) and other airside activity. Whether this takes 
the form of expanded TIFIA eligibility or a new aviation-specific 
credit program, the same investment-friendly terms will help 
incentivize the transition to sustainable aviation. When airports 
produce hydrogen that can be both used in their ground operations 
vehicles and sold to air carriers, they will have access to new revenue 
streams that can be used to service loans in the same way that highway 
tolling provides a loan service stream for a traditional TIFIA loan.
    Infrastructure credits offer another approach to incentivize 
airports toward on-site hydrogen production. Within a Federal clean 
fuel program, for example, airports investing in clean-hydrogen would 
earn credits that can be sold to fuel providers whose products garner 
deficits by exceeding a statutory carbon-intensity (CI) standard. This 
is one aspect of California's successful Low Carbon Fuel Standard 
(LCFS) program, recently adopted as well by the State of Washington. In 
the LCFS, an entity that provides electric-vehicle charging stations 
earns credits that can be sold to a transportation fuel supplier whose 
fuel mix does not meet State CI standards.
    These are just a few avenues toward timely development of airport 
hydrogen production to support more sustainable ground operations as 
well as advanced aviation.
FAA research and development programs encourage some innovators to seek 
        funding abroad
    The ZA600 powertrain I spoke of earlier was largely developed using 
U.K. facilities and personnel thanks to the generous support of the 
U.K. Government through the ATI Programme; the Department for Business, 
Energy, and Industrial Strategy; Innovate U.K.; and Aerospace 
Technology Institute.
    Securing U.S. R&D funding for hydrogen-electric propulsion R&D has 
been frustrating to say the least. The likeliest home to low-TRL 
technology research in sustainability should have been the FAA's 
Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT). However, on the Office of 
Environment and Energy's web page, where the ASCENT program is 
introduced, it is described as ``the FAA's Center of Excellence (COE) 
for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment.'' The ASCENT program has 
largely been a Sustainable Aviation Fuel program with nibbles at the 
margins of operational and engine efficiency but no step-changes in 
propulsion technology. The Inflation Reduction Act designated $250 
million of its $300 million allocation to the FAA for SAF research. 
Congress also designated $46 million for low emission aviation 
technology, but the FAA Office of Environment and Energy has indicated 
instead an intent to channel a good portion of that $46 million for SAF 
work. While we do not discount the usefulness of sustainable aviation 
fuels as a bridge technology capable of delivering some carbon 
abatement, billions of taxpayer dollars and more than a decade have 
been spent, and SAF production has yet to make a dent. And, as we have 
seen, the price differential of these elusive fuels is expensive enough 
to result in increased ticket prices if SAFs increase their market 
share. While ASCENT has recently acknowledged a need for more hydrogen 
research, this is not nearly enough to qualify as tech-neutral and not 
nearly enough to match the level of funding for alternative propulsion 
technologies we've seen in the U.K.
    At the same time, other nations have been working to stay apace 
with the U.K. The EU's Clean Aviation program supports alternative, 
sustainable technologies by funding advanced aviation innovation, 
including a significant investment in hydrogen. China is also racing to 
develop hydrogen fuel-cell aviation. While ZeroAvia very much wants to 
rebalance its resources back toward the U.S., the U.S. and the FAA are 
simply not as engaged as others in this area.
    To this end, ZeroAvia encourages the Committee to include language 
in the upcoming FAA Reauthorization that directs the agency to pursue 
investigation into the safety and usefulness of alternative propulsion 
technologies and of hydrogen as a non-combustion source of aviation 
energy.
Adding sustainable aviation to the existing DOT/DOE Joint Office for 
        electric vehicles
    One solution that can help address both the certification 
challenges and the FAA's intransigence on alternative propulsion in one 
stroke would be an expansion of the DOT/DOE Joint Office of Energy and 
Transportation mission to include sustainable aviation, rather than 
limiting its mandate to only electric vehicles. This exchange of ideas 
and perspectives would allow the Department of Energy's experience with 
hydrogen to pollinate the FAA's AIR and AEE programs.
Commercial aviation emissions can be abated
    Under the right conditions, a path to safe, sustainable commercial 
flight by 2025 and large-scale removal of emissions from regional 
aviation by 2030 is absolutely achievable. The costs of failure in this 
pursuit far outweigh the costs of implementation. First and foremost, 
failure means that, as other sectors successfully reduce their 
footprints, aviation will contribute a larger and larger proportion of 
climate-impacting emissions. Sustainable aviation technology already 
developed will languish on the shelf, benefiting no one. Air carriers 
will not be able to lower their emissions beyond the incremental 
improvements made possible by Sustainable Aviation Fuels and engine 
efficiencies, and U.S. skies will suffer. In that scenario, either 
people stop flying--as the growing pattern of European travel 
demonstrates--or the climate crisis worsens.\9\

    Additionally, while some airports find the resources to make the 
necessary investments in hydrogen and begin to benefit from the new 
revenue streams it creates, other airports will be unable to compete 
and will lose service. The immediate cost of airport closures is that 
travelers will have to drive longer distances to access air routes. 
Over time, however, the lack of air carrier access will impinge on 
communities' economic competitiveness.
    Congress and the FAA have positioned the U.S. aviation system to 
lead the world. Those of us pursuing sustainable aviation welcome the 
opportunity to work with you to continue that leadership. Thank you for 
the opportunity to speak with you today, and I look forward to 
answering your questions.

  STATEMENT OF ARJAN HEGEMAN, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY LEADER, GE 
                           AEROSPACE

    Mr. Hegeman. Good morning, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Cruz, and Member of the Committee.
    On behalf of GE Aerospace, our 24,000 employees in the U.S. 
and 45,000 employees worldwide, thank you for the opportunity 
to share more about our company and the incredible innovation 
underway in the aviation industry that will shape flight for 
decades to come.
    My name is Arjan Hegeman, and I'm the General Manager of 
Advanced Technologies for GE Aerospace.
    In my role I get to work with engineers, designing, 
testing, and maturing technologies for the next generation of 
aircraft engines. Our work will enable even more efficient and 
safe future commercial aviation fleets.
    GE Aerospace, based in my hometown Cincinnati, Ohio, 
operating in 25 U.S. states, is one of the world's largest 
manufacturers of commercial and military aircraft engines, 
components, and systems.
    Engines that we and our partners make power three out of 
every four commercial departures globally. That means in 2022 
nearly three billion people flew with our technology under 
wing.
    There's never been a more exciting time in my 25-year 
career as an aerospace engineer. This era of innovation 
requires ongoing collaboration with Federal agencies like NASA 
and the FAA. Aviation is a long cycle industry and new aircraft 
and engines are built based on decades of research and 
development into materials and product designs.
    GE Aerospace recently refreshed our commercial engines 
portfolio providing 10 to 15 percent more fuel efficiency than 
the engines they replaced. This is helping airlines manage one 
of their single largest expenses, jet fuel, and it reduces 
emissions.
    We're already at work developing the next generation of 
technologies that could lead to new aircraft and engines that 
will enter service in the mid 2030s and beyond. New commitments 
call for net zero air travel, requiring more efficient 
equipment than our newest products. This is an opportunity for 
the U.S. to continue to demonstrate global leadership while 
promoting energy independence.
    For our part, GE Aerospace and our partners have proposed 
our most ambitious technology development plans yet. We 
unveiled what we call the RISE Program which is short for 
Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines.
    We aim to do something our company has never achieved 
before, introduce a new jet engine that is at least 20 percent 
more fuel efficient than our most advanced engines today.
    This represents a jump in technology development that would 
typically take multiple generations to achieve.
    The key to the RISE Program is our new engine architecture 
and open fan. Its revolutionary design would open up the 
engine's front fan, reducing weight and drag, and increasing 
air flow around the core at an unprecedented ratio.
    This is accomplished with the same aircraft speeds and the 
same cabin experience that passengers are experiencing today.
    We cannot accomplish this without the partnership of NASA 
and the FAA. For 50 years we've collaborated on technology 
demonstration programs with NASA and the results can be found 
in all our engines flying today.
    With the FAA, we have collaborated on their continuous 
Lower Energy Emissions and Noise Program, the CLEEN Program. 
The current phase of CLEEN is directly supporting development 
of our open fan hybrid electric and noise mitigation 
technologies that are part of our RISE Program.
    While these technologies are exciting game-changers, our 
commitment to safety first is unwavering. As this committee 
well knows, the FAA is responsible for ensuring the safety of 
the aviation technologies through its certification and 
airworthiness work.
    The coordination of government and industry during the 
technology development and demonstration phase ensures that the 
FAA has insight and acquires the expertise needed to create the 
appropriate regulations, policy, and guidance.
    Our industry-leading position is due in large part to the 
strength and resolve of our U.S. employee base and operations 
and earlier this month, we announced plans to invest more than 
$335 million this year in existing U.S. manufacturing 
facilities.
    As you can consider the 2023 FAA Reauthorization Act, I 
would urge you to recognize the important role the FAA plays in 
industry oversight as well as in the development of aviation 
technologies that improve equipment efficiency, reduce noise, 
and enhance aviation safety.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Hegeman follows:]

Prepared Statement of Mr. Arjan Hegeman, Advanced Technology Leader, GE 
                               Aerospace
    Chair Cantwell, Senator Cruz and members of the Committee, on 
behalf of GE Aerospace, our 24,000 employees in the U.S., and 45,000 
employees worldwide, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on 
the topic of next generation aviation technologies and the future of 
flight. My name is Arjan Hegeman, and I lead advanced technologies for 
GE Aerospace.
    GE Aerospace, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, with operations in 25 
states, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of jet engines, 
components, and systems for commercial and military aircraft. We also 
have a global service network to support these offerings.
    It's a privilege to join you and the other organizations invited to 
share our testimony today, during what's truly one of the most exciting 
periods of my 25-year career as an aerospace engineer. We welcome the 
opportunity to join other stakeholders in the aviation industry--
Universal Hydrogen, ZeroAvia, the FAA and NASA--to show how we're 
shaping the future of flight.
    Today, GE Aerospace and its joint venture companies have nearly 
41,000 commercial engines at work powering three out of every four 
aircraft departures globally and a diverse portfolio of more than 
26,000 military engines. As a result, nearly 3 billion people flew with 
our technology under wing in 2022. We take that responsibility 
seriously, living our purpose to invent the future of flight, lift 
people up, and bring them home safely.
    GE Aerospace is a top aircraft engine producer due in large part to 
the strength and ingenuity of our U.S. employee base and 
infrastructure. Earlier this month, we announced plans to invest more 
than $335 million in existing U.S. manufacturing facilities this year, 
purchasing cutting-edge equipment and making upgrades to position the 
company and our U.S. workforce of more than 24,000 people for a strong 
future. For example, in Lynn, Massachusetts, we'll invest $31 million 
toward test facility and tooling upgrades to support engine production 
and development. In anticipation of continued manufacturing growth in 
Auburn, Alabama, we'll invest $16 million towards facility upgrades to 
support increased use of additive manufacturing technology.
    In addition to these investments in our operations, we are also 
investing in the development of new technologies to define the future 
of flight. We have embarked on one of the most extensive technology 
demonstration plans in our 100-plus year history, spending $1.9 billion 
\1\ on aviation research and development in 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ GE, customer and partner funded
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In 2022, government members of the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO) adopted targets to reach net zero carbon emissions 
for international flights by 2050, following a similar commitment made 
by the aviation industry. This is an ambitious goal, requiring broad 
cooperation and significant investment across all sectors of the 
industry. New innovative aircraft engine systems will need to be 
developed that burn significantly less fuel to help meet emission 
reduction goals, supporting America's drive toward energy independence.
    In my role, I work with engineers designing, testing, and maturing 
technologies for the next generation of aircraft engines to enable an 
even more efficient and safe commercial aviation fleet. This is a 
pivotal moment for the aviation industry, as we're already at work 
today developing the technologies that will power the aircraft of 
tomorrow.
    As you consider the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2023, I would urge 
you to recognize the important role the agency plays in industry 
oversight, as well as in the development of aviation technologies that 
improve efficiency, reduce noise and emissions, and enhance safety for 
the public.
GE Aerospace's roadmap for the future of flight
    At GE Aerospace, we are taking bold action to define and develop 
technologies for the next generation of engines. GE Aerospace and our 
partners have incrementally improved fuel efficiency with each 
successive new commercial aircraft engine design. The GEnx engine, 
introduced in 2011, is up to 15 percent more efficient than its CF6 
engine predecessor. The LEAP engine \2\, introduced in 2016, is 15 
percent more efficient than the CFM56 engines it replaces. Our most 
recently certified engine, the GE9X, has been designed to be up to 10 
percent more efficient than the GE90-115B, with emissions of nitrogen 
oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) 55 percent below current regulatory 
requirements, due to a low-emissions combustor designed through the 
FAA's Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ LEAP engines are a product of CFM International, a 50-50 joint 
company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Plans now aim to achieve something GE Aerospace hasn't ever done 
before with a revolutionary new engine design--pushing for 20 percent 
greater fuel efficiency in one generation.
    To address this challenge, GE Aerospace, along with Safran Aircraft 
Engines, announced the CFM RISE \3\ (Revolutionary Innovation for 
Sustainable Engines) technology demonstration program in June 2021. The 
CFM RISE program encompasses a range of new, disruptive technologies 
for future engines that could enter service by the mid-2030s.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ RISE is a registered trademark of CFM International, a 50-50 
joint company between GE and Safran Aircraft Engines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Central to the program is advancing open fan engine architecture, a 
novel engine design that removes the nacelle around the front fan to 
optimize propulsive efficiency and reduce weight and drag. This 
proposed open fan architecture is a key enabler to achieving 
significantly improved fuel efficiency while delivering the same speed 
and cabin experience as current single-aisle aircraft. NASA and FAA 
programs are supporting RISE program technologies, such as NASA's 
Hybrid Thermally Efficient Core (HyTEC) project, through which GE 
Aerospace is advancing combustion technology further for a new compact 
engine core.
    CFM's RISE program will also use hybrid electric capability to 
optimize engine efficiency while enabling electrification of many 
aircraft systems. Through the Electrified Powertrain Flight 
Demonstration (EPFD) project, NASA and GE Aerospace are developing an 
integrated hybrid electric powertrain to demonstrate flight readiness 
for single-aisle aircraft. The EPFD program builds on recent GE 
Aerospace and NASA efforts at NASA's Electric Aircraft Testbed (NEAT) 
facility that was the world's first test of a megawatt-class, multi-
kilovolt hybrid electric system in conditions simulating altitudes up 
to 45,000 feet. We expect to conduct ground and flight tests of the 
hybrid electric engine system by the mid-2020s using a modified Saab 
340B testbed and GE's CT7 turboprop engines. Boeing and its subsidiary 
Aurora Flight Sciences are providing GE Aerospace with airplane 
modification, system integration and flight-testing services.
    Additionally, CFM is collaborating with Airbus on a hydrogen 
demonstration program as part of the CFM RISE program. CFM will modify 
a GE Passport engine for testing by designing a new cryogenic fuel 
delivery system, hydrogen combustor and fuel controls. This is no easy 
feat, requiring a significant change to the propulsion system to be 
capable of safely burning liquid hydrogen, which doesn't generate 
carbon emissions during the combustion process. Efforts to design a new 
hydrogen combustor engine will draw from GE's more than 8 million hours 
of operating experience with hydrogen combustion with land-based gas 
turbines.
    The RISE program embodies CFM's mission to push the limits of 
innovation to develop, demonstrate, and bring to market breakthrough 
technologies that will advance the industry.
Alternative fuels--key to reduced aviation emissions
    Revolutionary technologies and alternative fuels both have critical 
roles to play in meeting the aviation industry's net-zero ambitions.
    The biggest opportunity to make progress toward net zero by 2050 is 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), an alternative jet fuel with a lower 
carbon footprint. All GE Aerospace engines can operate on approved SAF 
blends today, which can be made from plant-based material, fats, oils 
and greases, alcohols, waste streams, captured carbon, and other 
alternative feedstocks. When blended, SAF has the same chemical 
composition as the jet fuel most commonly used today. The key 
difference is that instead of being made from fossil-based sources, SAF 
is made from partially or completely renewable sources. The use of 
renewable feedstocks and processes reduces net carbon emissions over 
the entire lifecycle of SAF compared to fossil-based fuels by up to 80 
percent.
    GE Aerospace has been actively involved in assessing and qualifying 
SAF since 2007 and works closely with producers, regulators, and 
operators to help ensure SAF can be widely adopted for use. One of the 
major roles GE plays is in evaluating and qualifying new types of jet 
fuels for engine operation, including various types of SAF.
    While approved SAF is compatible with existing aviation equipment 
and infrastructure today as a drop-in solution, supply is extremely 
limited. Currently, SAF production is less than 1 percent of global jet 
fuel demand.
    To address the current scarcity of SAF, the U.S. Department of 
Energy, U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, and other government agencies introduced the SAF Grand 
Challenge in 2021 to develop a comprehensive strategy for scaling up 
new technologies for SAF production on a commercial scale. GE Aerospace 
supports this vision to reduce the cost, enhance the sustainability, 
and expand production and use of SAF. It represents an opportunity to 
demonstrate global leadership while promoting energy independence.
    Another candidate jet fuel that has received increasing interest 
globally is hydrogen. Whereas approved SAF can be used in jet engines 
today, hydrogen as an aviation fuel requires the development of new 
aircraft engines to be compatible, which we are exploring.
The role of agencies in aviation technology development
    NASA and the FAA play crucial roles in accelerating development of 
new technology through research investments.
    NASA has deep domain expertise and excellent facility resources, 
making the agency the ideal technology collaborator. For more than a 
century, NASA and its predecessor organization--the National Advisory 
Council for Aeronautics--has been the global leader in aviation 
research. As outlined in the Aeronautics Mission Directorate Strategic 
Implementation Plan, NASA is continuing its aeronautics leadership 
through the sponsorship of four key programs: the Advanced Air Vehicle 
Program (AAVP); the Airspace Operations and Safety Program (AOSP); the 
Integrated Aviation Systems Program (IASP); and the Transformative 
Aeronautics Concepts Program (TACP). These programs have led to major 
investments for the development of new hybrid electric jet engines and 
more compact engine components that can withstand higher operating 
temperatures to reduce fuel burn. Similarly, NASA's Sustainable Flight 
Demonstrator (SFD) program represents an investment into new aircraft 
designs needed to achieve the aggressive performance goals for future 
products. As the SFD program advances, integration of new engine 
architectures will become more important to reach efficiency 
objectives.
    As this shows, the NASA aeronautics investment portfolio reflects a 
continuation of successful government/industry partnership to maintain 
and advance competitiveness of U.S. aviation products.
    The Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) Program is 
the FAA's principal environmental effort to accelerate the maturation 
of new aircraft and engine technologies. Through the CLEEN Program, the 
aviation industry partners with the FAA via a cost-sharing approach to 
expedite integration of more environmentally beneficial technologies 
into commercial aviation. Technologies developed under the CLEEN 
Program effectively transform the commercial fleet, replacing legacy 
aircraft with new products that produce less noise and fewer emissions, 
while using less fuel. These technologies support the overall 
environmental performance goals of the FAA's Next Generation Air 
Transportation System (NextGen) to help protect the environment in a 
way that allows the aviation industry to grow.
GE Aerospace's history of collaboration with FAA and NASA
    GE Aerospace's partnership with NASA has transformed the landscape 
of aircraft propulsion over the last 50 years. Collaborative programs 
like the NASA Quiet Clean Short Haul Experimental Engine (QCSEE) in the 
1970s contributed to the design of the GE CF6-80C engine, which is 
still in commercial service today. Similarly, following successful 
demonstration of an F101 core powerplant under the QCSEE program, GE 
Aerospace obtained an export license to incorporate it into the CFM56 
engine, which went on to be the best-selling commercial aircraft engine 
in history, powering both the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 narrowbody 
aircraft. In response to the energy crisis of the 1970s, another 
combined NASA and GE effort gave rise to the GE Unducted Fan 
Demonstrator, UDF<SUP>TM</SUP>, and the subsequent open fan engine 
concept that is informing CFM's RISE program today.
    Although unducted fan development was previously canceled when oil 
prices declined, joint GE Aerospace and NASA development of composite 
technology was introduced into service in 1995 with the GE90 engine, 
powering the Boeing 777, featuring the industry's first fan blades made 
from composite materials that are lighter weight and more durable than 
their metallic counterparts. GE and NASA continued composite fan 
technology collaboration, demonstrating a new design on the NASA 
Advanced Ducted Propulsion (ADP) rig, which entered service in 2011 on 
the GEnx engine. The GEnx engine powers the Boeing 787 and 747-8 
aircraft.
    With the current focus on energy independence and environmental 
sustainability, GE Aerospace and NASA are collaborating on multiple 
fronts to develop new technologies to enable a future product, 
targeting 20 percent better fuel efficiency than today's most advanced 
engines. These programs include: EPFD (hybrid electric), HyTEC (engine 
core), and other small projects.
    GE Aerospace's partnership with the FAA has been similarly 
successful. Through Phases I and II of the CLEEN program, the FAA has 
partnered with GE Aerospace to introduce technologies into the current 
generation of products, including the CFM LEAP family of engines, 
powering narrowbody aircraft, which represents the largest segment of 
the commercial fleet. LEAP engines burn 15 percent less fuel and are 10 
to 12 decibels quieter than CFM56, the prior state-of the art. The 
CLEEN program also helped develop technology for our latest commercial 
engine, the GE9X, which will power the newest U.S. widebody offering, 
the Boeing 777X. The GE9X is up to 10 percent more fuel efficient than 
the GE90 engine, the prior generational equivalent, with NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions 55 percent below regulatory requirements.
    Currently, CLEEN III program funding supports research and 
development efforts for several of the most promising technologies to 
achieve CFM RISE program goals for a major step-change reduction in 
carbon emissions for future, next-generation single-aisle aircraft 
engines. Through CLEEN, GE Aerospace is advancing open fan engine 
architecture, electrification, noise-lowering technologies, and more, 
as well as continuing ongoing research into alternative jet fuels. 
Looking to the future, CLEEN IV is on the horizon, to accelerate 
additional technologies into the fleet, in coordination with industry 
and NASA.
    Further, the FAA's Fueling Aviation's Sustainable Transition (FAST) 
grant program, also known as the AERO Act and created in the Inflation 
Reduction Act of 2022, supports efforts to accelerate aviation 
innovation and technological advancements. This program complements 
ongoing efforts to accelerate the uptake, distribution, and use of SAF 
while simultaneously spurring investments in innovation and 
technological advancements. GE Aerospace thanks the committee for its 
role in creating this program, especially Senator Raphael Warnock (D-
GA), Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Senator Gary Peters (D-MI), and 
Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) who led in the creation of the AERO Act.
NASA and FAA investments fuel aviation competitiveness
    The U.S. aviation industry faces fierce competition from Europe and 
emerging challenges from China. During the pandemic, European 
governments increased investments in more sustainable aviation 
including Germany, France, and the UK. These funds join existing EU-
wide programs focused on next generation technology development such as 
Horizon Europe, which supports the European Partnership for Clean 
Aviation. Meanwhile, China is advancing its aerospace airframe and 
propulsion capabilities by investing tens of billions of dollars in 
homegrown champions under its Made in China 2025 plan and other 
initiatives.
    That is why strategic, structural government investment in aviation 
technology infrastructure is critical to protect U.S. national security 
and economic interests amid foreign competition, reduce long-term 
aerospace emissions, and maintain the U.S. aviation industry's position 
as a global leader as it continues to recover from the COVID-19 
pandemic. To meet aviation industry carbon commitments and global 
regulatory requirements, a next generation aircraft fuel burn reduction 
goal of more than 20 percent is needed, requiring a shift in propulsion 
and aircraft technologies. This requires accelerated research and 
development of advanced propulsor, thermal management, and hybrid 
electric technologies, as well as advanced integration of propulsion 
systems with optimized aircraft designs.
    Additionally, new concepts like hydrogen fuel cells and hydrogen 
combustion present both new opportunities and new challenges that will 
require investment to ensure U.S. leadership in these emerging 
technologies. Scaling these new revolutionary technologies will also 
likely require new manufacturing methods and skillsets. Industry 
partnering with NASA through the programs outlined in the ARMD 
strategic plan and with the FAA through the CLEEN program are proven 
paths with a successful track record of accelerating development and 
transitioning new technology into the aviation fleet.
Advancements tied to certification and regulatory progress
    In addition to playing a critical role in accelerating the 
development and demonstration of key technologies, these partnerships 
also provide a pathway for developing certification standards required 
for the successful implementation of new technologies into future 
aviation products. Realizing the benefits of our advancements are 
dependent on the regulatory agencies being able to certify our new 
technologies in a timely manner so that they can be adopted throughout 
U.S. fleets and accepted by other civil aviation authorities around the 
world. Delays in certifying these technologies will have a ripple 
effect and slow our industry's technology implementation, energy 
independence, and sustainability initiatives.
    For the FAA to keep pace with innovation in the development of new 
products and technologies, it must issue new and updated regulations, 
policies, and guidance necessary to support certification and continued 
airworthiness during operation. The FAA lacks sufficient resources to 
simultaneously address the volume of guidance, policy and regulatory 
support requested by industry, resulting in a backlog of in-process 
regulations, policy, and guidance.
    The FAA has a strong commitment to safely integrating new 
technologies as part of its mission to provide the safest, most 
efficient aviation system in the world. The close coordination of 
government and industry during the technology development and 
demonstration phases ensures the FAA builds the technical depth 
required to create appropriate regulations, policy, and guidance for 
new technologies. And as these technologies are matured, the Safety 
Management System (SMS) approach championed by the FAA--which GE 
Aerospace voluntarily adopted in 2017--further ensures that technology 
development efforts targeting significant reductions in emissions 
continue to keep safety of flight at the forefront.
    GE Aerospace is encouraged by this Committee's focused attention on 
reauthorizing the FAA. It is important that the agency is reauthorized 
in a timely manner because, as this committee well knows, the FAA must 
approve all products before they reach the marketplace. Through the FAA 
reauthorization, Congress provides critical direction and funding 
stability to the agency. Recent certification and regulatory reforms 
exemplify the importance of the reauthorization process. It provides 
Congress the opportunity to review how those reforms are working and 
adjust as necessary. Importantly, if the certification and regulatory 
processes do not run smoothly, new and innovative products, which often 
enhance safety and increase efficiency, cannot access the marketplace 
or benefit the National Airspace System and its users.
Workforce readiness
    GE Aerospace would not be a world-leading jet engine manufacturer 
without its workforce of 45,000 people around the world and more than 
24,000 team members in the U.S. As we seek to invent the future of 
flight and support our fleet of engines in operation today, talent 
development and retention is key. The ability to attract new, skilled 
talent is also vital.
    To help inspire future generations to join the aviation industry, 
GE Aerospace introduced in 2021 Next Engineers, a global college-and 
career-readiness program to increase the diversity of young people in 
engineering. The program, offered in the U.S. in Cincinnati, Ohio, and 
Greenville, South Carolina, provides students ages 13 to 18 with first-
hand experiences in engineering concepts and careers, and ultimately 
awards partial scholarships to pursue higher education in engineering.
    College graduates with a passion for technology can apply for GE 
Aerospace's Edison Engineering Development Program. Through the two-
year, entry-level program, young professionals gain valuable experience 
across the engineering spectrum, including engineering hardware design, 
controls, validation testing, materials, power electronics, software, 
and more. Additionally, program participants can accelerate 
professional and technical development through GE Aerospace's Advance 
Courses in Engineering and a variety of business-critical engineering 
assignments. Upon completion, Edison program graduates have the 
technical and business foundation to help invent the future of flight.
    The aviation industry can't achieve its ambitious goals for the 
future of flight and create jobs in local communities without a 
collective effort to address workforce shortages. Industry groups are 
advocating for expanded workforce development programs for aviation 
manufacturing, creating a transition process for military members to 
join civil aviation, and creating a national center for the advancement 
of aviation. GE Aerospace supports proposals like these that promote 
aviation careers and provide resources to help develop a skilled U.S. 
aviation and aerospace workforce through scholarships, apprenticeships, 
aviation curriculum development, and other outreach efforts.
Conclusion
    On behalf of GE Aerospace, I want to thank Chair Maria Cantwell and 
Senator Ted Cruz for convening this hearing and allowing us to testify 
on next generation aviation technologies. We are grateful that the 
Committee has prioritized this issue during your work to reauthorize 
the FAA and appreciate that you are working, on a bipartisan basis, 
with aviation stakeholders to provide the resources and programs to 
advance aviation's future. Maintaining global leadership in aviation 
offers multiple benefits to the American public including high-paying 
jobs, enhanced national security, and meeting the sustainability 
challenges we face. Thanks to all committee members who participated 
today.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. Hegeman.
    I would now recognize Mr. Lieberman for his remarks.

    STATEMENT OF BEN LIEBERMAN, SENIOR FELLOW, COMPETITIVE 
                      ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE

    Mr. Lieberman. Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and 
Members of this Committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
testify today.
    My name is Ben Lieberman, and I'm a Senior Fellow at the 
Competitive Enterprise Institute, a non-profit, non-partisan 
public policy organization that concentrates on regulatory 
issues from a free market perspective.
    Before that, I was a staff member on the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee from 2011 to 2018 and it was there that I 
was volunteered to convert the renewable fuels standard and 
related measures designed to encourage the use of biofuels in 
cars and trucks. I'd like to draw upon those experiences at 
this hearing.
    In particular, there are many parallels between the 
measures that support sustainable aviation fuels today and the 
measures to support cellulosity biofuels in the RFS back then.
    Cellulosity was a separate category of cutting edge 
biofuels, not corn ethanol or conventional bio diesel, but next 
generation technology made from qualifying non-food feedstocks 
that were required to have a 60 percent lower greenhouse gas 
contribution than gasoline.
    Going back to the early to mid 2000s, it's hard to 
underestimate the exuberance that Washington had over 
cellulosity biofuels. All the usual arguments, good for the 
environment, good for national security, good for American job 
creation and global competitiveness, and investment in the 
future. They were all there in full force and a host of 
measures were included in the 2005 and especially the 2007 
Energy Bills.
    The Federal Government went all out to tilt the playing 
field in favor of cellulosic biofuels. There was a very 
generous $1 per gallon tax credit. There also was inclusion as 
a separate category in the Renewable Fuels Standard as well as 
other subsidies, including subsidies for building renewable 
cellulosic production capacity.
    Now, 15 years later, we can say with certainty that it was 
all a failure. Cellulosic biofuels and other so-called mixed 
generation biofuels, whether it was the ethanol from switch 
grass that we heard from President Bush in one of his State of 
the Union Addresses or the algae fuels that President Obama was 
enthusiastic about, it never really materialized.
    Nobody was able to produce commercially viable quantities. 
In fact, nobody really came all that close, and, of course, 
taxpayers were stuck with most of the bill.
    I think there are lessons from that episode that have 
relevance to today's hearing. The first lesson is one of 
humility. We inside the Beltway experts are not as good as we 
think we are at identifying the next big thing. Members and 
staff were wrong about the technological and commercial 
potential of cellulosic biofuels, and as were Environmental 
Protection Agency and Department of Energy bureaucrats, the 
truth is we can't know where the technology is headed and what 
the next breakthrough is and how resources should best be 
allocated. That's a process best left to the free market rather 
than attempts at central planning.
    The final lesson with cellulosic, of course, is that the 
American people got a bad deal. We can debate how much the RFS 
raises the price of gasoline and what fraction of that could be 
attributed to the cellulosic provisions, but it certainly had 
some impact, but the public didn't just pay at the pump. They 
also paid as taxpayers who were made to subsidize all this 
through the tax credits and other provisions.
    Add it up. The experiment in cellulosic very likely cost 
the American people at least a billion dollars. I think we may 
again see a double whammy here if we're not careful with 
Americans seeing their tax dollars going toward sustainable 
aviation fuel while also possibly seeing higher airline ticket 
prices.
    We could be talking about a significant amount of money if 
the President's goal of three billion gallons of subsidized 
aviation fuel or aviation fuel annually is even partially 
reached. So given my experience and seeing the RFS and 
particularly the cellulosic provisions play out over 7 years, 
you can see why I'm leery of some of the similar provisions for 
sustainable aviation fuels in the Inflation Reduction Act.
    I think less government involvement rather than more would 
best serve the cause of aviation industry innovation and be in 
the best interests of taxpayers and the flying public.
    Thank you.

          Prepared Statement of Ben Lieberman, Senior Fellow, 
                    Competitive Enterprise Institute
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of this Committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Ben 
Lieberman and I am a Senior Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute, a non-profit, non-partisan public policy organization that 
concentrates on regulatory issues from a free market perspective. 
Before that, I was a staff member on the House Committee on Energy and 
Commerce from 2011 to 2018 and prior to my time on the Hill, I was 
following these issues at the Heritage Foundation. While at the 
Committee, I covered the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and related 
measures designed to encourage the use of biofuels in cars and trucks. 
I would like to draw upon those experiences at this hearing.
    I had a front row seat watching the RFS and biofuels agenda play 
out, and I saw quite a few things that did not turn out as well as 
predicted. Unfortunately, I see a number of those mistakes being 
repeated in the context of the sustainable aviation fuel provisions in 
the Inflation Reduction Act.
    In particular, there are many parallels between the measures to 
support sustainable aviation fuels today and the measures to support 
cellulosic biofuels back then. Cellulosic was a separate category of 
cutting-edge biofuels--not corn ethanol or conventional biodiesel but 
next-generation technology made from qualifying non-food feedstocks and 
required to have a 60 percent lower greenhouse gas contribution than 
gasoline. Going back to the early to mid-2000s, its's hard to 
understate the exuberance that Washington had over the potential for 
liquid cellulosic biofuels, not unlike the enthusiasm some have for 
sustainable aviation fuels today. All the usual arguments--good for the 
environment, good for national security, good for American job creation 
and global competitiveness, an investment in the future--were there in 
full force, and led to host of measures in the 2005 and 2007 energy 
bills.
    The Federal government went all out to tilt the playing field in 
favor of cellulosic biofuels. There was a very generous $1.00 per 
gallon tax credit, and there were also plenty of subsidies for 
cellulosic research and development and incentives for the construction 
of cellulosic production capacity. And cellulosic biofuel was added to 
the RFS mandate in the 2007 energy bill--even though nobody was making 
it in commercial quantities at that point--which meant that producers 
of it would also get to sell the valuable tradeable credits under the 
program known as RINs. Overall, the cellulosic industry enjoyed a 
redundancy of generous provisions.
    And 15 years later, we can say with certainty that it was all a 
failure.
    Cellulosic biofuels and other so-called next generation biofuels, 
whether it was the ethanol from switch grass that President Bush 
mentioned in a State of the Union address, or the algae fuels that 
President Obama thought were the answer, never materialized. Nobody was 
able to produce commercially viable quantities, and in fact nobody came 
close. And most of the facilities built to make it have been idled or 
have been converted to other purposes. And of course, taxpayers were 
stuck with most of the bill.
    Today, most of the promoters and supporters of cellulosic biofuels 
don't want to talk about it; they would prefer to sweep it under the 
rug and forget about it. But that's not how you learn from mistakes, 
and that's not how you avoid repeating mistakes. And I think there are 
lessons to be learned that are relevant to the discussion about 
sustainable aviation fuels and the provisions in the Inflation 
Reduction Act.
    The first lesson is one of humility--we inside-the-beltway experts 
are not nearly as good as we think we are at identifying the next big 
thing. Members and staff were wrong about the technological and 
commercial potential of cellulosic biofuels, as were Environmental 
Protection Agency and Department of Energy bureaucrats, and of course 
the countless lobbyists that kept telling us that it was just around 
the corner. The truth is we can't know where the technology is headed 
and what the next breakthrough is and thus how resources should best be 
allocated. That is a process best left to the free market rather than 
central planning.
    We also learned that throwing a lot of Federal money at something 
does not ensure success. It certainly can't fix any inherent 
limitations in a particular technology. And in fact, it may well be the 
case that Federal involvement harms rather than helps the process of 
innovation. Twenty years ago, biofuels were almost entirely corn 
ethanol and soybean and waste fat biodiesel, and they still are today. 
It's remarkable how little progress was made on next generation 
biofuels despite all the efforts on the part of the Federal government. 
I recall one venture capitalist saying that when the feds start picking 
winners and losers and throwing money around, it sucks all the oxygen 
out of the room. In other words, Federal involvement makes it harder on 
those emerging technologies and companies that aren't the ones favored 
by Washington. We can't subsidize every idea, and it is important to 
remember that many of the greatest technological breakthroughs were 
ones few saw coming. In this regard, it might be useful to compare the 
taxpayer resources wasted on developing and subsidizing cellulosic 
biofuels with the private efforts and investments that created the 
shale oil and gas revolution at about the same time.
    The other lesson with cellulosic is of course that the American 
people got a bad deal. We can debate how much the RFS raises the price 
of gasoline and what fraction of that could be attributable to the 
cellulosic provisions, but it certainly had and continues to have some 
impact.
    But the public didn't just pay at the pump; they also paid as 
taxpayers who were made to subsidize all of this through the tax 
credits and other provisions. Added up, the experiment in cellulosic 
very likely cost the American people at least a billion dollars. I 
think we may again see that double-whammy here, with Americans seeing 
their tax dollars going towards sustainable aviation fuel--with each 
qualifying gallon getting at least $1.25 and up to $1.75, depending on 
the calculated greenhouse gas emission reduction--while quite possibly 
also seeing higher airline ticket prices. And we could be talking about 
a lot of money if the President's goal of 3 billion gallons of 
subsidized aviation fuel annually is even partially reached.
    So, given my experiences seeing the RFS and in particular the 
cellulosic provisions play out over seven years, you can see why I am 
leery of the similar provisions for sustainable aviation fuels in the 
Inflation Reduction Act. I think less government involvement rather 
than more would best serve the cause of aviation industry innovation 
and the best interests of taxpayers and the flying public.
    Thank you again for inviting me to testify. I look forward to your 
questions.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Mr. Lieberman.

   STATEMENT OF MARK SCRIBNER, SENIOR TRANSPORTATION POLICY 
                   ANALYST, REASON FOUNDATION

    Mr. Scribner. Thank you, Senator Duckworth.
    Good morning, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and 
members of the Committee, and I want to thank you for the 
opportunity to testify before you today.
    My name is Mark Scribner. I'm Senior Transportation Policy 
Analyst at the Reason Foundation, which is a national non-
profit, non-partisan public policy research and education 
organization with expertise across a range of policy areas, 
including aviation.
    My testimony today focuses on the infrastructure needed to 
support the continued growth in air traffic volume and 
integration of emerging technologies into the national air 
space system.
    The United States was once the global leader in air space 
management. However, in recent decades we've fallen behind peer 
countries that have modernized their air traffic control 
practices and technologies.
    As you mentioned, Senator Cruz, FAA's modernization 
program, known as Next Gen, has been plagued by cost overruns 
and delays, and while there are many problems facing FAA's air 
traffic organization, they can be grouped into three 
categories.
    One is funding. It's uncertain, unstable, and poorly suited 
to pay for large-scale capital modernization programs, such as 
Next Gen.
    Another is governance. We have a system with so many 
Legislative and Executive Branch overseers that it focuses air 
traffic organization management attention far more on overseers 
than on their aviation customers.
    And, finally, culture. The air traffic organization has an 
organizational culture that is very risk-averse and status quo-
oriented.
    A decade ago, my Reason Foundation colleague Robert Poole 
conducted an in-depth study of FAA culture and innovation. He 
identified five detrimental aspects of organizational culture 
at FAA's air traffic organization, which were subsequently 
validated by a panel of more than a dozen expert peer 
reviewers. Unfortunately, very little has changed since then.
    To improve the provision of air navigation services in the 
U.S., three fundamental structural reforms are needed. First, 
the air traffic organization should be organizationally 
separated from FAA. Second, funds that support the newly 
separated air traffic organization should be raised by fees 
charged directly on users of the system. Third, a new and more 
responsive governance model for the separated air traffic 
organization should be established.
    These reforms would bring the U.S. into compliance with 
International Civil Aviation Organization best practices 
establish more than two decades ago, reform that have been 
adopted by air navigation service providers managing air space 
in 83 countries today.
    My written testimony provides more detail on the global air 
traffic control landscape, but I wish to highlight two areas 
that deserve special attention: space-based ADSB and remote and 
digital towers.
    Global air traffic satellite surveillance, known as space-
based ADS-B, is currently being provided by Aireon. Aireon's 
service went live in March 2019 and is currently in use by 
dozens of countries, including Canada, Denmark, India, and the 
United Kingdom, that manage air space covering nearly half of 
the earth's surface.
    The benefits include shorter trip times, reduced fuel burn, 
and reduced CO<INF>2</INF> emissions. In addition, near real-
time surveillance quickly identifies aircraft that might have 
deviated from their approved flight tracks, thereby increasing 
air safety.
    In November 2020, the FAA and Aireon announced an agreement 
under which the agency will use the company's ADS-B data to 
analyze possible uses in managing both domestic and oceanic air 
services but this partnership has yet to bear fruit.
    With respect to remote and digital towers, since the FAA 
first investigated this technology in 2007, projects have been 
deployed throughout the world. Remote and digital towers not 
only offer cost savings by foregoing the expensive traditional 
crew control towers, their sensors can provide better 
visibility, especially at night and in rain or fog with 
infrared cameras as well as reduced controller workload.
    The first remote tower became operational in Sweden in 2015 
and was developed by Saab. A global database currently lists 20 
operational remote and digital towers, 24 in development and 
testing, and another seven in research trials.
    The U.S. currently has no certified remote towers. I do 
want to highlight two projects in Leesburg, Virginia, and 
Loveland, Colorado, that have shown promise but they face major 
delays and uncertainty.
    Last month Romania's first remote control tower went live 
using Saab technology. Weeks later, the FAA announced it was 
shutting down the Leesburg project effective June 14th. The 
lead vendor for that project, also Saab, had reportedly told 
FAA last year that it was pulling out of the project after 9 
years. This is likely because FAA has still not provided a 
clear path to certification.
    To conclude, the modernization of existing air traffic 
management infrastructure in the U.S. continues to fall behind 
peer countries. The prospect of new air space entrants raises 
even more questions about the ability of the U.S. to 
accommodate the future of aviation.
    I thank you for the opportunity to testify before the 
Committee and I welcome your questions.

   Prepared Statement of Marc Scribner, Senior Transportation Policy 
                       Analyst, Reason Foundation
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and Members of the Committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today. My name is 
Marc Scribner. I am a senior transportation policy analyst at Reason 
Foundation, a national 501(c)(3) public policy research and education 
organization with expertise across a range of policy areas, including 
aviation.\1\ Throughout its 45-year history, Reason Foundation has 
conducted research on air traffic management, emerging aviation 
technologies, and their interactions with public policy. My testimony 
today focuses on the infrastructure needed to support the continued 
growth in air traffic volume and integration of emerging technologies

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Introduction
    The United States was once the global leader in airspace 
management. However, in recent decades, we have fallen behind peer 
countries that have modernized their air traffic control practices and 
technologies. The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) modernization 
program, known as the Next Generation Air Transportation System 
(NextGen), has been plagued by cost overruns and delays. This bodes 
poorly for anticipated traffic growth from conventional airspace users 
and raises serious questions about long-term efforts to integrate 
emerging aviation technologies and operations--such as unmanned 
aircraft systems and advanced air mobility--into the National Airspace 
System (NAS).
    Our increasingly obsolete air traffic control system is preventing 
airspace users from realizing benefits today while also threatening the 
future integration of emerging aviation technologies into the NAS. 
While there are many problems facing FAA's Air Traffic Organization 
(ATO) generally and NextGen specifically, they can be grouped into 
three categories:

  <bullet> Funding: uncertain, unstable, and poorly suited to paying 
        for large-scale capital modernization programs such as NextGen.

  <bullet> Governance: a system with so many legislative branch and 
        Executive Branch overseers that it focuses ATO management 
        attention far more on overseers than on ATO's aviation 
        customers.

  <bullet> Culture: an organizational culture that is very risk-averse 
        and status-quo oriented.
    These are all interrelated. The uncertain nature of the annual 
appropriations process makes it difficult for the ATO to complete major 
procurements in a timely fashion. As a governmental entity charged with 
regulating safety while providing air navigation services, 
unfortunately, FAA focuses on remaining accountable to its many 
political and administrative overseers rather than the users of its 
navigation services. FAA's dual regulator/service provider mission also 
presents a fundamental conflict of interest.
II. FAA's Culture Problem
    A decade ago, my Reason Foundation colleague Robert Poole conducted 
an in-depth study of the culture at FAA and its relationship to 
innovation.\2\ He selected seven innovations in air traffic control and 
did brief case studies on each, observing how each innovation has been 
dealt with by the ATO and its corporatized counterparts overseas. In 
each of these, he found that ATO's approach was far more hesitant than 
that of corporatized air navigation service providers (ANSPs) in other 
countries. He then developed five explanations of why this culture 
exists, which were subsequently validated by a panel of more than a 
dozen expert peer reviewers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Robert W. Poole, Jr., ``Organization and Innovation in Air 
Traffic Control,'' Reason Foundation Policy Study 431, Jan. 2014. 
Available at https://reason.org/wp-content/uploads/files/
air_traffic_control_organization_innovation.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These five identified detrimental aspects of organizational culture 
at FAA's ATO are as follows:

  1.  Self-identity as a safety agency rather than as a technology 
        provider. This stems from the ATO being embedded within FAA, 
        whose mission is safety. Nearly all the innovations relevant to 
        NextGen come largely from the aerospace/avionics industry, 
        which has a much more innovative, dynamic culture. All those 
        companies are regulated at arm's length by FAA safety 
        regulators--but the ATO is embedded inside the aviation safety 
        regulation organization.

  2.  Lack of, or loss of, technical expertise. Partly due to its 
        status-quo culture and partly due to civil service pay scales, 
        the FAA has a chronic problem with not attracting or not being 
        able to retain the best engineers and software professionals. 
        This means that a lot of the detailed requirements for new air 
        traffic control and aviation systems end up being defined by 
        contractors, which can lead to costly additions that make the 
        systems more complex than is needed and more costly than 
        necessary.

  3.  Lack of, or loss of, management expertise. For the same reasons 
        that FAA has limited technical expertise, it also has trouble 
        attracting and keeping top-notch program managers who are used 
        to being held accountable for results.

  4.  Excessive bureaucracy labeled as oversight. Inherent in being a 
        large government agency that is spending taxpayers' money, the 
        FAA must be held accountable to all the normal government 
        overseers. The ATO must respond to oversight by the FAA 
        Administrator, the Department of Transportation (DOT) 
        Secretary, the DOT Inspector General, the Office of Management 
        & Budget, the Government Accountability Office, and up to 535 
        Members of Congress. While safety is a top priority, responding 
        to the requests and whims of all these overseers takes up a 
        large amount of senior management's time.

  5.  Lack of customer focus. Because the ATO gets its funding from 
        Congress, it ends up--de facto--acting as if its customer is 
        Congress rather than the aviation customers it is supposed to 
        serve.
III. Recommended Reforms to Improve U.S. Air Navigation Service 
        Provision
    To improve the provision of air navigation services in the U.S., 
including the uptake of new technologies and best practices, 
fundamental structural reform is needed.
    First, the Air Traffic Organization should be organizationally 
separated from FAA. That would put the ATO at arm's length from its 
safety regulator, like all the other key players in aviation--airlines, 
business aviation, general aviation, airframe manufacturers, engine 
producers, pilots, mechanics, etc. For more than two decades, the 
separation of air navigation service providers from safety regulators 
has been International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) policy,\3\ 
and the U.S. is among the last industrialized countries that have not 
taken this step.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ International Civil Aviation Organization, Safety Oversight 
Manual, Doc. 9734, Part A, Paragraph 2.4.9 (2001).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Second, funds that support the newly separated ATO should be 
directly raised by fees charged directly to airspace users rather than 
the status quo tax revenue and appropriations processes. That would 
refocus the organization's attention on satisfying its aviation 
customers, as is true of every other high-tech service business. This 
is also the model on which airports operate in nearly every developed 
country, including the United States. Airports issue revenue bonds, 
based on their predictable stream of revenues that come directly from 
users, to finance large-scale capital modernization efforts. So do the 
larger corporatized ANSPs.
    Third, establish a new and more responsive governance model for the 
ATO. Since the revamped ATO would no longer be spending taxpayers' 
money, the proper oversight should come from those providing the 
revenues--its aviation customers. So those customers, along with other 
key stakeholders such as airports and employees, should be the ones 
responsible for oversight and governance--apart, of course, from arm's 
length safety regulation by the revamped FAA.
IV. The Global Air Navigation Service Landscape
    The status quo ANSP model in the U.S. was historically the dominant 
model, whereby air traffic control was provided by a civil aviation 
authority within the transport ministry. That model has undergone major 
change since 1987 outside of the U.S., starting when the government of 
New Zealand removed its air traffic control system from the transport 
ministry by ``corporatizing'' it as Airways New Zealand, a self-
supporting government corporation. Within 10 years, more than a dozen 
other countries had followed suit.
    The revenue source for ANSPs is globally accepted user fees, based 
on the airport and air traffic control charging principles promulgated 
by ICAO.\4\ Prior to corporatization, those revenues were nearly always 
paid by airlines and other airspace users to the respective national 
governments. In most cases, once an ANSP has been corporatized, the 
user-fee revenue flows directly to the ANSP as its primary source of 
revenue. This makes it possible for the corporatized ANSPs to issue 
revenue bonds based on their projected revenue streams, just as 
airports and toll roads do.

Charges for Airports and Air Navigation Services, Doc. 9082 (9th 
Edition, 2012).

    Globally, four ANSPs have been moved out of the government entirely 
under either an independent nonprofit model or as partially privatized 
companies. Another 55 operate as wholly owned government corporations. 
Just 20--mostly developing countries, but also including the U.S., 
Japan, and Singapore--operate as part of legacy civil aeronautics 
authorities that also regulate aviation safety. ANSPs that operate as 
corporations funded by user fees now number 62, which serve 83 
countries globally.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Two areas where FAA has fallen behind much of the rest of the world 
deserve attention: space-based ADS-B and remote/digital towers.
    Space-based ADS-B. Historically, air traffic control over most 
populated countries has, since World War II, relied largely on radar, 
later supplemented by transponders that report altitude and other basic 
information in real time. But there is no radar in the oceans, in 
mountainous terrain (e.g., the Alps, the Himalayas, the Rockies), and 
in polar regions, all of which are traversed by aircraft, including 
airliners. Surveillance there has long been carried out by 
``procedural'' methods, which means periodic reports from pilots to air 
traffic control of their estimated positions based on the plane's 
inertial navigation system. Since those updates are both imprecise and 
only periodic, air traffic control protocols require very large spacing 
between oceanic flight tracks and between planes flying the same flight 
track.
    This began to change in 2019, when an investor-owned company--
Aireon--started offering near-real-time global surveillance via 
satellite. The company contracted with satellite company Iridium to 
place its transponders on all 66 satellites in its new Iridium-Next 
constellation that was launched mostly in 2018. Since most ANSPs are 
now implementing ground-based surveillance using a system called ADS-B 
(automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast), business jets and 
airliners flying oceanic, mountainous, and polar routes are 
increasingly equipped with ADS-B transponders that broadcast a plane's 
identity, GPS position, speed, and other data every 3 seconds. That 
signal is detected by the new satellites and retransmitted to domestic 
ANSP control centers that subscribe to Aireon's services. The space-
based information then shows up on air traffic controllers' screens, 
just as do ADS-B transmissions in domestic airspace.
    Aireon's service, which went live in March 2019, can now offer 
radar-like surveillance to the 70 percent of the globe where this has 
been lacking. But it is only available to ANSPs that subscribe to the 
service. With the addition of the Port Moresby Flight Information 
Region of Pacific airspace in March 2021, Aireon reported that its 
system is in use in over 248 million square kilometers of the Earth's 
surface, nearly 49 percent of the total. Subscribers include the air 
navigation service providers of Azerbaijan, Canada, Denmark, the Dutch 
Caribbean, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Ireland, Singapore, the United 
Kingdom (U.K.), and three multi-country providers: Eurocontrol's 
Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC), the six COCESNA 
(Corporacion Centroamericana de Servicios de Navegacion Aerea) 
countries of Central America, and the 17 African countries of Agency 
for Aerial Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA).
    The ANSPs of Canada and the U.K. were early adopters of Aireon's 
space-based ADS-B surveillance, implementing it on the heavily traveled 
North Atlantic airspace. Thanks to near-real-time information from each 
aircraft, the very large spacing required for ``procedural separation'' 
has been significantly reduced on North Atlantic tracks, and today the 
majority of airliners can fly those tracks at their optimal altitudes 
with regard to headwinds or tailwinds. The benefits include shorter 
trip times, reduced fuel burn, and reduced CO<INF>2 </INF>emissions. In 
addition, near-real-time surveillance quickly identifies aircraft that 
might have deviated from their approved flight tracks, increasing air 
safety.
    In 2019, FAA signed a research agreement with Aireon aimed 
initially at exploring the use of its ADS-B data in the Caribbean. This 
focused on using a modified version of the En Route Automation 
Modernization (ERAM) system at Miami Center to control traffic between 
Miami and San Juan, but FAA also modified the Advanced Technologies and 
Oceanic Procedures (ATOP) software used in its New York, Oakland, and 
Anchorage Oceanic Centers for experimental use in their oceanic 
airspaces. In January 2020, it was reported that FAA was developing a 
one-to-three-year roadmap to expand its use of space-based ADS-B. In 
November 2020, the FAA and Aireon announced an agreement under which 
the agency will use the company's ADS-B data to analyze possible uses 
in managing both domestic and oceanic air services. The most important 
of these would be the vast Pacific Ocean airspace for which FAA is 
responsible. The same kinds of benefits being achieved on North 
Atlantic routes could be achieved in Pacific Ocean airspace flight 
information regions (FIRs), which are the ATO's responsibility.
    Remote/digital towers. In 2007, the FAA research center in Atlantic 
City conducted a demonstration project on a new kind of airport control 
tower. Instead of a tall building with a staffed control cab on top, 
FAA evaluated carrying out tower functions using cameras and other 
sensing devices at various airport locations, with the control cab and 
large display screens on the ground. Besides saving the cost of 
constructing and maintaining the tall building, the demonstration 
showed that controllers would have increased visibility (especially at 
night and in rain or fog when infrared cameras provided better views) 
and decreased workload. Despite these very positive results, no FAA 
program to implement remote towers materialized.
    Drawing on these findings, technology companies and corporatized 
ANSPs overseas began developing and testing remote tower concepts. LFV 
in Sweden and Avinor in Norway were among the first to implement 
remote-tower programs, and the first remote tower to be certified for 
operational use was developed for LFV by Saab-Sensis Corporation and 
became operational in 2015.
    In the years since then, remote towers have been planned or 
implemented in Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Romania, 
and the U.K., among others. Germany, Sweden, and Norway have 
subsequently implemented remote tower centers in which controllers can 
manage air traffic at a number of airports from a single location, 
providing additional cost savings. Such centers are already in 
operation in Germany, Norway, and Sweden and are in the planning stages 
in other countries. A global database assembled and regularly updated 
by Think Research Ltd. lists 20 operational remote/digital towners 
(none in the U.S.), 24 in development and testing, and another seven in 
research trials.\6\ That's in addition to 23 remote tower projects in 
the feasibility study stage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    By contrast, remote tower progress in the United States has been 
very slow. In the 2018 FAA reauthorization, Congress authorized a pilot 
program under which the agency would develop and test five remote 
towers at five different locations, but did not provide funding. Two 
U.S. remote tower projects have been awaiting FAA certification, one in 
Leesburg, Virginia, and the other at Loveland, Colorado. They were 
funded by a combination of state funds and private investment, not by 
FAA.
    In November 2021, FAA issued an operational viability decision on 
the Saab Remote Tower System at Leesburg authorizing it to continue 
managing traffic without a backup mobile tower. This is not official 
certification, but it did trigger the type certification process 
between Saab and FAA, which would allow the Leesburg remote tower to be 
approved as a non-federal system within the National Airspace System. 
Congress included $4.9 million in FY 2022 appropriations to fund 
contract controllers for type certification at Leesburg, as well as 
fund operational viability testing at Fort Collins.
    However, in February 2023, the same month that Romania's first 
remote tower went live using Saab technology, FAA announced it would 
terminate the operations of the Leesburg remote tower on June 14 of 
this year. Saab had reportedly sent a letter to FAA in 2022 announcing 
that it was pulling out of the project after nine years. This is likely 
because FAA had still not provided a clear path to remote tower 
certification.
    FAA's struggle with and slow approach to remote towers is 
illustrative of its broader inability to identify, embrace, and 
implement new cost-effective technologies that are quickly to put to 
good use in other parts of the world.
V. Emerging Technologies and Airspace Management Issues
    Emerging aircraft technologies and operations such as unmanned 
aircraft systems (UAS) and advanced air mobility (AAM) offer exciting 
opportunities to provide new and enhanced aviation services to 
consumers and businesses. However, it remains to be seen how they can 
be efficiently and safely integrated into the National Airspace System 
(NAS).
    UAS traffic volumes and operational limitations have to date had a 
small impact on the NAS. However, these volumes are anticipated to 
increase dramatically in the coming decades coupled with more complex 
operations. FAA, in partnership with NASA and aviation stakeholders, 
has been developing a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) framework for 
several years. But numerous questions are still answered, including how 
a UTM Flight Information Management System will integrate with FAA's 
air traffic management services for conventional airspace users. The 
release of FAA's UTM Concept of Operations version 3.0 has now been 
delayed by over a year and we hope this update can begin answering some 
of the many outstanding questions on UAS traffic management.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General, 
``FAA Has Made Progress on a UAS Traffic Management Framework, but Key 
Challenges Remain,'' Report AV2022041, 28 Sept. 2022. Available at 
https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20Implementation
%20of%20UAS%20Traffic%20Management%20FInal%20Report%20-%2009-28-22.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AAM that makes use of electric vertical take-off and landing 
(eVTOL) aircraft for short-distance trips also raises major questions 
about infrastructure readiness. Some existing infrastructure, such as 
underutilized heliports, can likely be leveraged to support AAM growth 
with minimal disruption. But AAM traffic management will likely involve 
both traditional air traffic management services designed for 
conventional airspace users and UTM. Large AAM traffic volumes will 
demand new productivity-enhancing air traffic control technologies to 
accommodate this growth.
VI. Conclusion
    The modernization of existing air traffic management infrastructure 
in the U.S. continues to fall behind peer countries and is straining 
from the continued operations and growth of conventional airspace 
users. The prospect of new airspace entrants raises even more questions 
about the ability of the U.S. to accommodate the future of aviation, 
which would have significant negative impacts on the economy and 
safety. To successfully modernize the technology and service provision 
of air traffic management of the National Airspace System requires 
institutional modernization.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Committee, and 
I welcome your questions.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    We now recognize Chairwoman Cantwell for her questions.
    The Chair. Thank you, Chair Duckworth. Thank you so much 
again for chairing this important hearing and for all our 
witnesses in describing the advancements in aviation that may 
not be all here, some are here, but we need to continue to work 
on for U.S. competitiveness.
    Mr. Pearce, I'd like to start with you. I'm very interested 
in the Hi-Rate Composite Aircraft Manufacturing Program, HiCAM. 
This is something that I certainly believe we need to do.
    There are multiple companies, like Boeing and Macatillol 
Based Tooling Company, ElectroImpact are involved in HiCAM. 
Obviously the CHIPS and Science Bill said let's continue to 
make sure that we're on the cutting edge of aerospace 
manufacturing and scaling-up on the certification process. NASA 
has clearly recognized how important this is to invest in 
composite manufacturing.
    What do you see as the latest--well, the largest 
impediments for us moving forward? What else do you think we 
need to do to really be successful in the next phase of 
manufacturing?
    Mr. Pearce. The challenges that we are going after with 
respect to HiCAM is really the ability to produce composite 
aircraft structures rate.
    Today, it is state-of-the-art in terms of the aircraft 
production, especially if you look at the Boeing 77, the Airbus 
A350. They are composite aircraft, but they can only be 
produced economically at relatively low rates.
    The Chair. So you're saying 10 to 14 a month?
    Mr. Pearce. Right. And, you know, if you want to do that 
for a single aisle aircraft, you'd have to get that up to 60-
70-80 aircraft a month and the way current composites are 
produced, it doesn't allow you to do that economically. You'd 
have to essentially create lots of parallel lines which really 
would just not be affordable.
    So what we're doing is looking at the composite material 
systems and the ability to produce those at much faster rates 
and so we've got--in fact, today, just a little awhile ago, we, 
through our Advanced Composites Consortium, which has been 
together now for, well, you know, probably close to 10 years 
now, that brings together the U.S. composite manufacturing 
industry. We've just let several contracts, about 30 contracts, 
to look at the fundamentals of the different material systems 
and what it would take to speed those up and then based on the 
results of those studies we'll take the highest leverage 
components of that and then take those to higher scale so that 
we actually get to demonstrate at near full scale the ability 
to produce these composite aircraft at higher rates. So that's 
the focus we have.
    The Chair. Are we falling behind here?
    Mr. Pearce. Well, I'd like to think that, you know, with 
our previous effort, the Advanced Composites Project, which 
demonstrated that we can speed up the rate at which we develop 
and certify these aircraft and now with what we're doing to 
speed up the manufacture that we will be able to stay at the 
leading edge of composite aircraft development and 
manufacturing. But if we don't do these things, yes, we will 
fall behind.
    The Chair. Well, I think obviously for people who may not 
know, composites are lighter weight materials, drive down on 
the fuel costs. That's clear, but I have a lot of aerospace 
machinists in my state. I'm pretty sure Senator Cruz has a lot 
of aerospace machinists. They want to be on the cutting edge of 
technology. They want to be driving.
    I know that there is a thermal plastics center, I think 
it's in the Netherlands, that people are working on. So I think 
we want to know what we're going to do to be aggressive here 
both with the public and private sector.
    I think when we saw CHIPS and Science as an opportunity to 
make sure we were doing that.
    Mr. Pearce. Thermal plastics is one of those areas that we 
are--one of the materials that we're focused on. We're trying 
to be very objective about which material systems will provide 
the best performance and with respect to the application that's 
being desired. So we're kind of trying to keep----
    The Chair. In your testimony, you mentioned, I think you 
called it GRX-10 new composite materials.
    Mr. Pearce. It's actually a metallic alloy system used for 
very high temperature. For example, in turbine engines where 
you're exposing these materials to very high temperatures. GRX-
10 could be a good innovation in that space.
    The Chair. Oh, we just need to get a big banner that says 
material science is key for aviation's future.
    Mr. Pearce. It is critical.
    The Chair. I see everybody nodding.
    Mr. Pearce. It is critical.
    The Chair. I don't know that we've said it so specifically 
and we need to because the material science aspect of this is 
really important and obviously the minerals and everything 
else.
    Mr. Hegeman, Dave Calhoun, CEO of Boeing, has set a new 
U.S. major aircraft program will not be announced until 2030 
and that we wouldn't expect a U.S. commercial airliner to be--a 
new one--built and in service until 2035 at the earliest.
    I think part of what they're waiting for is what they think 
is clarity and leaps in energy engine technology. Do you agree 
with that timeframe?
    Mr. Hegeman. Yes. We are working very hard on maturing our 
technologies and demonstrating that they are safe and durable 
for engine programs that can move into a certification-type 
effort.
    So for the next couple of years, this decade, we have a 
series of demonstrators that do exactly that. Once that is 
completed and you have shown that indeed these technologies are 
delivering and are safe, at that point you kick off the design 
effort and the certification effort toward those new 
applications which then would fall sometime into 2030.
    The Chair. What is going to be the additive advantage? How 
would you describe it?
    Mr. Hegeman. The additive--I'm sorry?
    The Chair. What do you think is the engineering efficiency 
that you're going to get out of the next engine?
    Mr. Hegeman. The fuel efficiency that we're going after is 
more than 20 percent which is significantly more than what you 
traditionally get in a generational update.
    The Chair. And you're going to do that again by these 
material science issues or?
    Mr. Hegeman. A lot of it is material sciences. We have in 
our leap engines, we've introduced new materials, ceramic 
matrix composites that are more temperature-resistant than any 
metal. They are lighter. They're stronger. That path is 
continuing in our technology growth which gives you thermal 
efficiency inside the engine. It's a very large part of what 
the next generation engines will continue to improve on.
    The other large part is the propulsive efficiency which is 
our open fan architecture.
    The Chair. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will 
definitely have more questions but yield to my colleagues.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Chairwoman Cantwell, and I 
recognize Ranking Member Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you again to 
each of the witnesses. This has been an interesting and 
productive hearing so far.
    Mr. Scribner, I want to start with you. We're hearing a lot 
today about future technologies entering the aviation system, 
drones, air taxis, aircraft powered by hydrogen propulsion or 
electric engines. All are looking to integrate into our 
aviation system.
    As we talk about the entrance of these new technologies, 
we're also having conversations about the challenges facing our 
existing air space system and its users.
    Specifically, the FAA has encountered significant 
challenges in modernizing our air traffic system, from the 
antiquated radar-based system into a modern system that can 
handle not just existing users but the influx of new 
technologies.
    It seems to me that many of these new technologies will hit 
a major roadblock if our air traffic system can't handle the 
operations.
    Mr. Scribner, in your judgment, is the current FAA air 
traffic control system capable of managing these new aviation 
technologies in our air space?
    Mr. Scribner. Thank you for that question, Senator Cruz.
    At the volumes and the operations and the timelines that 
have been suggested by many of the developers of those 
technologies, I would say no, and that's particularly true with 
small unmanned aircraft systems, advanced air mobility that 
call for a large increase in total aircraft in the air space.
    Senator Cruz. So what's been the impediment? They've been 
ostensibly working on next gen for 20 years. Why isn't it here 
yet?
    Mr. Scribner. I believe the problem is, you know, the 
separate issues of inconsistent funding, this strong risk 
aversion that we have within FAA's air traffic organization. I 
think it's related to governance.
    A lot of the other countries that have moved away from the 
traditional, you know, combined regulator air navigation 
service provider model that's been with us since the beginning 
of aviation, they did so because they realized that the 
provision of air navigation services is a 24/7 high-tech 
business and that is why they've moved toward at the very least 
the dominant model is the one pioneered by Airways New Zealand 
in 1987 and that is a state-owned corporation, but it is 
separate from the aviation safety regulator which the aviation 
safety regulator continues to regulate at arm's length just 
like it does with every other participant in the aviation 
system but it lets them focus on doing their jobs and that is 
providing the best service to their customers and users of the 
system that's possible.
    Senator Cruz. So am I right that right now the air traffic 
control system is essentially using technologies designed in 
the 1950s? It's using radar technologies. It's using little 
slips of paper.
    As a consequence of being 80 years back, as we're having a 
hearing on technology in aerospace, as a consequence of that 
outdated technology, just about every commercial air flight is 
longer than it needs to be, that they have to route planes 
further apart because the system can't track them. They're not 
using GPS widely.
    Then as a consequence of that, on every flight that's 
taking off, it's taking longer for every passenger, which means 
we're wasting millions of man hours that could be used 
productively doing something else. We're spending millions of 
gallons of fuel which is driving up costs for everyone buying a 
ticket on an airplane.
    We're emitting massive amounts of pollution which could be 
solved if you had shorter and more direct flights that emitted 
more. Is all of that correct?
    Mr. Scribner. Yes, all of that is correct, and we've seen 
how other countries that have modernized their technologies can 
quickly enjoy the benefits that you're talking about.
    Senator Cruz. So what' the path to get there? It seems to 
me there's enormous upside and I've got to say when it comes to 
air traffic control modernization, you have the airlines that 
are enthusiastic about doing it , but you also have the unions 
that are enthusiastic about doing it. We're used to issues 
where management and unions are at cross purposes and you've 
got to mediate the conflict.
    When you've got an issue with that kind of political 
alignment, what's the barrier to getting there, to saving 
millions of dollars, to saving millions of hours of people's 
time, to reducing the cost of air travel, and to having a 
massive environmental benefit? What do we need to do to make 
that happen?
    Mr. Scribner. Well, I think having status quo bias has been 
carrying the day for a long time.
    You know, in the United States this whole discussion began 
during the Clinton Administration with then Vice President Al 
Gore's Reinventing Government Initiative where he proposed 
something similar to the Airways New Zealand Government 
Corporation Model.
    I think we've moved beyond that. We have the nonprofit user 
co-op model that has been very successful in Canada that is now 
the world leader among air navigation service providers that 
had been discussed in previous Congresses, as well, but I think 
even that original reform model, the government-owned 
corporation, would be a substantial improvement on what we have 
today.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Senator Cruz.
    I now recognize myself for my own questions. One of the 
most important things we can do to make American aviation more 
sustainable is increase the supply of American-grown, American-
made sustainable aviation fuel or SAF. SAF presents an 
incredible opportunity to support a critical industry in our 
Nation's heartland.
    Policies that grow sustainable aviation fuel sources 
stemming from America's agricultural bounty represents a true 
win-win solution that supports domestic farmers and blenders 
while also reducing our carbon footprints across all modes of 
transportation.
    However, as has already been discussed, success is far from 
guaranteed. I'm troubled that outdated and inaccurate 
environmental models may prevent America's corn and soybean 
farmers from being a part of comprehensive climate solutions.
    That is why I strongly believe that the forthcoming FAA 
reauthorization must require the Federal Government to use the 
most up-to-date life cycle emissions models, such as Argonne 
National Lab's Creed Model that accurately consider crops, land 
uses, and carbon reduction practices in the United States.
    For example, ethanol produced in the U.S. using advanced 
precision farming methods, plus carbon capture sequestration, 
is much closer to being net carbon neutral that ethanol from 
Brazil where rain forests are being cut down and high carbon 
inputs are being used.
    Executive Director Welsh, how important is it to make sure 
that our life cycle emissions models account for real world 
crop land use and carbon reduction practices to ensure that we 
don't waste a game-changing potential SAF to cut emissions by 
putting American-grown crops to work fueling our aircraft and 
other vehicles?
    Mr. Welsh. Thank you, Senator.
    This is a very important topic. Ensuring accurate life 
cycle emissions reductions from sustainable aviation fuels is 
critical to credibly establishing our environmental benefit.
    So under this sustainable aviation fuels grant challenge 
that I mentioned, the agencies have defined SAF as those fuels 
that meet at least a 50 percent life cycle benefit and directly 
to your question, when it comes to measuring the life cycle 
emissions, it is important to have objective, accurate, clear, 
credible criteria, and as you mentioned, up-to-date criteria 
for producers and users to meet, and absolutely all American-
grown crops are potentially eligible feedstocks if they can 
deliver those emissions reduction benefits and should be 
considered eligible.
    Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    My second question has to do with hydrogen fuels. The 
Midwestern Hydrogen Partnership estimates that hydrogen could 
become $130 to $170 billion a year industry in the United 
States by 2050. Emerging hydrogen and fuel cell markets present 
an opportunity to stimulate economic growth in my home state of 
Illinois as well as other states and improve the environmental 
health for the whole planet.
    In particular, the Midwest boasts a large manufacturing 
base that could rapidly adapt to producing products for 
hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.
    Mr. Gordon and Mr. Miftakhov, what more could Congress do 
to reduce barriers toward hydrogen development and help unleash 
the potential for greener energy and job growth? Let's start 
with Mr. Gordon.
    Mr. Gordon. Senator Duckworth, thank you very much for the 
question, and I absolutely agree with everything that you said.
    Look. I think we just need parity right now. The programs 
are in place for new aviation platforms, but right now it does 
feel like hydrogen aviation is being excluded. So I'm just 
asking for parity.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Mr. Miftakhov.
    Dr. Miftakhov. Thank you, Senator Duckworth, for the 
question.
    From my side again, it's the other flavor of parity is the 
setting up the right metrics for success and what might work 
for some of the ground transport works differently for the 
aviation due to difference in the environmental footprint for 
aviation because of the high altitude emissions. So some of the 
combustion off fuels is more harmful for aviation, in the case 
of aviation than ground transport, and that needs to be 
reflected.
    The fuel cells specifically are hydrogen electric approach 
represents the best of all possible worlds and there are 
multiple third party studies on this by now. It's 90 to 95 
percent full life cycle abatement of all harmful effects off of 
aviation and this is the magnitude that we need because if we 
continue combusting, even if it's south, even if it's 
completely net zero carbon fuels, we still have noncarbon 
effects of this and it's actually combustion is less efficient 
than the fuel cell-based propulsion.
    For small aircraft economically, three times worse than 
fuel cells, for large aircraft, twice as bad economically 
without even talking about the emissions.
    So fuel cells represent a huge opportunity not just for 
aviation but around all types of transfer but for aviation 
especially, and we think that the United States leadership in 
this area will be quite critical for the world's transition.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    I now recognize Senator Budd for his questions.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED BUDD, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Budd. I thank the Chair and again I thank the panel 
for being here today.
    You know, North Carolina is a leader in aviation, has been 
for about a hundred years. We like to say that--and also 
recognize my colleague from Ohio--when I say first in flight. 
They provided the talent, we provided the terrain.
    So, you know, we look at Greensboro supersonic plans to 
manufacture a commercial supersonic airliner that would 
revolutionize travel. In Concord, not too far away, this city 
is seeking to replace its manned air traffic control tower with 
a state-of-the-art remote tower. In Zipline, just a few miles 
from there, it's using unmanned aircraft to deliver health care 
supplies.
    North Carolina was the first state to complete a bridge 
inspection using beyond visual line of sight with a drone. 
Honeywell Aerospace in Charlotte will supply many of the 
components and advanced air mobility vehicles and GE Aerospace 
and Pratt and Whitney are producing next generation engines at 
a facility across the state.
    The common theme I've heard from these companies and many 
others is that the FAA's regulations are leaving them behind. 
Despite congressional mandates for the FAA to issue new rules, 
the agency hasn't issued key regulations that these industries 
really need for growth and the delay, it's not just time, but 
it's got other impacts, as well.
    For example, Honeywell Aerospace has $8 billion in signed 
contracts for advanced air mobility and UAS platforms waiting 
on FAA regulations.
    So, Dr. Miftakhov, again thank you for being here, and, Mr. 
Gordon, can you speak--we'll go to Mr. Miftakhov first. Can you 
speak to how important it is for innovative companies to know 
the regulatory requirements that they're going to be expected 
to meet?
    Dr. Miftakhov. Thank you, Senator Budd, and it's, of 
course, extremely important because we need the certainty of 
the regulatory environment in order to develop the technology.
    Now that collaboration starts early on as we were not just 
showing up but to the regulator with the complete system and 
asking them to look at it. We need interaction long before 
that, especially with new technologies, to understand how we 
need to build them in order to substantiate the safety.
    That means that on the new technologies, the engagement has 
to start earlier. We need more resources from the regulators to 
engage in that and not just more resources in terms of more 
head count but the right types of resources. They do understand 
these new technologies and how they fit into the aircraft and, 
of course, that has impact well beyond aviation as well as 
we're working on the new fuels.
    We have a lot of local impact, as well. So you mentioned 
Southeastern Hub. We're actually part of this initiative in 
your state. It's really exciting to see those developments all 
around the country that will support the future of aviation, 
but we do need to have stronger engagements with the regulator 
early on with the right types of resources.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. Mr. Gordon.
    Mr. Gordon. Thank you, Senator Budd. I'll be quick.
    I think it's important to recognize how complex US. Air 
space is currently without all those new platforms we're 
talking about. Most jurisdictions just deal with one or two 
different types of airplanes. We have nearly every airplane 
flying at nearly every sector from a huge general aviation 
platform to the larger planes, and when you combine all of 
these new platforms that you're talking about that are growing 
in your state, you are talking about a very ,very complex 
system.
    That's why the most important thing for this committee, I 
think, to act on is more funding for the FAA. I know that's 
hard to say more funding for a bureaucracy, but this is a very, 
very complicated problem and you need a lot of bright people 
working on it. They've already got bright minds. They need 
exponentially more.
    Senator Budd. Thank you.
    Mr. Scribner, in my remaining time, you have in your 
testimony, you talked about remote air traffic control towers.
    In Concord, the regional airport there would like to 
install a remote tower to safely handle a wide variety of 
aircraft that operate there. I share your concern that the FAA 
certification approach has contributed to the closure of the 
remote tower at Leesburg. You mentioned one also in Colorado.
    Could you speak to the benefits of remote tower systems?
    Mr. Scribner. Yes. I mean, in addition to the--and thank 
you for the question, Senator.
    In addition to the cost savings that you get, which that's 
true if you're trying to--if you're looking at potentially 
replacing a conventional tower or I think even more 
significantly, if you presently lack a tower at your airport 
and there are many particularly rural GA airports where that's 
the situation, this can provide that added functionality, but 
it also gives, you know, having a mask with sensors that can 
see better than human beings at night, in rain, in fog, and 
then having that display in front of controllers, video feeds 
stitched together so they can zoom in on particular objects, 
the benefits are enormous.
    You know, even if we're talking about upgrading a 
conventional tower or replacing a conventional tower with a 
remote tower, major benefits to remote and digital tower 
solutions that we're already seeing play out worldwide.
    Senator Budd. Thank you all. I yield back.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    I'll now recognize Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Very good. Thank you to all of you. 
You're kind of squeezed in there. I won't make any airline 
jokes about seats.
    So I think that I will start on modernizing our aviation 
infrastructure. Senators Moran and Capito and I just got a bill 
through this committee to focus on improvements to prevent 
future outages, like we saw at the FAA, to bring stakeholders 
to the table.
    Mr. Welsh, what are some of the biggest challenges in 
strengthening the resiliency and reliability of the air traffic 
system? What do you think we need to do?
    Mr. Welsh. Thank you, Senator.
    So I will say that your question mostly is beyond my area 
of expertise in the environment, but I think that I will answer 
it from an environmental aspect but then happy to take any 
follow up back.
    But certainly when we look at resilience in terms of 
climate change and severe weather, we're working actively with 
airports on addressing what those challenges are and how we can 
improve, whether that's the runway design, potential for 
flooding and other impacts.
    So those are the types of things that we're very focused on 
in the area that I work on.
    Senator Klobuchar. In terms of making upgrades to the 
system?
    Mr. Welsh. That's right and providing----
    Senator Klobuchar. You're aware there's other issues that 
have to be upgraded?
    Mr. Welsh. Yes, yes, I am, Senator.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. All right. Every time we're going to 
have a witness from the FAA, I'm going t bring this up.
    Mr. Welsh. Understood.
    Senator Klobuchar. Of course, a lot of it is on us on 
getting the funding and making sure this actually happens.
    Maybe Mr. Hegeman and Mr. Welsh, decarbonizing commercial 
flight is one of the greatest challenges, as you know, that the 
airline industry has ever faced. Renewable fuels are a key 
pathway.
    Secretary Vilsack is a big believer, as am I, in this as 
one of our solutions.
    In your testimony, you note that ``The biggest opportunity 
to make progress toward net zero by 2050 is sustainable 
aviation fuel.'' What more needs to be done to increase the 
supply of sustainable aviation fuel to meet future demand?
    Mr. Hegeman. Thank you.
    So that's absolutely correct. We believe that sustainable 
aviation fuel will be a very large part of getting the whole 
aviation industry to net zero flight by 2050.
    There is no silver bullet here. There's not one single 
thing that is going to work. Alternative fuels, like hydrogen, 
most definitely play a role, as well, but we think sustainable 
aviation fuel can address really the largest part of the 
commercial aviation industry.
    And then on top of that, it's the pursuit of super-
efficient aircraft as well as super-efficient propulsion 
systems to make sure we consume as little as possible as we can 
from those sustainable aviation fuels.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Very good. Mr. Miftakhov, I like 
people that put a lot of vowels in their names, so good name.
    I'm focused on some of the--all of the new technology and 
what we're seeing in part because Sirius is based in Minnesota. 
It was founded in a barn in 1984 in Baribou, Wisconsin, and the 
company revolutionized safety, as you know, with their 
parachutes and saved many lives.
    I've been to Sirius many times but also we have a company 
called Ballistic Recovery Systems in St. Paul, I've been there, 
as well, that makes these parachutes and are incredible that 
are attached to these planes and there have been numerous 
incidents where planes have had problems and these parachutes 
have launched.
    In your testimony, you described how difficult it is to get 
FAA certification at times for new technologies. Obviously 
these were certified. I still remember when all this was going 
on, but could you talk about what you think could be done to 
improve the certification process?
    Dr. Miftakhov. Absolutely. Thank you, Senator.
    Yes, so the first thing that we need, I think, is the real 
focus on the new technologies, some zero emission technologies. 
I talked about potential opportunity to set up specific zero 
emission technology centers perhaps with the FAA in 
collaboration with some other departments. Department of 
Energy, of course, has done a lot of work on the zero emission 
technologies. Department of Transportation itself has done a 
lot of work in the electric vehicle space that can be 
referenced here, and we need that cross-department 
collaboration.
    And then, of course, the resourcing, echoing some of the 
comments here, we need to establish the right resourcing plan 
for the FAA in those zero emission technologies perhaps with 
some comments from the industry. Some other markets have shown 
that this could be an effective way to quickly ramp up the 
resourcing and it is in the industry's interest to support 
that. So perhaps that's part of the solution.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. I'm out of time and I'll put on the 
record some questions about aviation work force. To me the 
answer is working on bills that have been introduced here. I've 
got some ideas. We don't have enough workforce and if we're 
going to do the next great Sirius and the next great personal 
parachutes and save lives, we got to have that workforce as 
well as flying people around the country.
    So thank you very much and got to keep up the good work.
    Senator Duckworth. Senator Thune.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair, and before I give my 
remarks this morning, I also want to acknowledge and think it's 
already been stated that Theresa Eugene, who has spent almost 
30 years here working on this committee, is today--this is her 
last hearing. She has been a stalwart in the work of this 
committee and so grateful for her many contributions to the 
work not only on this committee but the entire Senate and also 
just appreciate her always smiling face. Whenever you get here 
in the morning, no matter what mood you're in, you run into 
Theresa, it improves your day immediately and so I also want to 
echo and share many of the comments that have already been made 
about Theresa and she departs this committee. We wish her all 
the best. There she is, yes, Theresa.
    [Applause.]
    Senator Thune. I won't make you say anything in response 
but thank you so much. You've been of great service.
    During my time as Chairman of this committee, we considered 
and enacted the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which included 
several provisions related to bolstering the Nation's air 
traffic control system, advancing the next generation aviation 
technologies, and improving the experience of the flying 
public.
    As the next FAA reauthorization approaches, modernizing the 
Nation's air traffic control system, including through the 
implementation of next gen, must remain a top priority.
    Travel disruptions, especially those related to recent ATC 
issues and the failure of the NOTEM System in January, have 
only highlighted the critical importance of technology 
modernization, especially as it relates to improving management 
of the national air space system.
    Beyond accommodating existing operations, the agency is 
contending with an increasingly complex national air space 
system which must accommodate the growth of commercial space 
activity and the integration of drones and advanced air 
mobility aircraft.
    On February 8, Senator Warner and I introduced the 
Increasing Competitiveness for American Drones Act, which 
directs the FAA to establish a regulatory framework for beyond 
visual line of sight UAS operations.
    I believe that a clear framework for such operations is 
critical to the safety and efficiency of the NAS and I intend 
to work with the Chair and Ranking Member to integrate this 
legislation into any FAA reauthorization bill.
    Mr. Scribner, do you see the integration of a beyond visual 
line of sight regulatory framework for UAS as an important 
component of modernizing the Nation's aviation system?
    Mr. Scribner. Yes. Thank you for that question, Senator.
    Yes, I do. I think that is. That would enable most of the 
applications that have been discussed surrounding unmanned 
aircraft systems. So, you know, having to be able to see it or 
someone on the ground being able to see it remotely doesn't get 
you very far in terms of commercial applications.
    Senator Thune. Mr. Pearce, in drafting this bill, Senator 
Warner and I worked to address the concerns of encumbered users 
of the NAS, especially those operating at lower altitudes, such 
as helicopters and agricultural aviation. However, more work 
will need to be done at the agency to ensure the safe co-
existence of UAS with the stakeholders.
    In developing a more streamlined airworthiness approval 
framework, what sort of technologies or solutions do you 
believe the FAA should be considering to ensure the safe co-
existence of beyond visual line of sight operations with 
incumbent users at low altitude?
    Mr. Pearce. Thank you, Senator.
    So we have a long history of working these issues with the 
FAA. Obviously our role is on the research side and FAA is on 
development and implementation and so we've got mechanisms to 
do that.
    We have been working over the years on UAS traffic 
management which enables the use of small UAS at low altitude 
and then the integration of that or the interface of that to 
the air traffic control system is obviously an important issue, 
as you said, beyond visual line of sight and so forth.
    So we work on these issues, develop solutions, and we have 
a continuing what we call research transition team on these 
issues with the FAA. So as we continue this work, we are 
transitioning those to the FAA. So there are solutions out 
there.
    I mean, it takes some time to take research and put it into 
implementation, but we certainly are contributing to that. We 
will continue to do so.
    Senator Thune. I would always encourage you to, you know, 
not only continue the research but hopefully, as you said, in a 
timely way.
    Mr. Pearce. Correct.
    Senator Thune. There's a need for this and it seems like 
we've gotten kind of behind the eight ball.
    Mr. Welsh, we've heard from several stakeholders that 
improving the efficiency of environmental review for the 
expansion of UAS operations will be a crucial part of their 
integration into the NAS.
    Could you describe the work your office is doing to adapt 
and improve the environmental review process for both current 
and future UAS operations?
    Mr. Welsh. Thank you, Senator.
    Yes, we are actively working to ensure that we complete the 
required environmental certification approvals for AAM and UAS 
vehicles and do so expeditiously.
    Similar to other areas, we are adapting existing approaches 
from conventional and gathering data to better inform our 
decisionmaking of the potential impacts of these vehicles, 
particularly, for example, vehicles with frequent flights in 
proximity to homes and neighborhoods.
    So we're working to do this quickly, but we also--these are 
new vehicles and they're flying in new ways. So we want to 
understand what those impacts are, and we've been successful so 
far in completing the environmental reviews and we continue to 
expand the scope of those environmental reviews and move more 
quickly to do so.
    So ultimately what we're seeking to do is facilitate the 
introduction of AAM and UAS while also ensuring that we satisfy 
the environmental requirements and understand the environmental 
impacts but really to your point focusing on doing that as fast 
as possible and not holding up the broader safety 
certifications and approval.
    Senator Thune. I think this will be a big part of this FAA 
reauthorization.
    Mr. Pearce, I'm out of time, so I'm going to ask you to 
take this one, if you will, maybe for the record, but as this 
committee looks toward developing an FAA reauthorization bill, 
do you believe there are opportunities for the FAA to 
incorporate adaptive or dynamic air space management 
technologies into its next gen initiative, and I would ask Mr. 
Scribner what else you believe the FAA ought to be doing to 
more swiftly advance some of the next gen implementation, but 
this whole concept of dynamic air space management is really 
critical and it's important to a state like ours.
    We've got an air base, a lot of general aviation, 
commercial aviation users, all competing, and figuring out how 
to create this adaptive or dynamic air space management 
technology seems to be really important. So I'd like to have 
you, if you could, take that one for the record.
    Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    Via remote, Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Madam Chair. We appreciate 
this.
    Mr. Welsh, earlier this month Senator Lujan and I sent a 
letter to the FAA and DOT requesting a briefing on the status 
of retrofitting aircraft alternators to determine to prevent 
interference with 5G networks and my staff then reiterated that 
request and once again no response from the FAA.
    The July 1 retrofit deadline is coming. I don't know about 
you but I don't know many passengers who will be happy if their 
flights are canceled or grounded when they hear the FAA failed 
to address this situation that they have known about in 
advance.
    So I hope you will go back to the Secretary and you will 
make it known that we need to have a response on this.
    Let me ask you one other question. You've had the deadline 
for the lead-free aviation fuels for the piston engine aircraft 
and that's to be by the end of 2030 and as far as we 
understand, there is no validative replacement for these fuels.
    So how will this initiative impact the general aviation 
fleet which includes essential services, like emergency 
services and law enforcement that is in our rural areas?
    Mr. Welsh. Thank you, Senator.
    First, I'm not familiar with the letter you sent and I'm 
sorry that you haven't received a followup, but I will commit 
to bringing your request back and following up with you.
    Second, regarding removing leaded aviation gasoline, leaded 
aviation emissions, what I want to highlight there, that's a 
great question, and the FAA last year launched the Eagle 
Initiative, which is about eliminating leaded aviation gasoline 
emissions by 2030 and we launched it in partnership with the 
general aviation community, with the different associations, to 
make sure that we do so so that we can find and identify 
replacement fuels and the additional strategies that are needed 
to ensure that we do so safely and economically and absolutely 
take into account the factors that you mentioned, such as 
emergency vehicles and other things.
    So we are working very closely with the general aviation 
community to do that in an environmentally beneficial but also 
safe and economical way.
    Thank you.
    Senator Blackburn. Thanks. I appreciate that.
    Mr. Pearce, last year Oak Ridge National Lab worked with 
firefighters and the FAA to deploy drones to protect wildfires 
and they monitored the heat and transmission lines and 
transformers and in your testimony, you mentioned that NASA is 
also using this technology, including emerging air space 
management technology, to combat active wildfires and improve 
emergency response.
    So what I want to hear from you is how do we encourage 
innovators, first responders, researchers in this work and what 
tools are they needing to carry forward these innovations so 
that they have this to combat fires and utilize new 
technologies?
    Mr. Pearce. Thank you, Senator.
    One of the first things we are doing is through an 
interagency and intergovernmental process developing a common 
concept of operations for wildfire management and what that 
will allow everybody to do is to work to a common vision for 
the future. We can develop a common roadmap.
    That way, innovators have a path to implementation for the 
innovations they are developing in this space. So that's sort 
of the first, I think, very important step to improving----
    Senator Blackburn. OK. Then let me ask you this. If you've 
got NASA, DOE, other agencies that are working on this, what 
applications, other than law enforcement and wildfire 
maintenance, transmission line monitoring, are you considering 
using these technologies for?
    Mr. Pearce. Well, any variety of emergency response 
operations----
    Senator Blackburn. OK.
    Mr. Pearce.--in the aftermath of storms, those kinds of 
things.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. That sounds good. I know my time is 
up against the clock.
    Mr. Scribner, I'm going to come to you with a question. A 
written response is fine on the ADS-B, looking at that and the 
benefits for pilots, but I will submit that as the QFR for you.
    Thank you, Madam Chairman.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    Senator Lujan.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Chair. I appreciate this hearing 
and everyone that's here for this important panel, as well.
    Mr. Welsh, thank you for joining us today to discuss the 
work of the Federal Aviation Administration, as well, in the 
area of fuels.
    Now expansion of domestic production of sustainable 
aviation fuels, a hundred percent of domestic demand will 
require closed coordination between government agencies and 
should include relevant stakeholders, including our public 
research institutions.
    New Mexico's home to several institutions, including two 
Department of Energy National Laboratories and two research 
universities, New Mexico State University and the University of 
New Mexico, that are conducting research into this crucial 
effort.
    Mr. Welsh, can you confirm that the FAA is coordinating 
with the Department of Energy on the development of sustainable 
aviation fuels?
    Mr. Welsh. Yes, thank you, Senator Lujan.
    We absolutely are and on a daily basis I can attest but in 
a formal way the Department of Transportation, Department of 
Energy, and U.S. Department of Agriculture have entered into a 
memorandum of understanding to work together on this under the 
sustainable aviation fuel grant challenge. So we have formally 
put in place a coordination mechanism and that has resulted in 
active work between our agencies, between the FAA, DOT, DOE on 
a daily basis.
    Thank you.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that.
    Mr. Welsh, can you confirm whether the FAA is collaborating 
directly with the National Laboratories?
    Mr. Welsh. Yes, we're also working with the National 
Laboratories, as well.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that.
    And, Mr. Welsh, is there more this committee can do to 
facilitate collaboration between the FAA, the Department of 
Energy, particularly our National Laboratories?
    Mr. Welsh. Yes, Senator, there's certainly--while I don't 
have a particular suggestion or recommendation, there certainly 
are ways that we could improve the coordination and 
collaboration over the long term.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that.
    Madam Chair, I'm not going to use all my time today, but 
what I do want to say is the importance of Federal partnerships 
and investments. Most technology that we now benefit from, all 
the way from GPS to other areas, were developed by Federal 
agencies through the use of an investment and then private 
entities were able to do much more with commercializing or 
finding those partnerships.
    I'm very interested in more foundations to bring together 
public/private partnerships, things of that nature, but I 
certainly hope that no one is discounting the importance of 
investment, whether it's the Department of Defense, the 
Department of Energy, and many other Federal agencies who are 
charged with innovation practices, as well, and that we can 
learn from those and then we can partner more and more, as 
well, with private collaboration, but I was just, I guess, 
disappointed when I heard testimony suggesting that some of 
these Federal investments, that they were not worth anything. I 
completely disagree and I'd invite anyone who wants to to come 
out to New Mexico and visit the National Laboratories, expose 
you to some of the technology and maybe it will change your 
mind. So I'm hoping that we'll be able to do that together.
    Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you.
    Senator Vance.

                STATEMENT OF HON. J. D. VANCE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Vance. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I want to start 
by acknowledging Mr. Hegeman from GE Aviation. Of course, he 
always does a lot of good in the state of Ohio, we appreciate 
it, employing over 8,500 people and investing more than $35 
million in aviation technologies. So thank you for being here.
    Where I want to focus my questioning today is on the 
question of sustainable aviation fuel and subsidies for it. So, 
Mr. Welsh, I'm going to direct my questions to you, and I guess 
the first thing that I'd ask just to, sort of, establish the 
baseline here, do you believe that it should be the policy of 
our government to--that we should be encouraging commercial 
airlines to pay climate reparations for some of their conduct 
and some of their business activities?
    Mr. Welsh. Thank you, Senator.
    Well, I would be speaking in a personal capacity here and 
not on behalf of the FAA, but I would say no, I don't believe 
so.
    Senator Vance. Thank you.
    So my understanding is that climate reparations sometimes 
called emissions offsets are where effectively the airlines pay 
money to a broker and that broker then pays money theoretically 
to, you know, some sort of reforestation project that 
theoretically reduces the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
    My understanding is that you've been pretty supportive of 
emission offsets in the past, is that right?
    Mr. Welsh. Well, emissions offsets are one tool, but I 
would disagree that they are climate reparations and I would 
even take a step further back and when we look at reducing 
emissions, you know, the focus is on where are you removing 
emissions from the atmosphere and so how you do that in a 
rigorous way is the focus that I would place on that.
    Senator Vance. Whatever you want to call it, I mean, we're 
talking about basically penalizing commercial airlines for 
having certain business practices in the past. I think it's not 
an especially good use of resources, especially given what 
we've learned about the ways in which these alleged carbon 
offsets or climate offsets very often don't lead to the carbon 
offsets they're meant to provide. So just a point of issue 
there.
    One more direct question. Are you supportive of requiring 
the United States to submit to ICAO's recommendations, ICAO's 
recommendations on emissions, including transitioning our 
entire commercial fleet to run on sustainable aviation fuel?
    Mr. Welsh. So this Administration has put forward the U.S. 
Aviation Climate Action Plan which sets out a U.S. goal of 
transitioning to net zero emissions for aviation by 2050.
    Senator Vance. Sure.
    Mr. Welsh. That includes supporting work at ICAO and in 
fact in the last Administration, we began implementing the 
ICAO's carbon offsetting measure in March 2019. This 
Administration intends to continue to implement that.
    Senator Vance. So, Mr. Welsh, I guess one concern I have 
with this is when you're talking about carbon emissions and the 
effect on the environment, an emission in China or anywhere 
else is the same as an emission in the United States of 
America. It has the same effect according to the concern that 
you're raising.
    Why are we doing so much to follow ICAO's recommendations 
when the Chinese themselves are not doing very much and if you 
think about the fact that China is the dirtiest economy in the 
world, they emit about two times as much carbon as we do, why 
are we effectively penalizing the American aviation industry 
while we don't require or even attempt to force the Chinese to 
do the same to their aviation industry?
    Mr. Welsh. So thank you, and I think this is really an 
important point and question.
    So the work that we've done at the International Civil 
Aviation Organization, which includes China as a member, it's 
fundamental that they actually do participate and that the 
playing field is level and to date, China has, despite raising 
concerns, they have been participating in the program at ICAO, 
but that is something that we're monitoring and following 
closely and will address if we see that they are not complying 
because we would not want to hold U.S. airlines to a different 
standard than Chinese airlines.
    Senator Vance. So you're saying the Chinese have followed 
the ICAO guidelines?
    Mr. Welsh. Yes, to date they have.
    Senator Vance. OK. We'll probably follow up on that because 
I'd like to understand that a little bit better. That's not my 
understanding but happy to have you prove me wrong there.
    You know, my final point here, I guess, my fear here with 
all things China and the United States when it comes to these 
international programs is that we often make these commitments 
and we follow through on these commitments. I don't know if 
we're trying to be good global citizens or we're just trying to 
honor our word, but very often these voluntary commitments are 
not followed by the Communist Chinese, and in particular a very 
real worry I have is, you know, we all believe in technology 
and we all believe in the importance of moving American 
industry into the technological future, but if we allow the 
Chinese to operate their industrial economy more cheaply than 
in the United States, we're offshoring the very basis of 
technological innovation.
    You can't have technological innovation if you're 
offshoring so much of your industry to China. If we're making 
American industry more expensive and we're making Chinese 
industry cheaper, then that strikes me as a really bad deal for 
American consumers, a really bad deal for American 
technologists, and ultimately a really bad deal for national 
security.
    So we'll follow up on that point but appreciate your 
answers to the questions, Mr. Welsh.
    Senator Duckworth. Senator Warnock.

              STATEMENT OF HON. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA

    Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Madam Chair.
    In September 2021, the White House launched the Sustainable 
Aviation Fuel Grant Challenge to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions from the aviation sector and the goal of this grant 
challenge is to supply three billion gallons of sustainable 
aviation fuel per year by 2030 and 100 percent of expected 
domestic commercial jet fuel by 2050. That's the goal.
    But on Monday, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, 
released a report showing that in 2022 sustainable aviation 
fuel accounted for less than 0.1 percent of the total jet fuel 
used by major U.S. airlines. So we don't seem to be rushing 
headlong in this direction, issues around China and others not 
withstanding.
    Mr. Welsh, based on this report, is the Biden 
Administration currently on track to meet the sustainable 
aviation fuel targets it set 2 years ago?
    Mr. Welsh. Thank you, Senator.
    I think you point out very clearly that we have our work 
cut out for us. What I would say about the GAO report, which 
provides a really good overview both of the current levels of 
production and challenges and them scaling-up, the level of 
procurement in 2022 was around 16 million gallons, up from 
around five million gallons in 2021.
    So the absolute number's very small, but if we see the 
tripling in production, so if we see that trend going forward, 
we actually--we will get to the three billion gallon goal.
    Now we really do have our work. There are significant 
barriers and really the next step in terms of implementing the 
Inflation Reduction Act provisions will be a key influencer in 
kind of where we move from here.
    Thank you.
    Senator Warnock. So we are seeing some improvement, but the 
goal was to get to one billion gallons of sustainable aviation 
fuel by 2018, 5 years later we're not there, correct? So we 
have some way to go?
    Mr. Welsh. That's right.
    Senator Warnock. So the Department of Transportation--the 
GAO recommended that the Department of Transportation 
coordinate with the Department of Energy and the USDA to 
develop performance measures that enable the agencies to better 
evaluate the effects of their actions and policies on 
sustainable aviation fuel production.
    How does the department plan to respond to this 
recommendation?
    Mr. Welsh. So thank you, Senator.
    We concur with that recommendation and fully agree on the 
establishment of performance measures to track the progress in 
that work.
    Having just received the final report, we're currently 
reviewing and we will work with our partners to implement those 
specific recommendations.
    Senator Warnock. Well, thank you so much. I think it's 
important that we continue to move in the direction of the 
sustainable aviation fuel production. It reduces harmful air 
pollution and at the same time moving the aviation industry 
toward a more environmental-friendly future while at the same 
time spurring clean energy job growth and innovation all across 
our country.
    But this is only possible if the government fully commits 
to the goal that it set for itself. So I look forward to 
continuing that conversation and holding all of us accountable 
and keeping all of us honest and pushing our skies to a clearer 
and cleaner future.
    Thank you so very much.
    Senator Duckworth. Senator Schmitt.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC SCHMITT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI

    Senator Schmitt. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Mr. Welsh, I want to follow up on some of the questions 
that Senator Vance asked, as well, in that line of questioning.
    I'd like to hear in your words a brief summation because I 
have limited time why do you believe it's important for us to 
have a goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050?
    Mr. Welsh. Thank you.
    So as I mentioned, that's an Administration----
    Senator Schmitt. No. I'm asking you because you're the 
Executive Director. Do you agree with that?
    Mr. Welsh. Well, in my professional capacity, my 
responsibility is to implement that type of policy goal that's 
made at the level of the White House.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. If you were to articulate the position 
then that evidently may or may not be yours, what is the stated 
reason for this?
    Mr. Welsh. Well, there's several reasons, but, first and 
foremost, the nature of the challenge and the impacts of 
climate change demand the types of----
    Senator Schmitt. OK. So China last year alone permitted two 
coal fire plants a week. Do you honestly believe that tying the 
arm behind the aviation industry here in the United States is 
going to make one iota of difference if China and India are not 
onboard?
    Mr. Welsh. So, first, it was actually the U.S. airlines 
that took this goal before----
    Senator Schmitt. No, I know, but I'm talking about the 
stated position now of this Administration.
    Mr. Welsh. Right. But the U.S. airlines collectively set a 
net zero 2050 goal before the Administration did. So actually--
--
    Senator Schmitt. Oh, so OK. So the Administration is just 
following the lead of the airline industry. They don't really 
care about it. Is that your position? Because Joe Biden said 
last week that we have a climate time bomb.
    Do you believe that we're in imminent risk of peril from 
the climate right now? There's a climate time bomb?
    Mr. Welsh. I'm not familiar with those specific comments. 
As I said, the urgency and the nature of climate change due to 
man and the types of reductions that have been proposed.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. In May 20th of last year, there was an 
advisory committee on transportation equity. A press release 
went out that the ACTE will consist of equity practitioners. I 
don't know what an equity practitioner is, but an equity 
practitioner advising the department on its strategies, 
centering around four equity objectives. I can mention them.
    Have you been advised in your capacity of what those 
recommendations are from the advisory committee on 
transportation equity?
    Mr. Welsh. No, sir, I'm not familiar with that commission. 
Thank you.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. The DOT has 1,700 new employees for 
the new infrastructure law. How many of those that you oversee 
are dedicated to DEI initiatives?
    Mr. Welsh. Sir, I'm not familiar with--I don't have an 
answer to your question. That's something I have to follow up 
on.
    Senator Schmitt. I'd love to get an answer to that, and 
then in the Strategic Plan, the DEIA Strategic Plan by the 
Department of Transportation is to--on Page 18, to develop and 
implement a training curriculum for more inclusive and 
equitable hiring practices.
    Can you explain to me what equitable hiring practices would 
consist of?
    Mr. Welsh. So again, Senator, I think, you know, the 
specifics of that are beyond my area of expertise, but I think 
it is important to reflect the priority of the Department of 
Transportation on DEI.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. So in your capacity as Executive 
Director, what trainings have you implemented as relates to 
DEIA initiatives?
    Mr. Welsh. Well, there are various trainings that we've had 
an opportunity to participate in and employees can take at the 
FAA. I don't have a specific list to share with you now.
    Senator Schmitt. OK. Could you please follow up with any 
and all materials related to these training initiatives?
    Mr. Welsh. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Schmitt. I think one of my concerns here is that 
the stated mission of the FAA is--this is the stated mission. 
``Our continuing mission is to provide the safest, most 
efficient aerospace system in the world,'' and what I continue 
to hear from you and from others who come before this committee 
that that's actually not the priority at all.
    The priority is this climate agenda. The priority are these 
DEIA initiatives and when people are flying 30,000 feet above 
the earth, what they want to know is, is that they're going to 
get home safe to their family, that they can afford a plane 
ticket, and this Administration's radical agenda is simply out 
of step with the priorities of the American people.
    Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Senator Sullivan.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I just want 
to comment on Senator Schmitt's comment and Senator Vance.
    I do think, and I might be wrong on this, maybe, Mr. Welsh, 
maybe we can just have CRS do it, the Congressional Research 
Service, I don't think there's any statute in the United States 
Federal statutes that mandates that the U.S. Government 2050 
net zero. I'm pretty sure that's the case. I don't know.
    I don't think the Congress has ever said that that's our 
goal. Maybe I'm wrong. I know Joe Biden talks about it, but, 
you know, normally in a country with the Rule of Law it's got 
to be based on the statute. I'm pretty sure we don't have 
anything like that. I might be wrong, but I know I haven't seen 
one but maybe it would be good to look at it but it's a really 
good point. I appreciate my colleagues raising these issues.
    Mr. Welsh, I want to zero in on specific challenges that my 
state has, the great state of Alaska. Have you ever been to 
Alaska?
    Mr. Welsh. No, I have not, but I hope to soon.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. Well, you need to get up there. It's 
a big state, as you know, really big, bigger than every other 
state by far, but here's the thing about Alaska. 82 percent of 
the communities in my state are not accessible by road. That's 
251 communities are exclusively--you can only get to them by 
air or in the winter snow machine or in the summer on the river 
if they're on a river, and the threat of regulation of av gas 
causes great anxiety for airline, airplane operators in Alaska.
    We have more pilots per capita than any state in the 
country because our communities depend on pilots and piston-
driven aircraft that can operate on low lead fuel and right 
now, as you know, there are no substitutes available.
    So this creates supply chain risks for heating fuel, basic 
goods for communities, the ability to get in and out, and, of 
course, importantly to you, it creates safety risks.
    My understanding is that the FAA Office of Environment and 
Energy will play a key role in the regulation of leaded av gas, 
including the consultation with the EPA which is required by 
law, on development of any future regs on leaded fuel for 
piston-driven aircraft.
    Even though there's not a final rule, have conversations 
begun with the EPA on a potential reg?
    Mr. Welsh. Thank you, Senator, and though I have not been 
to Alaska, I am a general aviation pilot. So I'm very much 
aware the important role it plays.
    So regarding----
    Senator Sullivan. I got a bunch of questions. I'm not 
trying to be rude.
    Mr. Welsh. Yes.
    Senator Sullivan. So those conversations have begun?
    Mr. Welsh. Yes.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. So as you know, the Clean Air Act 
provides the EPA discretion over a period of time, looking at 
all kinds of things with the Department of Transportation and 
you guys in particular.
    What are you doing right now to prevent regs that would 
lead to an ill-timed lead phase-out prior to the availability 
and affordability of the oncoming unleaded av gas fuels? It's a 
huge issue. There's issues of infrastructure. If you come to 
some of the smaller villages in my state, everybody relies on 
leaded av gas and if it's phased out too early and there's no 
replacement fuel that's affordable or available in different 
locations, it'll be really challenging in Alaska.
    Would you agree that that is not just an economic issue but 
could create a hazardous issue as it relates to aviation 
safety?
    Mr. Welsh. Yes, absolutely, both safety, economic, but also 
environmental, as well.
    Senator Sullivan. Yes, no. It's everything.
    Mr. Welsh. Yes.
    Senator Sullivan. And we recognize it, but if you say, hey, 
get rid of leaded av gas and there's no cost effective 
replacement, as you just said, safety issues, environmental 
issues, economic issues, the health of some of these 
communities.
    Remember, you can't just get in the car in 251 communities 
and say, well, I'm not going to take an airplane, I'm just 
going to drive. You can't do it. So in my state, it's really 
important.
    Let me--so you would agree that that would create an 
aviation safety hazard, as well.
    Let me ask one final question. What measures can the FAA 
take, again considering all these costs--I'm glad you're 
looking at them--and issues that come in, environment, 
economic, safety. What measures can the FAA take to ensure 
existing low lead fuel remains available to the airports for 
piston-driven aircraft throughout the transition that we know 
like in Alaska is going to take years, many, many, many years? 
Are there measures the FAA can take in that regard? Are you 
thinking through those?
    Mr. Welsh. Yes. So it'll be difficult to be brief but I 
will try to.
    We are very focused on that and we're doing that through 
what we've called the Eagle Initiative where we're working with 
the general aviation community on exactly what not just the 
replacement fuels, the infrastructure needs, the transition. 
All of those pieces are critical and that's in part why we have 
2030 date because exactly the point you're raising. This is a 
transition that needs to be safe and orderly and address the 
types of considerations you're raising.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. Can I ask one final question, Madam 
Chair, and it's an important one for my constituents?
    You know, we have this thing and I think most states, I'm 
sure Illinois does, we always say one size doesn't fit all when 
it comes to Federal regulations, but in Alaska, that's really, 
really the case.
    So if there's a 2030 date, you know, for my state, it 
probably needs to be 2050, right, again given the unique and 
huge challenges. If you guys screw this up, you're going to 
shut down the whole state of Alaska and create safety hazards.
    So can you commit to me--I know you're working with the GA 
community which is great, but can you commit to me to give some 
special attention to the GA community in Alaska whose unique 
challenges on this very topic are very significant?
    Mr. Welsh. I think I can commit--in your words, I think the 
FAA can commit to give special attention to that. I don't know 
if it will result in special treatment, but I think that you're 
raising a very important point. So that's something we will 
take a hard look at.
    Senator Sullivan. OK. My office will continue to work with 
your office and the EPA and others. You know, the law is very 
clear. There are hazards to safety. The reg shouldn't be 
finalized and that's in the statute.
    So I appreciate you paying attention to that and we will 
continue to work with you on it.
    Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you and thank you to our witnesses 
for your participation today.
    The hearing record will remain open for four weeks, until 
April 26, 2023. Any Senators who would like to submit questions 
for the record should do so two weeks from now, by April 12, 
2023.
    We ask that all witness responses be returned to the 
Committee by April 26, 2023.
    And that concludes today's hearing.
    Thank you very much.
    [Whereupon, at 12 o'clock p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                              Kevin Welsh
Impact of Investments in Sustainable Aviation Programs
    The Biden Administration has centered its aviation emissions 
reduction goals on benefits associated with scaling up the production 
of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) but has also highlighted the future 
potential for electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft to ``unlock 
affordable and convenient local and regional travel''. We have seen how 
test flights occurring in the United States--in the State of 
Washington--are demonstrating the viability of zero emission aircraft 
technologies including electric and hydrogen-electric propulsion 
systems on a near-term basis. The FAA has a number of policies and 
programs to support the deployment and application of sustainable 
aviation technologies. This year, Congress has the opportunity to build 
upon these efforts and help local economies across the Nation realize 
benefits associated with sustainable aviation investments.

    Question 1. To reach the goal of net-zero aviation emissions by 
2050, how do you envision the ``division of labor'' between sustainable 
aviation fuel (SAF) use in currently operating commercial aircraft and 
incorporating zero-emission aircraft propulsion systems like electric 
and hydrogen in future aircraft? Would SAF fuel the existing fleet of 
large long-haul aircraft while hydrogen-powered aviation companies like 
ZeroAvia and Universal Hydrogen would support regional, short-haul 
aircraft?
    Answer. Our ASCENT research efforts demonstrate that SAF can help 
address the majority of civil aircraft emissions. Roughly 65 percent of 
jet fuel burn comes from long-haul aviation (greater than 1,000nm) 
using narrow-and wide-body aircraft produced and sold today and for 
decades to come. Therefore, the majority of aviation emissions 
reductions to meet 2050 goals will come from a drop-in solution for 
today's fleet. Hydrogen-powered aviation, assuming economy wide growth 
in hydrogen production, can serve short-haul, regional markets. 
However, to be environmentally beneficial, abundant renewable energy 
must exist to produce this hydrogen. For the greatest GHG reduction 
benefits, renewable energy resources must be prioritized to decarbonize 
the grid rather than to produce green hydrogen. Our research efforts 
also indicated that it is not only a question of whether the aircraft 
technology exists, but also whether the necessary infrastructure (at 
and beyond the airport level) exists to support a hydrogen aircraft 
market. Aviation stakeholders have indicated significant hurdles 
remain, including risk mitigation, space limitations, and market 
viability, before a significant hydrogen market in aviation can 
materialize.

    Question 2. We need to enable innovation to occur at all levels, 
not just with the major players. If funded at a significantly higher 
level, do you believe the FAST-TECH program can help smaller aerospace 
companies develop higher risk low-and zero-emission aviation 
technologies and accelerate the overall entry of these innovative 
technologies into the market?
    Answer. As we have seen in the CLEEN Program, government resources 
help mitigate technological risk and incentivize aviation manufacturers 
to invest in and develop cleaner, quieter technology that might 
otherwise not be pursued. FAST-Tech has similar goals of reducing risk 
through cost sharing such that low-emission aviation technologies can 
be introduced into the fleet sooner. FAST-Tech is open to smaller or 
larger aerospace companies, so long as the technologies that they are 
proposing support the overall GHG emissions reduction goals of the 
program.

    Question 3. How can FAA, NASA, and other Federal agencies (i.e., 
the Dept. of Energy) better partner with each other to increase Federal 
workforce recruitment and development of technical expertise in low-and 
zero-emission aviation technologies?
    Answer. University partnerships--such as the Aviation 
Sustainability Center (ASCENT) at FAA and the University Leadership 
Initiative at NASA--are an excellent tool for workforce recruitment and 
development. The ASCENT Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels 
and the Environment has supported the instruction of hundreds of 
professionals on the environmental challenges facing aviation, with 
over 674 students supported and counting. Intragovernmental 
partnerships like the SAF Grand Challenge and Sustainable Flight 
National Partnership are also essential to ensuring that agency 
resources are optimized and well-coordinated.

    Question 4. The Government Accountability Office has recommended 
that the Department of Transportation incorporate performance metrics 
into the Biden's Administration's SAF Grand Challenge that enable the 
agencies to measure the effect of policy choices on SAF production. Do 
you agree that adopting these performance metrics is important? If so, 
how would you recommend moving forward with this?
    Answer. We agree that tracking progress on SAF Grand Challenge 
goals is an important effort and can help us review and revise Federal 
programs, as needed. SAF Grand Challenge Action Area 6: Communicating 
Progress and Building Support includes key actions that address the GAO 
recommendation. One is to conduct benefits assessments and impact 
analysis of the SAF Grand Challenge to inform decisions, demonstrate 
benefits and mitigate negative impacts. Another action is to measure 
progress of the SAF Grand Challenge to provide updates, measure 
success, and show where progress needs to be made. As a co-lead of the 
SAF Grand Challenge, we will continue to develop this action area and 
refine performance metrics to include measures such as public tools 
that track various features of SAF production. This includes facility 
information such as production capacity, location, conversion process 
and feedstock; economic effects both in terms of job creation and 
economic value; environmental impacts including GHG reductions; and 
total SAF volumes including domestic production and uplift. These 
public tools will help communicate progress to the general public and 
engage stakeholders with valuable information to continue the rapid 
scale-up of SAF that is needed.

    Question 5. What steps is the FAA taking to work with international 
civil aviation authorities in countries with a bilateral aviation 
safety agreement to develop harmonized procedures for certifying, 
validating, and accepting innovative sustainable technologies like 
hydrogen-electric aircraft?
    Answer. FAA meets regularly with its international counterparts and 
bilateral partners, and the use of hydrogen as a primary energy source 
is one of the prominent topics. We continue to engage with numerous 
CAAs, including UK CAA, EASA, Japan Civil Air Bureau, and the Korea 
Office of Civil Aviation. Action taken include working with EASA 
through an eVTOL Taskforce and with the UKCAA on identifying the 
differences in the certification criteria and the means of compliance, 
making adjustments to harmonize where possible, and documenting the 
differences if harmonization. We are also working with other CAAs to 
collaborate on Advanced Air Mobility projects and share ideas, 
information, skills, and techniques.
Community Noise Impacts
    In 2021, the FAA released the results of the Neighborhood 
Environmental Survey, which produced an updated dose-response curve 
with respect to the percentage of people annoyed across a range of 
aircraft noise exposure levels. The results of this study indicated a 
significant difference compared to previous dose-response curves used 
in the United States to inform aircraft noise policy.

Question 1. Given these new dose-response curves and the implications 
        for airport-adjacent communities and those living along a 
        flight path, what course of action has the FAA taken or plan to 
        take in response to this study?
    Answer. In light of the results of the Neighborhood Environmental 
Survey, other research and public input, the FAA is undertaking a 
review of our noise policy. More information can be found on our Noise 
Policy Review webpage: www.Faa.gov/noisepolicyreview.

    Question 2. Does the FAA plan to update current aviation noise 
policies and regulations? Has the FAA reviewed the decision to utilize 
65 dBA as the threshold for significant noise exposure?
    Answer. The FAA has initiated our noise policy review with the 
intent to update our noise policy, as appropriate based on the results 
of the review. The Noise Policy Review will include both the metrics 
and the levels of those metrics that are used for defining our noise 
thresholds (including the DNL 65 dBA significance threshold for NEPA). 
The FAA has not yet made any decisions on what changes will be made.

    Question 3. What framework is the FAA using to integrate the noise 
impacts caused by new entrants, such as AAM or UAS technologies, into 
community noise exposure maps? How does the FAA plan to mitigate these 
noise impacts for affected communities?
    Answer. The FAA agrees that integrating noise impacts caused by new 
entrants, such as AAM or UAS technology, into noise exposure maps is 
critical to accurately convey a complete aviation noise impact picture 
to the public. The FAA is working on developing guidance for including 
the effects of small commercial UAS operations on areas near airports.

   Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to 
                              Kevin Welsh
Topic: Crashworthy Wheelchairs and In-Cabin Wheelchair Restraints
    Electric aircraft with vertical take-off and landing capabilities 
or ``eVTOLs'' are a paradigm shift in aircraft and cabin design. 
Unfortunately, there's no standard for crashworthy wheelchairs and in-
cabin wheelchair restraints.

    Question. Would you agree that it would be easier for manufacturers 
to design for accessibility if FAA had a standard for crashworthy 
wheelchairs and in-cabin wheelchair restraints--and if, so, when can we 
expect FAA to provide this standard?
    Answer. The FAA is currently working with other Federal agencies to 
evaluate existing crashworthy wheelchair standards for adaptation to 
use on aircraft. In the interim, the FAA has standards for safely 
incorporating seating, cabin interiors, and other items into the cabin 
of aircraft. Manufacturers can currently use these standards to propose 
new designs to accommodate wheelchairs and wheel chair restraints.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Jacky Rosen to 
                              Kevin Welsh
    Several next-generation technologies have been deployed in Nevada 
at airports in Reno, Henderson, and Las Vegas--critically important as 
passenger numbers have increased over the past two years. In 2022 
alone, Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas saw over 52 
million passengers, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers. We are expecting 
to see an even greater number of visitors over the next year, with Las 
Vegas hosting events like the Formula 1 Grand Prix in November and the 
Super Bowl in 2024. As the Chair of the Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, 
and Export Promotion, I'm thrilled to see people traveling again and 
want to make sure that airports are ready to support this influx in a 
way that makes the traveler experience smooth and hassle-free.

    Question 1. How will next-generation technologies, like 
performance-based navigation and time based flow management--both of 
which are being deployed at Nevada airports--will help improve the 
passenger experience by reducing wait times on the tarmac and in the 
air and better prepare airports to handle a record breaking number of 
visitors? And, given your office's focus on environmental protection, 
can you also talk about the emissions impacts of more on-time and 
efficient air travel using these technologies?
    Answer. It will be a challenge to maintain and improve upon current 
efficiency levels as demand for airspace increases and modernization 
efforts focus on safely accommodating that demand. Airspace 
modernization efforts like performance-based navigation and time-based 
flow management are necessary for accommodating anticipated growth in 
demand for aviation, which could result in increased congestion and 
excess fuel burn per flight if these capabilities are not developed and 
implemented. These tools can also provide efficiency benefits by 
allowing flights to absorb delays caused by merging and sequencing in a 
more fuel-efficient manner over the full trajectory. For example, 
delays absorbed via low-altitude vectoring in the current system could 
be shifted upstream, and absorbed via more efficient means such as 
speed-control, vectors at higher altitudes, or ground delays at the 
origin airport, where the aircraft can stay on the ground with no, or 
markedly lower, fuel burn.

    Question 2. Is FAA experiencing any challenges deploying next-gen 
technologies in smaller or more rural airports, which are also now 
seeing more passengers? And is there anything Congress can do to 
support broader adoption of these technologies?
    Answer. FAA continuously monitors current and projected volume and 
complexity of airport operations across the National Airspace System to 
ensure we are prioritizing the deployment of technologies/capabilities 
based on the greatest need. The President's budget request for Fiscal 
Year 2024 will support the continued operationalizing of NextGen, which 
aims to improve the safety, efficiency, capacity, and environmental 
impact of the Nation's air transportation system through the use of 
advanced technology, procedures and infrastructure. We look forward to 
working with congress in support of that continued effort.

    Question 3. As the entertainment capital of the world, Las Vegas 
often sees an influx of private planes landing at our airport ahead of 
marquee events. What steps is FAA taking to encourage greater adoption 
of technologies by private flights, business aviation, and general 
aviation that will reduce emissions, cut down on fuel use, and reduce 
the number of people on the ground exposed to aircraft noise?
    Answer. We develop, coordinate, and implement aircraft noise and 
emission standards, advance operational solutions, and engage with 
communities and industry stakeholders. These actions apply to scheduled 
aircraft as well as business aviation. For example, under the 
Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) Program, the FAA 
is working with Honeywell Aerospace and Rolls-Royce North America to 
accelerate the development of cleaner and quieter engine technologies 
for the business jet market. Operationally, the FAA has implemented 
Optimized Profile Descents (``OPDs'') at 64 airports, including Las 
Vegas. These OPDs can enable aircraft to descend on a smooth, 
continuous path with the engines at low power, which reduces noise from 
the engines.

    Question 4. What work needs to be done to maintain U.S. global 
leadership in international standard-setting bodies so that passengers 
traveling anywhere in the world can experience the same next-gen 
technologies we are adopting in the U.S., and so that our efforts to 
invest in more sustainable aviation are not a one-sided endeavor?
    Answer. The FAA plays a leadership role in the international 
standard-setting process, such as through the International Civil 
Aviation Organization Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection, 
where we work to set international environmental standards ensuring 
that the more efficient and quieter technologies are adopted across 
international aviation and not just in the United States.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to 
                              Kevin Welsh
    As you know, the FAA has been working for years on a certification 
process for UAS or drones, using the type certification process that 
has traditionally been used for passenger aircraft. As part of that 
effort, your office has been leading the environmental review component 
of UAS certification.
    My understanding is that a handful of UAS companies have been 
working toward getting the environmental review component of 
certification squared away, but that the process has languished. For 
example, I've heard of some submissions being signed off on by the FAA 
program office well over a year ago but have yet to even be published 
in the Federal Register to begin the public comment process.
    This is a technology that can actually bring numerous environmental 
benefits in accomplishing tasks from infrastructure inspection to 
package delivery. In a lot of instances, the environmental benefits are 
clear and commonsense.

    Question 1. First of all, can you commit that the FAA will see 
these type certification applications through to timely completion? 
Particularly for UAS that have been in the pipeline now for years?
    Answer. The FAA is committed to enabling UAS operations in the NAS. 
We are continuing to work with several companies on their type 
certification projects, many of which are nearing completion. Going 
forward, the FAA will continue to apply lessons learned to ensure that 
UAS manufacturers have clearer expectations about the risk level and 
the appropriate level of rigor and oversight.

    Question 2. Can you explain the nature of the delays, and report on 
any progress on the environmental submissions? Especially for UAS that 
are already well into the pipeline? In the interest of transparency, 
can you commit to having these documents published in the Federal 
Register soon so that the general public can participate in the 
process?
    Answer. The FAA has been working to balance the needs of the UAS 
manufacturers with the need for transparency and the FAA's mandate to 
set noise requirements. Because UAS do not directly fit into the FAA's 
current noise certification regulatory structure, the FAA uses rules of 
particular applicability (RPAs) for individual aircraft to set 
requirements for how that aircraft can show compliance for noise 
certification. The FAA has published one noise certification RPA for 
the Matternet M2. This RPA was based on existing noise certification 
methods, but the FAA has modified them--in consultation with the UAS 
manufacturer--to apply to this model of UAS. In the interest of 
transparency, FAA is committed to making all RPAs publicly available. 
The FAA is also working to streamline its internal processes to make 
the noise certification process more efficient.

     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young to 
                              Kevin Welsh
    As you know, the FAA has been working for years on a certification 
process for UAS or drones, using the type certification process that 
has traditionally been used for passenger aircraft. As part of that 
effort, your office has been leading the environmental review component 
of UAS certification.
    My understanding is that a handful of UAS companies have been 
working toward getting the environmental review component of 
certification squared away, but that the process has languished. For 
example, I've heard of some submissions being signed off on by the FAA 
program office well over a year ago but have yet to even be published 
in the Federal Register to begin the public comment process.
    This is a technology that can actually bring numerous environmental 
benefits in accomplishing tasks from infrastructure inspection to 
package delivery. In a lot of instances, the environmental benefits are 
clear and commonsense.

    Question 1. First of all, can you commit that the FAA will see 
these type certification applications through to timely completion? 
Particularly for UAS that have been in the pipeline now for years?
    Answer. The FAA is committed to enabling UAS operations in the NAS. 
We are continuing to work with several companies on their type 
certification projects, many of which are nearing completion. Going 
forward, the FAA will continue to apply lessons learned to ensure that 
UAS manufacturers have clearer expectations about the risk level and 
the appropriate level of rigor and oversight.

    Question 2. Can you explain the nature of the delays, and report on 
any progress on the environmental submissions? Especially for UAS that 
are already well into the pipeline? In the interest of transparency, 
can you commit to having these documents published in the Federal

Improving NASA-FAA Collaboration and Technical Capacity
    The Biden Administration's proposed FAA budget for Fiscal Year 2024 
includes nearly $110 million for research programs on aviation 
environmental concerns, $73 million of which will be directed towards 
accelerated research in the areas of sustainable aviation fuel and 
aircraft technologies. It's clear that the FAA needs assistance with 
developing its technical capacity to evaluate, certify, and create 
safety standards for the deployment of innovative and low-emission 
technologies. Part of growing FAA's technical capacity should include 
building on existing research and development partnerships and 
increasing collaboration between the FAA and NASA to share aerospace 
technology data and expertise.
    In fact, under Section 108 of Aircraft Certification, Safety, and 
Accountability Act (ACSAA), we required the convening of integrated 
project teams--made up of technical experts from the FAA and Federal 
agencies such as NASA and the Air Force--for particularly challenging 
aircraft certification projects.

    Question 1. We have heard instances of FAA consulting certain 
subject matter experts (SMEs) at NASA for certain topics--how can NASA 
and FAA increase their sharing of technical expertise in a more 
structured way to better inform FAA certification of innovative 
aircraft and new entrant technologies? Do you believe a pilot program 
between NASA and FAA where subject matter experts are detailed for 
certification projects would be helpful to enhance safety systems 
analysis and accelerate the certification of new aircraft technologies? 
This could build upon what we mandated with Integrated Project Teams 
under the safety reform law.
    Answer. We believe continuing our existing practices is the most 
appropriate way to leverage our capabilities and expertise effectively 
across the two agencies to address common interests while retaining 
focus on our respective missions and ensuring we are able to accomplish 
them within the resources provided. NASA supports continuing our 
excellent history of working with the FAA on the research and 
development of aircraft technology and operational procedures leading 
to certification and in-service safety and efficiency improvement 
across the fleet benefiting American industry, aviation service 
providers, and the public. Our current relationship continues to 
benefit from NASA subject matter experts (SMEs) with deep technical 
expertise aimed at pushing performance boundaries safely and the FAA 
SMEs bringing detailed technical expertise in safety standards and 
regulations to meet their ongoing mission to ensure a safe and 
efficient National Airspace System (NAS).
    In support of the FAA in recent years, NASA has provided subject 
matter expertise and informative research with data to assist the FAA 
with decision making and the implementation of advanced technologies to 
enable their mission. In addition, NASA and the FAA have engaged in 
regular collaboration through Research Transition Teams to ensure that 
research findings and other technical products continue to be relevant 
for transition to FAA operations, as well as partnering in the review 
and development of advanced technology in through the FAA's Continuous 
Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) Program.
    As certification is not part of NASA's mission and research focus, 
we rely on the FAA to advise on insights needed to enable them to 
certify new technologies, configurations, and operational procedures to 
ensure safe operations in the NAS.
    Today, NASA engages the FAA by providing insights into ongoing 
development of flight systems and technologies from our Sustainable 
Flight National Partnership (SFNP) demonstrations. This connectivity 
with the FAA for possible future certification needs provides early 
insight into advanced technologies and systems that may transition to 
future products. In so doing, NASA is enabling early consideration by 
the FAA of the path to certification of these advanced systems should 
they be brought by industry for certification in the future.
    We recommend continuing our existing collaborative approaches 
instead of initiating a pilot project.

    Question 2. NASA is investing $425 million over seven years for the 
Sustainable Flight Demonstrator (SFD) project. How will the SFD project 
help inform the possible certification of Transonic Truss-Braced Wing 
design? How would you describe the emissions reduction and market 
potential for TTBW design if it were to be applied to the next 
generation of commercial aircraft entering into service?
    Answer. The SFD will provide important data to inform possible 
certification of a future TTBW design through the design, build, and 
flight test of a full-scale, integrated technology demonstrator 
airplane. Aerodynamic performance, structural design and efficiency, 
and aeroelastic characteristics of the high-span TTBW and subsystem 
installation within its relatively thin wing are examples of key 
challenges that will be addressed and inform future product 
certification. Though the SFD itself does not require FAA 
certification, NASA has engaged the FAA Aviation Safety certification 
authorities who will actively follow the SFD project as observers and 
learn about this novel technology as the project progresses through 
flight test.
    The TTBW configuration architecture is projected to reduce fuel 
burn and emissions by 5-10 percent, dependent on overall airplane 
design trades and implementation. Combined with other advanced 
technologies, including larger diameter advanced propulsion systems 
that are enabled by the TTBW's high wing layout, NASA forecasts up to 
30 percent reduction in fuel use and emissions from a TTBW-based single 
aisle airplane design compared to today's best in class aircraft.
    Single-aisle class airplanes are forecast to be over 75 percent of 
the 40,000 new and replacement commercial aircraft deliveries over the 
next 20 years, and a TTBW-based airplane with up to 30 percent less 
emissions likely will elicit high demand.
Overland Supersonic Flight Standards
    NASA's Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator projects centers around the 
development and demonstration of aircraft that can conduct supersonic 
overland flights with reduced noise impacts. Currently, the FAA imposes 
a ban on overland supersonic flight for commercial aircraft.

    Question 3. How will flight testing the X-59 inform regulations 
applied to future supersonic commercial aircraft operations and inform 
relevant standards setting?
    Answer. Beginning in the 2026 time-frame the Quesst mission will 
conduct surveys of community response to the sounds of quiet supersonic 
flight created by the X-59 aircraft. Five surveys, approximately one 
every six months, are planned, each with a duration of roughly one 
month, and taking place in a different U.S. community.
    The process for selection of survey participants in each community 
is designed to gather the necessary scientific data across a diverse 
set of operating environments and representative communities across the 
U.S. population, given the constraints placed on community selection by 
the operational limitations of the X-59.
    When the surveys are complete, NASA will provide data correlating 
community response and sound level exposure to U.S. and international 
regulators. These groups will use this data as they consider 
establishing standards for acceptable sound levels from supersonic 
flight over land.

    Question 4. In addition to reducing noise impacts associated with 
supersonic flight, is NASA ARMD assessing the feasibility of operating 
supersonic aircraft using 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel? If 
not, how would you estimate the level of jet fuel usage and emissions 
of supersonic transport category commercial aircraft in comparison to 
subsonic transport category commercial aircraft?
    Answer. NASA's Commercial Supersonic Technology (CST) project 
conducts research targeted at improving efficiency and reducing the 
environmental impact of future supersonic aircraft. This research is 
conducted in concert with the larger NASA research efforts in 
sustainable aviation, such as investigating lightweight materials or 
improved engine technologies, that could provide efficiency benefits to 
future supersonic as well as subsonic aircraft.
    For supersonic commercial aircraft that fly at speeds up to about 
Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound and 2.3 times as fast as subsonic 
aircraft), achieving flight with 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF) does not face any unique challenges compared to doing so in 
subsonic aircraft. The main issue will be reaching the needed 
production of SAF for the entire aviation market.
    The CST project's research is focused on specific challenges for 
supersonic aircraft that are not being addressed in subsonic related 
sustainable fuels research. This includes understanding how different 
sustainable aviation fuel components can be blended to help reduce 
harmful emissions, such as soot and Oxides of Nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>), at the higher altitude where supersonic aircraft fly.
Design of PBN Procedures
    As part of the initiatives established under the NextGen program, 
the FAA has been developing and implementing performance-based 
navigation (PBN) procedures in order to allow aircraft to fly more 
precise flight paths, reducing fuel burn and emissions. However, there 
have been concerns about noise being concentrated over certain regions 
as a result of PBN.

    Question 5. How can PBN procedures account for noise impacts to 
communities? Can the design of PBN procedures include noise mitigation 
strategies without significantly affecting the efficiency of relevant 
departure and arrival procedures?
    Answer. Noise mitigation is highly dependent on atmospheric 
conditions such as winds, temperature, and pressure. The noise 
generated at altitude can travel and be felt on the ground at different 
places based on the direction and distance carried by the wind. In 
coordination with the FAA, NASA is planning future technology 
development for dynamic PBN which includes noise mitigation strategies 
while still providing efficiency of arrival and departure demands. 
Development of PBN procedures is the responsibility of the FAA and 
several additional factors are considered in that process.
    Therefore, NASA is considering research to assess whether solutions 
for dynamic routing could be provided to air traffic controllers as 
well as pilots to route the aircraft for both noise mitigation and 
efficiency, given appropriate atmospheric forecasting, air traffic 
demand/capacity forecasting technologies, as well as fully implemented 
dynamic trajectory-based operations. This would allow an aircraft to be 
routed to ensure that the noise signature is placed for minimal or 
distributed/diffused noise impact based on predicted travel of noise 
given current atmospheric conditions. The overall impact of such PBN 
procedures on the noise and emissions affecting communities are not yet 
well understood.

    New aviation technologies will need a workforce that is large 
enough and well-trained enough to meet these future needs. Current 
challenges with growing the pipeline of workers for existing 
technologies continue to disrupt the aviation industry.

    Question. What kind of training will our future aviation workforce 
need, and what type of investments should Congress be making to ensure 
that we have enough workers to harness the full benefits of these new 
technologies as they become available?
    Answer. NASA sees value in K-12 programs that teach and prepare 
students for emerging technological advances, specifically programs 
where students can gain firsthand experience and transferrable skills 
to benefit the U.S economy and aviation and aeronautics field.
    NASA works to support teachers and seeks continuous feedback on the 
necessity of investment in STEM education through the K-12 curriculum 
to ensure this level of preparedness can be prioritized and intertwined 
with the standard curriculum.
    Additionally, the University Innovation (UI) Project recently 
released a solicitation focusing on one of the prominent issues likely 
to be faced by future air transportation industry: Aviation 
Maintenance. It is important to identify the new and unique maintenance 
issues that will occur with these new forms of air transportation and 
also develop the workforce for it. Research proposals (under the UI 
Future Aviation Maintenance Technical Challenge) are sought to address 
key maintenance and training challenges facing the next generation of 
air transportation.
    Further congressional support related to NASA STEM investments and 
partnerships will also continue to help the Agency's advancements 
toward education and workforce development.

    Topic. Preparing a Next Generation Aviation Workforce
    The next generation of commercial aircraft is expected to look 
vastly different from what we experience today. Innovation, efficiency, 
and design will push air travel to become more reliable, efficient, 
forward-thinking, and sustainable. Air taxis, the return of supersonic 
flights, and low to zero emission travel are just some of the things we 
can look forward to. But to fully realize these future benefits, we 
need to invest in our workers today. That means developing a skilled 
tech workforce through apprenticeships, trade schools, community 
colleges, and traditional four-year colleges and universities. It also 
means providing opportunities for upskilling, retraining, and 
returnships for mid-career workers.

    Question 1. What policies and initiatives can Congress support to 
attract and expand opportunities in aviation and aeronautics technology 
to ensure that the United States remains a global leader in this field?
    Answer. Congress can ensure the United States remains a global 
leader in the field of aviation and aeronautics technology by 
continuing to support NASA's robust and diverse Research and 
Development (R&D) portfolio to advance U.S. technology, thereby 
supporting the U.S. industrial competitiveness and stimulating the 
opportunity for high-skilled, high wage jobs for the future workforce.
    Further congressional support related to NASA STEM investments and 
partnerships will also continue to help the Agency's advancements 
toward education and workforce development.
    NASA's ongoing commitment to provide students with real life 
experiences is often realized through many avenues including 
transformative research. Currently, NASA is investing in a new type of 
intern--Sustainability Ambassador interns--who will engage with our 
Sustainable Flight National Partnership's research demonstrations and 
communicate the work being done to dramatically reduce aircraft fuel 
consumption.
    The Advanced Air Vehicles Program (AAVP) recently announced funding 
opportunities to accredited U.S. institutions for research training 
grants to begin the academic year. The grants will support 
independently conceived research projects by highly qualified graduate 
students in disciplines needed to help advance NASA's mission, thus 
affording these students the opportunity to directly contribute to 
advancements in STEM-related areas of study.
    The AAVP Fellowship Opportunities are focused on innovation and the 
generation of measurable research results that contribute to NASA's 
current and future science and technology goals.

    Question 2. How can we ensure that the aviation workforce is 
diverse and that people from all backgrounds--including women and 
underrepresented minorities--have access to the education and training 
necessary to succeed in the new and emerging fields that will be needed 
for our next generation aviation ecosystem? And how has NASA's 
Aeronautics Mission Directorate attempted to address this challenge?
    Answer. NASA has established a goal to promote greater diversity in 
aeronautics through increased participation of Minority Serving 
Institutions (MSIs) in the University Leadership Initiative (ULI). ULI 
requires proposers to provide plans to include faculty and students 
from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other 
MSIs in ULI research. There is a specific evaluation criterion to give 
weight to the inclusion plans.
    NASA partners with the research community and a wide range of 
organizations (e.g., academic, commercial, and government laboratories) 
to accomplish its mission of exploration, discovery, and innovation. In 
accordance with NASA's 2022 Equity Action Plan, NASA is committed to 
increasing the capacity of HBCUs and MSIs to participate in Agency 
programs and initiatives, and to compete effectively for grants, 
contracts, and cooperative agreement opportunities.
    In addition, NASA's K-12 STEM programs work to broaden student 
participation through aeronautics-based STEM content that builds 
excitement, core content knowledge relative and necessary for success 
in aeronautics fields, and opportunities to support their transition 
into post-secondary education.
Topic. Enhancing Safety Through Technology
    Close calls between aircraft on runways at American airports have 
gotten significant attention lately, with seven instances happening 
this year alone. One of the most recent runway incursions happened 
right here at Washington, D.C.'s Reagan National Airport, where 
thankfully an air traffic controller was able to safely re-route the 
endangered aircraft to safety. We heavily rely on pilots and air 
traffic controllers to mitigate these risks, but investments in 
technology are necessary to help keep the flying public safe from 
preventable accidents. The advent of new and exciting technologies like 
air taxis deliver tremendous promise, but also raise an additional 
layer of aviation safety concerns.

    Question 3. How can we improve the technology utilized by air 
traffic controllers and others to reduce potential risk and manage 
congested airports and complicated airspace that will only get more 
complex with new entrants into our airspace?
    Answer. NASA is developing technologies for In-Time Aviation Safety 
Management System (IASMS) to move towards a future prognostic aviation 
safety management system. In the IASMS environment, precursors to 
safety incidents are proactively identified through automation and 
digital data mining to mitigate precursors to potential safety 
incidents based on data and data trends before they have a possibility 
to become incidents.
    In addition, in today's environment, automation is used to monitor 
for safety with limited automated alerting capability. Safety alerting 
and mitigation services and actions today are still provided by humans. 
However, with growth in diversity, density, complexity, and capacity of 
the envisioned future aviation operations, humans alone will not have 
sufficient bandwidth nor reaction time to be the sole providers of 
alerting and mitigation services. Therefore, IASMS is being developed 
for the future to assist humans to provide automated alerting and 
automated mitigation actions on top of todays automated monitoring.

    The implementation of NextGen will be crucial in the coming years. 
These investments, as well as employing concepts such as dynamic 
airspace management, will allow the United States to better utilize 
existing infrastructure, increasing the capacity and efficiency of the 
National Airspace System.
    Question. As this Committee continues to develop a Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill, do you believe there are 
opportunities for the FAA to incorporate adaptive or dynamic airspace 
management technologies into its NextGen initiative?
    Answer. The FAA's NextGen initiative is already in its 
implementation phase, and the corresponding research to deliver 
technologies was completed in FY 2020. Future adaptive and dynamic 
airspace management technologies are likely to rely on the data systems 
being deployed through NextGen, so it is critical that the FAA fully 
deploy NextGen systems to realize benefits and enable future 
capabilities.
    Currently, NASA research is ongoing regarding adaptive and dynamic 
airspace management technologies which could be integrated into the 
FAA's post NextGen initiative: Info-Centric National Airspace System 
(NAS).

U.S. Innovation in Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft
    Earlier in March, Universal Hydrogen conducted a successful test 
flight of the Dash-8 at the Moses Lake Flight Test Center in 
Washington. The hydrogen fuel cell-powered electric propulsion engines 
were produced by Everett-based magniX. The aircraft could potentially 
have a range of over 500 nautical miles.
    No wonder Washington has ranked number one nationally in aerospace 
sales, exports, profits, and employment for more than a decade.
    With the CHIPS and Science law, we have the opportunity to build 
upon innovation happening across the State of Washington and the 
Nation. Universal Hydrogen's test flight was a significant milestone 
toward FAA certification of hydrogen-electric aircraft. In order for 
Americans to be able to fly on hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft, 
the FAA will need to develop new airworthiness standards.

    Question 1. Most cities in Washington are within 500 miles of each 
other, and most have airports, but few have direct air service. What 
could hydrogen-powered aircraft mean for people who typically drive 
between destinations like these?
    Answer. Hydrogen-powered aviation offers the opportunity for 
communities to be connected entirely emissions-free using the safest 
mode of transportation, at the same cost per available seat mile as jet 
fuel. At a 500 nautical mile range, Universal Hydrogen's planes can 
cover the majority of regional flight routes, including those within 
Washington. Our hope is that as zero-emission hydrogen aviation becomes 
more prevalent, economies of scale and increased consumer interest will 
mean that we can work with our airline partners to create new routes 
and serve these new customers that would otherwise have to drive long 
distances from home to their destination and incur the comparatively 
greater safety risks of road transportation.

    Question 2. What steps can Congress take to improve the FAA 
certification process and enhance the agency's technical capacity to 
ensure innovative technology like hydrogen-powered aircraft become a 
safe and commercial reality?
    Answer. We have enjoyed a supportive, and also very critical and 
analytical, relationship with the FAA. We welcome it. The 
transformation to zero-emission aviation is too important for there to 
be any question as to the safety and validity of new aviation 
platforms. We invite the strongest and most comprehensive certification 
process possible. We hold ourselves to the highest standard, and invite 
the highest level of rigor and scrutiny from the FAA. One of the most 
important parts of aircraft innovation is preserving the trust of the 
American people, so the FAA needs all available resources to ensure 
that the door to certification is only open to those upholding superior 
safety standards. Congress should pair these resources with an 
obligation for the FAA to focus on zero-emission aviation.
    Additionally, Congress should ensure the FAA and other Federal 
agencies fully incorporate zero-emission aviation into their plans, 
programs, and grant opportunities. For example, the Airport Improvement 
Program (AIP), CLEEN Program, and FAST-TECH grant programs should all 
be expanded to include aircraft powered by hydrogen. Further, Congress 
should direct ASCENT to research hydrogen aircraft and should direct 
the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation to convene DOE, DOT, 
NASA, and industry to work together to prepare for future hydrogen, 
hybrid, and electric aviation platforms.

    Question 3. Do you agree that FAA can do more to work with 
international civil aviation authorities in countries with a bilateral 
aviation safety agreement to develop harmonized procedures for 
certifying, validating, and accepting innovative sustainable 
technologies like hydrogen-electric aircraft? If so, do you have 
specific recommendations?
    Answer. Yes, we would welcome FAA working with civil aviation 
authorities across the globe to harmonize processes and procedures. 
Companies in Europe and China are beginning to enter the zero emission 
aviation industry and we need consistent safety standards in place 
across the board.

    Question 4. Should we be leading more at the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO) on negotiating and setting aircraft carbon 
emissions standards to ensure they meet U.S. interests and innovation? 
Do you believe existing international carbon emissions standards hinder 
the ongoing development of low-and zero-emission technology in the U.S. 
aviation sector and our ability to compete in the global market?
    Answer. The United States is a leader in aviation generally and, 
right now, a leader in hydrogen aviation. We need to maintain this 
leadership and therefore the U.S. should absolutely be leading more at 
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on negotiating and 
setting aircraft carbon emissions standards to ensure they meet U.S. 
interests and innovation.

    Question 5. For hydrogen to be a viable alternative to jet fuel, it 
needs to be safe. Yet some have raised questions about the safety of 
hydrogen-powered flight. How does Universal Hydrogen address this 
concern in its aircraft design?
    Answer. Universal Hydrogen agrees that the number one priority for 
the aviation sector generally (and the zero-emission aviation sector 
specifically) is and must always be safety. We have engineered every 
aspect of our aviation platform with safety in mind and have taken many 
steps to ensure that passengers, crew, and the planes are always safe. 
Safety is our number one concern--our biggest request from Congress and 
the FAA is a robust, thorough, and well-staffed certification effort 
that ensures hydrogen aviation is 100 percent safe in this country.
    Additionally, in many respects, hydrogen is actually safer than jet 
fuel. For example, it vents rather than pools, so there's diminished 
danger of an explosion. Hydrogen is also non-toxic and unburdened by 
the typical risks of environmental contamination associated with other 
energy sources or fuel spills. And a hydrogen fuel cell has no internal 
moving parts, so it can be more reliable than a conventional engine.

    Question 6. SAF is an important tool to achieve 2050 net-zero 
emissions goals. But the potential for other technologies that cut 
emissions is large. How can we improve the FAA low-emission aviation 
technology program, known as the FAST-TECH program, to help companies 
like yours, and enable the U.S. to be a leader in hydrogen aviation 
technologies?
    Answer. Universal Hydrogen agrees that the FAA should broadly 
incorporate zero-emission aviation technologies into our 2050 net-zero 
emissions goal. This includes the FAST-TECH program, which should 
explicitly include hydrogen aviation as a focus area for funding. This 
will allow zero-emission aviation technologies like hydrogen to receive 
equal footing in accessing the crucial government resources needed to 
meet these decarbonization goals.

Developing Hydrogen-Electric Aircraft
    In January 2023, ZeroAvia conducted a test flight in the United 
Kingdom using a 19-seat Dornier 228 twin-engine aircraft marking the 
world's largest retrofitted commercial hydrogen-electric aircraft, at 
that time.
    ZeroAvia has also made a $5.5 million investment in Paine Field for 
a team of 20 design and software engineers. Snohomish County is already 
home to more than 500 aerospace companies.
    This Paine Field location will help the company scale the design, 
build, and certification of safe hydrogen-powered aircraft in a variety 
of commercial aviation markets. ZeroAvia already has secured both FAA 
and UK Civil Aviation Authority experimental airworthiness certificates 
for its initial prototypes and is aiming for commercial production and 
delivery for sub-regional aircraft by 2025. In Washington and across 
the nation, there will also need to be the right infrastructure in 
place to scale up hydrogen powered flight.

    Question 1. We know that the European Union is dedicating billions 
to promote low-and zero-emission technologies. In the Inflation 
Reduction Act, I led the establishment of the $45 million FAA FAST-TECH 
program dedicated to kickstarting this effort here in the United 
States.a) From your perspective at ZeroAvia, do you agree that we need 
to expand Federal funding and programs like FAST-TECH? b) With respect 
to innovative and sustainable aviation technologies, how can this 
program help start-ups and smaller aerospace companies remain 
competitive and get support needed to address challenges associated 
with investing in high-risk technology development?
    Answer. a) ZeroAvia is certain that Federal funding and programs 
like FAST-Tech need to be expanded. FAST-Tech, in particular, is a one-
time program as funded in the Inflation Reduction Act and should be 
extended; a single fund of $46 million, which is not enough to advance 
the innovation needed to compete with China, the EU, and the UK. 
Further, the potential scope of innovative aviation technologies is 
quite broad. So, while the IRA allocated $245 million to Sustainable 
Aviation Fuels -a narrow-scope technology that has been funded 
significantly for a decade and is renewed annually- the IRA allocation 
for the entire remaining swath of low-emission aviation technologies 
needed to keep the U.S. industry competitive with the rest of the world 
was a one-time allocation at one-tenth of SAF. By comparison, in the 
UK, a nation whose economy is one-fifth the size of the U.S. economy, 
the Aerospace Technology Institute is funded with &pound;365 million 
annually.
    b) The FAST-Tech program as designed by the FAA targets 
technologies that are on the more advanced side of the TRL continuum. 
This is very generous and useful to startups and smaller aerospace 
companies that are ready to transition their technologies to market. 
And, this is very much in keeping with the near-term goals of the IRA 
to get innovative technologies that are ready into the marketplace 
where they can help advance our progress toward agreed-upon carbon-
emissions goals.
    However, programs like FAA's ASCENT and CLEEN, which target 
technologies that are earlier on the TRL continuum, have not embraced 
hydrogen aviation. ASCENT has been heavily focused on SAF and on 
technologies that nibble at emissions abatement by focusing on marginal 
efficiency improvements. While these are useful, they are not the far 
more significant step-changes that start-up and small aerospace 
innovators are working on and that our competitors abroad are 
advantaged enough to be working on in better public funding 
environments.
    NASA's Sustainable Aviation National Partnership is another program 
that targets early-stage technologies, but again this program has 
ignored hydrogen fuel-cell aviation. Similarly, the Administration has 
pursued a SAF Grand Challenge that largely ignores other technologies 
that can out-perform Sustainable Aviation Fuels in carbon, air quality, 
and noise. Although the Department of Energy's Hydrogen Fuel-cell 
Technology Office has benefited from existing hydrogen-related funding, 
its efforts have focused on pursuing hydrogen fuel cells as a means of 
decarbonizing heavy-duty vehicles and industrial applications.
    If Congress want U.S. start-ups and smaller aerospace companies to 
remain competitive and develop high-risk technologies with 
significantly useful environmental and economic projected outcomes, the 
simplest approach is to increase the specificity of funding language so 
that Federal agencies better understand the intent of Congress with 
regard to distribution of aviation RD&D spending. Obviously, ZeroAvia 
would prefer language that explicitly encourages hydrogen aviation, but 
even something that draws a line between SAF investment and all other 
low-emission aviation technology investment that is somewhat fairer 
than the IRA's 10:1 split would be beneficial.
    America's already mature fossil fuel companies will dominate the 
SAF market and are far better able to invest in advancing this 
technology than the smaller innovators are able to invest in 
alternative paths to emissions abatement. When potential investors see 
where the Federal government is investing, they are far more likely to 
put their capital in those same companies. So, in addition to being 
locked out of the competition for scarce Federal funds, smaller 
innovators are also victims of the signals Federal investment sends to 
the market for capital. The barrier to entry for smaller players is 
high; Congress can lower that barrier and not only achieve a more level 
playing field, but also facilitate better dividends for the U.S. 
taxpayer.

    Question 2. I'm glad to hear you are pursuing partnerships with 
FAA's ASCENT Center of Excellence as well as Washington State 
University's HYPER Lab. How can these partnerships inform the 
infrastructure and technologies needed to enable safe and stable 
hydrogen storage to support future hydrogen-powered flights?
    Answer. The benefits of working with expert researchers in academia 
are twofold. First, the ability to draw on the expertise, facilities, 
and graduate students available in U.S. research institutions is a 
tremendous value. Second, partnering with reputable research 
institutions confers credibility upon companies when interacting with 
Federal agencies, regulators, and potential investors. Specific to 
hydrogen aviation, ZeroAvia is working with research experts, like 
Washington State's HYPER lab, to better understand the safety, 
training, and technological requirements for safe, stable hydrogen 
storage and distribution. We are also working within a partnership 
between the FAA and NREL on similar research. Solving these problems 
will not only benefit ZeroAvia; it will also benefit the operators 
flying hydrogen-powered aircraft, the airports trying to support their 
airline customers, and passengers who will reap the benefits of better 
flight economics and a lower carbon footprint.

    Question 3. How could your hydrogen-electric powertrain help 
regional carriers like Horizon Air, which operates short-haul and 
regional flights across the Pacific Northwest?
    Answer. Our particular powertrains offer tremendous benefit to 
regional carriers. Because our technological pathway involves scaling 
up from smaller aircraft, smaller carriers flying shorter routes will 
be the first to benefit. The technology we are targeting for entry-
into-service in 2027 is designed specifically for regional carriers 
like Horizon. The ZA2000 powertrain will be useful in 40-80 seat 
regional turboprops aircraft like the ATR42 and 72 and the Dash8, all 
of which are workhorses for smaller, regional routes. The subsequent 
iteration of ZeroAvia's powertrain will be a version of the ZA2000 
amended for installation into regional jets like the CRJ700, which are 
the 100-passenger workhorses for carriers like Horizon. With lower 
operating costs and lower emissions, carriers will be able to expand 
service, and passengers will be able to travel knowing their emissions 
footprint is close to true zero.
    Major U.S. airlines have already recognized the value of our 
technology for their regional affiliates. For example, Alaska Airlines 
has invested in ZeroAvia, joined us as a partner in our next powertrain 
iteration by contributing the demonstration aircraft, and has signaled 
its intention to purchase powertrains to support routes flown by 
Horizon Air.

Developing the Next Generation Commercial Aircraft
    Part of the challenge of developing the next generation of 
commercial aircraft is building a product that cuts emissions and 
improves fuel efficiency by at least 20 percent and hopefully up to 30 
percent over the aircraft it replaces.
    Traditionally, advancements in propulsion systems are critical to 
achieving these types of ``leaps'' in efficiency. We saw that with GE's 
LEAP engine, the first engine to use additive manufacturing to ``grow'' 
complex, fully dense yet lighter engines.
    Absent a course correction, the aviation industry's share of human-
caused carbon dioxide output could surge from about 2.5 percent today 
to 18-20 percent in the coming decades. The global race is on to 
develop this next generation of aircraft technologies. We have to make 
smart, targeted investments in order to get this right.

    Question 1. GE Aerospace has been a longstanding participant in 
FAA's CLEEN program. Would tripling the funding that we are currently 
investing in Phase III of the program for the next phase help the U.S. 
better meet targets and timelines for introducing new technologies, 
such as innovative open-fan engine designs and other lower emission 
propulsion systems, into commercial service?
    Answer. Yes, increasing funds for FAA's CLEEN program creates a 
tremendous opportunity for the U.S. to continue its aviation leadership 
globally while facilitating new industries and supporting job growth to 
meet projected demand within the aviation industry. Additional funds 
will increase the number of projects FAA can partner with industry on 
and will absolutely help to accelerate innovation and development of 
new technologies, bringing them to the market more quickly than 
otherwise possible.

    Question 2. I'm glad to see you all are partnering with NASA on a 
hybrid-electric engine demonstrator. Given that there are many public-
private innovative projects in the works, what research and development 
gaps still need to be addressed to inform the holistic development of 
next generation commercial aircraft? Do you believe that adjustments to 
the research and development portfolio of the CLEEN program need to be 
made in order to address these gaps in the next phase of projects?
    Answer. GE Aerospace is already at work developing next-generation 
technologies for the future of flight, including advancements that have 
been supported through the longstanding collaboration with the FAA on 
the CLEEN program. To date, these partnerships on the propulsion 
systems have focused on core thermal efficiencies, combustion and 
emission technologies, and acoustic reduction technologies. Similarly, 
the collaboration between NASA and the industry has focused on a next 
generation aircraft. A large gap we see in public--industry 
partnerships is the integration of a next generation propulsion system 
with next generation aircraft. Going forward, more funding will be 
needed to accelerate development of innovations like open fan and 
hybrid electric systems for aircraft applications and to address the 
integration of these next generation propulsion systems with next 
generation aircraft for a total system that reaches 30 percent or more 
efficiency improvement compared to today. This can help ensure the 
competitiveness of the U.S. aviation industry.
    For example, the open fan engine architecture GE Aerospace is 
developing with partners will need to be tested with new aircraft 
configurations like those proposed as part of NASA's Sustainable Flight 
Demonstrator project. GE Aerospace is also developing a hybrid electric 
propulsion system with NASA for flight tests later this decade using an 
existing modified aircraft. Future opportunities to bring hybrid 
electric flight closer to reality would include testing hybrid electric 
jet engines on an innovate new aircraft designs.
    The future of commercial aviation requires new technologies as well 
as compatibility with alternative fuels. Significant effort is needed 
to continue to grow the production capacity of these sustainable 
alternative fuels to meet the airline industry demand.

    Question 3. Do you agree that FAA can do more to work with 
international civil aviation authorities in countries with a bilateral 
aviation safety agreement to develop harmonized procedures for 
certifying, validating, and accepting innovative sustainable 
technologies like hydrogen-electric aircraft? If so, do you have 
specific recommendations?
    Answer. It is important for the FAA to take all efforts to lead 
with international civil aviation authorities. Their direct engagement 
with international civil aviation authorities promotes and strengthens 
the principles of harmonization encouraged by bilateral agreements. In 
order to lead in those international collaborations, the FAA must not 
fall behind in their ability to develop, accept, and publish 
regulation, guidance and policy that support these innovative 
technologies coming to market.

Aviation Workforce Development
    Aviation manufacturers, mechanics, air traffic controllers are 
critical to ensuring that passengers can experience safe, reliable air 
travel. But currently, the industry does not have enough trained 
technicians and maintenance workers, which could lead to more flight 
cancellations and repair delays.

    Question. What are some of the types of jobs we still need to make 
sure the U.S. is a leading force in aviation innovation?
    Answer. GE Aerospace would not be a world-leading jet engine 
manufacturer without its workforce of 45,000 people around the world, 
including more than 24,000 team members in the U.S. As we seek to 
invent the future of flight and support our fleet of engines in 
operation today, talent development, retention, and recruitment are 
key. The aviation industry provides many career opportunities, ranging 
from aviation maintenance and assembly technicians, multiple 
disciplines of engineering, and other support functions typical for 
business, such as finance, legal, and information technology.
    Engineering jobs will be critical to make sure the U.S. is an 
innovation leader for the aviation industry for the early design, 
continued development, and maintenance of air vehicles. GE Aerospace 
alone hired more than 1,000 engineers in 2022 and is recruiting 
experienced engineers to work on technology programs shaping the future 
of flight.

    Topic. Preparing a Next Generation Aviation Workforce
    The next generation of commercial aircraft is expected to look 
vastly different from what we experience today. Innovation, efficiency, 
and design will push air travel to become more reliable, efficient, 
forward-thinking, and sustainable. Air taxis, the return of supersonic 
flights, and low to zero emission travel are just some of the things we 
can look forward to. But to fully realize these future benefits, we 
need to invest in our workers today. That means developing a skilled 
tech workforce through apprenticeships, trade schools, community 
colleges, and traditional four-year colleges and universities. It also 
means providing opportunities for upskilling, retraining, and 
returnships for mid-career workers.

    Question. What role is there for the private sector in partnership 
with government to invest in the workers that GE Aerospace and other 
businesses need to develop, produce, and operate the aviation 
technology of the future?
    Answer. Aviation is projected to be a growing industry, making 
efforts to raise awareness about aviation careers critical and 
requiring investment in training and education programs. Public-private 
sector collaboration that identifies career pathways supports this 
initiative. Two GE Aerospace programs, Next Engineers to inspire young 
people to choose engineering careers, and the Edison Engineering 
Development Program for entry-level young professionals, are examples 
of the company's commitment in this area at different stages in the 
talent pipeline.
    Industry groups are advocating for expanded workforce development 
programs for aviation manufacturing, creating a transition process for 
military members to join civil aviation, and creating a national center 
for the advancement of aviation. GE Aerospace supports proposals like 
these that promote aviation careers and provide resources to help 
develop a skilled U.S. aviation and aerospace workforce through 
scholarships, apprenticeships, aviation curriculum development, and 
other outreach efforts.

      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                             Ben Lieberman
    You testified about the shortcomings of the Federal government's 
subsidies to the cellulosic biofuel industries, including a $1.00 per 
gallon tax credit. Over a period of 15 years, policymakers invested at 
least $1 billion for these biofuel technologies, yet they have not 
become commercially viable and most of the facilities built to produce 
them have been idled or have been converted to other purposes.

    Question 1. Based on that experience, what indicators should 
lawmakers be looking for in a government program that subsidizes fuel 
technologies, like Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), to be able to tell 
if it is working as intended or not?
    Answer. This question gets to the heart of all that is wrong with 
Federal efforts to spur fuel innovation through subsidies and mandates. 
As we learned with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and its attempt to 
usher in cellulosic and other advanced biofuels, the Federal government 
is not good at deciding which emerging technologies to support, often 
backing the wrong racehorse while more promising alternatives are 
disadvantaged in the process. In the end, the subsidies did nothing to 
overcome the shortcomings with cellulosic biofuels and proved no more 
than a waste of taxpayer dollars.
    The real test whether sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is showing 
true promise rather than being a repeat of the cellulosic boondoggle is 
that a point will be reached where the technology no longer needs 
Federal support and can stand on its own. On the other hand, if 
proponents of SAF demand extensions of the tax credits as well as other 
subsidies--or worst of all, an RFS-style mandate that requires the 
airline industry to use specified amount--that will be a sure sign that 
the experiment in SAF was a failed one.
    Note also that continued dependence on subsidies would demonstrate 
SAF to be an environmental as well as economic failure. If a technology 
consumes more resources than it provides, it cannot realistically be 
considered environmentally beneficial. It is worth noting that, 
although cellulosic biofuels were initially supported by many 
environmental activist organizations (some of whom actually helped 
draft the generous provisions for them in the Energy Independence and 
Security Act of 2007), most green groups have since changed their minds 
and no longer support cellulosic biofuels. The same may happen for SAF.

    Question 2. Do you believe the United States will be able to 
achieve President Biden's goal of three billion gallons of SAF a year 
by 2030 without renewing the SAF tax credit implemented in the 
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which is set to expire in 2025?
    Answer. Progress thus far has been poor in getting SAF anywhere 
close to being economically competitive with petroleum-derived aviation 
fuels--which as it is are being artificially raised via current 
policies limiting leasing on Federal lands, new methane fees and other 
regulatory costs, and rejections of needed pipelines and other 
infrastructure. This is a sign that SAF will fall far short of the 3 
billion gallons per year target for 2030, absent an extension and 
possibly also an increase in the subsidies or imposition of a Federal 
mandate.

    Question 3. Will achieving that goal also likely require increasing 
the subsidies from the Treasury for each gallon of SAF?
    Answer. The history of Federal support for biofuels has been one of 
subsidies getting ratcheted up, not down, most recently with the 
existing incentives in the RFS getting a massive boost via additional 
subsidies for biofuels in the Inflation Reduction Act. The most likely 
future for SAF is that they will need a permanent and growing flow of 
Federal subsidies or else wither on the vine.

    Question. Mr. Lieberman, do you see advances in operational 
efficiency through technology modernization investments like NextGen as 
an expedient and cost-effective way to reduce aviation emissions, 
especially in comparison to some of the other proposed solutions?
    Answer. There is a great deal to be said for reducing the Federal 
interference that has thus far stifled innovation in air traffic 
control and other elements of air traffic infrastructure. In contrast, 
subsidies for SAF show few if any signs of progress and in fact are 
following the trajectory of the failed experiment in cellulosic 
biofuels.

    Transportation Secretary Buttigieg recently asked airlines to 
reduce their schedules in the New York region, as well as at Reagan 
National Airport, by 10 percent this summer due to air traffic 
controller staffing shortages.

    Question 1. Secretary Buttigieg blamed the recent COVID-19 pandemic 
for the staffing shortage. Do you agree with this assessment?
    Answer. Staff shortages at the Federal Aviation Administration's 
Air Traffic Organization were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
with some air traffic controllers retiring early and training of new 
controllers being limited by public health mitigation actions. However, 
the controller workforce had been declining in the decade prior to the 
pandemic. Labor representatives have repeatedly cited heavy workloads 
made worse by FAA's inability to procure modern productivity-enhancing 
technologies in a timely fashion as a primary culprit in the inability 
to both attract and retain talent.

    Question 2. In general, what is the impact on consumers when the 
number of flights is reduced in a congested market?
    Answer. In highly congested airspace such as in the New York City 
region that contains severely capacity-constrained airports already 
subject to strict slot controls, reducing the number of flights can be 
expected to limit consumer choice and raise airfare prices. Airlines 
upgauging to larger aircraft can mitigate some of the upward price 
pressure on airfares, but a reduction in the number of flights will 
inherently reduce consumer choice on flight day, time, and/or 
destination.

    Question. Mr. Scribner, what else do you believe FAA should be 
doing to more swiftly advance NextGen implementation?
    Answer. It is unlikely that FAA can more swiftly advance NextGen 
implementation under the status quo. The causes of deployment delays 
and cost-overruns of particular NextGen components are manifold, but 
all trace back to the FAA Air Traffic Organization's obsolete 
governance model. That combined air navigation service provider/
aviation safety regulator model has been discarded for good reason over 
the last three decades by nearly all industrialized, and increasingly 
developing, countries around the world. Countries that have adopted 
modern governance models have enjoyed a much more rapid uptake of new 
technologies and practices. There are several variants of this general 
approach, but all involve the separation of the provision of air 
navigation services from the aviation safety regulator. At the very 
least, the Air Traffic Organization should be organizationally 
separated from the FAA, perhaps as an independent Federal agency or 
government corporation, with steady revenue guaranteed by the self-
collection of cost-based fees assessed directly on airspace users by 
that separate air traffic organization.
