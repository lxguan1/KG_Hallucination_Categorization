                        THURSDAY, MARCH 30, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                                      Committee on Finance,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The hearing was convened, pursuant to notice, at 10:07

Cardin, Brown, Whitehouse, Cortez Masto, Warren, Crapo, 
Grassley, Cornyn, Thune, Cassidy, Lankford, Johnson, Tillis, 
and Blackburn.
    Also present: Democratic staff: Shawn Bishop, Chief Health 
Advisor; Tiffany Smith, Deputy Staff Director and Chief 
Counsel; and Polly Webster, Senior Health Counsel. Republican 
staff: Kellie McConnell, Health Policy Director; Gregg Richard, 
Staff Director; and Conor Sheehey, Senior Health Policy 
Advisor.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM 
             OREGON, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

    The Chairman. The Finance Committee will come to order.
    Colleagues, I am going to take just a minute to thank the 
members for what I believe has been a very productive work 
period. Our bipartisan efforts on organ transplants--thank you 
very much, Senator Grassley--have really paid off. We are going 
to have new contracting practices with much more accountability 
to protect the millions of Americans who depend on these organ 
transplants.
    Senator Cardin and Senator Daines yesterday focused on 
dental care. Senator Crapo and both sides are working to build 
on our mental health work. I thought we had a very good and 
bipartisan housing hearing that proceeded in the middle of the 
work period. In my State, eight different school districts are 
having to buy houses to rent to teachers because there is such 
a housing shortage.
    And finally yesterday, the investigation--a 2-year 
investigation by the Finance Committee--exposed massive Federal 
tax evasion by Credit Suisse, working with ultra-wealthy 
Americans, often dual citizens, who are hiding their taxes, 
concealing their tax obligations for years on end. So, 
colleagues, thanks, and it was a productive time.
    This morning, we are going to continue our longstanding 
efforts to lower the cost of health care for taxpayers and 
patients. Today, the committee focuses on pharmacy benefit 
managers, in particular the new strategies like charging 
administrative fees tied to the price of a drug that these 
multibillion-dollar corporations have aggressively adopted in 
the last 4 years, since we had previously looked at PBMs.
    Pharmacy benefit managers had a strong case for themselves 
back in the 1980s and 1990s. The original goal was to use their 
access to limited data to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf 
of their clients--insurance companies and employers.
    When prescription drug coverage came to Medicare, with Part 
D in the 2000s, PBMs shifted into overdrive to get to a larger 
market and more sophisticated drugs. In recent years, it has 
been increasingly apparent that PBMs are using their data, 
their market power, and their know-how to keep prices high and 
pad their profits instead of sharing the benefits of the prices 
they negotiate with consumers in the Medicare program.
    I believe this is an industry that is going in the wrong 
direction, and that is having a big impact on the prices that 
Americans pay at pharmacy counters from one end of the country 
to another. There are especially serious consequences for the 
Federal health programs that the Finance Committee oversees.
    Between Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and the individual health 
insurance market, the committee oversees health coverage for 
more than half of all Americans, or roughly 180 million people. 
Prescription spending for these Americans constitutes a 
significant portion of the amount the United States as a whole 
spends on pharmaceuticals each year. That totaled $577 billion 
in 2021.
    That is why it is so critical for the committee to examine 
what needs to be done to modernize the rules of the road for 
PBMs. Senator Crapo and I have talked about this at some 
length, particularly this concept of modernizing the rules, 
because what made sense really 34 years ago, does not look so 
sensible today.
    So we are taking off on this hearing--as with so many of 
the things that I just outlined over this work period--with 
strong bipartisan interest, and I thank Senator Crapo for that. 
So what we are going to do is look at pharmacy benefit managers 
with a thorough eye, and take any legislative steps necessary 
to ensure taxpayers and patients are not getting a raw deal. 
The Finance Committee has a long history of tackling these big-
league issues on a bipartisan basis, and the results speak for 
themselves.
    Finally, before I turn it over to Senator Crapo, I want to 
illustrate just one example of PBM practices that are resulting 
in high prices. In a competitive market, if two products have 
equal quality, a business should prefer the lower-cost option.
    However, oftentimes PBMs charge administrative fees to drug 
makers, which are calculated as a percentage of a drug's list 
price. That means PBMs get a higher payment if they favor 
higher-cost drugs. In my view, that is a clear example of these 
bizarre, these perverse incentives that PBMs have created that 
have left so many Americans fed up and outraged at the health-
care system.
    The consequences of this out-of-whack market are felt by 
taxpayers and families every time they show up at the 
prescription counter. Discounts negotiated by PBMs play an 
important role in driving down premiums for seniors. But the 
games PBMs play behind the scenes also appear to be driving up 
drug costs for many seniors, who are forced to pay top dollar 
for their prescriptions at the pharmacy counter, while PBMs 
profit at their expense.
    So we have an important opportunity today to look at the 
latest practices, the most current practices being employed by 
pharmacy benefit managers, and the impact that these tactics 
have on taxpayers and Americans who count on affordable 
medicine--affordable medicine--for a decent quality of life.
    Thanks to all our witnesses.
    Senator Crapo, please, and I thank you for your 
cooperation.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE CRAPO, 
                   A U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO

    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I have 
long championed efforts to improve prescription drug access and 
affordability for all Americans, and I welcome the opportunity 
to engage in this vitally important bipartisan hearing.
    Whether at the pharmacy counter, the doctor's office, or 
the hospital, some of the most lifesaving medications remain 
out of reach for far too many working families and seniors, 
especially in the face of persistent inflation.
    Congress took a critical step toward addressing these 
challenges nearly 20 years ago, when we voted to enact 
Medicare's prescription drug benefit or Part D, leveraging 
market-based competition to create and protect high-quality 
coverage for seniors. In many ways, Medicare Part D reflects an 
unprecedented success story.
    Coming in massively under budget, with low and stable 
monthly premiums and with a generic drug dispensing rate of 
roughly 90 percent, Part D's resilient market-oriented 
structure continues to ensure low-cost drug access for most 
seniors, even as many other medical costs have continued to 
skyrocket.
    Stakeholders across the supply chain deserve credit for 
these figures and trends. That said, much has changed in the 
past 2 decades, and we have an obligation to both build on the 
aspects of Part D that work well, and to address access and 
affordability gaps where we find them.
    In weighing and developing policy solutions, my priority is 
always the patient. We need to identify avenues for lowering 
out-of-pocket costs, increasing competition, and promoting 
access to lifesaving innovation, and we need to do so in a 
fiscally responsible manner.
    Given the tremendous common ground and shared goals around 
this issue, I am confident that we can fulfill these objectives 
and deliver real results for seniors. A few major points 
regularly raised by Idahoans--transparency, incentives, and 
out-of-pocket costs--are of key importance as we hear today's 
testimony.
    As anyone who has looked at a flow chart or a diagram of 
the drug supply chain can attest, the only clear thing about it 
is how unclear and opaque it is. We need an all-of-the-above 
approach to transparency that empowers consumers, plans, 
providers, and pharmacies to make informed, cost-effective, and 
clinically appropriate decisions, as well as to practice 
meaningful oversight.
    Policymakers also need more line of sight into the black 
box of drug pricing relationships and transactions, especially 
as we look to pursue productive reforms in the future. We also 
need to assess the various incentives that operate within the 
medication supply chain.
    Ideally, we should have frameworks both within Part D and 
in other markets that encourage low prices through meaningful 
competition. Unfortunately, in too many cases, certain dynamics 
seem to drive list prices up, as the chairman has mentioned, 
even as net prices reflective of rebates and discounts decline.
    The gap between list and net price has grown dramatically 
in recent years, keeping premiums stable but exposing some 
consumers to astronomical out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy 
counter, particularly for uninsured patients or families 
relying on high-
deductible health plans.
    Misaligned incentives have also constrained biosimilar 
uptake in Part D, driving manufacturers to launch products at 
multiple different price points, with PBMs sometimes 
preferencing the option with the higher sticker price. The 
incentive structures at play here clearly warrant a hard look.
    Americans face an out-of-pocket cost of less than $20 for 
92 percent of the prescriptions filled. For the remainder, 
however, costs can run much higher, particularly for seniors 
enrolled in Part D. I look forward to discussing targeted 
solutions to bridge this gap without fueling premium hikes for 
older Americans.
    With these priorities in mind, thank you to our witnesses 
for your being here today, and I do look forward to your 
testimony.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Crapo appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Crapo. And listening to 
you and comparing it to those five areas that I touched on 
where we have been working in a bipartisan way, this is 
especially important, because people find this at the pharmacy 
counter in communities all across the country. So we look 
forward to having the majority and minority work together.
    Let me briefly introduce our witnesses. Robin Feldman, J.D. 
She is a national expert on drug pricing, competition, 
innovation, and the law. She teaches at UC College of Law, San 
Francisco, where she is the Arthur Goldberg distinguished 
professor of law. She holds the Albert Abramson 54 
distinguished professor of law chair, and with apologies to Ms. 
Feldman and our other witnesses, I am going to be brief because 
I think we have so many things going on today. I think you all 
have wonderful backgrounds. I am just going to try to condense 
this a little bit.
    Karen Van Nuys is next. She holds multiple positions at the 
Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, 
including senior fellow and the executive director of the Value 
of Life Sciences Innovation Program.
    Lawton Robert Burns will be next. Dr. Burns is a professor 
of health care management, professor of management, and the 
James Joo-Jin professor at the University of Pennsylvania 
Wharton School, with a special focus on studying health 
strategy.
    Jonathan Levitt is with us. He is co-founder of Frier 
Levitt, a boutique health care law firm. He has dedicated his 
practice to representing pharmacies, dispensers, provider 
associations, manufacturers, wholesalers, and plan sponsors. We 
welcome him.
    And Dr. Matthew Gibbs is with us, president of Capital Rx, 
a pharmacy benefit manager that operates with a fully 
transparent flat-fee dispensary. He is responsible for several 
core operations at Capital Rx which cut across client 
relations, benefit design, customer support, and clinical 
services.
    With apologies for abbreviating all of your very 
distinguished backgrounds, I would just ask unanimous consent 
that a more complete record of their backgrounds be made a part 
of the record.
    [The biographies appear in the appendix on p. 213.]
    The Chairman. Okay, let us begin with you, Ms. Feldman.

 STATEMENT OF ROBIN FELDMAN, ARTHUR J. GOLDBERG DISTINGUISHED 
 PROFESSOR OF LAW, ALBERT ABRAMSON '54 DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR 
   OF LAW CHAIR, AND DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR INNOVATION, 
        UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LAW, SAN FRANCISCO, CA

    Ms. Feldman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members 
of the committee. The supply chain for medicine is riddled with 
perverse incentives and marked by skyrocketing prices. Key 
aspects of the problem can be traced to the industry that lies 
at the center of drug pricing: pharmacy benefit managers, or 
PBMs.
    Historically, PBMs were just claims processors handling the 
paperwork. But 15 years ago, when Medicare expanded to include 
prescription drugs, PBMs offered to help health plans negotiate 
with drug companies for better prices. But instead of prices 
coming down, the prices of many drugs have increased 
dramatically. For example, the prices of 65 common medicines 
have almost tripled, just during that 15-year period. Now, 
there are many contributing factors, but PBMs have been in the 
middle of it.
    So how did this happen? How did PBMs, who are supposed to 
help bring prices down, end up driving prices higher instead? 
Well, rather than act as honest brokers for the health plans, 
PBMs have unsurprisingly acted in their own self-interest, and 
as it turns out, their own interests are not aligned with lower 
prices. Quite simply, higher prices put more dollars into a 
PBM's pockets.
    When the sticker price goes up for a drug and the PBM 
negotiates a rebate, the PBM appears successful. It is a little 
like a department store that raises the price of a coat before 
putting it on sale. The markdown looks great when you walk in, 
but it is not.
    In addition, the PBM often keeps a percentage of the 
rebate, so it gets to pocket more, again based on the price. 
Now all this might not be so bad if no one actually paid that 
high sticker price, but as Senator Crapo pointed out, many 
people do. With many plans, the out-of-pocket payment comes as 
a percentage of that high sticker price, and that is very 
difficult. Many Americans do not have prescription drug 
coverage, even if they do have health insurance.
    Now, I mentioned raising the price of a coat before you put 
it on sale, but it gets worse. So, imagine if the price jump is 
higher than the sale discount. That is what is happening with 
medicine. Between 2010 and 2017 in Medicare, prices for drugs 
after rebate--we are talking about after rebate--still rose 313 
percent on average. So we are buying the same coat, but we are 
paying more and more. And a significant chunk of that increase 
is going to the PBMs.
    Now, a PBM may be brokering deals for the health plan, but 
it is a very strange relationship. The PBMs refuse to give the 
details of the deals they are making to their own clients, the 
health plans. And, given the monopoly over pricing information, 
and the fact that only three PBMs control most of the market, 
PBMs are setting the terms of almost every arrangement. It is 
not a free and fair market.
    Despite the fact that PBMs should be serving as honest 
brokers for the health plans, PBMs also ask drug companies for 
side payments. And again, those payments rise when the prices 
of drugs rise, and that creates perverse incentives. They 
vigorously deny having a fiduciary or any other type of duty to 
act in the best interest of the health plan and its patients.
    So, at the end of the day, what do PBMs do to protect their 
income stream of rebates and payments? Well, PBMs stand at the 
center. They are the benefit managers. As well as negotiating 
the prices, PBMs help decide if patients will be reimbursed and 
how much they will be reimbursed. So, in dealing with drug 
companies, PBMs can offer to exclude a drug company's 
competitors, or to make it more difficult for patients to get 
the competitor's medicine. As a result, this is where we end 
up. Less-expensive medicines are disadvantaged, and patients 
are channeled into higher-priced drugs.
    Although the pharmaceutical supply chain is a complex 
system, the overview of these aspects of the problem can be 
summarized fairly simply. PBMs are able to exploit their role 
at the center to extract dollars and channel the system into 
higher-priced drugs. That is the core of the problem.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Feldman appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Well said.
    Let us go next to Dr. Van Nuys.

 STATEMENT OF KAREN VAN NUYS, Ph.D., SENIOR FELLOW, LEONARD D. 
SCHAEFFER CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS; AND EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR, VALUE OF LIFE SCIENCES INNOVATION PROGRAM, UNIVERSITY 
            OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, CA

    Dr. Van Nuys. Thank you, Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member 
Crapo, and honorable members of the committee. Thank you for 
the opportunity to testify today about the practices of 
pharmacy benefit managers.
    My name is Karen Van Nuys, and I am an economist and a 
senior fellow at the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health 
Economics at the University of Southern California. The 
opinions I offer here today are my own and build on previous 
statements and publications.
    At the Schaeffer Center, we have been studying prescription 
drugs for over a decade, and we are among the first research 
institutions to quantify the role of intermediaries in that 
market. PBMs provide important and much-needed services to drug 
companies, insurers, employers, and patients, and sit in the 
middle of nearly every financial transaction.
    This position provides them with extraordinary information 
access and leverage. As has been widely reported, the PBM 
industry has become larger and more vertically integrated. Four 
out of five U.S. prescriptions are now handled by the top three 
PBMs. While their size may allow them to negotiate lower drug 
prices, it also positions them to suppress competition and 
raise drug costs.
    Which of these two possibilities prevails is ultimately an 
empirical question that our research seeks to answer. 
Estimating money flows in this market can be challenging, 
because much of the needed data is opaque to outsiders. That 
said, drug price researchers have been conducting these studies 
that shine slivers of light into the dark corners of the 
system. From these glimpses, we can assemble a collage of the 
overall picture, and here are some things we have learned in 
assembling that collage.
    First, in some circumstances, PBMs raise drug costs. We 
compared what Medicare paid for the most common generic drugs 
with what those same prescriptions would have cost cash-paying 
members at Costco. We found that Medicare could have saved $2.6 
billion in 2018 on just 184 drugs if they had been purchased 
without insurance at Costco. Somehow, involving the PBM and the 
health plan in the transaction increased drug costs by 21 
percent.
    Second, in some branded markets, when PBMs negotiate 
savings from manufacturers, they do not always pass those along 
to patients and taxpayers. My Schaeffer colleagues and I 
studied the money flows from U.S. insulin sales between 2014 
and 2018. While PBMs negotiated a 31-percent reduction in net 
payments to manufacturers, the total amount spent per unit of 
insulin barely budged. Instead, intermediaries, including PBMs, 
were capturing those savings. In 2014, intermediaries were 
taking 31 out of every 100 dollars spent on insulin. Five years 
later, they were claiming $53, more than half. PBM's share 
alone grew 155 percent in 5 years.
    PBMs use commercial tactics like copay clawbacks, spread 
pricing, and strategic formulary placement to do this. This 
leads to perverse outcomes, including patients' copays 
exceeding the cost of the drug on one in four prescriptions, 
and plans paying on average 31-percent markups for generic 
scripts.
    PBMs motivate manufacturers to compete for formulary 
placement through rebates. PBMs often keep a share, leading 
them to prefer drugs with higher rebates. So manufacturers 
offer higher rebates, raising list prices to accommodate them. 
Consequently, this form of competition pushes prices up rather 
than down, and formularies can end up favoring the highest- not 
lowest-cost drug.
    High list prices have real consequences for patients. Those 
without insurance may pay list prices directly; those with 
insurance may still be exposed in the deductible phase or 
through co-
insurance payments. Passing rebates through to health plans 
creates its own problems for patients. Health plans may use 
them to lower premiums, but this decreases the effective 
generosity of coverage. It transfers resources from sick 
patients to healthy beneficiaries.
    Finally, the current rebate-focused price negotiation 
process can generate counterintuitive formulary designs. For 
example, researchers found that 72 percent of Medicare 
formularies place at least one branded product on a lower cost-
sharing tier than its generic. Some biosimilar manufacturers 
are finding that it is easier to get biosimilars with high list 
prices and high rebates onto formularies compared to identical 
products with lower prices.
    While it is true that PBMs provide valuable services, the 
lack of transparency in the transactions they control, the 
misaligned incentives that govern their behavior, and vertical 
consolidation in the PBM industry should be concerning to us 
all. Increased transparency that gives market participants more 
equal footing in price negotiations would help level the 
playing field, and stricter reporting requirements for more 
granular transaction data would allow regulators to analyze 
specific markets and tactics, identify problems more quickly, 
and provide us with more targeted solutions.
    Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

    The Chairman. Thank you for your testimony. We are serious 
about this.
    Dr. Burns?

STATEMENT OF LAWTON ROBERT BURNS, Ph.D., MBA, JAMES JOO-JIN KIM 
PROFESSOR, PROFESSOR OF HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT, WHARTON SCHOOL, 
          UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA

    Dr. Burns. Well, good morning. Thank you, Chairman Wyden 
and Ranking Member Crapo, for inviting me to speak. My name is 
Robert Burns. I am a professor of health care management and 
strategy at the Wharton School.
    One part of my research focuses on the entire health-care 
ecosystem. I have taught the introductory course on the entire 
health-care system for over 35 years. I am beginning to 
understand it, so I understand everybody's frustration. I put 
it into a textbook which was published 2 years ago. It covers 
not only the life sciences side, pharma, and biotech, but also 
the providers: the insurers--both public and private--and then 
the employers. And it provides a big picture of what goes on 
with health care.
    I think you need to understand that big picture of the 
ecosystem to understand some of the dynamics that you are 
focusing on here today. Another part of my research does a deep 
dive into what we call the supply chain, and I look at both the 
institutional and retail supply chains in health care. I have 
written two books on these topics, and I have been studying 
them since the 1990s.
    This past fall, I published a 650-page book just on the 
PBMs and the GPOs, basically trying to ``demystify'' their 
roles in the health-care system. To paraphrase Mark Antony in 
Act III of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, ``I come here today not 
to praise the PBMs, but to bury some concerns about them.''
    The Chairman. And you said you wrote 590 pages about PBMs?
    Dr. Burns. And 650 pages on GPOs and PBMs.
    The Chairman. That almost equals, Senator Grassley, the 
report that you and I did. I think we have a close competition. 
Excuse me for interrupting. It is not going to count against 
your time.
    Dr. Burns. My remarks today focus on three topics. First, 
just the role of intermediaries: health intermediaries and 
health-care-linked buyers and sellers. Health care is full of 
them. They are not well-understood or appreciated. No course is 
taught on these critters, and I liken them to the Rodney 
Dangerfield of health care. They get absolutely no respect.
    Worse yet, they are considered the whipping boys--in other 
words, the people who take the rap and get spanked for the evil 
doings of others. I spent 25 years studying these 
intermediaries, starting with the HMOs in the 1990s, the GPOs 
in the early 2000s, and then more recently the PBMs. They all 
take the rap. They are all blamed for all the ills in health 
care.
    My first book on GPOs and the institutional supply chain 
taught me a lot about these intermediaries. We have been down 
this road before, and to quote President Harry Truman, ``The 
only thing new in the world is the history we don't know.'' So 
that is why I have devoted so much time to these things.
    I believe there is a lot of smoke but not as much fire as 
people think. I take my readers through an exercise in critical 
thinking, looking at the allegations that you have seen 
everywhere, and then I get my students to ask the question, 
``Is what I just heard really true?''
    A historical analysis--this is one of the tools I use--
shows that PBMs serve the interests of health plans and the 
ERISA plan sponsors who utilize them. The PBMs are agents. They 
are not rogue actors in the health-care system. They exert 
leverage over manufacturers in terms of the volume, trading off 
higher volumes for a lower unit cost.
    They have used a lot of the same contracting tools for 
decades, once you consult the historical record. One thing that 
should alleviate some concerns here is that their business 
models have been changing over the last 5 to 10 years. They no 
longer rely on rebates the way they used to, and I think what 
they are relying on now is the dispensing of specialty 
pharmaceuticals, and we ought to reserve some time today to 
talk about the role of specialty pharmaceuticals in the rising 
prices for Medicare Part D seniors, because it is a huge role.
    You ought to know that manufacturers do not like 
intermediaries like PBMs. Very few people like intermediaries 
like PBMs, and basically that is because they are using 
leverage to extract price concessions from everybody. The name 
of the game in this area is trade-offs. You are trading off 
volume for price, access for price, things like that. You 
cannot have it all.
    But the PBMs are clearly instruments of trying to extract 
leverage from the manufacturers. Yes, there has been some 
consolidation of the PBMs, but it is a competitive market, and 
if you look carefully, everybody in health care is 
consolidating, not just the PBMs. I think the problem that we 
face in this sector is no or little competition in the 
specialty pharmacy area.
    The second part of my report focuses on the rebates or what 
we call the gross-to-net disparities. Rebates basically reflect 
the difference between the gross and the net price. Research 
shows, if you look carefully, that the rebates do not drive 
increases in list price.
    A lot of factors drive that gross-to-net disparity. A lot 
of factors drive the rise in the list prices charged by 
manufacturers. Some of those drivers are found in Federal 
legislation and Federal contracting dynamics.
    The second thing to recognize is that those rebates flow 
increasingly to the health plans, who are the people that the 
PBMs are agents for. They do not flow to the PBMs as much, and 
I think Part D and Medicaid policies encourage manufacturers to 
raise their list prices, as well as to increase their launch 
prices, where I think a lot of the attention ought to focus.
    Finally, there are a lot of issues about rising out-of-
pocket costs in Medicare Part D. That occurs primarily in the 
catastrophic phase, and that is driven primarily by the high 
cost of specialty pharmaceuticals.
    The Chairman. We are going to have to move on.
    Dr. Burns. I will stop.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Burns appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Great; thank you very much.
    Okay, let us see. Mr. Levitt?

  STATEMENT OF JONATHAN E. LEVITT, CO-FOUNDING PARTNER, FRIER 
            LEVITT ATTORNEYS AT LAW, PINE BROOK, NJ

    Mr. Levitt. Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and 
members of the Senate Finance Committee, thank you for inviting 
me to testify here today about PBMs. I am a trial lawyer with 
the law firm of Frier Levitt. I represent stakeholders in the 
drug supply chain--most importantly, independent, retail, and 
specialty pharmacies.
    I have been trying cases against PBMs for the last 20 
years. I am here at my own cost. The six largest PBMs control 
96 percent of the Nation's prescription drug market, and 
adversely impact all stakeholders in the drug supply chain, 
including patients, pharmacies, plan sponsors, and taxpayers.
    As with all Americans, Medicare and Medicaid and employer 
groups are at the mercy of PBMs and their vertically integrated 
health-care conglomerates. These top PBMs are driving 
independent pharmacies out of business; creating pharmacy 
deserts, especially in rural areas; fueling drug list prices 
higher for all Americans; and delaying and denying treatment 
for the sickest Americans, including those with serious 
diseases like cancer.
    In my written testimony, I have provided information on all 
PBM tactics that adversely impact the stakeholders. During 
these opening remarks, I address how PBMs fuel drug prices and 
extract the DIR fees from pharmacies. While drug manufacturers 
set drug prices, the growing gap between the list price of 
drugs and the actual net price is due to rebates that PBMs 
extract from manufacturers for preferential formulary placement 
and tiering treatment.
    Americans pay their copay based on the list price of drugs, 
not the net price. Thus, patients pay dramatically increased, 
artificially inflated costs for drugs. PBMs, through their 
sister companies, siphon a huge percentage of the list price of 
drugs as profits to CVS Health, Cigna, and UnitedHealth, all of 
whom own little-known companies called rebate aggregators.
    Today, two of these PBM-owned rebate aggregators are 
located outside the United States. Cigna, which owns Express 
Scripts, owns Ascent Health, located in Switzerland. 
UnitedHealth, which owns OptumRx, also owns Emisar, the rebate 
aggregator located in Ireland.
    Just this week, the Attorney General in Ohio filed a 
lawsuit against Cigna for using, in his own words, ``a little-
known Switzerland-based company to illegally drive up drug 
prices and ultimately push those higher costs onto patients, 
who rely on lifesaving drugs such as insulin.''
    Now let me make a few comments on DIR fees, the direct and 
indirect remuneration that PBMs extract from pharmacies. PBMs 
extracted $12.6 billion in 2021 in post-point-of-sale DIR fees 
from retail and specialty pharmacies. These performance fees 
are supposed to be based on legitimate adherence metrics that 
measure how well a pharmacy has kept a patient on the 
physician's prescribed drug regimen.
    However, especially in the case of specialty pharmacies, 
PBM adherence methodologies are designed to cheat pharmacies 
and are shrouded in secrecy. Pharmacies are unable to audit 
PBMs on the accuracy of their DIR fee calculations. PBMs 
provide no adherence data, and pharmacies are unable to 
challenge PBMs out of fear of retaliation.
    CMS will eliminate DIR fees in 2024, but the problem is not 
eliminated. PBMs and their affiliated Medicare Part D plans 
will compensate for the lost DIR fee revenue, which is very 
profitable, by drastically reducing pharmacy reimbursement.
    Case in point: in 2024, Express Scripts will slash 
pharmacies' reimbursement rates to rates that are worse than 
the time when DIR fees existed. The other top PBMs are likely 
to follow, which will drive more pharmacies out of business. 
However, given that PBMs own their own affiliated mail-order 
pharmacies, the largest specialty pharmacies, and giant chain 
pharmacies, PBMs do not care if they drive independents out of 
business. PBMs will make money one way or the other.
    I have taken depositions of PBM executives and insurance 
executives, and I have asked questions such as, ``What do you 
do with the $12 billion of DIR fees that you take from 
pharmacies? Does any of it go back to Medicare or to 
patients?''
    The answers to these questions that I have gotten under 
oath from these executives are really staggering. I would love 
to share those answers, but PBM gag clauses and protective 
orders in these cases prevent me from doing so. I truly hope 
Congress can shine more transparency on PBMs and pass 
meaningful legislation for the benefit of all Americans.
    I welcome your questions. Thank you.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Levitt.
    Dr. Gibbs?

  STATEMENT OF MATTHEW GIBBS, Pharm.D., PRESIDENT, CAPITAL Rx 
                       INC., NEW YORK, NY

    Dr. Gibbs. Thank you, Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, 
and members of the Finance Committee. First and foremost, I am 
a pharmacist. I have been in the PBM industry for a very long 
24 years, serving in various leadership roles. I am currently 
serving as a member of the executive team at Capital Rx, a 
disrupter PBM in the market.
    We must first take a step back to truly understand how the 
PBM situation developed. Since PBMs emerged in the 1980s and 
1990s, they have played a vital role in the overall supply 
chain. PBMs connect all pharmacies in the U.S. via a single 
uniform communication logic.
    This logic allows pharmacies from single-store ownership to 
multistore chain operations to communicate safety edits, drug-
to-drug interactions, disease-to-drug interactions, and patient 
payment information. This happens within milliseconds and is 
arguably the most efficient transaction in all of health care.
    In the early 2000s, PBMs started to grow in scale, while at 
the same time brand drug inflation increased. PBMs began to 
negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers on rebates 
for preferred product placement on the PBMs' formularies. 
Rebates quickly became the lifeblood of every PBM. With this 
development came a web of complex layers of rebate payment 
definitions, which became impossible for any employer or 
government entity to track.
    The market then shifted in an arguably suspicious 
direction, choosing consolidation over innovation. It is no 
secret to anyone on this committee that 70 to 80 percent of the 
PBM market is controlled by three major organizations. Each of 
these is either owned by or owns a major insurance carrier.
    PBMs also own dispensing assets, mail-service pharmacies, 
and specialty home delivery, and in certain circumstances even 
a retail chain. Fortunately, the Federal Trade Commission is 
now examining these market concerns.
    Most critical is the fact that nearly all PBMs utilize a 
less-than-efficient pricing benchmark. This benchmark is known 
as average wholesale price, or AWP. This was the pricing source 
that was part of a class action lawsuit that required the 
majority of publishers of AWP to stop before September 2011.
    There was hope in the market that, at the time, a new 
industry benchmark would emerge. Unfortunately, every PBM 
migrated back to AWP through another available index, and it 
now is again the market standard. State fee-for-service 
Medicaid plans, however, were no longer going to leverage AWP, 
so they relied on CMS to develop a new acquisition cost 
benchmark called National Average Drug Acquisition Cost or 
NADAC.
    It is based on survey data from retail pharmacies that 
report their invoiced acquisition cost at the drug level to 
CMS. NADAC is published on a free public website, while AWP--
remembering that is the industry standard--is a fee-based 
subscription service.
    So how is Cap Rx different, and why am I the only PBM 
meeting with you today? Capital Rx is set up to change the way 
drugs are priced and patients are cared for to create enduring 
social change. We are over 1 million members strong across all 
payer types. Our pricing model abandons the traditional AWP 
index and utilizes NADAC as the primary benchmark, and we have 
a single ledger model that is easily understood by our payers.
    The best way to describe the problem in the market is to 
give you an everyday example. If you go in the pharmacy to pick 
up an over-the-counter product, you quickly see the prices in 
front of you and you know what you are going to pay when you 
get to the register. But when you go to the back, and you go to 
the pharmacy to pick up your prescription, you spin the 
roulette wheel and cross your fingers and hope for the most 
affordable price that month.
    It does not have to be this way, and it is a direct result 
of the AWP being manipulated by PBMs. The ask is simple: every 
drug should have a price that is accessible to every American 
at any time.
    Traditional PBMs have trained everyone to believe that drug 
pricing is unstable, using complex proprietary algorithms to 
lower their contractual reimbursements to pharmacies, while at 
the same time not returning those savings to the payers or the 
patients.
    And while Medicare limits this practice to some extent, 
most commercial and managed Medicaid contracts still allow it 
to continue. One solution is to use NADAC as a publicly 
available price and the source of truth for drug costs. Is it 
perfect? No. Is it fundamentally better than the industry 
standard? Absolutely.
    I will leave you with this final message. I have worked my 
entire career to drive transparency into the pharmacy supply 
chain. We are at a pivotal moment in history where we can 
finally change what is broken and bring rational drug level 
pricing to the American people.
    Compulsory NADAC reporting from all retail, mail order, and 
specialty pharmacy home deliveries will drive competition and 
bring meaningful cost insights to payers and patients alike.
    Thank you, Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and the 
committee, for your time on this crucial issue.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Gibbs appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. All right. Colleagues and guests, we are 
about to start votes. Two points. One, we are just going to 
keep this moving. It is such an important topic, and Senator 
Crapo and I will figure out a way to do it.
    The first four questioners will still be the first four 
questioners, though in a somewhat different order because 
Senator Stabenow has to get to a Forestry hearing, and she has 
been very patient, has a great interest.
    Senator Stabenow?
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and 
Ranking Member, and thank you to all of you. This is a really 
important hearing, and I very much appreciate your courtesy as 
well.
    I have long been involved in issues around rising prices of 
prescription drugs, as many of our colleagues have, and I mean 
this is, bottom line, about lifesaving medicine. It is about 
people's life and their health, and I would say it is hard to 
find something more serious than whether or not people can 
afford the medicine that they need. And unfortunately, we know 
that for decades Americans have been paying the highest prices 
in the world, which makes no sense. And when we look at prices 
three times higher as in many countries, I mean, it is just--it 
makes absolutely no sense.
    One of the lifesaving drugs we have tried to tackle, and we 
are tackling, is insulin, and we know that prices have tripled 
in the last decade, with insulin costs going up 800 percent 
more than in other developed countries. So we have now put a 
cap of $35 per month for someone on Medicare.
    It is a good start. Drug companies that make insulin are 
now appearing to move in this direction, but there is a lot 
more to do--Medicare negotiation and so on. I know the Lowest 
Price Act, which was signed into law in 2018, banned PBMs from 
blocking pharmacists from telling patients how they could pay 
less money for a prescription if they paid out of pocket. They 
were not allowed to tell people that.
    So that was just one of many, many bad practices. So let me 
get to today. PBMs have said that their purpose is to negotiate 
lower prices. I said, when we had a group of PBMs in front of 
us a couple of years ago, we should call them ``PBNs,'' because 
they are pretty bad negotiators, if that is what they are 
supposed to be doing.
    So, I would first ask Ms. Feldman, can you discuss in more 
detail the PBMs' practices that have led Americans to pay the 
highest prices in the world?
    Ms. Feldman. Thank you. When PBMs channel patients into 
higher-priced drugs, then the prices rise for everyone in the 
system.
    Fair and efficient markets do not work that way. Patients 
should be encouraged to buy the drug with the lower sticker 
price. That entire system is how we end up with some of the 
highest prices in the world for the same drugs that other 
developed countries are purchasing.
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you very much.
    And, Mr. Levitt, you talked about the DIR fees, and I share 
your great concern both for those independent pharmacies and so 
on, but also for beneficiaries. So could you talk more about 
how the DIR fees harm the sickest people in the system, and 
could you give us more details? We are talking about people who 
have cancer or other serious diseases, and how they are 
affected by these fees.
    Mr. Levitt. Thank you. It is true that the sickest are the 
most harmed, because I will say PBMs have made the argument 
that when we collect all these rebates and also fees from 
pharmacies, we are able to lower the premium. That is actually 
true, that the premium is lowered--and for those who never use 
their prescription drug card, they pay the lower premium.
    But for the sickest Americans, those, for example, with 
cancer, when they go to the pharmacy counter, as has been 
stated, they pay the maximum copay. They go into the donut 
hole, and then they go into catastrophic coverage--all of them, 
anyone who is on a specialty drug.
    So those patients who use their medication, they pay the 
most. And also, the government does. In the catastrophic 
coverage phase, the PBM insurance company pays the least. 
Manufacturers and the government pay more, and so do patients. 
So the sickest patients are the biggest losers.
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you again, and the ranking member, for 
holding this hearing. This is a very important piece of how we 
are going to really make medicine in America affordable for 
people. I would just add we, as taxpayers, pay for basic 
research that creates these drugs, which I am happy to do, and 
it is an important piece of what happens.
    But it is public dollars, and then when we end up paying 
the highest prices in the world, this does not equate. This 
does not work, and I am so glad we are tackling this.
    The Chairman. And thanks for all your leadership in these 
issues, Senator Stabenow. I hope everybody picked up on the 
point Mr. Levitt just made to Senator Stabenow, and that is, 
you can do phenomenally well in the prescription drug system as 
long as you never need medicines. If you do not need medicines, 
everything works out well.
    Senator Crapo?
    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    When we talk about the need for greater transparency in the 
drug supply chain, that term can and should mean a few 
different things. It means transparency for plans, who need to 
select the best PBM option and conduct effective oversight. But 
it also means transparency for consumers in choosing a plan, as 
well as for providers in choosing the most cost-effective, 
clinically appropriate medication to prescribe.
    We also know from experience that any effective 
transparency policy needs to drive down rather than increase 
costs, and that credible trade secrets warrant protection. With 
these considerations in mind, I will start with you, Mr. Levitt 
and Dr. Van Nuys, in that order.
    What specific and concrete policy steps should we take to 
improve transparency under the Medicare Part D system for 
patients and plan sponsors, as well as for providers and 
pharmacies? I would ask you to be as succinct as you can, 
because I want to have a few other answers as well.
    Mr. Levitt. So, to speak very succinctly, I think that the 
process for the government to take that would be the most 
practical and the most effective would be to create a true 
rebate safe harbor. So that would mean that it would be 
transparent, that PBMs could legally take a rebate fee or an 
administrative fee, but it would be limited to 3 percent, 4 
percent, 5 percent, not 50 percent. So I think a very practical 
rebate safe harbor would be a big change.
    Senator Crapo. Okay, go ahead. Were you going to add 
something?
    Mr. Levitt. I was just going to add, from the patient 
perspective, the Medicare Plan Finder is where patients go to 
look and see their copay. The Medicare Plan Finder does not 
reveal that patients are paying a copay based on that list 
price of the drug instead of the net price after rebates and 
after DIR fees.
    Senator Crapo. All right; thank you.
    Dr. Van Nuys?
    Dr. Van Nuys. Thank you, yes. You heard from Dr. Gibbs in 
his opening statement about how helpful the National Average 
Drug Acquisition Cost data are to his business model, but they 
are also helpful to researchers like us.
    I think one action that the Federal Government can take is 
to create similar pricing series that are collected regularly, 
standardized, averaged, and posted publicly just like NADAC is. 
That would help.
    But those series are not on the acquisition cost, which is 
the cost that pharmacies pay to wholesalers, but at other 
points in the distribution system--so, for example, the prices 
that are the reimbursements that pharmacies are receiving from 
pharmacy benefit managers, or the prices that health plans are 
paying their pharmacy benefit managers to settle claims.
    If we had similar aggregated--so, not disclosing any 
confidential information--if we had similar consistent 
benchmarks and measures in those points of the distribution 
system, people like Dr. Gibbs could use them in their business 
negotiations, researchers like me and regulators could know 
more about how prices are moving throughout the system. I think 
that would be a big help.
    Senator Crapo. All right; thank you very much.
    Dr. Gibbs, what would your answer to that question be?
    Dr. Gibbs. Well, I feel as if Dr. Van Nuys quoted me, but I 
would say it is very similar. We are using a pricing index 
everywhere--Medicare, managed Medicaid, commercial--off of AWP, 
and it literally has nothing to do with the price of a drug. So 
I do not know if people understand that in most, if not all, 
Medicare contracts, you pay the average cost of all drugs.
    That is your guarantee. Drugs do not have a price. You do 
not know the price of generic Lipitor. You pay a price based on 
all generics' average over a year. We do not buy any products 
like that in our economy. We have accepted it in the drug 
business. And until we get rid of the fundamental issue of 
these average benchmarks that are not related to drug costs, we 
can do all these other great, creative things around rebates, 
transparency, but when the cost basis is not reflective of 
actual cost, it is not going to be worth it. We have to change 
that.
    Senator Crapo. Well, thank you very much.
    I have a number of other questions that basically ask for 
solutions, and I am not going to have time to get into those. 
So I am going to yield my time back to the chairman.
    But I would like to ask you all--I will tell you, we will 
be submitting questions for the record to you, and I ask you to 
really pay a lot of attention to these questions, because we 
need the kind of expertise and guidance that you can give to us 
to help us put together the right solutions here.
    The Chairman. And I second Senator Crapo's request. We want 
to make this a bipartisan effort in this committee. So please, 
treat Senator Crapo's questions like mine and everyone else's. 
We have got to get moving on this.
    My first question to you, Ms. Feldman, is that in 2021, 
Senator Grassley and I released what was, really, a landmark 
report, reviewing contracts between the three biggest PBMs and 
insulin manufacturers. One of the findings was that the 
manufacturers often paid PBMs administrative fees for 
services--for example, for providing data--and PBMs made 
billions of dollars every year off these fees.
    The report also found that these administrative fees are 
often based on a drug's list price. So, preferring a higher-
priced drug by placing it on an advantageous lower formulary 
tier can make more money for the PBM, yet higher costs for 
patients and taxpayers.
    Question: doesn't the PBMs' practice of preferring higher-
priced drugs raise patient costs and overall drug spending?
    Ms. Feldman. Yes, of course. When patients are channeled 
into higher-priced drugs, the prices rise. With the system you 
have just described, the problem is that the person negotiating 
on behalf of the patient should not be getting paid by the 
other side. It is a conflict of interest. It is a problem, and 
it pushes those prices higher.
    When that payment is based on a higher price for the drug, 
it undermines the negotiation entirely.
    The Chairman. You are being way too logical for a lot of 
the ways the Federal Government does business, and I appreciate 
it.
    Dr. Van Nuys, for you: your research suggests that PBMs may 
be overcharging their health plan clients for generic 
medicines, including Medicare Part D plans. One of your studies 
found that Medicare was overcharged by $2.6 billion for generic 
medicines in 2018 alone, compared to Costco's pricing for the 
same drugs.
    A separate Harvard study backs up your findings. They found 
Medicare would have saved $3 billion in 2020 if Part D plans 
were charged the same prices that Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs 
company charged us for generics. This is all factually correct 
thus far; is that correct?
    Dr. Van Nuys. Yes.
    The Chairman. Okay. Now, it is no secret that big PBMs can 
be effective negotiators when there is competition between drug 
manufacturers. It is hard to believe they are not getting as 
good a deal, if not better, than Costco or Mark Cuban. So I 
want to finish up with a specific example.
    CivicaScript is a nonprofit pharmaceutical manufacturer. 
They sell a generic prostate cancer drug for $160. The average 
price that the PBMs are charging the Part D plans for the exact 
same drug is over $3,000. Just let that all sink in a little 
bit--the difference between generic prostate cancer drugs for 
$160; PBMs are charging Part D $3,000. Yet Civica cannot get 
the big three PBMs to cover their drug, which is a tiny 
fraction of what they are doing their business with.
    So as a result, Part D plans--and consequently patients and 
taxpayers--for this drug, this specific drug in this specific 
case, they are facing a markup of nearly 2,000 percent. Is that 
right?
    Dr. Van Nuys. The math?
    The Chairman. Yes.
    Dr. Van Nuys. Oh, I trust your math, yes.
    The Chairman. Yes, correct. So, colleagues, we are going to 
enter this letter into the record from CivicaScript. It 
provides more details on the issue. But the example that we 
have cited with a generic prostate cancer drug, we are talking 
about a markup of almost 2,000 percent. So something is way out 
of whack here, all right?
    [The letter appears in the appendix beginning on p. 211.]
    The Chairman. One last question for you, Dr. Van Nuys. Why 
do PBMs appear to be charging such high prices to their health 
plan clients for these medicines?
    Dr. Van Nuys. I think the short answer is, because they 
can. Lack of transparency in these markets allows PBMs to pay 
the pharmacy one reimbursement and then charge the plan a 
different price for that same prescription and keep the 
difference, which is the spread.
    And because plans cannot see what the pharmacy has been 
paid, they do not know when they are being overcharged. It is 
that kind of lack of transparency that certainly is driving 
what happened with the Costco study that we did. I suspect that 
is also going on in the CivicaScript example you just cited.
    In the CivicaScript example, there is also this added 
complexity of the PBM owning the specialty pharmacy that is 
dispensing it. That is a different issue, but also related to 
your question.
    The Chairman. So let me close with this, and my time is 
just about up. This sounds like a really bad news discussion 
for patient costs and spending under Medicare. Is that your 
assessment as well?
    Dr. Van Nuys. Yes, I agree.
    The Chairman. Because we have got to figure out how to hold 
down costs in America. We have got to figure out how to 
strengthen Medicare. Senator Crapo and I talk about this often. 
In this committee, colleagues, the late Senator Hatch worked 
with us, and I think Senator Grassley remembers as well. We 
built the CHRONIC Care bill.
    We are interested in finding ways for people to get good-
quality care, and to make it more affordable. We have just 
gotten a snapshot in time of just how the consumer gets fleeced 
under these kinds of PBM practices, and how that really ripples 
right through to Medicare, which picks up so many of these 
bills. And we just cannot afford to do business this way and 
meet the challenge of Medicare in our time.
    Senator Grassley?
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, thank you for continuing 
this committee's work on PBMs. Something ought to get done this 
Congress, considering the fact that there is already a bill out 
of Judiciary, a bill out of Commerce. Senator Sanders is 
talking about getting a bill out of the HELP Committee. The 
House committee is already working on this issue.
    I believe it is our duty to understand how the 
pharmaceutical supply chain is working, and what we can do to 
improve it. In 2019, this committee held a hearing with PBM 
executives, and we worked to advance a bipartisan bill to shed 
more light on PBMs and drug companies. The Inflation Reduction 
Act took big steps to reduce drug prices, but there are 
approximately 30 provisions in the Grassley-Wyden bill still 
not law that would establish more accountability in the drug 
pricing world, including for PBMs.
    The current drug price system is so opaque that it is easy 
to see why there are many questions about PBM motives and 
practices. In 2018, I pressed the Federal Trade Commission to 
investigate PBMs. Last year, the FTC began studying PBMs, and I 
am not waiting--we cannot wait for FTC to issue their report.
    The Judiciary and Commerce Committees have passed PBM bills 
that I am working on with Senator Cantwell. Senator Cantwell is 
also on this committee. The Prescription Pricing for the People 
bill requires the FTC to study pharmaceutical intermediaries, 
including vertical integration, and issue a report and 
recommendations to Congress within 1 year. This bill has passed 
the Judiciary Committee on a voice vote. The PBM Transparency 
Act has advanced out of the Commerce Committee with a 
bipartisan vote of 18 to 9. This bill puts sunshine on PBMs and 
saves taxpayers $740 million.
    I pursued bipartisan legislation, held hearings, and 
conducted oversight. In the Grassley-Wyden 2-year investigation 
into insulin price-gouging, we found that that PBM scheme 
encourages drug makers to spike the drug list price in order to 
offer greater rebates, and in turn secure priority placement on 
covered meds, and all at the expense of many patients.
    This especially impacts those who are uninsured, 
underinsured, and on high-deductible plans. Recently three 
insulin manufacturers announced that they were lowering the 
list price on their insulin products. I believe the key way 
that we can solve high prescription drug prices is to have more 
transparency.
    One of the panelists talked about PBMs being scapegoats. I 
think they have created their own scapegoat environment, 
because of lack of transparency. If you want people to 
understand what you are doing and you are playing a very 
important role in this whole business of getting pills from the 
manufacturer to the consumer, then why not have transparency, 
and then you do not have any problems with the public not 
understanding what you are doing?
    So, my one and only question will be to Dr. Van Nuys and 
Mr. Levitt. The Cantwell-Grassley PBM Transparency Act requires 
transparency reporting to shine sunlight on prices and fees. 
Why is PBM transparency important to ensuring taxpayers and 
patients are getting the lowest drug prices possible?
    Dr. Van Nuys. I think transparency is an essential first 
step, because it gives researchers like me, regulators like the 
Federal Government, the opportunity to understand the bigger 
picture. But more importantly, that kind of transparency is 
actually going to provide participants in the markets with 
information about the true prices that they are facing.
    When they have information about the true prices that they 
are facing, they can make better economic decisions, and they 
can choose the highest-value opportunity. So I think it is an 
important first step. I think it will help in at least those 
two ways.
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Levitt?
    Mr. Levitt. Thank you. It is our contention, based on 
information we have seen in litigation and how we studied the 
market, that there is a huge percentage of the list price of a 
drug that is retained by the PBM and the PBM rebate aggregator. 
Transparency would shine the light on that.
    It is okay if PBMs make some money, but if it is 20 or 30 
percent of the list price of a drug, that is a problem. If we 
are able to shine that transparency on those rebates, we can 
actually lower the list price of drugs for all Americans. 
Pharmaceutical companies could literally charge less and earn 
the same net price. Plan sponsors including the government, 
Medicare and Medicaid, and private employers could pay a lower 
price for drugs, and pharmacies could stay in business because 
they could get a reasonable reimbursement rate.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague, and next is Senator 
Cornyn.
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is an 
extraordinary panel, and there is so much complexity here that 
I am going to join Senator Crapo in sending you some specific 
questions about solutions. I am not sure what the right 
metaphor is. I have heard you talk about the system being 
riddled with perverse incentives.
    Sometimes the PBM is called the ``black box,'' and I have 
heard us talk about transparency. I start with the fundamental 
proposition that our pharmaceutical industry is entitled to a 
return on their investment for their risk-taking, and that we 
are the beneficiary of that from the public health standpoint.
    The fact that the American and the international 
pharmaceutical industry can come up with Operation Warp Speed 
in an incredible amount of time and save millions of lives, is 
something to be celebrated.
    Conversely, I do believe that there is a lot of 
gamesmanship going on in the industry. Maybe that is an 
understatement for all of you here. So again, I do not know 
what the right metaphor is--whether it is a Rubik's Cube, or a 
shell game, or whatever you want to call it--but transparency, 
as many of you have said, seems to be an important part of 
getting the right answer.
    But I cannot help but feel like this is by design, the 
complexity and the difficulty of actually determining what is 
the price of the drug. Dr. Gibbs, you talked about the 
importance of setting that standard. So I am very interested in 
getting some specific proposals, and of course Senator Grassley 
and others have talked about transparency.
    But it strikes me that without transparency, the market 
cannot work. Dr. Van Nuys, do you agree with that?
    Dr. Van Nuys. Wholeheartedly, yes.
    Senator Cornyn. I mean, I am not an economist. I am a 
recovering lawyer, but it seems to me that this whole area is 
rife with gamesmanship. We have even had examples of drugs that 
have had as many as 100 different patents, so-called patent 
thickets, and product-hopping and other gamesmanship by the 
industry, to try to maximize price.
    Again, I do not begrudge the industry making a return on 
their investment, and I know it is highly risky. But I do 
object to the gamesmanship and the playing of a rigged system. 
So, Dr. Van Nuys, why is it that Costco can charge so much less 
for the same drug?
    Dr. Van Nuys. Again, I am going to go back to transparency. 
I think that because, in a cash market, there is no third-party 
payer, there is no spread. The PBM is not charging a spread, 
and so Costco does not have to pass those costs on to the 
patient.
    Senator Cornyn. I am not--I usually do not gamble when I go 
to Las Vegas, but sometimes they talk about the spread. This 
sounds like it is one big gambling operation.
    Dr. Van Nuys. I am not sure whether it is gambling, but it 
is a way for PBMs to capture money inside that distribution 
process, yes.
    Senator Cornyn. And, Dr. Gibbs, you talked about the 
mechanism that you have used to try to provide more 
transparency and sort of a standard price that people can 
operate from, because we lack the basic information to 
understand the system and this whole----
    Mr. Levitt has talked about all the ``do not disclose'' 
statements and the confidential settlements and things like 
that that prohibit him from telling us what he knows about this 
system. But what impact do you think your company and the way 
you are operating in terms of the business model, compared to 
Amazon or Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs--what promise does that 
have to lead us out of this terrible mess?
    Dr. Gibbs. Sure. Thank you, Senator, for your question. I 
would say our goal is and always has been to bring transparency 
options, regardless of channels.
    Senator Cornyn. You want to make money too though, don't 
you?
    Dr. Gibbs. Correct. I mean we are--we are a startup. We 
started in 2018, and we are not profitable yet. We are getting 
there, and it----
    Senator Cornyn. I do not think Amazon was either for the 
first period of time.
    Dr. Gibbs. Exactly, exactly. And using a price index like 
NADAC, which is published by CMS--they actually do the survey 
to the pharmacies. And by making it more robust so it is not 
voluntary--today it is a voluntary survey--and getting better 
responses to that will lead us to the actual drug cost.
    And then you can have your nuance of Costco, Mark Cuban, 
and a person can actually go in and look, and actually be 
informed of what the real price is once and for all. Today, 
with all the dynamics, from PBM spread to stores having 
different usual and customary fees, to membership programs that 
all the stores have, it has created this quagmire for a person 
to really know what they are going to pay.
    The only way is to level set. The good news is, we have the 
tools already. We just need to enforce them.
    Senator Cornyn. Well, Dr. Burns, I appreciate your 
scholarly work, but the fact it took you 650 pages or so to 
explain PBMs and GPOs I think speaks volumes about where we 
are.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cornyn.
    Next would be Senator Cardin.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me thank 
you for calling this hearing. I want to thank our panelists. 
Put me down on the comments that you made in the opening. I 
strongly support greater transparency.
    The rebate systems seem to be leading to the wrong types of 
incentives. Higher-cost drugs are priority over lower-cost 
drugs, and quite frankly, I do not know who holds the pharmacy 
benefit managers accountable for any public responsibility.
    I think that is the challenge. We, the taxpayers, are the 
largest payers and consumers of pharmaceutical products, and 
yet the pharmacy benefit managers that play a critical role in 
this are really not accountable to us. To me, that is the major 
challenge.
    So, I do not know how we get a handle on the accountability 
issue, but let me mention one area that has been one of my 
major areas of concern. We have many low-cost drugs that are 
very important in our health-care system, infusion drugs, that 
are in short supply.
    I have heard specifically of examples where patients were 
denied the protocol care because the drugs were not available. 
These are low-cost drugs that in the richest country in the 
world, that spends the most on pharmaceutical products--to me 
it is outrageous that these drugs are not in adequate supply.
    Now, you would think the pharmacy benefit managers that are 
negotiating on behalf of the companies' coverage for drugs 
would have leverage to make sure that low-cost drugs are 
available. But it does not seem to be the case, and this past 
year we added more drugs to the shortage-of-supply list than we 
ever have in the past.
    So how can we modify our system to make sure that we have 
adequate supplies, and how can the pharmacy benefit managers be 
engaged in that process? Who wants to take a shot at that? 
Please.
    Dr. Burns. Well, there are Federal reports that the major 
problem with drug shortages is not PBMs; it is with the 
manufacturers, and I am not here today to bash the 
manufacturers. But oftentimes, those shortages are driven by 
manufacturing problems and compliance problems in the plants 
operated by those manufacturers. That is the source of the 
problem, number one.
    The source of the problem number two is, sometimes we just 
do not have enough manufacturers there, such that one could 
pick up the slack if one of the other manufacturers' production 
goes down.
    Senator Cardin. I agree with you that the primary 
responsibility is with drug manufacturers and their profit 
motives. If they cannot make enough on a particular drug, they 
are going to use that capacity for other purposes.
    But I would just argue that pharmacy benefit managers are a 
huge part of the pharmaceutical chain here, and they could use 
their leverage in regard to pharmaceutical manufacturers. I 
would suggest also that the group purchasing organizations that 
are setting up could also add to the number of drug shortages 
because of the pricing here.
    So there is part of what they are setting up, to me, that 
makes the problem more challenging. Yes, did you want to 
respond, Mr. Levitt?
    Mr. Levitt. Yes, I think that it is true. Manufacturers 
should be making these short-supply drugs. But I think one of 
the things that PBMs can do in a more moral control of the 
formulary, is to put these low-cost drugs on the formulary, 
encourage manufacturers to make these by giving them a fair 
return, and giving the pharmacies a fair return for dispensing 
some of these drugs.
    Senator Cardin. I agree. It seems to me that, as I see it, 
the PBMs have ignored this issue, and in some cases have made 
it worse because of the way that they have organized their 
pricing. So, it encourages the pharmaceutical manufacturers to 
do what they are doing today, rather than trying to provide a 
different avenue so that we can deal with the shortages.
    We have some legislation here to deal with the shelf life 
of drugs and to make it easier, and some incentives to add 
capacity for lower-cost drug manufacturing. So, we are doing 
some things on the supply side.
    But when you look at the profits that are being made, both 
at the manufacturer level and at the benefit manager level, to 
me it is shocking that there is not an attention to the patient 
who needs these drugs.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Senator Cassidy is next.
    Senator Cassidy. Dr. Burns, it's like no one is talking to 
you, man, so I would like to talk to you. We have several 
academics on, and if you read Ms. Feldman and Dr. Van Nuys, you 
are thinking, are you all from the same planet, right? You seem 
to be--so let me just ask about some things that Dr. Van Nuys 
puts in her testimony and have your response.
    In 2019 before patents were due to expire, Gilead 
introduced an authorized generic version of Harvoni that was 
going to lower out-of-pocket cost by $2,500, but it never made 
it to several PBMs' formularies. The patients continued to pay 
top dollar, even though there was a generic that was available. 
I think I summarized that correctly, Dr. Van Nuys.
    Now, that would look like something which is an abuse of a 
PBM, by a PBM. What would you say to that, Dr. Burns?
    Dr. Burns. Well, one has to look at the incentives in 
Medicare Part D plans, and the incentives there are to get the 
beneficiary through all of the various coverage phases into the 
catastrophic phase, where the government picks up almost all of 
the tab and the health plan pays very little.
    So it is the health plans who have an incentive for the 
patients to move through those coverage plans, such that their 
liability is diminished when the patient hits the catastrophic 
phase. It is not the PBM; it is the health plan that the PBM is 
an agent for.
    Senator Cassidy. So you are saying that the health plan 
would be instructing the Part D PBM in order to put that 
formulary so as to move the person into the catastrophic phase 
most rapidly?
    Dr. Burns. Well, the health plans run the Part D plans. 
They are not instructing the PBM to run the patient----
    Senator Cassidy. So, it still sounds like a little bit of a 
collusion. If you have an insurance company that owns, in 
whole, the PBM company, and they are telling them, listen, we 
want to offload our responsibility, so stick it to the patient 
buying the drug and move them into--that is what you are 
saying, huh?
    Dr. Burns. Not necessarily, because that vertical 
integration that you have talked about with the health plans 
owning the PBMs, that is mostly recent, okay. Up until 2018, 
the only health plan that owned a PBM----
    Senator Cassidy. Yes, but I think what we are describing is 
still a recent phenomenon, at least until that was capped.
    Mr. Levitt, you are shaking your head. You are waving your 
hand. You are like jumping up and down, but be concise.
    Mr. Levitt. I thought I was being more subtle than that, 
but yes. I mean the PBMs, and the insurance companies are one 
in the same, and there is no firewall. So UnitedHealth owns 
Optum. Cigna owns Express Scripts, and CVS owns Caremark and 
SilverScript.
    So to the extent--that was an accurate statement. These 
health plans want the patient to have a higher-cost drug to 
move through the coverage phases to get to the catastrophic.
    Senator Cassidy. So I think what you are saying is that we 
have to actually broaden our view. The PBM is merely an agent 
for the insurance company that is willing to foist cost upon 
both the consumer and upon the Federal taxpayer, in order to 
maximize their profit?
    Mr. Levitt. That is right, but----
    Senator Cassidy. Let me stop you, because I have limited 
time.
    Dr. Van Nuys, now recent legislation has changed the 
dynamic of the Medicare Part D incentive. Theoretically, there 
is no longer a reward for sticking it to the patient and moving 
her into the catastrophic. Would you expect that which Dr. 
Burns, I think it is fair to say--I do not know if 
``minimizes'' is the right word but seems to give less 
importance to--how do you think this is going to impact it?
    Dr. Van Nuys. I will start by saying I am not sure, but I 
do think that it could alleviate some of the issues. I do not 
know. We will have to see how it plays out to understand.
    Senator Cassidy. And, Dr. Burns, coming back to you, I 
think you are quoting Weinstein-Schulman's data when you, in 
your testimony, say that people are inferring that the higher 
list price, even though net price is minimally rising, that 
they are inferring that that is related to the fees, the 
rebates, et cetera.
    Seems like a pretty good inference to me. And so, knowing 
that that high list price is what the person, the patient in 
her deductible, is going to pay, they are still extracting more 
money from the Medicare beneficiary, a lot more money. Your 
thoughts on that?
    Dr. Burns. Sure. Research, as well as my own study of some 
of these drugs, shows that the list price goes up because the 
manufacturers can get away with it.
    Senator Cassidy. Now the Schulman article or articles, and 
the Schulman-Weinstein most recently, show that the list price 
grows, I do not know, 2.7 percent, whereas the--I am sorry. 
List price will grow 5 percent and net price is growing 1.7 
percent. Now, that is not the manufacturer; in fact, there is a 
depressive effect. Others have noted that this is costing 
manufacturers a fair amount of money. So I am not sure. So 
where would you come from?
    Dr. Burns. Well, the manufacturer is setting that list 
price, and then the PBMs act as agents on the health plan to 
negotiate down that price----
    Senator Cassidy. No. That list price is a negotiation 
between the rebate and the net price. In fact, I think I know 
that the manufacturers do not report, as a profit, the list 
price. They only report the net price, which tells me that that 
is all they are counting on, and the rebate, the price between 
the list and the net, is that which the PBM is demanding for 
where they put it on a tier, etcetera. Would you dispute that?
    Dr. Burns. Well, the PBM demands that, in order to get on 
the formulary, and then demands a bigger rebate in order to get 
a more favored position on that formulary. And then the PBM 
translates or passes along those rebates to the health plan. 
The issue is what the health plans do with that money, not the 
PBMs.
    Senator Cassidy. I am way over, but I will say that the 
lack of--the opaqueness of it is, I think, what people are 
concerned about, because we do not know the entirety of that is 
going back to the payer. It may be going back to the integrated 
insurance company, but we do not know that it is going back to 
Google, Exxon, Deloitte and Touche, or you know, Performance 
Contracting in Louisiana.
    Dr. Burns. And what I would say is----
    The Chairman. To be continued, Senator Cassidy. Important 
points.
    Senator Menendez is next, followed by Senator Carper and 
Senator Thune.
    Senator Menendez. Mr. Levitt, pharmacy benefit managers are 
key players, or should be, in alleviating patients' financial 
burden at the pharmacy counter, as they frequently set 
patients' out-of-pocket costs based on a drug's list price. The 
higher the list price, the more the patient pays, an obvious 
burden.
    Less obvious, but equally concerning, is that PBMs benefit 
significantly from high list prices and have no incentive to 
choose lower-priced drugs to drive down patient costs. PBMs 
extract rebates from manufacturers based on list price in 
exchange for a manufacturer's drug receiving formulary 
placement.
    Those rebates are passed on to plans that employ them, but 
almost never to patients, and manufacturers also pay 
distributors, group purchasing organizations, and specialty 
pharmacies percentage fees that are based on the list price. 
The patient gets nothing.
    So, under the current structure, PBMs make more money when 
a drug's list price increases, while patients bear the 
financial burden. Conversely, if a manufacturer lowers the list 
price, PBMs stand to lose money while patients benefit.
    So, Mr. Levitt, do you agree that it would be better for 
patients if the supply chain was delinked from list prices, so 
that patients' out-of-pocket costs were based on net prices?
    Mr. Levitt. Yes. There is absolutely no doubt that patients 
would do better paying a copay based on that lower price, based 
on the drug benefit structure of almost all plans.
    Senator Menendez. And let me ask you, would patients be 
better off if PBMs and other supply chain entities were paid 
flat fees for the services they provide?
    Mr. Levitt. Absolutely they would, as long as it is a 
reasonable flat fee.
    Senator Menendez. Now, Humira treats people who are 
afflicted with crippling rheumatoid arthritis. This critical 
medicine can cost patients more than $80,000 a year. It should 
be good news to consumers that Humira biosimilars are being 
launched, which should make the treatment more affordable for 
patients who desperately need it.
    But because the economic incentives to PBMs are completely 
skewed, the biosimilar drugs launch with two different prices: 
one with a high list price and a large rebate; one with a low 
list price and a lower rebate. So take another look at this 
chart. We know PBMs favor the high list price in order to 
obtain larger rebates, even though the patient would pay 
significantly less if PBMs selected the drug with the lower 
list price.
    So is it true, Mr. Levitt, that the current structure 
incentivizes PBMs to select higher-cost drugs to the detriment 
of patients?
    Mr. Levitt. Yes, Senator, it does, and it is often to the 
detriment of the patient, because sometimes there is a better 
drug on formulary that does not pay as much of a rebate that 
would be better for the patient.
    Senator Menendez. You know, the Pharmacy Care Management 
Association, which represents the PBMs, includes research on 
their website that states, and I quote, ``High list prices hurt 
patients who must pay these prices. If list prices were lower, 
out-of-pocket payments based on list prices would be lower and 
more affordable.''
    It rocked my mind when I read this. So if the PBMs 
themselves acknowledge lower list prices would help patients at 
the pharmacy counter, why would they still place preference on 
a higher list price product, when a drug company has given them 
a better option for their patients?
    Mr. Levitt. Because they have established this architecture 
in the system, where they have these rebate aggregators that we 
believe are secretly siphoning a lot of that rebate out and not 
giving it back to the plan or the consumer.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you.
    Now finally, as a result of mergers and acquisitions in 
recent years, CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx now 
control approximately 80 percent--80 percent--of all U.S. 
prescription drug claims. This level of concentration gives 
these PBMs market power over data, drug coverage, and 
contracting--80 percent.
    The hyper-consolidation, with little to no regulatory 
oversight, creates inappropriate negotiating leverage that 
discourages competition and makes it difficult to achieve 
transparency, affordability, and timely access for patients. 
So, Mr. Levitt, how does the consolidation in the PBM market 
impact costs for patients, and what sort of regulation and 
oversight is needed to protect consumers?
    Mr. Levitt. I think, first of all, this massive power 
influence over physicians, which is a problem--we want 
physicians to act independently. I think some of the things 
Congress could do to lower drug prices would be to create more 
transparency, as has been discussed a lot, but also a safe 
harbor for rebates.
    If PBMs want to earn a rebate, to keep money, it should be 
at an amount defined by the government. I think that would help 
lower drug prices.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I 
appreciate that Mr. Levitt's from New Jersey, his sock wear.
    The Chairman. I noticed.
    Senator Menendez. It looks like he may have graduated from 
North Carolina at one point.
    The Chairman. All right. Next will be Senator Carper and 
Senator Thune, and I thank my colleagues for their patience, 
and when we start voting, we are going to keep everything 
going.
    Senator Carper?
    Senator Carper. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome everyone. 
Nice to see you all.
    I am from Delaware, born in West Virginia, grew up in West 
Virginia, but I am privileged to represent the people of 
Delaware here for quite a while now.
    We are proud in Delaware, especially with being the first 
State to ratify the Constitution. And in the Constitution, you 
may recall--in the preamble of the Constitution it starts with 
these words: ``We the people of the United States, in order to 
form a more perfect union.'' It does not say in order to form a 
perfect union, but a more perfect union.
    Out of that, I take the idea that everything we do, we can 
do better, and we need to do better. That includes the way we 
deliver health care: to cover more people, to do it in a cost-
effective way, harness market forces where we can to provide 
better health care.
    I will just say, there are four questions that I ask when I 
am considering, among other things, how to make pharmaceuticals 
more available to people, to make sure that they are getting 
the drugs that they need at a reasonable cost.
    But I ask four questions in this room, and one of those is, 
given an idea, I say, what is the effect on patients, how does 
it affect patients? Then I ask, how will this affect taxpayers? 
What are the budget implications of what is suggested to us? 
The third question I ask is, a particular answer or idea, does 
it foster innovation? Does it diminish innovation? And the last 
question I ask is, does a particular idea simplify or make more 
complex an already complex situation, as you know?
    And with that in mind, I am going to ask, not a question 
for all of you. I am going to pick on Dr. Karen Van Nuys, and I 
would appreciate your response to this.
    Again, one of my guiding principles--and I just mentioned 
it is the first one--is, in terms of pharmaceuticals, the work 
that we do here with respect to prescription drugs--one of my 
first questions is, how does it affect patients at the counter 
in terms of their pocketbooks?
    That is why I previously cosponsored something called 
Creating Transparency to Have Drug Rebates Unlocked, and you 
bet there is an acronym for all that. It is C, capital C, 
through, T-H-R-U (C-THRU). And it is led by Senator Wyden, and 
would have ensured that cost savings from rebates provided by 
drug manufacturers would be passed on to patients.
    At the same time, sometimes lowering costs in one part of 
our health-care market, as you know, can cause another--it is 
like squeezing a balloon; it pops out some place else.
    But here is my question, Dr. Van Nuys. Can you share with 
us briefly your thoughts on how we can better ensure that 
rebate cost savings are passed down to patients at the counter, 
while also managing costs for our Federal Government? And is 
there a narrow or maybe an incremental way to go about this so 
we can balance these trade-offs? Thank you.
    Dr. Van Nuys. Thank you, Senator. Let's see. As you know, 
it is hard to lower patient out-of-pocket costs without 
impacting premiums and squeezing the balloon in one place and 
having it bulge in another.
    And so one of the solutions or avenues to help would be to 
take some of the savings that we have identified, right, that 
$2.6 billion that Medicare was overpaying for low-cost generic 
drugs in 2018, and figure out ways to take that money out of 
the current system and get it to patients for out-of-pocket 
relief or so we can lower premiums. We can do a lot of things 
with that.
    We had--my coauthor Erin Trish and I--an op-ed in The 
Washington Post this week about taking those low-cost generic 
drugs out of the benefit, so that we do not run it through this 
process that adds 21 percent to their cost.
    Right now, 21 percent is going to intermediaries. There are 
much better things we can be doing with that money: helping 
patients, helping taxpayers, helping the domestic supply 
industry, and helping innovation.
    Senator Carper. That is a very good answer. Yes, so go 
ahead and then I will--my time will expire, but go ahead, 
please.
    Ms. Feldman. I believe there are three key areas that are 
really worth focusing on to try to bring sanity here.
    Senator Carper. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Feldman. One is to clarify that the PBMs have a duty to 
the health plans and the patients they represent. The second is 
to ensure transparency, so the market can operate--price and 
price term transparency. And the third is to ensure that 
patients get the benefit when they choose a cost-effective 
drug, so that when the drug has a lower sticker price and the 
patient chooses it, the patient pays less.
    Senator Carper. Great. I am going to ask the men--I have to 
go. I address the men on the panel. If you agree with what she 
just said, those three, raise your right hand.
    [No hands raised.]
    Senator Carper. If you agree with two of them, raise your 
right hand.
    [No hands raised.]
    Senator Carper. How about one? All right. Well, we will 
come back, and we will let the guys have their discussion later 
on. Thank you. Thanks very much.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Carper.
    Senator Thune?
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I would say, if we were starting over, I would blow up this 
whole model of the supply chain, because I think it is an 
antiquated model. I believe the free market works when there is 
competition. But you have so much vertical integration, so much 
consolidation of market power, and no transparency, as has been 
pointed out a lot of times already.
    And I just--this to me makes no sense, and I have tried to 
study this supply chain and how this drug pricing works in this 
country, and I just--it is incredibly complex. There is not any 
other product that we buy in the market that has such a 
complicated and antiquated way of getting products to the 
consumer.
    I say that as just an observation and something that I hope 
we can work on. But I know that these, some of these issues are 
embedded in a system that has been in place for a long time. 
But I would start over.
    Let me start--I have a question having to do with the 340B 
program, which is critical to South Dakota hospitals, and, Mr. 
Levitt, if you could speak to this. I often hear concerns from 
South Dakota pharmacists, hospitals, and health centers when it 
comes to engaging the PBMs, especially on the 340B program.
    The dynamics of 340B are complicated as well. There is a 
lot going on with contract pharmacies right now, but it is 
important that the program continues to serve its intended 
purpose of helping our hospitals and health centers support 
their communities. So, could you talk about the impact of PBMs' 
practices on hospitals and health centers in the 340B program?
    Mr. Levitt. Thank you, Senator. I think nowhere in the drug 
supply chain is the influence of vertically integrated health-
care companies with PBMs--and with what they call third-party 
administrators in the 340B program--more troubling.
    The whole idea of 340B is to get 50 percent of the drug 
costs as a profit back to the hospitals like the ones in South 
Dakota. But what really happens? You have PBMs that take maybe 
a DIR fee of 5 percent or 10 percent. So that 50-percent profit 
that is supposed to go to hospitals in your State is taken by 
PBMs.
    PBMs also own a third-party company that manages the 340B 
program. Those third-party companies might take out another 10 
percent. So now, of that 50-percent profit that was supposed to 
help with indigent care in South Dakota, 15 percent is gone.
    Then you have the PBMs that own pharmacies and specialty 
pharmacies, and they act as contract pharmacies, as you 
mentioned, for the covered entities in your State, and they 
might take out another 10 percent or maybe more. So, at the end 
of the day, the 340B program is completely frustrated by PBMs, 
their specialty pharmacies, their retail pharmacies, and by 
their third-party administrators.
    Senator Thune. Let me--I want to direct this question to 
you too, Mr. Levitt. But we talked a little, you hit a little 
bit on independent pharmacies, but I also hear concerns from 
pharmacists in South Dakota regarding their retroactive direct 
and indirect remuneration fees, and this is something that CMS 
took a step toward providing more certainty on in their final 
rule last year by incorporating these fees in a negotiated 
rate.
    However, I know that pharmacies continue to have concerns 
about low reimbursement rates from PBMs, and we need to ensure 
that our independent pharmacies remain viable, serve patients, 
while also ensuring that the Medicare program is a good steward 
of taxpayer dollars by promoting value and rewarding quality.
    In your submission to the committee, you discussed the 
current performance metrics for pharmacies, some of which you 
state may not benefit pharmacies or patients. How do we 
incentivize or reward those pharmacies that are providing high-
quality care to patients?
    Mr. Levitt. The current system that PBMs use, the metrics 
that they use for medication adherence--there is no oversight. 
One of the Senators talked about accountability. CMS has 
absolutely no idea how these big insurance companies for the 
Medicare Part D program are evaluating adherence. It does not 
incentivize physicians that dispense drugs, or pharmacies.
    The solution might be CMS becoming more active in 
understanding how adherence is judged, so that the pharmacies 
that are truly doing well, serving patients, can get benefited 
more.
    Senator Thune. Good; thank you.
    Mr. Chairman, I am about out of time, so I will--I have one 
question I would like to submit for Mr. Gibbs for the record, 
dealing with the things that you are doing in terms of 
technology and some of the ideas that you have that hopefully 
could impact in a positive way the price that consumers are 
paying at the counter. So I will submit that one for the 
record. But thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my friend. I just want to say before 
he goes, I think there is no question that if you were starting 
over today, literally starting from scratch, nobody would go 
out and set up what we are dealing with now. And that is part 
of our challenge, and we are going to make it bipartisan, and 
that is what Senator Crapo and I have been talking about. I 
look forward to working with him.
    Senator Tillis is next.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I thank you all for 
being here.
    I spent most of my career in management consulting, supply 
chain optimization, strategic resources--all things that are 
relevant to this topic. For the last 8 years, I have been 
trying to get use cases that I could follow through the entire 
process, from the investigational new drug, to the new drug 
application, clinical trials, the manufacturing of product, 
going to the PBMs, going through the insurers, the health-care 
providers. And in 8 years I have not had anybody in this value 
chain willing to step up and go through the whole process. That 
suggests to me, Dr. Burns, that there is a lot of smoke. We 
just do not know exactly where the fires are.
    But I do, for one, think that we have some use cases where 
the PBMs are likely to be guilty of some of the fires. I think 
right now we probably have people across the country viewing 
this committee kind of like a Super Bowl watch party. You have 
PBMs watching it; they are going to get hammered today. You 
have the other people watching it, probably cheering. But every 
once in a while, a statement is going to be made going, ``Whoa! 
We have a dysfunction here.''
    I look at health-care policy pretty simply. To me, there 
are three critical success factors: how are you going to 
improve access, how are you going to improve outcomes, and how 
are you going to reduce costs? And until we get transparency in 
the entire process, we are not going to make headway here.
    The other thing I would like to do, Mr. Chair, is have a 
hearing at some point where past members, past or current 
members who passed bills, have to sit where you are, and the 
industry and all the people in the supply chain get to ask you 
questions about what you were thinking. They may have been a 
good idea, but a lot of the restrictions that we have are 
congressionally mandated. So, we have to look in the mirror if 
we are going to solve this problem.
    Pfizer launched a rheumatoid arthritis drug at a lower cost 
than the originator drug. A PBM placed a high price, high 
rebate on the formulary. Gilead authorized generic versions of 
a branded hep-C drug. They found that nearly half of Part D 
plans covered the branded versions, but the authorized generics 
were specifically launched to reduce patient cost. By the end 
of 2020, less than 20 percent of Medicare patients received 
either.
    Mylan launched a generic version of a lifesaving cancer 
drug for two price points. This PBM placed the high price, high 
rebate drug on the formulary. Sandoz, biosimilar, same sort of 
outcome: higher price, higher rebate on the formulary. Amgen 
with Humira, widely prescribed drug, similar story.
    Teva, lifesaving cancer drug, similar story. AbbVie, same 
story. These are examples, some of them widely prescribed 
drugs, that make no sense in terms of the ultimate cost and the 
availability of it. I said in a committee hearing, last week I 
believe, with Mr. Becerra--I said I think everybody in the 
value chain needs to be at the table to take a haircut.
    Now the question is, if we do it right, that haircut will 
probably look more similar to Dr. Gibbs. If we do it wrong, 
somebody in the value chain is going to get a haircut very 
similar to Mr. Levitt. And, Mr. Levitt, I appreciate you being 
here, because if we get this right, you are going to have fewer 
clients going forward, and I think you will be okay with that.
    But this is another thing that 5 minutes cannot simply 
allow me to drill down on with somebody who has written 600 
pages. That is the CliffsNotes version of all that we need to 
understand to get this policy right.
    But you reminded me of an experience I had going into a 
controlled burn, when you said there is a lot of smoke, but you 
cannot see the fire. When you go in a controlled burn on a 
house, you have to put your hand on the firefighter ahead of 
you, because you are not going to see him the minute you enter 
the house. But there is a fire, and my guess is there are, in 
some segments of the supply chain, big ones that are going to 
be difficult to bear out, others where we can have some hits, 
the singles and doubles, and get something done.
    But I am telling the industry, everybody in the supply 
chain, there is no rational basis for us not to have use cases 
so we can figure out the root causes of the problem, and it is 
not as simple as any one. You have to go through this and 
figure out what their value add is.
    I think over time the PBMs have morphed; there is a lot of 
vertical integration now, a number of things that we have to 
look at if we are serious about coming up with a bipartisan 
proposal for solving this. Now I would like to reserve the 
right to speak with you all individually, because I think your 
expertise requires far more attention than I can give you in 
the remaining 6 seconds. So, thank you for being here.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague, and as we talked about 
yesterday, I am very much looking forward to working with him 
on this.
    Senator Brown is next.
    Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Tillis, thank you for your comments. I heard about 
the last two-thirds of them. Thank you for that. With the 
Inflation Reduction Act, we stood up to big pharma and dark 
money and finally began to take action to bring down the cost 
of prescription drugs.
    I thank the chairman for his leadership on that. I have 
been working on this my whole career, pushing for Medicare 
price negotiations, pushing to crack down on drug company 
price-gouging. Their lobbyists rarely lose. They lost this 
time. We are seeing the same kind of actions with railroad 
lobbyists fortunately.
    We can build on that success to lower prices further by 
reforming DIR fees. It is an impenetrable system of fees most 
people have never heard of that makes it harder for local 
pharmacies--we all hear from them often--to serve Ohioans who 
count on them every day.
    Fees are so exorbitant in some cases, they force people's 
community pharmacy out of network or to close altogether. I 
called the administration last year to finalize its DIR fee 
reform proposal to help lower drug costs for seniors. CMS has 
acted to protect seniors' pocketbooks, but there are other 
problems with these fees that the rule does not touch.
    Mr. Levitt, for you: what other actions should Congress 
take to better protect consumers and local businesses they 
count on by addressing DIR fees or any new practices PBMs are 
starting because of the CMS rule?
    Mr. Levitt. I think that there is some current law that 
applies to Medicare Part D. Terms and conditions in Medicare 
Part D are supposed to be reasonable and relevant. But PBMs 
think that they can pay below cost to pharmacies and still get 
away with it. Their argument is, ``Look, we have 68,000 
pharmacies in our network. If it was not reasonable, they would 
all drop out.''
    But they are dropping out. So I would like CMS to clarify 
some current guidance. The guidance that says, ``reimbursement 
rates must be reasonable,'' I would like CMS to clarify to PBMs 
that that means that the reimbursement rate actually must be 
reasonable.
    Senator Brown. Thank you.
    Another concern I have with DIR fees is that pharmacies are 
paid or forced to pay based on quality measures.
    That sounds great, but I also hear from pharmacists in Ohio 
these measures are often inconsistent, sometimes just do not 
make sense. Some pharmacies, as I think you know from your head 
nod, Mr. Levitt, learn about these quality measures only after 
it is too late to address them. Elaborate on that, would you?
    Mr. Levitt. Sure. These DIR fees are based on performance. 
They are supposed to be based on the performance of pharmacies. 
But 50 percent of DIR fees plus are paid by specialty 
pharmacies, and the PBMs do not know how to measure adherence 
for specialty drugs.
    I think they do it intentionally wrong. Sometimes they do 
it themselves instead of outsourcing adherence. If we had more 
time, I could give you specific examples. But I think CMS has 
no idea how these PBMs are judging adherence. I think CMS 
should take a look.
    We sometimes ask the PBMs in depositions, ``Have you gone 
to CMS and asked them whether you are doing adherence 
measurements correctly?'' There is no communication between CMS 
and these big PBMs on DIR fees, including on the net 
reimbursement rate after the DIR fee.
    Senator Brown. Thank you.
    One of the biggest problems with our whole prescription 
drug system--and I think all five of you know this--is how 
opaque it is. Just a few companies dominate each part of the 
supply chain, which is far more convoluted than it needs to be, 
always frankly, to the benefit of the big drug companies.
    Even the experts are mostly guessing about what is 
happening behind closed doors at the pharmaceutical companies, 
again all to their benefit. I am proud that my State is in some 
ways taking the lead in tackling some of these problems. Ohio 
is getting some $100 million in overcharges back from PBMs.
    Earlier this week, we sued one of the mysterious group 
purchasing organizations, GPOs, that are owned by PBMs and used 
to take dollars from the pockets of people who simply need 
their medications. It is unacceptable that these shadowy, 
secretive entities have so much power over people's health 
care.
    Mr. Levitt, talk for the last couple of minutes--how do 
GPOs operate? How do they contribute to the drug cost problem 
for everyday Americans?
    Mr. Levitt. So, every single manufacturer that wants to get 
their drug onto a PBM's list of drugs that the PBM makes 
available to their big plan sponsors, has to pay a rebate to 
get on formulary. So PBMs use that, that formulary, as a tool 
to extract dollars from manufacturers. Sometimes if a 
manufacturer might resist, they might say that they do not want 
to pay a rebate, the PBM says, ``We are not going to put you on 
formulary. Or maybe we will, but we are going to make your 
copay Tier 3, which means no one is going to want to buy your 
drug. Or we might use step edits or prior authorization, so 
that physicians have a very tough time getting your drug onto 
formulary.''
    So these rebate aggregators, no one knows how much money 
they actually take out of the system. So, to be clear, these 
rebates that are collected by PBMs are not fully turned over to 
the plan sponsors, or maybe even to the government. They are 
retained in the middle.
    Senator Brown. Thank you.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague, and I appreciate the 
fact we have been working on these issues for a long time. And 
I would just say to my colleagues, these are complicated 
issues. There are questions of transparency and accountability. 
You always know whose side Senator Brown is on. Senator Brown 
is always on the side of the working families and the senior 
citizens.
    I told the story the other day about how we got the price-
gouging penalties, finally, and we are already starting to see 
breaks for consumers. We have the poster kids for these drugs 
like Humira, and we are starting to see price reductions. I 
thank my colleague for all his good work.
    I understand Senator Whitehouse, in his usual magnanimous 
way, is saying that he would like Senator Cortez Masto to go 
first.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you; I appreciate that. First 
of all, let me just reiterate what my colleagues have said. 
This is a great panel, and I hope this is one of many 
discussions we are having, because it takes more than 5 minutes 
to really dive into the issues here. So I appreciate everyone 
being here.
    I also want to thank our chairman and Senator Crapo, not 
only for holding this hearing, but really the work that we have 
done historically in this committee together, to lower drug 
prices for so many across the country, and continue to do.
    Today, I am introducing legislation called the Lower Drug 
Costs for Families Act, and what it will do is penalize 
pharmaceutical companies for increasing the price of their 
drugs faster than the rate of inflation, for patients in both 
the private health insurance market as well as Medicare. I 
think that is so important. It is what we are talking about 
today.
    We have heard PBMs often prefer higher-priced drugs to reap 
in administrative fees--we have heard that today--on the 
percentage of a drug's price. We know that health plans have 
incentives to limit overall drug spending. We have seen that as 
well, and we have also heard that PBMs get paid, both by their 
health plan clients and by the drug companies they negotiate 
with. This raises serious questions as to whether PBMs are 
serving the best interest of their clients, including union 
health funds.
    Obviously, transparency is key. That is what we are hearing 
about. But, Dr. Gibbs, let me ask you this, because you note in 
your testimony that Capital Rx has both financially and 
clinically aligned interests with its clients.
    As a PBM working with union payers, I am curious about your 
perspective here as well. How is your PBM model different, and 
what does that mean for the patients?
    Dr. Gibbs. Thank you, Senator, for your question. We work 
off what is called a single ledger model. We do not have to 
keep two separate sets of books, which have been referred to in 
many different aspects here today. What we reimburse the 
pharmacies is what we bill our clients. What we receive from 
pharmaceutical contracts is passed back to our clients, 100 
percent.
    Where that can be validated is with the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act. PBMs had to report their third-party margin 
spread at retail. They had to report their rebates that were 
retained on specific clients. So the data is now there as of 
January 31st of this year.
    I do not know what the Department of Labor or CMS intends 
to do with that. But that will shine the first light on what 
PBMs are making in this space, and I proudly put zeros in both 
of those columns.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Yes. And so, can I ask you, what else 
should we be learning from your model that you have not heard 
today, that we have not discussed, that we should be aware of?
    Dr. Gibbs. I think first and foremost is the fact that the 
supply chain is complex because the basis is wrong. The fact 
that at wholesale acquisition cost, which is kind of the 
starting point of drug pricing, when we actually serve a 
pharmacy, their price is lower than that.
    It does not make sense. The pharmacy does not buy lower 
than the wholesaler. So that should tell us right away that we 
are starting off at a place that is nonsensical, and until we 
fix that, everything else we are talking about is gray noise. 
We have to fix the cost basis of drug pricing in this country.
    Everything ties to that. Rebates tie to WAC. Wholesaler 
price ties to WAC. AWP goes to pharmacy sometimes. So, until 
that is all defined and revealed and becomes transparent, the 
rest of the fixes are going to continue to be on a spiral, in 
my opinion.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. And you know, it is true 
in Nevada, like every other State, where I am hearing from 
Nevadans, from our patients, from our pharmacies, all on the 
same issue.
    So it is not something that is unique to any one State. We 
have to figure this out, and I so appreciate the conversation 
today. I look forward to more of it so we can really address 
this issue, and I am going to yield the remainder of my time to 
my good colleague here.
    Thank you.
    Senator Crapo. Senator Whitehouse?
    Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Senator Crapo. Thank you, 
Senator Cortez Masto, and thank you all for being here.
    There is an obvious logic that Dr. Gibbs represents here, 
of having PBMs as an organized counterweight to the power of 
the pharmaceutical industry, which otherwise dominates. The 
danger is that a pharmacy benefit manager, once they are 
interposed between the pharmaceutical company and the customer, 
can become just a toll taker, or just a self-dealer, and 
extract more money out of the transactions than any market 
principle would justify.
    It gets a little bit worse than that, because if they are 
going that way, there is also the prospect that either through 
coordination or just through happy coexistence, the 
pharmaceutical companies can artificially inflate their prices 
to get paid more. That allows pharmacy benefit managers to get 
a bigger share of the savings that are, at this point, fake 
savings.
    The pharmaceutical industry is happy because it is making 
more money. The PBMs are happy because they are making more 
money. Nobody is blowing the whistle on the initial price being 
a phony, because the PBMs who are supposed to fight the initial 
price are actually in on the economics of the transaction, and 
the consumer once again takes it in the neck.
    So I am very interested in following up on what more in the 
way of transparency and guard rails we can do to prevent those 
behaviors and highlight them when they happen. Mr. Levitt is a 
lawyer. I am particularly interested in where you think some of 
our agencies might have a more robust role than they are 
presently exercising, like for instance our friends at the 
Department of Justice. And I will ask you about that in a 
minute, and give you the closing words.
    But I also want to point out that--as I sort of step back 
and observe this phenomenon of concern about pharmacy benefit 
managers--while it is possible that big pharma and big PBMs are 
orchestrating high prices that they can share, they are not 
doing their jobs about proper pricing.
    I think there is also a bit of competition going on here, 
and that big pharma would like nothing more than to have the 
American concern about their prices be diverted to concern 
about PBM behavior, so that we take our eye off the ball of how 
big pharma is pricing its products.
    I think the window we created in the Inflation Reduction 
Act to actually start real negotiations and get a bit of a 
better look under the hood is going to help cure that problem. 
But I urge all of my colleagues not to take our eye off the 
ball of pharma pricing as we look into the question of PBM 
behavior. And with that, Mr. Levitt, back to you on where you 
think the executive branch of government could be operating 
more effectively in this space, and how.
    Mr. Levitt. I think PBMs, for one of the things they do--
they earn, it has been called an administrative fee and a data 
fee--there is a safe harbor for those fees. There is a law 
about that. In order to be safe in that harbor, these PBMs are 
supposed to follow the rules, and they are not following the 
rules, because these are 
percentage-based fees that they are taking.
    I also think the executive branch should take a look at the 
Medicare bids submitted by these prescription drug plans. We 
talked a lot here about the different pricing. There was a 
cancer drug mentioned that was a couple of thousand dollars 
versus a generic--a nonprofit company had a generic that was a 
couple of hundred dollars.
    I think that when you bid, when these prescription drug 
plans bid Medicare, somebody should look at those bids. They 
should compare to things like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs, or 
this private company that has very cheap drugs.
    So I think looking at safe harbors, looking at the bids, 
and I think that DOJ absolutely should take a look at rebate 
aggregators, to see just how much money is being pulled out, 
especially when it relates to Medicare Part D.
    Senator Whitehouse. When you say take a look at the 
Medicare bids, you are meaning a very practical look comparing 
what the bid is for this particular drug in isolation against 
similar drugs or treatments--or perhaps other bids that they 
have made in other places, just to give a reality check that it 
is for real?
    Mr. Levitt. Exactly.
    Senator Whitehouse. Okay. Thank you very much.
    Thanks, Chairman Crapo.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
    Senator Lankford?
    Senator Lankford. Thanks. Thanks for the marathon that you 
all are on at this point today. You are crossing the 2-hour 
mark of us pummeling you with questions. Let me pummel you with 
a few more on this.
    Mr. Levitt, I am going to come back to you because you are 
sufficiently warmed up there on it, and it is the issue of 
tiering that has come in. This is an area that I have been 
working on for a while. The drug companies complain about the 
PBMs until they cooperate with them for tiering. When it is 
time for a drug to go generic, once the generic is about to be 
released, the PBM and the branded drug, they negotiate together 
some way to get a higher rebate fee if they will put the 
generic drug on the branded tier.
    That means the copay for the consumer is more, and it also 
is a higher cost for Medicare at that point. This has been an 
issue. They are literally driving generic companies out and 
driving the prices higher for the consumer. At the same time, 
the PBM will come back and say, ``We are negotiating to get 
better prices for the consumer,'' when they are actually not. 
Where am I wrong on this?
    Mr. Levitt. I can see no fault in any of that logic.
    Senator Lankford. Okay. So how do we, how do we solve this?
    Mr. Levitt. Earlier we talked about accountability. I am 
not sure who is looking at these formularies. I mean, if it is 
a Medicare formulary, I think CMS has outsourced Medicare to 
these private companies--completely outsourced, with very 
little oversight. So I think that CMS should look hard at this 
tiering issue you talked about.
    Also, honestly, in this self-funded plan space, I think big 
employer groups need to more carefully examine what their 
contracts say and what PBMs are doing.
    Senator Lankford. Okay. I would also--let me add one more 
element as well. There have been some studies and some 
conversations about what PBMs do to independent pharmacies, 
especially with the DIR fees, with the new quality basis that 
they literally invent every month or quarter.
    They will retroactively change all their requirements on 
them. But it has been remarkable to me how many independent 
pharmacists have told me the same crazy story, that they get a 
change in quality, they get a drive-down in price, and then 
within about 2 weeks, they will get a call from one of the PBM-
owned pharmacies saying, ``Hey, we are trying to expand into 
your area. Would you like to merge into our pharmacy? Would you 
like to become one of us?''
    So my challenge is in a couple of ways. What PBMs are 
doing, I believe, is actually driving our independent 
pharmacies and our rural pharmacies into submission or gone 
from there, and that is a real problem.
    The second thing we have seen is, even VA recently 
cooperating with a PBM to basically cut off thousands of rural 
pharmacies around the country and say, ``You are no longer 
going to do VA benefits. You have to do mail order through our 
PBM to be able to do it,'' which will kill our pharmacies.
    Have you seen this as just independent stories, or has 
anyone seen this as an actual trend that is going on?
    Mr. Levitt. The story told about PBMs aggressively auditing 
an independent pharmacy and then offering to buy that pharmacy, 
I have seen that for 10 years. I have seen that trend.
    The irony also, Senator, is that when PBMs buy these 
pharmacies, they are literally buying them with their own 
money, because PBMs have the DIR fees that are pure profit, and 
it has fueled this proliferation of PBMs buying up pharmacies.
    The thing about the VA and TRICARE, I think--you know, I 
looked at those. Whatever information is public about the 
TRICARE bid I was able to see. There were two PBMs that bid for 
the TRICARE business. That is one of the biggest contracts in 
the country. I cannot figure that out, but someone has got to 
look at that.
    Senator Lankford. That is worth a follow-up from there. The 
question is out there always. When we talk to any of the PBMs 
and we say we need greater transparency--we need to know more 
about the pharmacy reimbursement, the manufacturer rebates, we 
need that--their response is always the same: ``Well, that is 
going to hurt the consumer. If we give you greater 
transparency, the consumer is going to be hurt.'' Now, we never 
get an answer of what that really means. Where are they coming 
from on that, and does it really hurt the consumer if there is 
greater transparency in the PBMs? I will let anyone answer that 
who wants to be able to answer that. Dr. Burns?
    Dr. Burns. Well, there is plenty of research that shows 
when you start mandating transparency, especially of prices, 
there is always a danger of collusion among the people who are 
revealing those prices. So you always have to watch out for 
that.
    And studies show that a lot of the transparency movement, 
which has been going on for 20 years, has not really benefited 
consumers, because most consumers do not know what to do with 
the information.
    Senator Lankford. Right. The challenge that we have is, 
obviously, the consumer is paying a higher price, and we all 
know it. The spread pricing is real; we all know it. The 
percentages that are being paid is a very real issue. The 
rebates are not going back to the consumer.
    We all know all those things, and any time we try to step 
in and say, ``Okay, so let us provide some transparency to find 
out how many dollars are there,'' they are like, ``Oh, that is 
going to hurt the consumer,'' as if everything they are already 
doing is not hurting the consumer. But suddenly that piece 
becomes oh, that is going to be bad for the consumer.
    So this is an issue I am glad this committee is taking on. 
I am glad you all are here. We have a lot more work to do. We 
discussed this 4 years ago and have done nothing about it so 
far. I am grateful to the Biden administration and CMS in some 
of the things that they are currently doing on DIR fees to step 
in, but it is not far enough.
    And we have some additional work to do in this area. So I 
appreciate all the preparation that you all made for this 
hearing. I am grateful we are having it. Thank you all.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
    Senator Warren?
    Senator Warren. Thank you, Mr. Acting Chair.
    So last year, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, 
which finally gives HHS the authority to negotiate drug prices 
for a select number of high-priced brand-name drugs. This is a 
significant achievement, and one that drug companies paid their 
lobbyists about $150 million to avoid. That is one of the 
signals that it probably will have some effect.
    Despite these wins, there is more that we need to do to 
reduce exorbitant drug prices for all Americans, and that 
includes taking a hard look at the pharmacy benefit managers 
that we have been talking about, the PBMs that negotiate 
discounts from manufacturers on behalf of insurance plans, 
putting upward pressure on list prices.
    But we also cannot lose sight of the ways that drug 
companies continue to abuse our intellectual property laws to 
drive out competition, to jack up prices, and to protect their 
profits. So, in a competitive market, we would expect to see a 
lot of patent applications for new drugs as companies race to 
invent the next blockbuster product.
    Professor Feldman, does that describe the patent landscape 
for pharmaceuticals right now?
    Ms. Feldman. Senator, that is not really what we are seeing 
right now. Companies are largely recycling and repurposing 
existing drugs today. To cite one study, 78 percent of the 
drugs associated with new patents are not new drugs coming on 
the market; they are existing ones.
    Senator Warren. Wow.
    Ms. Feldman. We are seeing a lot of churn.
    Senator Warren. So, think about that. More than three out 
of four new patent applications for pharmaceuticals are for 
existing drugs, which means adding new patents for things like 
new formulations or manufacturing methods, or even certain 
restrictions on a drug, but not actually for new drug 
compounds, new drugs into the field.
    So let us say that a drug company manufactures a pill and 
the patent for this pill is just about to expire. Instead of 
facing competition, the company decides it will make the 
delayed release version of the drug, so that it goes into 
effect just a little while after the pill is ingested. Even 
though it is the exact same drug, the company patents the new 
formulation and then removes the original from the market. Ms. 
Feldman, could that restart the clock on the drug's monopoly 
protections?
    Ms. Feldman. Yes. That would effectively restart the clock.
    Senator Warren. Okay. So drug companies use these tricks, 
and a lot of others, to keep their monopolies and keep pushing 
prices higher and higher and higher. Now the Inflation 
Reduction Act exempts drugs from Medicare negotiation for the 
first 7 or 11 years, depending on the kind of drug, following 
that initial approval.
    Recognizing the potential for gaming, CMS has issued 
guidance saying it will use the earliest approval of all the 
formulations of a drug to determine its eligibility for the 
program. Professor Feldman, without this step, could drug 
companies use these patent tricks to ensure that their drugs 
never become eligible for the Medicare negotiation provision in 
the IRA?
    Ms. Feldman. Product hopping is a serious concern with 
regulations like that. The CMS guidance is a very important 
step for ensuring that companies cannot evade the impact of the 
law by simply changing the packaging of the drug or shifting 
from 20 milligrams to 40 milligrams.
    Senator Warren. Wow. Well, you know, we must ensure that 
drug companies do not rely on tricks in order to avoid 
competition. I support this step from CMS. I am glad to hear 
that you do. But the administration can do more to limit patent 
abuses without Congress, and they can do it for a wider range 
of drugs than just the handful of drugs that are currently 
subject to Medicare negotiations.
    We need to scrutinize the PBMs, but using existing 
administrative tools to end abusive drug company monopolies 
would give patients faster, broader relief from high drug 
prices.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. Have you completed your time?
    Senator Warren. I have.
    The Chairman. All right.
    Senator Blackburn?
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you 
all for being here today.
    I want to return to this issue of patient steering. I think 
that--and I know that Senator Lankford touched on that, and I 
constantly hear from Tennesseans how frustrated they are with 
the PBMs.
    You know, in all transparency, I would do away with the 
PBMs. I think they are unnecessary, and when patients are being 
steered, when patients are not able to reap the benefit of that 
reduced price and they continue to pay higher prices, it is 
something that is very difficult.
    I looked at the Ohio suit. I think, Mr. Levitt, your 
testimony had referenced that, and I know Kroger's chief 
medical officer lives in Nashville. You know, when they cannot 
turn a profit and the PBMs have muddied the process and they 
are pushing that business offshore, I think that it is 
difficult.
    Mr. Levitt, let me come to you on that. Let's talk for a 
little bit on what this does to Medicare and Medicaid, when you 
have this steering that is going on, because you have people in 
rural Tennessee that this is happening to, and then they have 
no access. So I would love to hear just a touch from you on 
that. Time is limited.
    Mr. Levitt. Under Medicare Part D, there is a Federal ``any 
willing provider'' law, that is----
    Senator Blackburn. That is my next question, so let's go 
ahead and hit that, because you know, we have any willing 
provider in Tennessee, which limits the PBMs. And so, should we 
just blanket that federally?
    Mr. Levitt. Yes. It is good Federal law, and Tennessee, you 
have actually passed one of the strongest State any willing 
provider laws in the country, which is phenomenal for practices 
and pharmacies in your State. The steering is terrible, 
particularly for sick patients, the sickest patients like 
cancer patients.
    We have examples in your State where a patient who has the 
choice to go to the oncologist that they want to get the drug 
from, is steered to a PBM-owned specialty pharmacy, and then 
they just get this oral oncolytic, which is a dangerous drug, 
in the mail. It is terrible for patient care.
    Senator Blackburn. Well, we think it is too, and we think 
that any willing provider has helped in so many instances.
    Let us continue down this same chain, because with a lot of 
our community health centers, what we hear is that the PBMs get 
in here and it really compromises the availability of 
pharmaceuticals and cramps the community health centers on 
patient care, and I would love to hear you comment for a moment 
on that.
    Mr. Levitt. Are these Federally Qualified Health Centers?
    Senator Blackburn. Yes, and community health centers in 
rural areas, yes.
    Mr. Levitt. I am not an expert on the Federally Qualified 
Health Centers.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Well, with our community health 
centers in rural areas, does anybody else want to weigh in on 
that because--go ahead, Ms. Feldman.
    Ms. Feldman. Sure. I just want to talk about what is 
happening with the community pharmacies.
    Senator Blackburn. Yes.
    Ms. Feldman. One of the techniques we have talked about in 
the hearing is clawbacks; so with that, the PBM actually asks 
for money back from the pharmacy. Sometimes the pharmacist 
loses money on the transaction. Now if a PBM owns the pharmacy, 
money is just going from one pocket into the other; it does not 
matter. But for a community pharmacist, it can drive them out 
of business. These are the types of techniques that are 
reducing the number of community pharmacies we have and 
limiting patient choice and access to medicine.
    Senator Blackburn. Well, and also what we are seeing is 
because PBMs have a role, what is happening is, we have 
lessened the 340B programs. That is something that when you 
have 230 health centers, community health centers, in your 
State, and you have the PBMs stepping in, it hurts the 340B 
programs that they have, because basically you are taking those 
savings away.
    I know there has been a lot of talk about vertical 
integration today, and we have monitored that. I will tell you, 
we are quite concerned about what we see there, because any 
time you have another step in that vertical integration, what 
you end up seeing is higher prices for consumers, and then you 
have less access, and it convolutes the market.
    So, thank you all for being here today.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. All right. I understand that Senator Johnson 
is either on his way or he would like to have us to hold for 
him. All right, let us--is Johnson's staff here? Is that the 
desire of the Senator? Okay. Well then, I will kind of jump the 
wrap-up and give you kind of my thoughts here about what we 
would like to work with you all on, and put it this way.
    I am heading back to Oregon in a few hours, and then over 
the next 10 days or so I am going to be having town hall 
meetings across my State, primarily in rural areas. We have 
them open to all. You can ask anything you want. I have had 
1,045 of them in my time in office. It is something I pledged 
in every county every year, to throw open the doors.
    People care a whole lot about this matter of getting mugged 
at the pharmacy counter. They do not get it, and they look at 
the prices around the world, and several of my colleagues 
compared them to other countries, and they certainly do not get 
all the medical lingo that we have been speaking about today. 
Rebates, DIR fees, putting things in hoppers, or hopping around 
or some such thing; people do not get that kind of thing. But 
they do understand these examples where what you are seeing 
just defies common sense and fairness. Whatever it was, a 
couple of hours ago, I cited this example of Civica and how it 
affects Part D, which is Medicare, you know.
    I am one of the people who voted for Part D. I got a lot of 
flak for voting for Part D. I thought it was important to get 
started, because it covered people and helped people, but 
clearly has not done enough for cost containment. What we were 
told again a couple of hours ago is Civica, a nonprofit, sells 
a generic prostate drug for $160.
    The average price that PBMs charge Medicare Part D plans 
for the exact same drug is over $3,000, and yet Civica cannot 
get the big three PBMs to cover the drug. So that means that 
people on Medicare and taxpayers are paying for medicine that 
is marked up almost 2,000 percent.
    So, I am going to take that home, and I am going to go into 
these rural communities, bright red politically, and they are 
going to want something done about this. They are going to want 
something done about this. I think while I wait for my 
colleague and I am wrapping this up, I would be interested--we 
can go down the panel.
    What do you think--if you could do one thing going forward, 
just one thing to end something that is so unconscionable, you 
know, taxpayers, seniors facing a 2,000-percent markup--and 
this is not kind of some abstract theory, this is what we were 
given as an example, to highlight today how Medicare Part D 
gets hammered.
    Medicare is our flagship health program, and we have a lot 
of challenges in demographics, given the number of people who 
turn 65 every day. So, we will wait for Senator Johnson, but I 
think I would be interested----
    We will start with Ms. Feldman, but everybody, as we wrap 
up after 3 hours, everybody take a crack at your idea, because 
I can tell you what we are going to do during our work period 
at home. Our staffs, Democratic and Republican, are going to be 
talking among themselves so we can see if we can go from the 
constructive discussion with all of you and with the members, 
and really come up with practical steps for what to do.
    So why don't you all just go right down? You have one crack 
at dealing with that outrageous example of the nonprofit versus 
what PBMs charge Medicare, and then when Senator Johnson comes, 
we will break for that. We will start with you, Ms. Feldman, 
and we will go down the row.
    Ms. Feldman. Sir, may I offer you one other example to take 
back to your constituents?
    The Chairman. Yes. But I think I would rather get----
    Ms. Feldman. To the one.
    The Chairman. Yes. I would rather get--here comes Senator 
Johnson.
    Ms. Feldman. Ahh.
    The Chairman. And that gives you more time to think, okay? 
Senator Johnson is going to use his time for questions, and 
then I will not be doing any more speechifying, other than to 
hear your response to what I asked.
    Senator Johnson?
    Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for 
holding this hearing. This has been fascinating. I wish I could 
have spent more time here, but I did hear the testimony.
    Dr. Burns, I always like starting out with the macro, okay? 
Let us take a look at the overall industry.
    The latest information I have according to the AMA, in 2021 
we spent about $4.3 trillion on health care. Is that----
    Dr. Burns. We are over $4 trillion, that is correct.
    Senator Johnson. And also, about $577 billion on 
pharmaceuticals--gross total?
    Dr. Burns. It depends on how you measure retail versus 
institutional.
    Senator Johnson. So what do you think the number is?
    Dr. Burns. Well, if you look just at the retail numbers 
that come out of CMS, people will say, well, it is about 10 
percent, 11 percent of health-care spending. But if you throw 
in the institutional side of it, the drugs that are used in 
hospitals, you could get up to 15 or 16 percent of national 
health care.
    Senator Johnson. So about a half-trillion dollars or 
somewhere in the ballpark. What do you think the after-tax 
profitability in total of that amount is?
    Dr. Burns. Well, it varies by sector. There are----
    Senator Johnson. I understand. But I mean in total, would 
you say--again, total industry after-tax profitability probably 
averages about 5 percent. Well, let us say with drugs more, 
maybe it might be 10 percent.
    Dr. Burns. Why not? The pharmaceutical companies and the 
medical device companies clean up.
    Senator Johnson. Okay. So would it be----
    Dr. Burns. They are in the low 20-percent range.
    Senator Johnson. Okay. So again, I am talking about after 
tax, because let us face it----
    Dr. Burns. Sure.
    Senator Johnson [continuing]. The tax the government 
collects goes right back into our coffers as well.
    Dr. Burns. Yes.
    Senator Johnson. So, but let us say it is 20 percent on a 
half-trillion dollars. That is about $100 billion on a total 
spend in health care of about $4.3 trillion. So we are talking 
somewhere 2, 2\1/2\ percent in terms of profitability of the 
drugs, in terms of our overall health-care spending.
    I make the point because it is easy for us to zero in on a 
particular problem. Again, I think PBMs--this is a really 
interesting hearing, okay? But if you eliminate all the 
profitability and all the incentives for creating new drugs, 
you have not really made a dent in our health-care spend. Is 
that pretty accurate?
    Dr. Burns. Well, the real issue now facing the Part D plans 
and their beneficiaries is the high-cost specialty drugs, for 
which there are no competitors, and that is where the elderly 
are getting creamed----
    Senator Johnson. Right.
    Dr. Burns [continuing]. In terms of their out-of-pocket 
cost. What we need there is more competition among those sorts 
of manufacturers.
    Senator Johnson. There you go. Do we not also need more 
consumer involvement? I think, Dr. Gibbs, you were talking in 
your testimony that unlike every other product--and that may be 
a little bit too broad--but like almost every other product in 
our economy, we do not know what things cost in drugs. And 
again, I think that is a generally true statement, but I guess 
I would argue that the reason for that is because of the third-
party payer system, where consumers pay about 10 percent of all 
of our goods and services in health care--10 percent.
    Nobody cares what any of this stuff costs. If they did, you 
would have price transparency just through the marketplace; 
correct? I mean, does anybody want to disagree with that? How 
about the attorney who sues these guys?
    Dr. Burns. I would totally agree with it, and if 
everybody's covered by insurance--and more than 90 percent of 
the population are--they do not really care about the cost.
    Senator Johnson. So the solution, again--you know, I would 
argue the biggest problem with PBMs is we have Medicare and 
their formularies, and it makes it so unbelievably complex. I 
am an accountant, okay? I actually understand numbers. I 
understand. I have had people try to explain this to me like 
Professor Burns. You have written books on this stuff, and you 
are just sort of kind of getting your arms around this, okay?
    Markets are complex. If you let in the competitive market 
system with consumers participating in it, you will get price 
transparency just as a natural part of it, as opposed to trying 
to suss it out through government regulations, which we have 
been trying to do, and it just does not work.
    Dr. Burns. Well, as I wrote in the textbook I published 2 
years ago, consumers and consumer literacy just have not shown 
up yet.
    Senator Johnson. So we do want drug companies to produce 
new molecules to save lives. I mean, we want that R&D. So there 
has to be a profit motive in there. One thing that I found out 
during the pandemic is how completely unlevel the playing field 
is between generics and the patentable drugs.
    Part of the problem is, now it has to be random control 
trials as the only standard. They will not accept observational 
meta-analysis of that. So the playing field is totally tipped 
towards patentable drugs.
    So all these molecules that are there, doctors oftentimes 
cannot use. And of course we found with some generic drugs 
that, in my experience working with the doctors worked really 
well in COVID, were not allowed, and I am highly concerned. I 
have actually--I am the author of Right to Try. I have also 
authored another bill now, Right to Treat.
    It should not be necessary, but can I get just your opinion 
in terms of allowing doctors to use their medical judgment? 
Something like 20 percent of all drugs are prescribed off 
label. That is how you get generic drugs more readily used, 
more looked at by the medical profession, and hopefully with 
more observational studies to prove their efficacy or if there 
are problems with them.
    I mean, we have got to produce research on generics and try 
and use those as much as possible. Does anybody want to argue 
with that?
    Dr. Burns. I totally agree. The last thing you want to do 
is 
second-guess what the doctors are doing at the bedside or the 
point of care. The thing I would have mentioned is that it is 
not necessarily patentable versus generic drugs. We oftentimes 
have a lot of biological drugs, specialty medicines that are 
off patent, and the price increases continue there because 
there are no effective competitors.
    Senator Johnson. Yes. So again, I am a private-sector guy. 
Competition solves an awful lot of problems, and we just do not 
have the competition, and certainly not in the PBM markets.
    So again, I really, really do appreciate all your testimony 
here. This is very interesting. I wish it was a little bit 
clearer than mud. Maybe I missed some stuff and maybe you 
clarified this entire issue. But again, I will point out again 
the marketplace, the third-party payer system, those are at 
odds in terms of transparency, and that is what we really need 
to move toward.
    So thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Ms. Feldman, my apologies. I think I did not look down at 
the name tags earlier. We are glad you are here.
    Everybody, take one crack at what you would say to the fact 
that there is nearly a 2,000-percent markup, a markup that hits 
seniors, hits Part D, hits taxpayers, and ought to be a 
symbol--and I can just tell you, I am going to go out and have 
all these town hall meetings, and I am going to hold that up.
    Because that is the real world today of people getting 
clobbered. I have to hear all the lingo about, you know, 
rebates and exotic fees and all the rest. It is about a markup 
of 2,000 percent--2,000 percent--that hits seniors and hits 
taxpayers, and it ought to be something that we use as kind of 
a theme to get this thing fixed.
    Ms. Feldman, right down the line. Everybody gets one idea 
to put into this, and we are going to have to build a 
coalition. Senator Johnson was not here when we talked about 
it. Senator Crapo and I said we are going to take the best 
ideas from both sides. Staffs are going to work on it over 
these 2 weeks, and we are just going to keep our foot to the 
pedal, because I think this is a good hearing.
    I did not hear a bad question in the house, to tell you the 
truth, from my colleagues; I thought your answers were 
thoughtful. So we are going to dig in here.
    Ms. Feldman, start us off. Your one answer to this 
challenge.
    Ms. Feldman. Perverse incentives happen when interests are 
not aligned. The PBMs' interests are not aligned with the 
patient, so make sure the duties are clear about what they have 
to do.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Dr. Van Nuys?
    Dr. Van Nuys. I am going to go back to that Federal 
benchmark of prices across different transaction points in the 
supply chain. Like we have NADAC, make those public in other 
places in the supply chain, so we can tell whether that 2,000-
percent markup is happening in the spread, or is it happening 
in the specialty pharmacy.
    The Chairman. Making it public?
    Dr. Van Nuys. Yes.
    The Chairman. The information in the supply chain.
    Dr. Van Nuys. Yes, exactly.
    The Chairman. Okay, good.
    Dr. Burns?
    Dr. Burns. Yes. I would fix Part D, two things in Part D. 
One is, the prices that are paid ought to be pegged to net 
prices, not list prices. Secondly, health plans need to have 
more skin in the game, more fiscal responsibility in the 
catastrophic phase.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Mr. Levitt?
    Mr. Levitt. More transparency for the PBMs, more 
transparency for the rebate aggregators, on both the spread 
pricing on the drug side, and the rebate side as well.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Dr. Gibbs?
    Dr. Gibbs. I agree with Dr. Van Nuys once again. The price 
should be made public and everyone should be able to see it at 
any time.
    The Chairman. Okay. Here is what we are going to do. We are 
going to--and by the way, it is a practice of the committee to 
hold the record open for, it will be 5 days, I believe, and 
Senators can--is that the correct number of days?
    The Hearing Clerk. A business week, yes.
    The Chairman. A business week. We will hold the record open 
for members to offer their questions. Those of you who want to 
submit additional information, please feel free to do so. This 
has been a good hearing. I want us to look back and say that 
today was the day that we started to get this fixed. I will 
welcome your ideas and suggestions. The stakes are high, and I 
thank you for participating.
    And with that, the Finance Committee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:35 p.m., the hearing was concluded.]

 Prepared Statement of Lawton Robert Burns, Ph.D., MBA, James Joo-Jin 
  Kim Professor, Professor of Health Care Management, Wharton School, 
                       University of Pennsylvania
                              introduction
    Good morning, Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of 
the committee. Thank you for inviting me to address the role of PBMs in 
the prescription drug supply chain. My name is Robert Burns, and I am a 
management and strategy professor specializing in health care at the 
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. My research and teaching 
examine how the entire U.S. health-care ecosystem operates; I have 
taught an Introductory Course on this material for nearly 4 decades at 
three business schools. I have also recently written a textbook on the 
topic.\1\ Another part of my research agenda examines how the 
institutional and retail supply chains work in the health-care 
ecosystem; I have examined these supply chains since the mid-1990s and 
written two books on them.\2\<SUP>,</SUP> \3\

    To paraphrase Mark Antony in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar,\4\ I come 
here today not to praise PBMs but to bury some concerns about them. My 
testimony covers three topics. Part I explains the operations of 
intermediaries (i.e., ``middlemen'') in health-care supply chains and 
demystify their role. Part II explains why pharmacy benefit managers 
(PBMs) are not the drivers of the rising prices of brand drugs, as many 
allege. Part III explains the growing trend of vertical integration in 
the retail pharmaceutical supply chain and explores its possible 
impacts.

about Mark Anthony, J Lo's third husband. Their last names are spelled

and first-hand experience with the health-care ecosystem since my 
doctoral training in late 1970s. They do not necessarily represent the 
views of the Wharton School.
          part i: dark territory: lifting the veil on pbms \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ This section draws on Chapter 14 of The Healthcare Value Chain: 
Demystifying the Roles of GPOs and PBMs (Palgrave Macmillan, 2022). It 
also draws on an article I recently wrote in The Hill, ``What History 
Tells Us About Your Prescription Costs and the New `Bad Boys' of Health 
Care'' (March 22, 2023).

    ``Dark Territory'' describes a section of railroad track not 
controlled by any signals. There are safety concerns due to the absence 
of train detection. There is a lessened ability to detect misalignment 
in track switches, broken rails, or runaway rail cars. It is dark and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
mysterious.

    Health care's version of dark territory consists of intermediaries 
that connect buyers and sellers. Often, these intermediaries are widely 
mistrusted and vilified. They seem out of control, lack transparency 
and Federal regulation, act in ways that reportedly threaten patient 
safety, make a lot of money without making anything, and are viewed 
with suspicion. During the 1990s, health maintenance organizations 
(HMOs) constituted the dark territory. The criticisms of the HMOs back 
then pale in comparison with the invective leveled over the past 2 
decades at two other intermediaries: group purchasing organizations 
(GPOs) and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Like the late comedian 
Rodney Dangerfield, ``they get no respect.'' Worse yet, they serve as 
the ``whipping boys'' of health care who take the rap for others.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ ``Whipping Boys'' is not a derogatory term. It refers to the 
use of stand-ins who were punished for the wrongdoings of the princes 
that were heir to the throne of the Tudor and Stuart kings of England. 
It was bad optics to whip the heirs, so childhood friends who were 
educated alongside them served as the substitutes. A synonym for 
whipping boy is scapegoat.

    Last year, I published a 650-page volume that takes readers through 
this dark territory.\7\ Here, I focus my remarks on the PBMs. The 
allegations against PBMs include: monopoly power, anticompetitive 
behavior, collusion with manufacturers, exclusive contracts, financial 
ties with suppliers that mitigate search for the best products at the 
lowest cost, reduced provider discretion and patient access to needed 
medicines, conflicts of interest, preoccupation with growing revenues, 
excessive fees and profits, kickbacks, secret rebates, lack of full 
disclosure, harms to patient quality, and higher consumer costs. Most 
of these allegations can usually be found in just a single newspaper 
story, book chapter, or industry report. Needless to say, the authors 
of such stories rarely ``go deep'' into any of these allegations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Lawton Robert Burns. The Healthcare Value Chain: Demystifying 
the Roles of GPOs and PBMs (Palgrave Macmillan, 2022).

    I approach these issues through the lens of ``critical thinking.'' 
I teach my undergraduate courses at Wharton using the Socratic Method: 
I show students an argument that someone has proposed, and then get 
them to first ask the question, ``Is What I Just Heard Really True?'' I 
then spend the course training students to evaluate such proposed 
arguments using published research evidence (both pro and con) to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
thereby answer the question.

    My book evaluates the claims advanced by GPO critics against 
several bodies of evidence. These include (1) the historical PBM 
chronicle, (2) the agency role that PBMs play on behalf of insurers, 
(3) the documented tradeoffs that PBMs make regarding access, cost, and 
quality while serving their insurer clients, (4) the growing 
concentration in U.S. health care, and (5) the existential threat of 
supplier consolidation. I conclude that PBMs are nowhere near the 
villains their critics have painted them to be. They perhaps deserve a 
bit more thanks for the roles they perform. One should remember that 
the Kaiser Permanente health plans of today that policy-makers laud as 
solutions to population health and the triple aim were the whipping 
boys in earlier decades.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ For a positive view of Kaiser today, see: Donald Berwick, 
Thomas Nolan, and John Whittington. ``The Triple Aim: Care, Health, and 
Cost,'' Health Affairs 27(3) (2008): 759-769. Less than 100 years ago, 
however, Kaiser and other prepaid health plans were viewed as 
``dangerous deviations from accepted forms of practice.'' See Patricia 
Spain Ward. ``United States versus American Medical Association et al.: 
The Medical Antitrust Case of 1938-1943,'' American Studies 30(2) 
(1989): 123-153.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          some history lessons
    PBM critics rarely bother to examine their history. The narrative 
has (until now) never been pulled together from archival and eyewitness 
sources, which requires a lot of homework. As former President Harry 
Truman said, ``the only thing new in the world is the history you don't 
know.'' My recent book devotes two chapters and 115 pages to this 
chronicle. The lessons from this narrative do not support the 
allegations and conclusions of the critics.
Like GPOs, PBMs Have Historically Served the Interests of Local 
        Providers and Health Plans
    The early PBMs began as local cooperatives providing medical and 
pharmaceutical services to community members through prepaid groups on 
a capitated basis. They were less health-care insurance and more 
health-care assurance providers. They were typically organized around 
HMOs that provided both medical and pharmacy benefits to cover the 
total health-care needs of their enrollees under an affordable budget. 
The early PBMs were thus tied to health insurers, just like they are 
today.

    Today, following the decline of HMOs, PBMs serve insurers and 
providers of health services but neither supply these services nor 
charge for them. They are at least one or more degrees of separation 
from where health-care costs and quality are rendered. Efforts by 
critics to lay the responsibility for rising health-care costs or harms 
to patient quality at the feet of the PBMs are misguided.
PBM Leverage Over Product Suppliers
    PBMs sought to amass purchasing volume to negotiate lower prices 
from product manufacturers. HMO-PBMs combined the prescription orders 
of scores (and then hundreds) of physicians on their medical staffs. 
Both routed these orders through a centralized negotiating hub to 
contract as ``one'' with manufacturers. The game has always been one of 
``leverage'' over suppliers to exchange higher buyer volume for lower 
unit price. This game became more important for survival and customer 
service with intensification of input cost pressures and/or 
reimbursement pressures. When squeezed downstream, PBMs sought to 
squeeze drug manufacturers upstream.
PBMs Subject to Considerable Federal Oversight
    Both GPO and PBM intermediaries have been subjected to considerable 
scrutiny by the U.S. Congress (House and Senate hearings), the 
Congressional Budget Office, and various Federal Agencies such as the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Office of The Inspector General 
(OIG). Such scrutiny led to the development of ``codes of conduct'' for 
both intermediaries during 2004 to 2005. None of this scrutiny has 
since resulted in any subsequent change in legislation or regulatory 
oversight of either intermediary. This latter point suggests that the 
codes of conduct may have served their purpose, as some research 
suggests.
PBMs Have Utilized Many of the Same Contracting Tools for Decades
    Certain PBM (and GPO) practices have irritated their critics in the 
new millennium. For PBMs, they include drug formularies, contract 
administration fees (CAFs) paid by manufacturers, discounts and rebates 
from manufacturers, narrow pharmacy networks, and spread pricing.

    What critics fail to realize is that most of these contracting 
tools have long been in place without causing an uproar. That is likely 
because these tools served the economic interests of their sponsoring 
organizations downstream (health plans), who developed them to deal 
with competitive and reimbursement pressures. Just like many contracts 
between buyers and sellers in the private sector, PBM contracts are 
never publicly disclosed in order to encourage price discounting by 
manufacturers (and inhibit any collusion among them).
PBM Business Models Have Changed Over Time
    Finally, the historical narrative demonstrates that the business 
models and revenue sources of these intermediaries have changed over 
time. PBMs are now heavily focused on the dispensing of specialty 
drugs, as are other players in the health-care ecosystem. Yet, PBM 
critics continue to attack them regarding strategies heavily pursued in 
the past, particularly manufacturer rebates and pharmacy network 
management. Although still a sizeable portion of their revenues, such 
strategies and revenue sources are on the wane.
               pbms' agency role in serving health plans
    PBMs seek to exert leverage over suppliers, not over their health 
plan sponsors. Their actions are thus consistent with being ``agents.'' 
Surveys of health plans confirm this agency role via high satisfaction 
levels and a concordance in their goals and interests. As further 
evidence of this agency role:

     Suppliers have been historically skeptical of intermediaries 
like PBMs;
     Suppliers have sought to render them ineffective;
     Suppliers do not contract with PBMs when they do not have to 
(due to lack of competition);
     The relationships between suppliers and these intermediaries are 
characterized as ``adversarial''; and
     Suppliers raise prices unilaterally ``because they can,'' which 
the PBM intermediaries seek to counteract.
     PBMs believe that supplier competition is always in their 
interest.
                    tradeoffs: the name of the game
    Economics and the entire health-care ecosystem are all about 
tradeoffs.\9\ For example, when one examines the different health plans 
that employers offer workers, those plans that offer a wider choice of 
providers (more open-network models such as preferred provider 
organizations, or PPOs) come with higher premiums--that is, PPOs trade 
off wider access for higher cost.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ Lawton Robert Burns. The U.S. Healthcare Ecosystem (New York: 
McGraw-Hill, 2021): Chapter 2.

    The same tradeoffs factor into the strategies employed by PBMs. 
PBMs (in partnership with health plans) have developed formulary tiers 
that allow plan participants to access the drug(s) they prefer at the 
cost they can afford. PBMs do not dictate the choice to their plan 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
enrollees.

    Product quality is, nevertheless, evident in the decisions made by 
health plan pharmacy and therapeutics committees. Such committees are 
heavily comprised of clinicians (physicians, nurses, pharmacists) who 
focus primarily on product quality, not on product cost. In other 
words, these committee mechanisms represent local-level decisions by 
clinicians on the types of products they want. PBMs are not in the 
business of telling doctors what they can or cannot order or prescribe. 
To the extent the product choice set is limited, it usually reflects 
committee (peer) assessments of what are comparable, therapeutically 
equivalent products with no evidence base to differentiate them.

    Another area where strategic tradeoffs are evident is national 
versus local. The GPOs began as local cooperatives and developed 
contracts for local membership. The proximity and small membership size 
made it fairly easy to decide upon products and manufacturers to 
contract with. As they grew, however, the regional and (then) national 
GPOs faced increasing difficulty in developing contracts that all of 
their members wanted. The GPOs therefore embarked on several strategies 
that allowed members to customize contracts to suit local needs and 
clinician preferences, including regional GPO affiliates, assistance 
with custom contracting, contracting tiers, etc. The goal was to 
balance the economic leverage of centralized buying with access to 
desired products at the local level. PBMs have engaged in similar 
tradeoffs. They, along with their health plan sponsors, have developed 
national drug formularies than can be tailored or disregarded by health 
plans at the local level.
                             consolidation
    PBMs have come under fire for being concentrated sectors in which a 
small number of intermediaries manage the vast bulk of sales. This 
observation is correct. But then critics extrapolate to conclude that 
these huge oligopolies raise costs, harm their own members, and engage 
in anti-competitive practices that harm the public's welfare.

    The evidence base refutes all of these charges. First, PBMs help 
their health plan clients by negotiating lower input prices and serve 
as their agents. Second, there has been no Federal antitrust 
enforcement activity brought against these parties since the early 
2000s. There has also been a vastly reduced number of lawsuits filed 
against them since they adopted codes of conduct in the mid-2000s. 
Third, the entire health-care ecosystem and nearly all the 
intermediaries in the supply chain have grown more concentrated. For 
some reason, however, critics do not usually complain about the 
oligopolies among pharmacies, pharmaceutical wholesalers, and specialty 
distributors. If one really wants to start pointing fingers at the 
biggest culprits in consolidation and rising cost, one does not have to 
look very far: large hospital systems (``Big Med'').\10\<SUP>,</SUP>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   existential threat of supplier consolidation, concentration, and 
                                pricing
    The greatest existential threat to intermediaries such as PBMs is 
consolidation and/or concentration among the manufacturers upstream 
with whom they contract. The immediate impact is (1) a reduction in the 
number of suppliers available for customers to contract with, and (2) 
the reduction in the competitive rivalry among these suppliers.

    Research suggests that pharmaceutical mergers and acquisitions 
(M&A) are sometimes motivated by the desire to limit competition. 
Researchers have found that a company is 5-7 percent less likely to 
complete the drug development project in its acquisition's pipeline if 
those drugs would compete with the acquirer's existing product line 
(i.e., ``killer acquisition'').\12\ Other research shows that M&A can 
result in reduced R&D spending and patenting for several years;\13\ 
conversely, higher competition spurs R&D spending by 
firms.\14\<SUP>,</SUP> \15\

Evidence from the Biopharmaceutical Industry,'' Journal of Financial 
and Quantitative Analysis (2021).
    \15\ However, the threat is not always due to supplier mergers. M&A 
activity among large pharmaceutical manufacturers has not resulted in a 
more concentrated sector. In 2006, the top 10 firms accounted for 46 
percent of total sales; 10 years later they accounted for only 41 
percent of sales. Instead, in recent years, the threat has sometimes 
come from generic drugs where either market demand is too small to 
support more than one firm and/or all other suppliers have withdrawn 
for various reasons. The result is a monopoly and egregious pricing 
behavior. Two prominent examples are Turing Pharmaceuticals and its 
drug Daraprim, and Mylan Pharmaceuticals and its EpiPen--firms which 
continually hiked their prices because they could.

    The threat of supplier concentration particularly resides in the 
availability of specialty pharmaceuticals, many of which are off 
patent. There are higher entry barriers in the biologics space due to 
(among other reasons) the complexity of the science, uncertainty 
regarding the regulatory process for biosimilars, and the guidelines 
for ``interchangeability.'' The result is fewer competitors and little 
generic threat to these newer biological products. Biologics as a 
percentage of drug spending doubled between 2006 and 2016, from 13 
percent to 27 percent. The wholesale acquisition cost of biologics is a 
multiple of the cost of small molecules. The approval of biologic 
license applications (BLAs) for new biological products has recently 
overtaken the approval of new molecular entities (NMEs) for traditional 
drugs. The threat facing payers is containing the cost of these drugs. 
At the same time, the distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals has 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
become a major revenue driver for the PBMs and others.

    Moreover, specialty drugs are more buffered from the effects of 
drug formularies and tiers. Formulary position is driven by competition 
within the therapeutic area. Such competition is greater in some areas 
(e.g., metabolic, cardiovascular, central nervous system, 
gastrointestinal) than in others (oncology, infectious disease, 
immunology, and respiratory). In the former areas, there is less 
clinical differentiation among drug classes and more variation in 
tiering; in the latter areas, there is more clinical differentiation 
among drug classes and much less dispersion of formulary drugs across 
price tiers. This reflects the considerable unmet clinical need and 
variation in patient response to specialty (e.g., oncologic) drugs, 
making it harder to restrict and/or channel physician choice among 
products. Finally, drugs that treat widely prevalent conditions (e.g., 
diabetes) and thus incur high aggregate spending are more likely to be 
targeted by formulary tiers than are specialty drugs that incur lower 
aggregate spending which are more likely to attract payer strategies 
such as step therapy.
                                summary
    GPOs and PBMs occupy parallel roles in the institutional and retail 
channels of the health-care value chain. There are multiple 
similarities in their historical origin, product selection bodies, role 
in the value chain, role as agents for downstream buyers, business 
model, operating guidelines, transparency, rebates earned, cost 
management efforts, tradeoffs managed, and directional influence in the 
supply chain. These similarities are counter-balanced by their 
differences in channel served (institutional versus retail), products 
contracted for, customer served (hospital versus health plan), founding 
period, owner/sponsor, number of firms, and industry financials.

    Finally, they are both intermediaries. They do not buy, sell, or 
price products conveyed through the supply chain. They are also not 
providers of health-care services. Their impact on the cost and quality 
of care rendered to patients is thus removed from the parties who play 
the major roles here. The remarkable finding here is that these 
intermediaries may nevertheless serve the public's welfare by 
controlling the rise in health-care costs.
part ii: the brouhaha over rebates and the gross-to-net price disparity 
                                  \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ This section draws on Chapter 9 of The Healthcare Value Chain: 
Demystifying the Roles of GPOs and PBMs (Palgrave Macmillan, 2022).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Over the past few years, observers have noted not only the rise in 
drug list prices but also the growing disparity between gross and net 
prices for pharmaceutical products. As a percent of drug price growth, 
rebates accounted for only 6-9 percent during 2011-2012 but then 
accounted for 57-77 percent during 2013-2015.\17\ The disparity has 
continued. More recent data published by IQVIA show that between 2015-
2018 branded drug invoice price grew between 5.5 percent and 11.2 
percent, while branded drug net price grew between 0.3 percent and 2.9 
percent; between 2018-2021, branded drug invoice price grew between 4.3 
percent and 6.6 percent, while net price either fell or grew only 
modestly (-2.9 percent to +1.7 percent).\18\ The latter data indicate 
that net brand prices are growing less than the annual average growth 
in the consumer price index, and that manufacturer rebates are partly 
responsible. Some health economists argue that rebates roughly 
constitute the difference between list price and net price.\19\

    Indeed, a recent report by a small, provider-owned PBM (Navitus 
Health Solutions) shows that per-member-per-month (PMPM) drug spending 
for its plan sponsor clients grew only 1.5 percent during 2021. This 
(low) growth rate was driven by higher utilization (9.1 percent for 
specialty drugs, 1.3 percent for nonspecialty drugs) and not by unit 
cost (-4.8 percent for specialty drugs, -2.2 percent for nonspecialty 
drugs).\20\ Another recent report by Milliman estimates that 
manufacturer rebates reduced total per-capita health-care costs by 6 
percent ($397) in 2022.\21\

    Some observers allege that the rise in list prices is partly caused 
by the higher rebates (and other payments made by manufacturers to 
PBMs), which are represented by the gap between gross and net price. In 
their view, the facts that (1) higher rebates and other fees account 
for a higher percentage of the drug's list price increase and (2) the 
rebate size increases with list price are evidence of causation. The 
theory behind this presumed causality is that the PBMs benefit from 
higher rebates, and that this may encourage manufacturers to hike their 
list prices which leads to a win-win situation: the PBM earns more 
rebates, and the higher rebates earn the manufacturer a more favorable 
position on the formulary where they can achieve higher sales volume. 
These observers nevertheless admit that the lack of granular data on 
PBM rebates and drug prices (due to confidentiality clauses) renders 
this causal assertion uncertain. As the great ``philosopher'' Yogi 
Berra once said, ``In theory, theory and practice are the same. In 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
practice, they are not.''

    The flaw in this causal logic is shown by several pieces of 
evidence. Drug manufacturers raise prices several times a year, whereas 
PBMs negotiate contracts and rebates every 2 to 3 years, with the 
rebates remaining constant during the duration of each contract. 
Moreover, drug manufacturers raise prices in anticipation of losing 
patent protection (and thus market share), in the event of filing 
patent lawsuits against competitors (potentially gaining share), in 
anticipation of a generic product entering the market (losing market 
share), in anticipation of new competitors entering the market (and 
thus losing market share), or in the event that an existing competitor 
pulls their product from the market (gaining market share). In general, 
drug manufacturers raise prices because they can--e.g., when they enjoy 
more of a monopoly position in their therapeutic category, when they 
have superior marketing, when their product is a physician preference 
item (PPI), and when their product has brand preference among patients. 
Most health economists acknowledge that drug manufacturers control list 
price.

    Multiple factors have contributed to the growing spread between 
gross and net drug prices (known as the gross-to-net disparity). First 
is the growing consolidation of the PBM sector. PBM consolidation was 
legitimated by the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) sign-off on Express 
Scripts' (ESI) acquisition of WellPoint's Next Rx in-house PBM in 2009, 
and the market valuation placed on Next Rx's business.\22\ This 
consolidation accelerated in the 2012-2015 period, led by ESI's 
acquisition of Medco (2012), Catamaran's acquisition of ReStat and 
TPG's acquisition of EnvisionRx (both in 2013), and then Optum's 
acquisition of Catamaran (2015).\23\ By 2017, the top three PBMs 
commanded 71 percent of the market (measured in scrips): CVS (25 
percent), ESI (24 percent), and Optum (22 percent). The top 7 PBMs 
controlled 95 percent of the market. This market concentration of 
buyers allows PBMs and health insurers to extract large discounts in 
price from manufacturers in exchange for a drug's position on the 
formulary. This is a major driver of drug rebates (discounts on list 
price) paid to the PBMs.

    Second, complementing the growing concentration on the buyer side 
(PBM market), there can be growing competition on the supplier side in 
the form of competing pharmaceutical products. This is also referred to 
as ``crowded therapeutic categories.'' Such product competition gives 
PBMs and health insurers leverage over manufacturers by virtue of 
playing one manufacturer off another and threatening to move market 
share to the manufacturer who offers better terms (including higher 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rebates).

    Third, beginning around 2012, but picking up around 2014, PBMs 
began to utilize the strategy of ``formulary exclusion'' whereby 
manufacturers are threatened with product removal from the PBM's 
national formulary.\24\ CVS/Caremark removed 34 brand-name drugs from 
its standard national formulary in January 2012, and added another 17 
drugs to the exclusion list in 2013; ESI followed CVS' example in 2014. 
Both PBMs have added more drugs to the list over time. Optum, Prime 
Therapeutics, Aetna, and Cigna embraced drug exclusions by 2016.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \24\ Burns. The Healthcare Value Chain: Demystifying the Roles of 
GPOs and PBMs, 2022: Figure 9.11.

    Such a strategy works in the presence of therapeutically comparable 
brand-name drugs. In 2016, more than 50 percent of the commercial 
market was covered by plans with formulary exclusions. Note that 
exclusions block access to specific products on a PBM's recommended 
national formulary; they are, thus, suggestions rather than mandates. 
ERISA Plan Sponsors and health insurers can ignore the PBM's national 
formulary, but then face reduced rebates and/or higher plan costs. 
They, thus, tradeoff higher access to drugs for higher costs incurred--
much in the way that formularies financially reward patients for 
selecting generic and lower-tier drugs with lower costs, while allowing 
access to additional drugs on higher tiers but requiring patients to 
face higher costs via higher copays or coinsurance. Nevertheless, the 
prospect of exclusion leads manufacturers to offer larger rebates. A 
precipitating event here was the introduction of AbbVie's hepatitis C 
drug Viekira Pak to compete with Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni. The 
number of products on the formulary exclusion lists for two PBMs (CVS 
and ESI) has grown steadily since 2012.\25\

Pharmacy Benefit Managers. Exhibit 85: 127.

    Fourth, statutory rebates are another large driver of gross-to-net 
discounts. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA 2010) 
increased the mandatory rebates that pharmaceutical manufacturers must 
pay under the Medicaid program. For single-source (non-generic) drugs, 
the Unit Rebate Amount (URA) increased from 15.1 percent of a product's 
average manufacturer price (AMP) to 23.1 percent of AMP. It also 
required manufacturers to provide rebates in the Medicare Part D 
coverage gap. The Bipartisan Budget Act, signed into law in February 
2018, increased these discounts. Rebates and other channel discounts to 
PBMs and pharmacies constitute ``direct and indirect remuneration'' 
(DIR) payments made to Part D Plan Sponsors. These payments were stable 
from 2010-2012 but began to accelerate beginning in 2013. DIRs help to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
create a gap between list and net prices.

    Fifth, the pharmaceutical industry experienced steep patent cliffs 
in 2012 and 2015, and much higher level of patent expiries in the 
period 2013-2019 compared to earlier levels (e.g., 2010).\26\ Attending 
these patent expiries was a wave of new generic drugs entering the 
market. The advent of biosimilars in the biotechnology market 
constituted a parallel development, but on a smaller scale. Research 
documents that drug prices decrease markedly after patent 
expiration.\27\ In 2017, the generic dispensing rate--the percentage of 
drug prescriptions dispensed with a generic drug instead of a branded 
drug--was 90 percent. The rise in generics and generic dispensing rates 
occasioned a slowdown in the price growth of branded drugs.

    Sixth, the same increase in rebates has been observed in Medicare 
Part D. Between 2006 and 2020, Part D drug rebates as a percentage of 
total drug costs rose from 8.6 percent to 27.0 percent.\28\ This is 
relevant since PBMs, which administer the drug benefit, retain less 
than 1 percent of these rebates and thus do not benefit. Instead, 
analysts point out that the growing Part D rebates are tied to 
competition among manufacturers within a given drug class to get on the 
formulary.\29\ Research by Milliman shows that, among drugs with 
rebates covered under Part D, rebates as a percentage of gross drug 
costs reached 39 percent in the presence of direct brand competition. 
Rebates reached 34 percent when there were 3+ competitors including a 
direct generic substitute, 27 percent when there were 1-2 competitors 
with a direct generic substitute, and only 23 percent in the absence of 
direct brand competition or a generic substitute.\30\

    Seventh, the growth in the gross-to-net difference observed over 
time has been driven not by commercial rebates but instead by Medicare 
Part D rebates and 340B discounts.\31\ According to Adam Fein, the 
gross-to-net difference in the price of branded drugs reflects a 
declining share in commercial rebates (22 percent of difference in 
2021, down from 27 percent in 2017), a rising share in Part D rebates 
(23 percent of difference in 2021, up from 19 percent in 2017), and a 
sharply rising share in 340B discounts (20 percent in 2021, up from 10 
percent in 2019).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Considering the Arguments of GPO Critics: Critical Thinking Exercise
    PBM critics counter by asserting that PBMs are not the only drug 
channel parties with an incentive for higher prices under Medicare Part 
D. Since 99 percent+ of the manufacturer rebates flow to the health 
plans, there may be an incentive for the health plan sponsors to favor 
higher list prices. The prescription drug plans (PDPs) which administer 
the Part D benefit earn a portion of their profits from DIR payments. 
Manufacturer rebates comprise the vast majority (92 percent) of DIR 
payments, which are paid to plans to get favorable placement on their 
formularies.\32\ Critics have expressed concern that this remuneration 
structure may lead health plans to favor higher-priced brand drugs 
(which come with rebates) on their formularies over lower-cost generics 
(which do not come with rebates).

    As evidence, researchers examined 57 unique drug formularies across 
all 750 stand-alone PDPs in 2016, focusing on 935 drugs that were 
``multi-source'' (brand and generic both available).\33\ They found 
that 12.8 percent of multi-source drugs did not have generics covered 
in any formulary; they also found that 72 percent of formularies placed 
at least one branded product in a lower cost-sharing tier than the 
generic. When they examined 222 multi-source drugs covered in all 
formularies that had both brand and generic products covered in at 
least one formulary, they found that brand products were placed in a 
lower cost-sharing tier than the generic for only 5 percent of these 
drugs. If there is a problem, the low percentages suggest it is limited 
in scope. Additional evidence from other researchers confirms this.\34\ 
A recent analysis of Medicare Part D plans with matched pairs of brand 
and generic drugs found that branded drugs are rarely covered when 
generics are available. Most of the time (84 percent), only generics 
were covered; some plans might cover both brand and generic products 
(15 percent). In the few instances where branded drugs had preferential 
formulary placement, beneficiary and Medicare prices were generally low 
for both products.\35\

have missed something. My colleagues are welcome to point out the error 
in my ways. As Jalen Hurts, the quarterback of the Philadelphia Eagles 
said after losing this year's Super Bowl, ``You either win or you 
learn.'' Wise words to live by.

    Eighth, there is correlational evidence of an association between 
rebates and list prices, and an association between increases in 
rebates and increases in list prices. However, the evidence here is not 
consistent, and can oftentimes suggest no relationship at all.\36\ 
Moreover, the researchers who report these findings are somewhat 
circumspect in their conclusions, arguing that to the degree that PBMs 
retain rebates (rather then pass them along to health plans) ``a higher 
list price might generate more revenue for PBMs'' [italics added].\37\ 
Some of my researcher friends similarly hedge their bets, stating that 
rebates are ``probably at least partially responsible for the faster 
increase in list prices than in the amounts received by drug 
manufacturers (net prices)'' [italics added].\38\ They are also quite 
clear in stating that rebates have moderated the growth in drug 
prices.\39\

    Ninth, and finally, there is growing research evidence that a main 
driver in the list prices of brand drugs is not PBM rebates but rather 
Federal reimbursement policies. Economists suggest that Medicare Part D 
dynamics encourage growth in list prices and thus in rebates. These 
dynamics include Part D benefit design and beneficiary cost sharing. 
The Federal Government is at greatest financial risk for high drug 
spending in Part D by virtue of shouldering 80 percent of costs in the 
catastrophic coverage phase, thereby encouraging higher list prices. 
Via this mechanism, Part D cost-sharing and beneficiary out-of-pocket 
costs are tied to list price.\40\

    In a similar vein, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently 
concluded that Medicaid's statutory rebates provide incentives to 
manufacturers to negotiate higher prices with commercial insurers as 
well as employ higher market-wide launch prices. The CBO's causal 
argument is as follows: more people covered by public insurance (such 
as Medicaid) leads to more third-party (public) coverage of drug 
spending which, in turn, means more patients less exposed to high drug 
prices and more willing to buy high-priced drugs--all of which 
alleviates pressure on manufacturers to restrain their price hikes.\41\ 
The cause is not PBM rebates, but rather moral hazard resulting from 
public insurance coverage. This last point suggests that--to paraphrase 
the old comic strip Pogo--we have met the enemy and the enemy is us. 
Rising prices and out-of-pocket of costs may have been unwittingly 
induced by Federal payment policy.\42\

    All of these factors contribute to gross-to-net discounts. These 
discounts accelerated from 2014 through 2019.\43\ The majority of these 
gross-to-net discounts were not realized by PBMs and other drug channel 
participants such as wholesalers and pharmacies, but rather were 
realized by public and private payers (62 percent). Researchers 
estimate that pharmacies capture the bulk (15 percent) of the 
remainder, with PBMs (5 percent) and wholesalers (2 percent) capturing 
much less.\44\<SUP>,</SUP> \45\

    This means that ERISA Plan Sponsors and the health insurers they 
contract with realized large discounts off of drug list prices, which 
accounts for the majority of the growing gross-to-net disparity. This 
is reflected in data for both small and large employers that capture 
the rebates flowing back to the ERISA Plan Sponsors in 2021.\46\ The 
data indicate that a growing percentage of both smaller and larger 
employers are receiving 100 percent of the rebates negotiated by their 
PBMs. Among larger employers, the 100 percent pass-through is by far 
the most common rebate arrangement; a majority of smaller employers 
also received 100 percent pass-throughs, but nearly one-quarter receive 
a percentage share of rebates.

    The question is, what did ERISA Plan Sponsors and health insurers 
do with the rebates (savings)? The rebates can be used in a number of 
ways, according to insurance executives.\47\ First, they can be used to 
offset the health-care costs generated by employees (or plan members) 
and thereby reduce their insurance premiums; this approach benefits 
everyone. Second, they can be used to fund employer wellness programs, 
which also benefits all members. Third, they can be used to finance 
patient engagement programs which extend enhanced benefits to those 
choosing more cost-effective plans or those more compliant with their 
medications. Alternatively, the rebates can be used to lower patient 
copays for members using specific drugs or reduce the prices paid at 
point-of-sale; this benefits specific members.

    PBMI survey data suggest that the vast majority of employers (68 
percent) use the rebates to offset the overall plan costs to the 
employer, especially their own spending on drugs.\48\ By contrast, a 
smaller percentage of employers (11 percent) use the discounts to 
reduce the premiums of their employees (11 percent), a strategy that 
benefits all workers. A small percentage of employers (15 percent) 
split the savings with employees, or reduce employee out-of-pocket 
costs at the point-of-sale (4 percent). This means that employers use 
the discounts generated by their employees with more severe illnesses 
that require expensive drugs (which earn higher rebates) to cover their 
overall health expenditures rather than benefit the employees who 
generate the rebates. The irony, according to industry analysts, is 
that the employees' actual out-of-pocket costs are set by their insurer 
and ERISA Plan Sponsor. It is not the PBMs, but rather the Plan 
Sponsors and health insurers who elect not to share the rebates 
directly with employees.\49\

    Over time, employers' drug benefit designs have shifted out-of-
pocket spending from flat co-payments to deductibles and coinsurance 
arrangements. By 2019, more than half of all consumer out-of-pocket 
spending on prescription drugs was for coinsurance or deductibles, both 
of which are tied to list price.\50\ Evidence shows the decline in cost 
sharing using co-payments, the rise in cost sharing using coinsurance 
when employer plans include high deductibles, by drug tier, and the 
dollar amount of cost sharing by drug tier for both co-payment and 
coinsurance. Moreover, over time, the percentage of ERISA Sponsor Plans 
with pharmacy benefit deductibles has risen. These deductibles can be 
separate from or combined with the medical deductible.\51\

    A recent survey of large employers by the National Business Group 
on Health suggests some change in employer sentiment here. In 2019, 18 
percent of employers reported having a point-of-sale rebate program in 
place; 2 percent said they were implementing a program in 2020, and 
another 40 percent were considering such a program for 2012-2022.\52\ 
Such programs pass the rebates directly to the employee at point of 
purchase. Such point-of-sale programs are most appropriate when the 
employee is filling a prescription during the deductible phase of 
coverage or when paying a coinsurance. As industry analysts make clear, 
this decision about point-of-sale programs is at the discretion of 
ERISA Plan Sponsors and the health insurers they contract with. These 
two parties choose the overall prescription drug benefit that is 
offered to plan participants, which can include: which drugs are 
covered, the different levels of cost sharing, the number of pharmacies 
available to participants, and the incentives for using certain network 
pharmacies.

health insurers make between access, quality, and cost. These two

    We do not know whether the vertical chains in the Figure above 
are pro-or anti-competitive. There are no data on the costs, prices, or 
other performance metrics resulting from these combinations. 
Researchers acknowledge that ``it is well known in antitrust economics 
that assessing policies in industries with important vertical 
relationships is challenging. . . . Even in the presence of reliable 
data, how vertical relationships affect consumer welfare is generally 
theoretically ambiguous, and under various models of supplier behavior, 
stronger vertical relationships can greatly improve consumer welfare or 
greatly harm it.''\54\

    Some observers look at this chart and quickly conclude that the 
emergence of such behemoth, bureaucratic intermediaries may not be good 
for the public. Even a seasoned analyst such as Adam Fein suggests, 
``These organizations are poised to exert greater control over patient 
access, sites of care/dispensing, and pricing.''\55\ At the same time, 
Fein argues that whether they do or can exercise such control is pure 
speculation. Other researchers go further, concluding that competing 
value chains such as those depicted above might serve as the new basis 
of competition in an ecosystem that is quickly consolidating.\56\ This 
sounds like a great topic for critical thinking.

         the key issue in vertical integration: make versus buy
    The type of combinations depicted in the Figure above are known as 
``vertical integration.'' Management researchers often argue that the 
central decision in corporate strategy concerns ``make versus buy'': 
i.e., make it in house or buy it in the marketplace. The choices are 
also known as ``insource versus outsource.'' There are advantages to 
each approach such as: use the company's managerial hierarchy versus 
market forces to coordinate the two parties' behaviors, seek the 
advantages of collaboration versus the benefits of specialization, 
diversify versus focus, etc. With regard to pharmaceutical benefits, 
the two approaches are known as ``carve-in'' versus ``carve-out.''\57\ 
There is no clearly defined calculus regarding which option to take in 
the make-versus-buy decision. One has to calculate the costs and 
benefits of each option--and be satisfied with the tradeoffs. In the 
absence of data on costs and prices, no one that I know of has made 
these calculations for the vertically integrated firms depicted here.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \57\ This is covered in Chapter 9 of The Healthcare Value Chain: 
Demystifying the Roles of GPOs and PBMs (Palgrave Macmillan, 2022).

    It is important to note that, historically, the players in the 
retail pharmaceutical supply chain have taken both approaches. For 
example, the PBM sector began using a carve-in approach when staff 
model HMOs served as their own pharmacy benefit managers working under 
a capitated budget constraint.\58\ The objective was to provide 
comprehensive coverage of both inpatient and outpatient services, 
including prescription drugs, at an affordable cost (``assurance'' 
rather than insurance). Stand-alone PBMs that originally developed as 
staff-model HMOs waxed and waned in popularity. Later PBMs evolved a 
different set of benefits and services that attracted both employers 
and health plans as clients; while some PBMs could be carved in, many 
were carved out of the health plan. United's acquisition of Pacificare 
in 2005 marked the beginning of the current trend to the carved-in 
approach (a return to the roots). United's move was motivated by its 
desire to acquire Pacificare's health plan operations; the PBM came 
with the deal. By virtue of acquiring Pacificare's 3.3 million 
enrollees, United increased its enrollment stature (25.7 million lives) 
relative to its larger competitor Wellpoint (27.7 million lives), 
diversified geographically into the West (where Pacificare was 
located), gained traction in the Medicare risk market, and helped it to 
prepare for the coming Medicare drug benefit. The deal was also part of 
the M&A frenzy among health plans in the 2005-2006 era.\59\ Thus, the 
sector has experimented with both approaches over time, oftentimes 
based on historical circumstances, opportunities, or rationales 
specific to that point in time--but not necessarily to get into the PBM 
business.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       adversarial relationships
    The historical lesson here is that the relationships between PBMs 
and health plans can vary. It is also important to note that the 
relationships between PBMs and their health plan clients are not always 
cordial and productive but could instead be unwieldy and rather 
adversarial. They can both wind and unwind.
Anthem-Express Scripts Litigation
    In 2009, Express Scripts entered a 10-year contract with Anthem to 
provide exclusive pharmacy benefits. In 2016, Anthem filed a lawsuit 
arguing that its contract with Express Scripts guaranteed it 
competitive prices for prescription drugs. Anthem or a third-party 
consultant it retained would conduct a market analysis every 3 years to 
determine how competitive the PBM's pricing was; if the pricing was not 
competitive, then Anthem could renegotiate pricing terms with its PBM. 
In 2011-2012, Anthem commenced the first round of these renegotiations, 
which lasted for nearly 1 year and strained the relationship between 
the two parties, before they reached an agreement. However, Anthem 
concluded it was overcharged $3 billion a year for several years. 
Anthem began a second round of renegotiations in 2014 by demanding $15 
billion in price concessions from its PBM, and then notified it of 
breach of contract. Express Scripts countered that the insurer was 
responsible to produce a market analysis of drug prices that would 
serve as the basis of negotiations. It also stated that it earned well 
below than $3 billion annually from the PBM agreement and thus could 
not meet Anthem's demand.

    In 2017, Anthem announced it would not new its contract with 
Express Scripts. This meant a loss of 20 percent of the PBM's revenue. 
In early 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge dismissed Anthem's suit, 
stating that its contract did not explicitly state that its PBM would 
ensure competitive pricing; Express Scripts' only obligation was to 
negotiate based on data the insurer provided.
Downstream Effects of the Litigation
    The litigation had several downstream effects--for both insurers 
and PBMs. First, Anthem had to replace its big-three PBM. In October 
2017, Anthem announced its plan to launch its own in-house PBM, 
IngenioRx, in collaboration with CVS Health; the latter would provide 
Anthem with claims processing, point-of-sale engagement, and 
prescription fulfillment services. In 2019, Anthem launched IngenioRx, 
which reportedly accounted for one-fifth of Anthem's revenue, and 
served as the insurer's PBM vehicle to target self-insured employers.

    Second, Express Scripts faced the loss of its largest health plan 
client (Anthem) and questions about its future as a stand-alone PBM in 
an era of consolidation. In April 2017, Express Scripts reported in its 
quarterly earnings announcement that it did not expect Anthem to renew 
its contract; indeed, in January 2019, Anthem terminated the contract a 
year earlier than scheduled. Express Scripts was soon courted by 
another insurer, Cigna. Cigna was rebounding from its failed horizontal 
merger with Anthem: on February 8, 2017, the District Court for the 
District of Columbia sided with the Department of Justice in blocking 
the horizontal merger of Cigna and Anthem. In March of 2018, Cigna 
announced its plan to acquire Express Scripts for $67 billion and 
pursue a vertical merger instead. The deal closed in early December.

    The February 2017 District Court ruling also blocked the proposed 
merger of Aetna and Humana. Within months of the decision, Aetna 
likewise pursued a vertical merger with CVS Health. CVS Health 
executives presented the merger to investors as a strategy to develop 
health hubs for Aetna enrollees at CVS drugstores.
             historical rationales for vertical integration
    The combinations of (1) Cigna with Express Scripts and (2) Aetna 
with CVS Health meant that all three major PBMs now had health plan 
partners. UnitedHealth had previously formed Optum in 2011 by combining 
its existing pharmacy benefit and care delivery services within the 
company. Its PBM operations stemmed from its 2005 acquisition of 
PacifiCare, a health plan which had a pharmacy benefit manager.

    Indeed, there have been many rationales for such vertical 
integration offered over the past decade. These rationales reflect the 
period's Zeitgeist (spirit of the times): care coordination, manage the 
continuum of care, disease management and chronic disease management, 
use big data and data analytics to (a) stratify enrollees by their risk 
level and then (b) identify and intervene for those at high risk. 
Providers have offered similar rationales for the vertical integration 
mergers they have undertaken.

    Vertical integration has also been partly motivated by the growth 
in spending on specialty drugs. Such spending is split between the 
pharmacy benefit and the medical benefit. Patients taking specialty 
medications tend to have more expensive conditions that health plans 
need to manage. Health plans have argued that spending under both 
benefits is large and roughly equal in level, thus requiring close 
management of both. While there is some overlap, specialty drug spend 
for different disease categories tends to dominate one benefit over the 
other (e.g., multiple sclerosis on the pharmaceutical benefit side, 
oncology on the medical benefit side).

    The vertical integration strategies were also partly motivated by 
Department of Justice's move to block Aetna's and Cigna's prior 
horizontal merger efforts (with Humana and Anthem, respectively). The 
latter observation suggests that, at least initially, one underlying 
rationale for vertical integration was simply growth, not necessarily 
the specific merger partner.
              current rationales for vertical integration
    Adam Fein (at Drug Channels) and Eric Percher (at Nephron Research) 
have done perhaps the best job of articulating the current vertical 
integration movement in the pharmaceutical supply chain. As noted 
above, Fein suggests that the issue may be control over the drug 
channel: ``vertically-integrated payers/PBMs/providers are poised to 
restructure U.S. drug channels by exerting greater control over patient 
access, sites of care/dispensing, and pricing. If they can effectively 
coordinate their sprawling business operations, they will pose a 
substantial threat of disruption to the existing commercial strategies 
of pharma companies.''\60\ Such control could result from (1) 
channeling of enrollees to the specialty pharmacies and providers 
inside these vertical firms, (2) rewarding providers for formulary 
compliance, and (3) greater management and utilization control over 
provider-administered drugs and the buy-and-bill practices of in-house 
physicians.\61\

Providers: Will Vertical Consolidation Disrupt Drug Channels in 
2020?'', Drug Channels (December 12, 2019).
    \61\ Here is what Adam Fein has to say. With regard to buy-and-bill 
utilization management: ownership of clinics enables much greater 
control over provider-administered drugs--including opportunities to 
tighten utilization management, negotiate greater rebates from 
manufacturers, and drive greater biosimilar adoption. For example, 
Optum's MedExpress clinics currently offer infusion therapy in select 
Florida and Indiana locations for people with UnitedHealthcare or 
Humana insurance . . . commercial health plans try to move infusions to 
lower-cost sites of care. This is typically achieved with utilization 
management strategies that guide patients to lower-cost and/or better-
performing sites of care. But employed physicians and in-house clinics 
make site-of-care management much easier. With regard to buy-and-bill 
channel management. A physician office or clinic that is owned by a 
vertically integrated organization can be required to obtain provider-
administered specialty pharmaceuticals from the company's own specialty 
pharmacy. This practice is called white bagging. It has displaced buy-
and-bill for a significant share of provider-administered drugs in 
commercial health plans. By owning the infusion site, the insurer 
bypasses the challenge of getting hospitals to accept white bagging.

Vertical Consolidation Disrupt Drug Channels in 2020?'', Drug Channels

    In his 2022 Report,\62\ Fein summarized some additional specific 
goals of vertical integration that are mentioned by Percher:\63\

         Because health-care services (e.g., pharmacy) are not 
        subject to the same risk-based capital requirements or 
        profitability regulations as insurers, integration can allow 
        them to retain a greater share of revenues.
         Patients who are on expensive specialty medications have 
        high overall medical spending which can benefit from the 
        combined pharmacy and medical benefit.
         Vertical integration enables insurers to tap into the 
        growing market for specialty pharmaceuticals and perhaps 
        control downstream pharmacy assets.
                   challenges to vertical integration
    In his 2022 and 2023 reports, Fein is also careful to point out the 
challenges facing the strategy of vertical integrating insurers with 
PBMs and pharmacies.

         There is no guarantee that an insurer which owns its own PBM 
        and pharmacy operations is assured that prescribing physicians 
        are aware of any pharmacy network restrictions and can direct 
        their drug dispensing.
         Employers may be skeptical about whether the savings from 
        combining the pharmaceutical and medical benefit will accrue to 
        them. This may slow down their adoption of such plans. Not all 
        health plan sponsors seem to be beating a path to such 
        integrated offerings. According to Drug Channels, 77 percent of 
        small employers (< 1,000 workers) contracted with a combined 
        health plan/PBM in 2021. By contrast, only 53 percent of mid-
        sized employers (1,000-5,000 workers) and only 33 percent of 
        large employers (> 5,000 workers) did so; the latter two 
        categories were more likely to carve out the PBM.\64\

Pharmacies and Pharmacy Benefit Managers. Exhibit 80.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Hospitals have been entering the specialty pharmaceutical 
        business and acquiring oncologist practices. The market for 
        physician-administered drugs is thus shifting from physician 
        offices to hospital outpatient departments. Alternate sites of 
        care such as home infusion account for a portion of the medical 
        benefit spend as well as Medicare Part B spend. Hospitals may 
        enjoy a competitive advantage over integrated insurers in this 
        fragmented market.
         Some prior insurer/PBM/pharmacy/provider joint ventures 
        (e.g., those involving Humana, Prime Therapeutics, Centene) and 
        prior insurer-PBM acquisitions (UnitedHealth and DPS) have 
        unwound.\65\ Humana has retrenched to focus on its core 
        Medicare business. In 2021, it began sourcing formulary rebates 
        for its commercial health plans via Cigna's Ascent Health 
        Services business; in 2022, it announced it would divest its 
        majority interest in Kindred at Home and Personal Care 
        Divisions. Prime Therapeutics sold its 49 percent stake in the 
        AllianceRx Walgreens Prime pharmacy; it also outsourced 
        significant portions of its PBM operations to Cigna's 
        Evernorth, including retail pharmacy network contracting, 
        formulary rebates, and mail and specialty pharmacy dispensing. 
        Centene announced plans to outsource PBM operations to Express 
        Scripts and has already sold other businesses (e.g., Magellan 
        Rx PBM, Rare specialty pharmacy). These vertical integration 
        formations are thus quite fluid.

Report on U.S. Pharmacies and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (Philadelphia,

    The overall goal of vertical integration may be the magic word, 
``synergy''. Like Helen of Troy, synergy may be the strategy that 
launched a thousand mergers.\66\ Synergy results when the whole is 
greater than the sum of the parts (i.e., 1 + 1 = 3). There are two 
types of synergies: cost synergies and revenue synergies. Following 
Fein and Percher, revenue synergies seem to be front of mind in 
combining the component parts depicted in the Figure above,. All of 
this is speculative and theoretical at the moment. We have yet to see 
whether these combinations can figure out how to coordinate the various 
parts they acquire. Success will largely hinge on getting physicians 
and patients to follow directives and ``do the right thing'': e.g., use 
in-house pharmacies and providers (stay in network) when they are part 
of different organizations. Success may be challenged by having to rely 
on those outside, non-contracted organizations to attract needed 
volume. As a result, each vertical integration combination may need 
business from other similar combinations, who are their competitors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \66\ In his play, The Tragical History of the Life and Death of 
Doctor Faustus, the 16th-century English playwright Christopher Marlowe 
refers to Helen of Troy as ``the face that launched a thousand ships.'' 
Helen was the queen of Sparta and the wife of the king, Menelaus. When 
Paris, son of the king of Troy, abducts Helen, Menelaus enlists the 
help of his older brother Agamemnon, King of Athens, to launch the 
Greek fleet (the 1,000 ships) to attack Troy. This is the start of the 
Trojan Wat as depicted in Homer's The Iliad. I have to explain all of 
this to my Penn students who (somehow, somewhere) neither read the book 
nor took a course on Greek history. They do not know what face launched 
a thousand ships, let alone who Menelaeus and Agamemnon were. When, in 
disbelief, I push further to ask them what they know about the Trojan 
War, I continue to get blank faces. Out of a class of 55 students one 
year, only one raised his hand, answering in a questioning voice, 
``Brad Pitt?''. Our educational system is in trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  consequences of vertical integration
    Vertical integration may have important, positive consequences for 
competition. According to analysts, one outcome of this vertical 
integration will be more aggressive price competition among health 
plans and PBMs.\67\ This could come about by the merging parties' 
bundling of medical and pharmacy benefits, which would entail a 
diminution of carve-out contracts between employers and PBMs for just 
the pharmacy benefit. This would put pressure on the margins of the 
freestanding PBMs, because vertically integrated insurers would 
discount their in-house PBM's services to win the combined business. 
Any stand-alone PBM contracts would need to lower prices to remain 
competitive.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \67\ Drug Channels Institute. The 2022 Economic Report on U.S. 
Pharmacies and Pharmacy Benefit Managers.

    Such integration might also reduce heterogeneity in health plans' 
approaches to strategic alignment with PBMs (which used to vary along 
an outsourcing-insourcing continuum). Greater homogeneity in strategic 
alignment across dyads of health plans and PBMs would increase their 
competitive rivalry since downstream buyers discern fewer distinctive 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
features of one vertical integration combination.

    Such integration also potentially signals that PBMs may focus 
increasingly more on the specialty pharmacy business for their 
profitability and, conversely, focus increasingly less on retained 
rebates. PBMs have passed along a much greater share of these rebates 
to health plan sponsors over the past decade, from 75 percent in 2013 
to 90 percent in 2018. According to some PBM industry presentations, 
rebates apply to 70 percent of their branded pharmacy scripts, which in 
turn account for only 10 percent of total scripts. Rebates have also 
diminished in importance due to Medicare's growing share of retail 
prescription drug spending (from 18 percent in 2006 to 30 percent in 
2017) and the low amount of rebates retained by PBMs in Part D PDPs.

    Finally, growing vertical integration between health plans and PBMs 
will likely reduce the transparency of freestanding PBMs' financial 
results.\68\ We have already confronted the opacity issue in trying to 
assess the performance of vertical integration efforts by hospitals to 
develop physician and health plan divisions.\69\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \68\ Growing vertical integration between health plans and PBMs 
will likely reduce the transparency of freestanding PBMs' financial 
results. Consider UnitedHealth Group, which had revenues of $226.2 
billion in 2018. For 2018, revenues at its OptumRx subsidiary were 
$69.5 billion. Interpreting the OptumRx figure is challenging, because: 
(1) it includes a combination of prescription revenues from its own 
mail/specialty pharmacies plus external retail network pharmacies, (2) 
it is reported net of rebates, (3) it excludes the value of members' 
out-of-pocket payments from revenues from retail network dispensed 
prescriptions, but includes the value of these member payments from 
prescriptions dispensed by its in-house pharmacies, and (4) it includes 
revenues of $39.4 billion (57 percent) from services provided to other 
subsidiaries, e.g., UnitedHealthcare. Drug Channels Institute. The 2022 
Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies and Pharmacy Benefit Managers.
    United's 10-K statement from 2021 includes a depiction of the 
conglomerate's total revenues. The data indicate huge growth between 
2018 and 2021 in the revenues of OptumRx (from $69.5 billion to $91.3 
billion) and Optum Health (from $24.1 billion to $54.0 billion); they 
appear to be the growth drivers in UnitedHealth's total revenues (from 
$226.2 billion to $287.6 billion). United's biggest revenue source (60 
percent) is the company's Medical and Retirement insurance segment. 
OptumRx may become increasingly more or less dependent on enrollees 
outside the parent company. It is difficult to determine the sources of 
United's profits coming from internal versus external sources given the 
conglomerate structure and the mix of customers.

            vertical integration: ride into the danger zone?
    Vertical integration has become a popular strategy in the health-
care ecosystem. Many of the recent vertical integration efforts 
depicted in the Figure above include providers (e.g., physicians, 
ambulatory surgery centers or ASCs, retail clinics) as well as 
insurers, pharmacies, and PBMs. A prominent illustration is 
UnitedHealth Group which includes the insurer UnitedHealth, its in-
house PBM (OptumRx), and its Optum Health division, which employs or 
contracts with roughly 70,000 physicians and owns a chain of ASCs and 
urgent care centers. Another is CVS Health, which encompasses Aetna, 
CVS pharmacies, and their retail clinics. Such provider markets are 
typically more fragmented than the core pharmacy and PBM businesses, 
offer another possible revenue stream, and can involve the key 
prescriber.

    The health-care sector is in the midst of its second or third 
iteration of vertical integration involving hospitals, physicians, 
insurers, and alternate care sites. The historical evidence among this 
different set of players has already been published, weighed in the 
balance, and found wanting.\70\ It is not a pretty picture. Most of the 
vertical combinations fall into one of three categories--physicians 
with insurers, hospitals with insurers, physicians with hospitals. They 
have all suffered from disappointing financial performance and, 
sometimes, huge losses. There are an estimated 50 different reasons why 
combinations of providers with insurers do not work; worse yet, it may 
only take one of those reasons to sink the deal.\71\

    How should one evaluate vertical integration between firms in 
adjacent stages in the health-care value chain? According to strategy 
researchers, vertical integration (insourcing) makes more sense than 
using the market (outsourcing) when the following general conditions 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
hold:

         There are few firms in the adjacent stage.
         There is need to make transaction-specific investment in an 
        upstream/
        downstream firm.
         The integration ensures access to needed inputs.
         There is a need for coordination between the firms in the 
        adjacent stages.
         The adjacent stages are similar in their optimal scale.
         The two stages are strategically similar.
         There is high certainty in market demand.
         There is low risk in the reliability of the trading partner.
         There is low need to continually upgrade capabilities.

    Moreover, the following specific conditions must also be met if the 
vertical integration is to confer competitive advantage over rivals:

         The integration achieves coordination and collaboration not 
        open to other firms.
         The integration improves the joint performance of value 
        chain activities under one roof.
         The integration leverages resources and capabilities across 
        the combined firm.
         Ownership is needed to capture all of this value.
         Culture clashes between the two firms can be avoided.
         Executives can get the two firms to work together.

    The bar is pretty high. Many firms may be challenged to clear it. 
It is unclear whether executives consider the general market and 
specific firm conditions needed to make vertical integration succeed. 
Vertical integration is a specific type of corporate diversification. 
The evidence base for the performance of diversified firms is not much 
better than that for vertically integrated firms. Related 
diversification outperforms unrelated diversification; but, focus may 
outperform related diversification. The key question is how big is the 
overlap between the value chains of the firms that are integrating; the 
secondary question is whether the overlap occurs in the most important 
stages of their value chains. This requires a comparison of the health 
plan's value chain and the PBM's value chain.\72\ Another key issue is 
that such an analysis needs to be conducted for each pair of components 
in the vertical chain. A final issue which most strategists fail to 
consider is this: given the popularity of vertical integration and the 
large number of firms adopting this strategy, just where is the 
competitive advantage?

               conclusion regarding vertical integration
    In sum, vertical integration is not a guaranteed success. When 
pursued by hospitals and physicians, there has been a lot of red ink 
and unwinding of the combinations. This is all documented evidence. At 
the same time, hospitals have utilized vertical integration with 
physicians to increase the prices they charge insurers in local 
markets; this serves to increase their costs and total spending. This, 
too, is well documented. Regulators need to closely monitor what 
effects the combinations depicted in the Figure above exert on pricing 
and costs. At this point, we simply do not know.

 Questions Submitted for the Record to Lawton Robert Burns, Ph.D., MBA
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo
      pbm-owned group purchasing organizations/rebate aggregators
    Question. Recent years have seen the emergence of a number of PBM-
owned or affiliated group purchasing organizations (GPOs), often known 
as rebate aggregators, through which certain PBMs have reportedly 
outsourced some of their functions, including with respect to 
manufacturer negotiations.

    How do these organizations differ from traditional GPOs, what are 
their implications for the broader prescription drug supply chain (and 
for patients), and what additional information should policymakers seek 
to collect and/or monitor with respect to these entities?

    Answer. The major PBMs have indeed set up their own GPOs. The PBM-
GPOs act like the group purchasing organizations found in the 
institutional channel of the supply chain. They aggregate the drug 
purchases for many health plans and their PBMs, extracting greater 
savings from manufacturers and pharmacies based on a larger-volume-for-
lower-price discount. The larger PBM members in the PBM-GPO get some 
additional price concessions due to the additional volume, while the 
smaller PBM members in the PBM-GPO get more substantial price 
concessions by virtue of pooling their drug buying with the larger 
PBMs. Because they are usually based outside of the U.S., the PBM-GPOs 
only operate in the commercial business.

    The PBMs that own and operate these rebate aggregators prefer to 
call them ``Contracting Entities'' rather than GPOs. Nevertheless, 
their contracts are structured so as to allow these aggregators to 
leverage the already-existing GPO safe harbor. This serves two 
functions, according to Eric Percher. First, it enables rebate 
aggregator to charge GPO administrative fees of up to 300bp, thereby 
creating a potential new or substitutive fee for PBM members 
(substitutive for admin fees with the added bonus that profits may be 
transferred to lower-cost tax jurisdictions). Second, it ensures that 
should legislative or administrative action undercut the pharmaceutical 
rebate/discount safe harbor, the PBM owners will continue to have 
access to a mechanism to collect and share administrative fees with 
PBM-GPO aggregator members via the separate and distinct GPO safe 
harbor. What the Senate might investigate is how large are the revenues 
shifted to lower cost tax jurisdictions.
                              transparency
    Question. As you noted during the March 30th hearing, transparency 
measures can produce both benefits and risks, depending on their design 
and context.

    In designing appropriate transparency provisions in the context of 
the prescription drug supply chain, what steps could Congress take to 
improve stakeholder and patient line-of-sight into practices and 
pricing dynamics while minimizing the risk of unintended consequences?

    Answer. It is not clear that patients want/need a clear line of 
sight into PBM practices. Research already shows that patients do not 
customarily use the price and quality information on the providers they 
utilize, even when such data are made transparent. It is also unclear 
that patients use such information in choosing their health plans. 
Since patient understanding of PBMs is likely a quantum degree lower 
than their understanding of their providers and their health plans, it 
is not clear there is much to be gained here in terms of patient 
shopping behavior.

    The major customers of the PBMs are (1) the health plans that PBMs 
serve and (2) the employers whom the health plans serve. At this time, 
there is nothing to prevent either PBM customer (health plan or 
employer) from demanding more transparency and data visibility/
reporting from their agent PBMs. It is not entirely clear why the plans 
and employers have not demanded greater access to such information. And 
this is after they spend a boatload of money on benefits consultants, 
contract consultants, and attorneys. Are the health plans and employers 
really that helpless? To be sure, the PBMs have gotten really big and 
may be good at moving fees around; and the plans and employers may have 
trouble seeing their own data as well as they would like. But should 
the Federal Government step in here? This seems like an area of 
private-sector contracting, not public-sector regulation.

                                 ______
                                 
                Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
    Question. As part of your written testimony at the hearing, you 
note that PBMs are the focus of many of the allegations in the 
industry--including, monopoly power, anticompetitive behavior, and 
reduced access to medication, to name a few. You also note how the 
business model of this industry has changed over time.

    Do you think more transparency in the PBM system--such as how 
rebates are used, what portion is passed onto the consumer, is an 
effective solution to understand the industry better?

    Answer. The issue of what to do with rebates entails some 
interesting tradeoffs. At present, the rebates flow to the health plans 
and their ERISA plan sponsors, who utilize them in ways to spread the 
benefits across all of their enrollees/employees. The rebates do not 
flow to those sicker members who are using the expensive drugs that 
generate the high rebates that flow to the plans. This means that the 
sicker enrollees/employees are subsidizing the healthier enrollees/
employees; this is true for both commercial and Part D enrollees. The 
conundrum is that the former group vastly outweighs the latter group in 
sheer numbers--so more people actually benefit. Some employers have 
taken steps to move toward ``point-of-service'' rebates in order to 
help the latter, sicker enrollees. The problem is that this weakens the 
competitive position of their employees and their health plans, since 
their premiums are likely to rise.

    In general, transparency has not worked in the U.S. health-care 
system to date. A recent report issued by the Congressional Budget 
Office confirms this. So does a boatload of academic research.

    Question. Your written testimony indicates that many people are 
still focused on the older practices of PBMs, such as manufacturer 
rebates, whereas PBMs are more focused on specialty drugs now. Can you 
elaborate on this comment?

    Does this mean that the solutions and actions Congress may be 
looked at should be focused differently?

    How do PBMs make a profit off specialty drugs, and does this fit 
into the overall pharmaceutical supply chain?

    Answer. A crucial, new part of PBM profits derives from the 
dispensing of specialty pharmaceuticals using their in-house 
pharmacies, as well as non-rebate fees from pharmaceutical 
manufacturers for a range of services (listed below). Conversely, PBMs 
now derive a smaller portion of their profits from rebate contracting 
with manufacturers and network management of retail pharmacies. 
Congressional efforts to target manufacturer rebates is, thus, 
misplaced and out of date.

    How has this come about? Specialty pharmaceuticals now drive the 
rising cost of drugs: they have few (if any) competitors, very high 
launch prices, and very high list prices. Without any effective 
competitors, the PBMs have very little bargaining power.

    Congress should be looking at the launch/list prices of new 
specialty drugs, including orphan drugs. That is where the money is 
being spent. That is where consumers face high out-of-pocket costs at 
the pharmacy (regardless of whether that pharmacy is owned by a PBM or 
some other party). There is a lot of competition in the specialty 
pharmacy space, but not much in specialty pharmaceutical manufacturing. 
Academic Medical Centers who administer these expensive drugs are 
starting their own specialty pharmacies.

    Everyone makes money from the dispensing of specialty drugs. The 
PBMs and others who operate specialty pharmacies are taking business 
away from retail pharmacies. That is one reason the latter complain so 
much about the PBMs: they are losing market share in the growing market 
of dispensing these expensive drugs. According to Adam Fein of Drug 
Channels, the gross margin of a specialty pharmacy consists of a 
dispensing spread (reimbursement - acquisition cost) + fees from 
manufacturers for a range of services provided. (However, there can 
also be many hidden sources of profits such as 340B, copay maximizers, 
and off-invoice discounts). These services can encompass disease 
management, outcomes research, compliance and adherence services, side-
effect management services, and managing patient service hub programs.

    Health plans develop small, preferred networks of specialty 
pharmacies, partly because they help to increase patient adherence to 
their medications, but also because they obtain lower prices in a 
volume-for-price tradeoff. Specialty drugs can account for at least 50 
percent of a health plan's net pharmacy benefit spending. That 
represents an enormous rise from just 23 percent in 2013. Likewise, 
drug manufacturers may limit the network of pharmacies that dispense 
their specialty drugs. We do not know much about this side of the PBM's 
business. Most companies do not report prescription revenues from 
specialty drugs.

                  Question Submitted by Hon. Tim Scott
    Question. I have seen a lot of information regarding the gross-to-
net bubble, the difference between a drug's list price and net price, 
which can be quite sizeable when there are rebates paid by the 
manufacturer. Reporting from many sources, including KPMG, Drug 
Channels, and others, share that discounts from manufacturers are often 
higher than 50 percent in Part D. Yet, patients who purchase those 
medicines do not share in those rebates. The PBM business model today 
has evolved to a point where they are now often owned by or own an 
insurer, a large pharmacy chain, or both.

    How do you think PBMs and related industry vertical integration and 
consolidation impacts the prices that patients pay directly and how 
might that impact the incentive to lower costs at the pharmacy counter?

    Answer. The prices that patients pay at the pharmacy counter are 
driven largely by what their health plans have (or have not) negotiated 
with the manufacturers. In the commercial space, a lot of patients pay 
high out-of-pocket costs because they have high-deductible health plans 
(HDHPs) and they are still in the deductible phase of their coverage 
that year. That means they are on the hook for all of a drug's cost, 
and that cost (unfortunately) happens to be the manufacturer's list 
price. This is driven by the employer; the PBM has nothing to do with 
it.

    On the Medicare Part D side, the health plans may not be 
aggressively negotiating prices for really expensive specialty drugs 
for the following reason. Part D beneficiaries pay the higher prices, 
they quickly move through the various coverage phases in Part D, and 
then reach the catastrophic coverage phase where the Federal Government 
covers 80 percent of the cost of the drug, while the health plan's 
share drops. This seems like a cost-shifting game, which Medicare Part 
D planners inadvertently allowed back in 2006.

    Medicaid beneficiaries do not pay much out of pocket for drugs. 
They are, therefore, not as disadvantaged as the other two sets of 
beneficiaries above.

                Prepared Statement of Hon. Mike Crapo, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Idaho
    I have long championed efforts to improve prescription drug access 
and affordability for Americans, and I welcome the opportunity to 
engage in this vitally important bipartisan hearing.

    Whether at the pharmacy counter, the doctor's office, or the 
hospital, some of the most lifesaving medications remain out of reach 
for far too many working families and seniors, especially in the face 
of persistent inflation. Congress took a critical step toward 
addressing these challenges nearly 20 years ago, when we voted to enact 
Medicare's prescription drug benefit, or Part D, leveraging market-
based competition to create and protect high-quality coverage options 
for seniors.

    In many ways, Medicare Part D reflects an unprecedented success 
story, coming in massively under budget, with low and stable monthly 
premiums--and with a generic drug dispensing rate of roughly 90 
percent. Part D's resilient, market-oriented structure continues to 
ensure low-cost drug access for most seniors, even as many other 
medical costs have continued to skyrocket. Stakeholders across the 
supply chain deserve credit for these figures and trends.

    That said, much has changed in the past 2 decades, and we have an 
obligation both to build on the aspects of Part D that work well and to 
address access and affordability gaps where we find them. In weighing 
and developing policy solutions, my priority is always the patient. We 
need to identify avenues for lowering out-of-pocket costs, increasing 
competition, and promoting access to lifesaving innovation--and we need 
to do so in a fiscally responsible manner.

    Given the tremendous common ground and shared goals around this 
issue, I am confident we can fulfill these objectives and deliver real 
results for seniors. A few major points regularly raised by Idahoans--
transparency, incentives, and out-of-pocket costs--are of key 
importance as we hear today's testimony.

    As anyone who has looked at a flow chart or diagram of the drug 
supply chain can attest, the only clear thing about it is how unclear 
and opaque it really is. We need an all-of-the-above approach to 
transparency that empowers consumers, plans, providers, and pharmacies 
to make informed, cost-effective, and clinically appropriate 
decisions--as well as to practice meaningful oversight. Policymakers 
also need more line of sight into the black box of drug pricing 
relationships and transactions, especially as we look to pursue 
productive reforms in the future.

    We also need to assess the various incentives that operate within 
the medication supply chain. Ideally, we should have frameworks, both 
within Part D and in other markets, that encourage low prices through 
meaningful competition. Unfortunately, in too many cases, certain 
dynamics seem to drive list prices up, even as net prices, reflective 
of rebates and discounts, decline.

    The gap between list and net price has grown dramatically in recent 
years, keeping premiums stable but exposing some consumers to 
astronomical out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter, particularly 
for uninsured patients or families relying on high-deductible health 
plans.

    Misaligned incentives have also constrained biosimilar uptake in 
Part D, driving manufacturers to launch products at multiple different 
price points, with PBMs sometimes preferencing the option with the 
higher sticker price. The incentive structures at play here clearly 
warrant a hard look.

    Americans face an out-of-pocket cost of less than $20 for 92 
percent of prescriptions filled. For the remainder, however, costs can 
run much higher, particularly for seniors enrolled in Part D. I look 
forward to discussing targeted solutions to bridge this gap without 
fueling premium hikes for older Americans.

    With these priorities in mind, thank you to our witnesses for being 
here today. I look forward to your testimonies.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman and esteemed members of the committee. I am 
honored to be here today to address an issue that is burdening 
patients, taxpayers, and those trying to help them.

    The supply chain for medicine is riddled with perverse incentives, 
and marked by sky-rocketing prices. we see persistently rising prices 
on the medications people depend on, day after day, to treat widespread 
problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and 
opioid addiction.\1\ Key aspects of the problem can be traced to the 
industry that lies at the center of drug pricing--pharmacy benefit 
managers, or PBMs.\2\

based on list, rather than net, price to remove the incentive for

and Federal level responses).

    Historically, PBMs operated as claims processors, just handling the 
paperwork.\3\ But 15 years ago, when Medicare coverage expanded to 
include prescription drugs, PBMs offered to help health plans negotiate 
with drug companies for better prices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Feldman, Washington Post, supra note 1.

    But instead of prices coming down, prices of many drugs 
dramatically increased. For example, the prices of 65 common medicines 
have almost tripled, just during those 15 years.\4\ There are many 
contributing factors, but PBMs have been in the middle of it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Institute, ``Trends in retail prices of brand name prescription drugs 
widely used by older Americans, 2006 to 2020,'' 1-2 (2021).

    So how did this happen? How did PBMs--which were supposed to help 
negotiate lower prices--end up helping to inflate drug prices instead? 
Rather than act as honest brokers for the health plans, PBMs have acted 
in their own self-interest. And as it turns out, their own interests 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
are not aligned with low prices.

    Quite simply, higher prices put more dollars into a PBM's pockets. 
When the starting price of a drug rises, and the PBM negotiates a 
rebate, the PBM appears successful. It's like a store that raises the 
price of a coat before putting it on sale. The markdown looks like a 
great bargain; but it's not. In addition, the PBM often keeps a 
percentage of the rebate, so it gets to pocket more.

    All of this might not be so bad if no one actually paid that high 
list price. But people do. Many consumers have what are called high-
deductible plans, in which they pay that high list price out of their 
pockets until they reach a certain threshold;\5\ other plans require 
that patients pay a percentage of the high list price for what is known 
as co-insurance.\6\ And many Americans don't have coverage for 
prescription drugs, even if they have health insurance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ For an example of a plan requiring that the patient pay 100 
percent of the costs of drugs up to a certain limit, see the Anthem 
insurance plan described at First Am. Consolidated Class Action Compl., 
at para. 13, In re Express Scripts/Anthem ERISA Litigation, 2018 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 3081 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (No. 16-3399).
    \6\ See Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, Report to the 
Congress: Medicare Payment Policy, 408-09 (2017).

    I mentioned raising the price of a coat before you put it on sale. 
It gets worse. Imagine if the price jump is higher than the sale 
discount. That's what's happening with medicine. Medicine prices are 
rising faster than rebates. Between 2010 and 2017 in Medicare, prices 
for particular drugs after rebate still rose 313 percent on average.\7\ 
We are buying the same coat, but it is costing us more and more. And a 
significant portion of that price increase is going to PBMs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Feldman, Devil, supra note 1, at 19, 21-22.

    A PBM may be brokering deals for a health plan, but it is a strange 
relationship. PBMs refuse to tell the health plans--their own clients--
the details of the deals they are making. Neither health plans, nor the 
government, nor the market has any disclosure.\8\ Given their monopoly 
over pricing information, and the fact that just three PBMs control 
most of the market,\9\ PBMs are setting the terms of almost every 
arrangement. It is not a free or fair market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ PBMs refuse to disclose net prices, the precise size of 
rebates, or the details of the rebate terms, asserting that the 
information is a trade secret. Even auditors and regulators are not 
given full access. For an explanation of why prices and price terms 
negotiated between PBMs and drug companies do not constitute trade 
secrets, see Robin Feldman and Charles Tait Graves, ``Naked Price and 
Pharmaceutical Trade Secret Overreach,'' 22 Yale J.L. and Tech 61 
(2020).

    And despite the fact that PBMs should be serving as honest brokers 
for the health plans, PBMs also ask drug companies for side payments--
again, payments that rise when the price of the drug rises. And they 
vigorously deny having a fiduciary or any other type of duty to act in 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
the best interests of the health plan and its patients.

    So, what so PBMs do to protect their income stream of rebates and 
side payments? PBMs stand at the center. As well as negotiating prices, 
PBMs help decide if patients will be reimbursed and how much they will 
be reimbursed. So, when dealing with drug companies, PBMs can offer to 
exclude a drug company's competitor or make it harder for patients to 
get the competitor's medicine.\10\ As a result, less-expensive 
medicines are disadvantaged, and patients are channeled into higher-
priced drugs.

Handshakes: The Unstoppable Growth of Prescription Drug Prices'' 
(2019). For press reports and case allegations describing formulary

resulted in hospitals and health plan formularies essentially excluding 
the lower-priced biosimilar).

    Although the pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, the overview 
of these aspects of the problem can be summarized fairly simply: PBMs 
are able to exploit their role at the center to extract dollars and 
channel the system towards higher-priced drugs. Patients and taxpayers

must pick up the bill.

                                 ______
                                 
          Questions Submitted for the Record to Robin Feldman
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
    Question. What specific data and information should PBMs share with 
their health plan clients in order to mitigate possible conflicts of 
interest?

    Answer. For transparency aimed at reducing conflicts of interest, 
PBMs should reveal to their health plan clients the terms of any 
payment agreements with drug companies, along with the payment flows 
resulting from those agreements. This can help make the markets more 
fair, efficient, and transparent.

    For the basic drug supply agreements, transparency should include 
the terms of the agreements along with both the gross and net prices 
that result. These should be described at the level of the individual 
drug and dose, rather than in the aggregate. The information should 
include whether the payment terms are based on conditions such as 
filling a quantity of drugs or limiting competing drugs.

    Transparency also should include terms and payment flows related to 
any agreements PBMs have with drug companies, whether those are 
administrative fees, data management fees, or other payments. This 
follows the notion that if I'm negotiating on behalf of the health plan 
and its patients, I shouldn't be receiving payments from the other 
side. At the very least, the health plan should know what those 
payments are.

    Question. Please describe price protection clauses. What incentives 
do these clauses create for PBMs and manufacturers?

    Answer. I am aware of two types of price protection clauses. First, 
there is a recent innovation in PBM contracting with health plans that 
side-steps the issue of rebates paid by drug companies to PBMs and what 
the PBMs are doing with the rebate moneys. Known as ``price 
protection,'' this approach completely obscures payments from drug 
companies to the PBM. If a large plan with some level of market clout 
asks for access to contract terms and claims information, a PBM can 
offer, as an alternative, that the overall prices won't rise more than 
a certain amount. The PBM is essentially saying to the health plan, 
``Why engage in examining all that grubby detail when what you care 
about is the bottom line?'' Unfortunately, these price protection 
agreements simply obscure the agreements that block cheaper entrants 
from gaining a foothold in the market, entrants that could ultimately 
bring prices down.

    Second, some rebate agreements between drug companies and PBMs 
include a clause ensuring a form of price protection or most-favored-
nation status for the drug company. These clauses ensure that patients 
won't be given better access to the drug company's competitors in any 
way, presumably even if the competitor offers a lower price. These 
clauses encourage PBMs and manufacturers to maintain higher prices, at 
the expense of patients and payers.

              Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
    Question. Last year, Congress passed and President Biden signed 
into law the Inflation Reduction Act--which capped insulin prices for 
Medicare beneficiaries at $35 per month. Thanks to President Biden's 
leadership, drug manufacturers like Eli Lilly have followed suit and 
have voluntarily capped the price of insulin at $35 per month in the 
commercial market as well.

    What are your thoughts on expanding the insulin price cap to other 
classes of drugs--for example, drugs that are older, highly rebated, 
and/or treat chronic conditions? What are the key things that Congress 
should think about when considering this type of policy? What are the 
trade-offs and how can we prevent costs from ballooning in other parts 
of our health-care system when designing such a policy?

    Answer. Any relief to struggling patients is welcome relief. But 
copay caps alone have a hidden trade-off. Patients have no reason to 
choose a cost-effective drug over the expensive brand-name drug. Thus, 
it buys customer loyalty by shielding them from out-of-pocket costs. 
The plan, however, pays the lion's share of the price. If patients stay 
with the pricier product when less-expensive alternatives enter the 
market, that increases costs to the plan as a whole, which could flow 
through to higher premiums for all patients.

    Question. Thanks to the testimony of our witnesses and questions 
from my colleagues, we heard a good amount of discussion about the 
perverse incentives that exist in the market due to how PBMs make their 
money. To summarize, a significant source of revenue for PBMs are 
rebates and administrative fees that are often based on a drug's list 
price. This creates bizarre and perverse incentives that have been 
found to lead to increased drug list prices and higher-priced drugs on 
formulary lists so that PBMs can bring in more revenue. That's bad for 
patients and its bad for taxpayers. Dr. Gibbs in his testimony talked 
about the transparent, flat-fee pricing model that Capital Rx has put 
in place.

    What can we as policymakers learn from Capital Rx's pricing model 
and what proposals would you recommend we pursue to align pricing 
incentives in the various parts of the drug supply chain?

    Answer. I am not familiar with Capital Rx, so I cannot comment on 
its model. Certainly, a transparent model that eliminates the perverse 
incentives would be a great improvement. Of course, as I noted in 
response to a question for the record from Chairman Wyden, a PBM 
pricing model based on a simple fee would not, in itself, eliminate the 
perverse incentives. Some of the price-protection agreements in place--
in which PBMs guarantee that the overall price for a health plan will 
not rise more than a certain amount--may obscure agreements between the 
PBM and drug companies that block cheaper entrants from gaining a 
foothold in the market and ultimately bringing prices down. In that 
case, the price-protection approach simply encourages the plan not to 
ask too many questions, but leaves many of the problematic elements in 
place.

                                 ______
                                 
              Questions Submitted by Hon. Elizabeth Warren
    Question. There is evidence that manufacturers may engage in 
rebate-based negotiating strategies with PBMs to block competitors and 
secure preferential formulary placement. These strategies may be used 
in tandem and jointly result in distorted formulary designs that may 
favor higher-cost and less effective products.

    Please describe bundled rebates and rebate traps.

    Answer. The PBM industry has evolved in a manner that puts upward 
pressure on prices. The name of the game is volume. The more volume a 
drug company has with a particular PBM, and the greater the drug 
company's market share, the better the potential deal that the drug 
company can offer as an inducement to disfavor rival drugs.

    In simplified form, imagine a major drug company that sells 1 
million doses of a medication to a plan's patients.\1\ The company 
tells the PBM, ``we will give you a rebate of $1 per dose if you agree 
to disfavor our new competitor.'' That deal is worth a million dollars 
in rebates. A new entrant, selling a small number of doses, could never 
offer enough off the price of the drug to compensate for the million-
dollar rebate offered by the major player. When a drug company has a 
portfolio of drugs to bundle together in a rebate offer, the 
opportunities for drug companies increase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ For an expanded version of this hypothetical using beer bottles 
as an analogy and citations to allegations in various drug industry 
cases, see Robin Feldman, ``Drugs, Money and Secret Handshakes,'' 21-31 
(Cambridge 2019).

    Bundled rebates take different forms. A drug company could offer 
the PBM an especially high rebate if the PBM's client accumulates a 
certain volume of multiple different drugs the company makes. In that 
case, a competitor that sells only one drug could never offer a 
comparable volume and thus could never offer a similarly high rebate. 
Or if a drug company is selling two drugs--one that is well-protected 
by patents against competition and one that is vulnerable to 
competition--the drug company could offer a break on the price of the 
well-protected drug (because the company doesn't fear competition) in 
exchange for a preferred formulary placement for the drug facing 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
competition.

    Real world examples abound. A suit against Allergan alleged that 
the company used bundled rebates to preserve its market share for the 
dry-eye medication Restasis. According to a Medicare plan administrator 
quoted in the complaint, given the company's scheme, a competitor could 
give the new drug away for free, and the numbers still wouldn't work--
meaning that the new drug still wouldn't get reasonable formulary 
access and consumers still wouldn't end up switching to the new drug. 
That is a striking comment, and it captures the raw power of bundled 
rebates.\2\

that Shire could offer on [its own drug] Xiidra''); cf. Shire U.S. Inc. 
v. Allergan, Inc., 375 F. Supp. 3d 538 (D.N.J. 2019) (granting motion 
to dismiss complaint because alleged relevant product market was 
defined so narrowly as to exclude entities that could have purchased 
Shire's drug, and because Shire did not allege that it couldn't itself 
offer bundled rebates or that bundled drugs generating Allergan's 
bundled rebate included any drug over which Allergan had monopoly 
power).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question. How might these practices influence formularies?

    Answer. With volume and bundled rebates, more expensive drugs 
receive preferred positions on formularies. And research suggests that 
generic drugs are increasingly losing out on formulary placement. 
Between 2010 and 2017, the percentage of generics on the most-preferred 
tier dropped from 73 percent to 28 percent.\3\

Biosci. 1 (2021).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question. What effect might they have on patient drug costs?

    Answer. When patients are channeled into higher-priced drugs, their 
costs rise. For example, any co-insurance payments that are based on a 
percentage of the drug's costs will be higher.

    Considering only costs paid by patients and the Federal low-income 
subsidy program, improper tiering conservatively resulted in $4.17 
billion in wasted cost in 2017 alone.\4\

Biosci. 1 (2021).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Question. What effect might they have on overall drug spending?

    Answer. These perverse incentives have caused dramatic increases in 
spending on medicine throughout the health-care system. As one doctor 
pointed out, it is ``Alice-in-Wonderland-time in the drug world.''\5\ 
And it's our money going down the rabbit hole.

 Prepared Statement of Matthew Gibbs, Pharm.D., President, Capital Rx 
                                  Inc.
    My name is Matthew Aaron Gibbs, and I am a doctor of pharmacy, also 
known as a Pharm.D. I have been in the pharmacy benefit management 
(``PBM'') and managed care industry for over 20 years serving in 
various roles, including managing clinical strategy, sales leadership, 
negotiating contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers, mail service 
and specialty home delivery operations, and most recently serving as a 
member of the executive team at Capital Rx, where I am the current 
president of the company. I have been at Capital Rx for nearly 3 years, 
and before joining Capital Rx, I served as president of another mid-
market PBM for 4 years. I have also managed two of the Nation's largest 
pharmacy consulting groups advising Fortune 100 companies on their 
procurement strategies for selecting PBM partners. Additionally, I have 
pharmacy expertise in all the relevant lines of business: Medicare, 
Medicaid, commercial insured plans, ACA/exchange, and self-funded 
employers of all types.

    I am honored and humbled to address this committee regarding 
growing concerns around prescription drug pricing in the United States.

    We must first take a step back to truly understand the problem and 
think through solutions. Since PBMs emerged in the 1990s they have 
played a critical role in the pharmacy and overall health care supply 
chain. PBMs were at the forefront of technology, connecting all 
pharmacies in the U.S. via a single and uniform communication logic 
known as The National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP). 
This logic allows pharmacies, regardless of owner or chain name, to 
communicate safety edits, drug-to-drug interactions, disease-to-drug 
interactions, and patient payment information related to out-of-pocket 
costs. This happens within milliseconds and is arguably the most 
efficient transaction in all of health care. Through the early 2000s 
PBMs gained in market share, but the business model was still simpler 
than today-they generally collected a fair and equitable per-claim 
transaction fee that was disclosed and understood by the payer. As PBMs 
grew in scale and brand drug inflation increased, they began to 
negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers on rebates for 
preferred placement on the PBMs' formularies. While this approach 
likely saved payers significant dollars initially, the dollars related 
to rebates became the lifeblood of every PBM. Additionally, PBMs 
created different definitions around what is considered a ``rebate.'' 
There were new terms such as administrative fees, market basket fees, 
data aggregation fees, etc. With this development came a web of complex 
layers of rebate payment terms and definitions, which created an opaque 
matrix of financial terms that became impossible for any employer or 
government entity to truly understand or track.

    These rebate payments, or as I like to say, ``pharmaceutical 
revenue,'' were not enough for the PBMs in terms of what they needed to 
optimize revenue. The market shifted in an interesting and arguably 
suspicious direction by choosing consolidation over innovation. It is 
no secret to anyone on the committee that (1) around 70 percent to 80 
percent of the PBM market share is controlled by three major 
organizations; (2) each of these has either been purchased by an 
insurance carrier or has purchased an insurance carrier themselves; and 
(3) the major PBMs also own dispensing assets for mail service and 
Specialty home delivery, and in certain circumstances a retail pharmacy 
chain. This ``all-in-one'' option has narrowed the marketplace and 
forced even more consolidation and fewer options for payers. I'll stop 
there and leave the issue in the capable hands of the Federal Trade 
Commission, which is presently reviewing these concerns.

    Last and certainly not least is the fact that nearly all payers 
utilize what I can only characterize as a ``less than ideal'' pricing 
benchmark as the standard for all drug pricing in the United States. 
This pricing benchmark, known as Average Wholesale Price (AWP), was the 
primary source of a class action lawsuit that required one of the major 
publishers of AWP to stop production of the benchmark no later than 
September 2011. AWP is not related to the retail acquisition cost of a 
pharmaceutical product. There was hope in the market at the time that a 
new industry benchmark would emerge. Unfortunately, most PBMs migrated 
to another publishing index available on the market, and AWP survived.

    However, in response to many State Medicaid plans, the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) did something great and started 
the process of creating and establishing the National Average Drug 
Acquisition Cost (NADAC) index. This new benchmark was initially 
published in draft form in 2012. It is based on voluntary survey data 
from retail pharmacies that report their invoiced acquisition costs at 
the drug level to CMS. This is performed as frequently as weekly and is 
available on a free public website. It should be noted that AWP data, 
by comparison, is a subscription-based service, and anyone wishing to 
review and audit AWP may have to purchase a license to examine their 
own drug cost benchmark data.

    Founded in 2017, Capital Rx set out to change the way drugs are 
priced and patients are cared for to create enduring social change. We 
are over 1 million members strong across payers, including employers, 
union trusts, municipalities, school districts, commercial health 
plans, Medicare, and managed Medicaid clients. As a proud member of our 
executive team, I can confidently say Capital Rx has both financially 
and clinically aligned interests with its clients. In fact, Capital Rx 
is the only full-service PBM serving all lines of business and one of 
the relatively few health-care companies that have earned B Corp<SUP>TM</SUP> 
certification, to my knowledge. This is the ultimate testament to 
aligning the company's interests with the patient and committing to 
``being a force for good'' for society.

    Our pricing model abandons the traditional AWP model and utilizes 
NADAC as the primary pricing benchmark. We have a Single-Ledger model 
that aligns our ``books''--the drug manufacturer and pharmacy side of 
the house always aligns with the accounting on the client side of the 
house. We do not retain rebates or ``spread'' from any pharmacy or 
manufacturer contract. We are paid a fair administrative fee which is 
disclosed in our client contracts and appears as a line item on every 
client invoice. In full transparency, we also receive disclosed fees 
for additional clinical services that we may provide to a client as 
well, but the point is that there's no gray area. Everyone can (1) see 
the price of the drug; and (2) clients don't have to question if all 
``other'' revenue is passed through to them or they paid a fair price.

    The best way to describe what we do is to give a real-life example 
to which everyone can relate. If you have a headache and go to a 
pharmacy to pick up an over-the-counter option to get some relief, 
you'll see quickly that your options--Tylenol, Advil, Aleve, the 
generic options--have a price on the shelf, and you know what you are 
going to pay when you go to the register. However, if you walk to the 
back of the store to pick up a prescription, you're spinning a roulette 
wheel and hoping for the best based on what you know about your 
benefits; or, if you're uninsured or underinsured, what you've read 
about the price online. You cannot see or know what you will have to 
pay for that medication. That's because of AWP and the aforementioned 
contract complexity. It doesn't have to be like that. Today's pricing 
framework does not empower the pharmacist to explain why a drug costs 
one amount one month and then costs something different the next month. 
We have all been conditioned that ``this is how it is and has to be.'' 
It's simply not true.

    In my opinion, the traditional PBMs have trained everyone to 
believe that drug pricing is unstable, but they are utilizing complex 
algorithms to minimize their contractual reimbursements to pharmacies 
while at the same time not sharing the ``savings'' from this 
reimbursement reduction with the patient or the payer. This spread 
pricing game must stop. And while Medicare specifically prohibits this 
practice, most commercial and some managed Medicaid contracts still 
allow it to continue. One solution is to use NADAC as a publicly 
available benchmark price as the source of truth for drug costs. Is it 
perfect? No. Is it fundamentally better than the AWP industry standard? 
Absolutely. Are there ways to make it even better? Again, absolutely.

    My simple message is this: every drug should have a price that is 
available for all to see and creates equity, thereby improving access 
for all Americans. It should be reported by all pharmacies, including 
retail, mail, and specialty home delivery, so patients and payers have 
day-to-day transparency on drug costs.

    I'll leave you with a final message. I have worked my entire career 
to drive transparency into the pharmacy supply chain. We are at a 
pivotal moment in history where we can finally change what is broken 
and bring rational drug-level pricing to the American people. The fix 
is simple because the mechanisms are in place to allow both sides of 
the transaction--anywhere in the U.S.--to see the price of a drug.

    Thank you, Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and this 
committee, for your time on this crucial issue.

                                 ______
                                 
     Questions Submitted for the Record to Matthew Gibbs, Pharm.D.
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
    Question. What specific data and information should PBMs share with 
their health plan clients in order to mitigate possible conflicts of 
interest?

    Answer. Capital Rx believes that the Consolidated Appropriations 
Act (CAA) made great strides in increasing transparency in the PBM 
market by mandating certain information be shared with plan sponsors 
and ultimately the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and 
Department of Labor (DOL) as well. In so doing, prescription drug data 
collection (RxDC) allows CMS and other regulatory agencies to identify 
potential sources of administrative inefficiencies. As such, CAA 
promotes mitigating potential conflicts of interest in the market. 
Further, Capital Rx anticipates that CAA will allow plan sponsors to 
begin making better-informed, and more cost-effective purchasing 
decisions.

    Our organization posits expanding RxDC reporting elements will 
further drive market alignment. We believe that true transparency in 
the form of mandated disclosure of the following data elements will 
allow lawmakers and regulators to meaningfully analyze the state of the 
current PBM market:

         PBM profit per prescription dispensed by PBM-owned assets at 
        mail order, specialty home delivery, and retail chain 
        pharmacies.
         PBM retained rebates and other revenue received from 
        manufacturers either directly, or through affiliated Group 
        Purchasing Organizations (GPOs), and rebate aggregation 
        partners.
         Revenue retained by brokerage firms as part of the 
        procurement process for plan sponsors. Currently, part of 
        section 202 of CAA however, we recommend that section 202 be 
        expanded to include PBMs.

    As an extension of the above point, we believe that better plan 
oversight is paramount in mitigating conflicts of interest. We also 
encourage the adoption of more robust health plan procurement standards 
to ensure financial alignment and mitigate conflicts of interest.

    Question. Please detail the strengths and weaknesses of the 
National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) benchmark. How could 
NADAC be enhanced?

    Answer. Below please find an assessment of the strengths and 
weaknesses of NADAC, as experienced through Capital Rx's use of NADAC 
for our full book of business. Most proposed enhancements, also noted 
below, focus on increasing participation in the CMS survey model.
                           strengths of nadac
    Capital Rx's position is to remain conflict-free in setting pricing 
benchmarks to protect our model's integrity and provide a fully aligned 
arrangement to plan sponsors. First published in draft form in 2012, 
NADAC has proven to be an effective pricing benchmark for fee-for-
service Medicaid plans. Moreover, NADAC is the closest national drug 
pricing benchmark that calculates the true average acquisition cost for 
retail pharmacies to purchase a medication. Provided at the NDC-11 
level, all drugs reported to CMS under NADAC have an established retail 
price. Capital Rx chose NADAC because it is the market's least 
conflicted option available today.

    In contrast, Average Wholesale Price (AWP) is derived from a 
calculation of Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) and is not generally 
related to the actual ``cost'' of a medication across the supply chain. 
According to a study Capital Rx developed in partnership with 3 Axis 
Advisors in 2020, NADAC prices for generic drugs deflated by 44 
percent, while the AWP price index inflated by 1 percent. This study 
analyzed price fluctuations from 2015 to 2020 for the top 1,200 generic 
drugs in our 2019 book of business.

    By using NADAC, Capital Rx's Single-Ledger model:

         Eliminates easily manipulated annual guarantees based on 
        average AWP discounts and Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) lists.
         Establishes a single, accurate price for nearly all NDCs, 
        pegged to acquisition costs.
         Eliminates price variability across employer contracts.
         Eliminates price volatility for patients at the point of 
        sale.
         Provides fair reimbursement to pharmacies.
         Empowers patients to understand drug prices and make 
        informed health-care decisions.
         Allows Capital Rx to focus on improving plan performance and 
        patient outcomes.
                          weaknesses of nadac
    NADAC is published through a CMS-administered survey, and 
acquisition cost is voluntarily self-reported by some pharmacies. 
Independent pharmacies and smaller chains most often respond to NADAC 
surveys. As such, larger pharmacies and chains typically prefer not to 
share certain information and rarely, if ever, fill out NADAC surveys.

    Furthermore, NADAC represents an estimated ``blended average'' of 
actual drug costs, not a precise measure at the chain level. As such, a 
handful of drugs do not have an assigned NADAC price (usually <1 
percent of a typical client's utilization). In such cases, PBMs like 
Capital Rx, who primarily use NADAC, must rely upon AWP for the subset 
of drugs without a NADAC price.
                    enhancements to the nadac survey
    Given the weaknesses noted above, there are several areas where 
NADAC could be improved. We suggest the following:

         Mandate all retail pharmacies who participate in Medicare/
        Medicaid programs to respond to the NADAC survey when requested 
        by CMS.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ This type of requirement is similar to Medicaid requirements 
imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers that participate in the 
Medicaid program and are required to participate in the 340B program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Mandatory reporting by all mail service pharmacies to create 
        a separate NADAC-mail index average.
         Mandatory reporting by all specialty home delivery 
        pharmacies to create a separate NADAC-specialty drug index 
        average.
         Inclusion of ``off invoice'' discounts as part of the net 
        cost invoice submission for NADAC reporting across all 
        dispensing channels.

                Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
    Question. Can you share some details about the way your current PBM 
is structured, and how you think this can be implemented in the market 
more broadly? Are these solutions scalable?

    Answer. The following paragraphs describe the main differentiators 
of Capital Rx's business model. To preface our description, it is 
important for the committee to understand that as a health-care 
technology company, our success and the scalability of our model is 
partly dependent upon our next-generation technical solution, JUDI. 
Through an investment of over $100 million in our platform, JUDI 
delivers unequaled scale at the highest standard of operational 
efficiency currently available in the industry. To put this in 
perspective, JUDI can process all the prescription claim transactions 
in the U.S. each year, with no change to our existing architecture or 
infrastructure. In comparison, legacy PBMs continue to utilize 
platforms which are inefficient and inflexible.

    JUDI, coupled with our Single-Ledger model, aligns the financial 
interest of the PBM with its clients. We have been able to scale our 
business and allocate our resources to critical aspects of the supply 
chain--thereby lowering costs for plan sponsors and patients while 
advancing best-in-class clinical outcomes and driving high patient and 
plan sponsor satisfaction.

    Capital Rx's position is that competitors can adopt modern 
technology and reinforce financial alignment to streamline manual 
processes and reduce overall operational costs, thereby passing said 
savings through to plan sponsors and their patients.
   capital rx is financially aligned with plan sponsors and patients
    Beyond our commitment to passing through 100 percent of all 
received rebate revenue, Capital Rx takes the mystery out of 
prescription drug pricing. The result is a fairer, fully aligned system 
with the ability to deliver untapped value from the supply chain by 
ensuring everyone knows exactly what they are getting and what it 
costs:

         We remain agnostic and allow patients to fill prescriptions 
        at any pharmacy in good standing. This allows Capital Rx to 
        serve as a truly objective strategic partner to our clients. 
        Free from this conflict of interest, we focus on the things 
        that matter--providing exemplary service, reducing costs, and 
        improving the health and well-being of our patients.

         Capital Rx operates using a Single-Ledger model and passes 
        100 percent of manufacturer revenue to our clients. We do not 
        believe drug pricing is proprietary, and all patients should be 
        able to freely access and receive the lowest prescription price 
        available. Because we do not look to retain any rebates, or 
        other manufacturer-derived revenue, we are free from any 
        conflict and are able to apply formulary management strategies 
        that drive the most cost-
        effective, clinically appropriate therapies to manage the 
        patients' health.

         We do not inflate or manipulate drug prices at retail, mail, 
        and specialty fulfillment. The current prescription pricing 
        system looks like drug prices change every hour, of every day, 
        in every pharmacy. This artificial pricing volatility is 
        fiction, and unfortunately creates a system of winners and 
        losers in the U.S. health-care system. Our Single-Ledger model 
        ensures every patient receives the same low price for each 
        drug.

    As such, we remain agile and unconflicted to support a framework 
that focuses on cost-reduction strategies supported by advanced data 
and analytics, improving patient outcomes and service excellence.
                  capital rx is driven by our mission
    Capital Rx's mission is to change the way prescriptions are priced 
and patients are cared for to create enduring social change. Each 
individual of our company--from our CEO to our employees caring for 
patients each and every day--is invested in this mission. By 
transforming the conventional relationship between plan sponsors and 
PBMs, we are leading the path toward reducing prescription drug costs 
with greater efficiency and simplicity.
             capital rx is committed to client satisfaction
    As a core aspect of our client services model, we prioritize speed 
and efficiency. We provide front-line clinical expertise, and each 
account executive is a registered pharmacist. We find this model 
improves efficiency, strengthens relationships, and yields a superior, 
clinically focused experience. Our client services culture emphasizes 
cross-functional collaboration, ensuring clear lines of communication 
that prevent delays and avoidable errors.

    From our state-of-the-art technology to our experienced and 
innovative staff, Capital Rx's comprehensive suite of PBM services 
delivers a new paradigm of service excellence, operational efficiency, 
cost savings, and the highest standards of clinical care. Our approach 
to client service is a key reason we have earned an unprecedented Net 
Promoter Score (NPS) of 96, a measure of client satisfaction.
 capital rx has received industry-leading patient satisfaction ratings
    Capital Rx treats pharmacy benefits as an investment, encouraging a 
holistic view of health care that focuses on achieving the highest 
level of patient care. Capital Rx's Customer Care Center employs 
representatives with distinct subject matter expertise who work to 
understand each client's clinical requirements and recognize, 
appreciate, and respect pharmacy, provider, and patient concerns.

    In 2022, Capital Rx was presented with a Bronze Stevie Award in 
the Customer Service Department of the Year--Healthcare, 
Pharmaceuticals, and Related Industries category at the 16th Annual 
Stevie Awards for Sales and Customer Service. The Stevie Awards for 
Sales and Customer Service are the world's top honors for customer 
service.

    Our approach to patient care is why we have earned a current 
overall satisfaction rating of 99 percent on post-call customer 
satisfaction surveys.
 capital rx uses next-generation technology to drive efficiencies and 
                     improve the patient experience
    JUDI unifies all pharmacy operations within one ecosystem. Through 
the use of a fully serverless architecture, JUDI allows for 
unprecedented scalability, instant rightsizing, and the unique 
capability to handle clients of any size. In fact, one instance of JUDI 
can process 3.6 billion claims per year. Our cloud-based architecture 
provides limitless scale for Capital Rx to efficiently handle all the 
prescription transactions in the U.S., at a fractional cost.

    JUDI underlies our success in the industry--and enables a level of 
efficiency never thought possible in health-care management. For 
example, while it takes other PBMs 30-45 hours to implement a plan 
design change, JUDI is able to make plan design changes in under 5 
minutes.
               capital rx is agnostic to drug dispensing
    Since our only source of revenue is a flat administrative fee and 
fully disclosed ancillary administrative fees, we have no financial 
interest in where a prescription is filled. We believe a PBM should 
focus on the administration of the pharmacy program, not the 
fulfillment of prescriptions.

    This approach allows Capital Rx to focus on meeting our clients' 
unique needs, benefit designs, and pricing arrangements as they relate 
to the administration and adjudication of claims.

    Question. You specifically call out spread pricing as a practice 
that should be prohibited, but are there other practices that you would 
like to expand on that you think are detrimental to the currently 
pharmaceutical supply chain structure?

    Answer. Other than combating spread pricing practices, we believe 
the following common industry practices create opacity in the current 
supply chain:

         Alignment with the Plan Sponsor: PBMs have an incredible 
        responsibility as the administrators of pharmacy benefit plans. 
        Among the hundreds of tasks required to run a prescription 
        benefit plan, a PBM develops client specific formularies 
        (access to specific drugs), conducts clinical review (patient 
        safety), and authorization (approval of high-cost medication). 
        Unfortunately, there is an inherent conflict of interest when a 
        PBM utilizes a spread-pricing model. Under a spread-pricing 
        model, the more expensive the drug, the more money a PBM makes. 
        Furthermore, the higher the price of a medication rises 
        (inflation), spread pricing yields greater revenue. Why else 
        would traditional PBMs (that use spread pricing) prefer high 
        rebate yield drugs on formularies, maintain abnormally high 
        approval rates on costly medication, and rarely intervene when 
        a patient is not responding to an expensive medication.

           Quite simply, if a PBM does not make money on drugs (spread 
        pricing), the PBM is no longer conflicted and can consider 
        lower-priced medications, focus on patient outcomes, and adjust 
        treatment plans without financial consideration. To fix this 
        problem a PBM (including the parent organization and all 
        affiliates) should not be allowed to make money on drug spend. 
        If a company wants to make money on drug spend, the company 
        should be a manufacturer, wholesaler, or pharmacy. However, if 
        a company wants to administrate a pharmacy benefit plan on 
        behalf of an employer or a government entity, it should be 
        prohibited from making money on drug spend (spread pricing).

         Data Sharing: As consolidation has been the primary growth 
        driver in the PBM marketplace, there have also been major 
        restrictions placed on payer data. For payers who utilize 
        different medical and PBM administrators there are often 
        obstacles created by vertically integrated organizations and 
        several large regional health plans, that restrict or 
        financially penalize the sharing of critical plan/patient data. 
        The data is utilized for payers who have integrated deductibles 
        or use a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) option for their 
        employees/members. Not having access to this plan/patient data 
        forces payers to continue using a limited number of PBM and 
        health plan providers. Payer data should be exchanged among all 
        PBMs and health plans in a unified format and at no cost to the 
        end payer. Capital Rx built JUDI with an open API architecture, 
        which enables payers to efficiently access and securely share 
        data without any restrictions.

                                 ______
                                 
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Tim Scott
    Question. I have seen a lot of information regarding the gross-to-
net bubble, the difference between a drug's list price and net price, 
which can be quite sizeable when there are rebates paid by the 
manufacturer. Reporting from many sources, including KPMG, Drug 
Channels, and others, share that discounts from manufacturers are often 
higher than 50 percent in Part D. Yet, patients who purchase those 
medicines do not share in those rebates. The PBM business model today 
has evolved to a point where they are now often owned by or own an 
insurer, a large pharmacy chain, or both.

    Can you discuss some of the innovative PBM models that are 
springing up to address some of the pain points of the legacy market 
using free market principals?

    Answer. First, Capital Rx would posit that the current PBM market 
does not adhere to free market principles. Artificial drug pricing--one 
set of prices for pharmacy reimbursement and another set of prices for 
each plan sponsor is flawed and allows PBMs to manipulate the price of 
each prescription. In most other markets, clear prices for goods and 
services are freely exchanged, which encourages competition and allows 
consumers to make informed decisions. As such, Capital Rx's Single-
Ledger model solves two fundamental problems with the pharmaceutical 
supply chain and the traditional PBM model by leveraging a single drug 
price for plan sponsors, the PBM, and pharmacies.

    Second, it is clear that the PBM industry, in general, needs to 
focus on modernizing the way in which basic tasks are performed. Most 
infrastructure utilized by PBMs is 20-30 years old. Literally hundreds 
of human capital-intensive tasks associated with administering pharmacy 
benefits are performed using human capital-
intensive, manual processes.

    Moreover, our recently developed Enterprise Pharmacy Platform, 
JUDI, helps our clients--including those focused on Medicare and 
Medicaid populations--understand what's happening with their pharmacy 
programs in real time. The level of transparency and visibility allows 
health plans, for example, to better project costs. Ultimately, 
innovation through technological enhancements will need to happen to 
decrease costs for plan sponsors and patients in the United States.

    Third, we would argue that traditional PBMs which own mail and 
specialty home delivery assets deploy specific channel steerage 
campaigns and pricing strategies to maximize their earnings while at 
the same time limiting patient choice and potentially increasing cost.

    Question. Where in the process can PBMs provide additional 
meaningful data and transparency to understand how manufacturer rebates 
are calculated and impact the cost of drugs for patients in addition to 
utilization management requirements which may interfere with patients 
receiving the optimal treatment selected in consultation with their 
physicians?

    Answer. Conventional PBMs enforce weak utilization management 
criteria for a subset of high-cost drugs and thus have recorded higher 
prior authorization approval ratings. We would encourage the committee 
to analyze whether negotiated utilization management criteria drives 
higher rebate yield or whether a pure low net cost, access-based rebate 
approach with more stringent utilization management criteria would 
decrease costs for plan sponsors and patients.

    Capital Rx does not make money from the dispensing of high-cost 
drugs and, as such, our clinical teams freely make prior authorization 
(PA) decisions unbiased by the financial implications for Capital Rx. 
To date, we have witnessed PA approval rates well below industry 
averages, and we believe this has significantly decreased drug spend 
for plan sponsors while ensuring that patients are receiving clinically 
appropriate medications. While Capital Rx's approval rates for these 
expensive medications is lower than the traditional market leading 
PBMs, our member satisfaction remains at 99 percent, given the fact we 
utilize pharmacists in every review and consult for critical 
medications which require a PA. Having clinician to clinician 
consultants on these critical medications is not the industry norm and 
is often the source of patient and client frustration regarding 
medication access. Capital Rx's clinical team guides each PA through a 
white-glove process and engages the prescriber with viable alternatives 
or appropriate first line therapies which are often more affordable for 
the member and less costly for the payer.

    Capital Rx would also recommend that the Finance Committee review 
the latest submissions tied to the Consolidated Appropriations Act 
(CAA) section 204 and review the ``spread'' margin being retained by 
PBMs as well as any pharmaceutical manufacturer revenue retained by a 
PBM from its clients.

    Prepared Statement of Jonathan E. Levitt, Co-Founding Partner, 
                     Frier Levitt Attorneys at Law
    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the Senate 
Committee on Finance, thank you for inviting me to testify today 
regarding the role of pharmacy benefit managers in the drug supply 
chain and their impact on taxpayers, patients, and other stakeholders.

    My name is Jonathan Levitt. I'm not an economist or an academic. I 
am a trial lawyer in the trenches within the drug space, and founder of 
a healthcare and life sciences law firm called Frier Levitt. We 
represent stakeholders in the drug supply chain, including 
manufacturers, distributors, associations of providers, like community 
oncologists, but, most relevant to this hearing, we serve independent 
specialty pharmacies and retail pharmacies. I've been studying pharmacy 
benefit managers for over 20 years.

    We thank the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance for holding this 
important hearing.

    Testimony Summary:

    The actions of the largest six pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs)--
that is six PBMs that control 96 percent of the Nation's prescription 
drug market--have adversely impacted all stakeholders in the drug 
supply chain, including patients, pharmacy providers, plan sponsors, 
and taxpayers. Interested individuals and entities looking to 
faithfully serve governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid 
(and private plans) are at the mercy of PBMs and their vertically 
integrated healthcare conglomerates.

    The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have 
outsourced the drug benefit to private PBMs, who have proven unable to 
responsibly wield that massive industry power. Governmental programs 
are only recently awakening to PBMs financial manipulation.

    PBM-imposed direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees force our 
sickest beneficiaries to pay artificially inflated copay and 
coinsurance. Specialty pharmacies, often accredited in specialty 
disease states to improve patient outcomes, face lower reimbursement 
rates and higher DIR fees. PBMs force manufacturers to raise their list 
price, in exchange for formulary placement. Drug manufacturers and 
distributors fear retaliation by vertically integrated PBMs that own 
our country's largest chain and specialty pharmacies and are 
manufacturers' largest customers, the largest purchasers of the 
manufacturers' drugs. The result is that PBM-owned pharmacies have a 
materially lower acquisition cost on the ``buy side'' and better 
reimbursement rates on the ``sell side'' when paid by their sister 
PBMs.

    Even PBMs theoretically competing with one another cut each other 
special deals. Independent pharmacies are then forced to pay higher 
acquisition costs while PBMs simultaneously reduce reimbursement rates 
and then acquire the independent pharmacies causing further 
consolidation.

    Public scrutiny of PBMs is in its infancy while the PBMs' tactics 
have been developed over several years. Previously left entirely 
unchecked, PBMs have designed a system where most disputes are 
``resolved'' in complete secrecy, cloaked behind gag clauses, 
confidentiality agreements, and private arbitrations. In other 
instances, PBMs avoid such disputes altogether through actual or 
threatened retaliation.

    PBMs' tactics are driving independent pharmacies out of business, 
creating pharmacy ``deserts,'' especially in rural areas; fueling list 
drug prices higher for all Americans; and delaying and denying 
treatment for the sickest Americans, those with cancer and other 
serious diseases. These are only a few of PBMs' adverse impacts.

    Today, I implore the committee to end this era of the large PBM 
stranglehold on the nation's healthcare system.

    Detailed Testimony:

    Pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs claim to lower the price of drugs 
for consumers, taxpayers, large employer groups, and governmental 
programs. But these claims are not supported by unbiased empirical 
evidence and do not hold up when scrutinized. In fact, such scrutiny is 
aggressively and effectively suppressed by PBMs. Medicare's Part D 
Program is estimated to cost $119 billion in 2023. While CMS has sought 
to form a public-private partnership between the Medicare Part D 
program and Part D Plan Sponsors, CMS and such Part D Plan Sponsors 
have outsourced the Medicare Part D Program to privately owned largely 
unchecked PBMs who have amassed sister companies that profit from every 
angle of the Medicare Program. PBMs utilize oppressive tactics, such as 
direct and indirect remuneration--or DIR fees--to retroactively reduce 
pharmacy providers' reimbursement rates, often times, below actual 
acquisition costs for such drugs meaning that every time the provider 
dispenses the drug, they take a loss. We know only through litigation 
that CMS has not evaluated the methodology PBMs use to judge patient 
medication adherence, which is the largest segment that determines the 
pharmacy's oppressive DIR fee rate. Victims of PBMs' conduct include 
the United States Government; Tricare and our military; specialty 
pharmacies; retail pharmacies; oncology groups that dispense drugs to 
cancer patients; and most importantly, numerous Americans: the 
consumer, the taxpayer, and most importantly, the patient.

    PBMs are directly--not theoretically--responsible for the increased 
list price of drugs. I testify today with the hopes of reframing the 
narrative. Drug manufacturers save lives. Of course, drug manufacturers 
are in the business to make money and have responsibility in setting 
drug prices. However, the gap between drug list prices and actual net 
prices are due to PBMs' specific actions. PBMs, through their secret 
sister companies, siphon a huge percentage of the list price of drugs 
as profits to CVS Health, Cigna and UnitedHealth, all of whom own 
little known companies called ``rebate aggregators.'' Often you won't 
find PBMs' rebate aggregators in the United States. This is true for 
Cigna and UnitedHealth; Cigna owns Express Scripts, one of the big 
three PBMs, and also owns Ascent Health Services--its rebate 
aggregator, which is located in Switzerland. UnitedHealth owns a PBM 
called OptumRx and also a rebate aggregator called Emisar Pharma 
Services, located in Ireland. CVS Health owns a PBM called CVS 
Caremark, and a rebate aggregator called Zinc.

    Consider the case of a manufacturer of oncology drugs that wants to 
get their lifesaving cancer therapy into the hands of oncologists and 
the oncologists' patients. How does the manufacturer accomplish that? 
The manufacturer must pay tribute to the PBM-owned rebate aggregator to 
get the drug placed onto a list of drugs that the PBM makes available 
to government programs, large employer groups, and of course to 
patients. This list is called a drug formulary.

    On the topic of drug rebates, a staggering percentage of our 
nation's drug spend is retained by these vertically integrated 
companies. Manufacturers pay rebates and believe, wrongly, that the 
full rebate is passed along to the plan sponsor. Manufacturers fear 
auditing PBM-owned rebate aggregators. After all, PBM-owned chains and 
specialty pharmacies are the largest buyers of the manufacturer's 
drugs. PBMs decide which drugs get on formulary, which drugs will have 
``higher tier copay'' or ``step therapy'' or prior authorization and 
whether pharmacies will profit or lose money when dispensing drugs. 
These processes are an artifice and merely a PBM tool to extract 
rebates. PBMs wield this power to gain unfair advantages for each of 
their vertically integrated companies. PBMs frequently make decisions 
about which drugs will be on a specific formulary not based upon the 
efficacy of the drug, but based upon how much of a rebate can be 
negotiated and retained by the PBM.

    The 340B program has come under substantial public scrutiny. But 
few realize that PBMs have drained the system of a huge percentage of 
benefit intended for patients and communities in need. Congress never 
intended the 340B program to benefit large for-profit corporations that 
provide little, if any, direct patient care for vulnerable populations. 
Furthermore, PBMs siphon money from the 340B drug program by improperly 
assessing DIR fees imposed on 340B prescriptions filled by independent 
pharmacy providers, by exacting huge fees from covered entities. PBM-
owned pharmacies act as contract pharmacies, by imposing huge 
percentage-based administrative fees when PBM-owned third party 
administrators reconcile 340B claims on behalf of covered entities, and 
by paying pharmacies substantially less for 340B claims for no reason 
other than to retain profits which is money intended for the 
underserved.

    Rebate aggregators invite manufacturers to attend meetings to 
discuss rebates, and manufacturers must bring their checkbooks. But 
when rebates lead to higher ``list price of drugs,'' it's the patient, 
big employer groups, and Federal and State governments that ultimately 
pay the bill. In case you are wondering, all rebates are not fully 
passed through to the plans.

    Rebate aggregators tell manufacturers the following. The first 
thing you must know is that you are going to pay a non-negotiable 
administrative fee and data fee that equals 5 percent. To put that in 
perspective, the United States total spend on retail drugs was $420 
billion before rebates, with $301 billion dollars spent on specialty 
drugs. That 5 percent combined administrative and data fee is likely 
close to $20 billion. I want to emphasize how substantial in scope that 
5 percent administrative fee is, in the context of the specialty drug 
marketplace. That PBM fee and income does not even include the portion 
of the drug rebate not passed along to plan sponsors. Consequently, 
manufacturers must constantly increase the list price of drugs to 
maintain the same margin.

    The 5-percent administrative and data fee must also be analyzed in 
the context of patient care. Specialty pharmacies are critical 
providers that serve our Nation's sickest patients. They do so on 
margins that are often less than 5 percent. In other words, PBM rebate 
aggregators make far more money than our Nation's providers who 
actually do the clinical work to serve our sickest patients. That is 
perverse. Incredibly, CVS Health's ``Caremark Specialty Pharmacy'' 
controls nearly 30 percent of all specialty drugs dispensed in the 
United States. Express Scripts and UnitedHealth's specialty pharmacies 
control another 23 percent and 14 percent respectively. That is not 
because of PBM-owned specialty pharmacies' clinical superiority, or 
patient choice. It's because of vertical integration and 
anticompetitive behavior.

    I mentioned that I am a trial attorney and as a trial attorney, I 
get to take depositions where PBM executives and insurance company 
executives testify under oath. The transcripts of the testimony are 
sealed by PBMs. I know answers to many questions you want to explore 
today from the litigations and arbitrations I've handled, that are all 
subject to confidentiality agreements. I get to ask questions like, 
``What do you do with the $12.6 billion in DIR fees you collect from 
pharmacies? Do you send any of the $12.6 billion annual DIR fee revenue 
to CMS? Do you use any of that $12.6 billion to enhance the care of 
Medicare beneficiaries? You say that DIR fees are based on the 
pharmacies' performance--how do you measure adherence to specialty 
drugs like oncology drugs?'' The answers to these questions are often 
staggering.

    Today, I am asking the committee to consider whether it is healthy 
for PBMs to mandate highly confidential arbitrations. To impose strict 
confidentiality requirements under the threat of a lawsuit for a 
breach. And to prohibit class actions. These are the tools used by PBMs 
to keep this information from the American people. PBMs operate in the 
dark; they hate the light of transparency.

    When making their mandatory filings with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), these companies do not disclose the profits 
or revenues generated by their rebate aggregator subsidiaries or 
through spread pricing. The SEC needs to compel better insurance 
company revenue reporting. These insurance companies should break out 
their revenue and profitability on rebates and spread pricing for 
drugs.

    The pharmacies from whom PBMs extract $12.6 billion annually in DIR 
fees are trying to stay in business, but they are also victims. PBMs 
will say that DIR fees lower Medicare beneficiaries' premiums. For 
beneficiaries that do not use their drug benefit, who are not on any 
prescription medications, a lower premium is indeed better. But most 
beneficiaries use the drug benefit, and 75% of Medicare beneficiaries 
worry about copay, coinsurance, and deductible. Low premiums are 
outweighed by higher copay. Many Americans have dreadful diseases like 
cancer, multiple sclerosis, and hepatitis and these Medicare 
beneficiaries use their drug benefit and pay copays. Consumers, as they 
are experiencing financial stress, are unaware that they are paying a 
copay based on a false list price of the drug. Consumers do not know 
that after they paid their copay, the PBM later recouped $12.6 billion 
in DIR fees. How much would the copay of Medicare beneficiaries have 
been reduced if there were no DIR fees?

    More than 50 percent of DIR fees are paid by specialty pharmacies. 
PBMs say they recoup DIR fees based on the specialty pharmacies' 
performance. But PBMs do not publicly reveal their methodology. I have 
deposed PBM executives and once we learn the details in discovery it 
becomes clear PBMs measure performance dreadfully, and likely 
intentionally, wrong. Retail and specialty pharmacies are victims of 
PBM methodology that pays DIR fees based on these incorrect practices.

    If PBMs continue to be left unchecked, the post-DIR fee world gets 
worse, not better. In May 2022 CMS released a Final Rule reinterpreting 
the term ``Negotiated Prices.'' The real impact of the Final Rule 
essentially eliminates the profitability that Part D Plans and PBMs 
enjoyed arising from pharmacy DIR fees. To make up for that lost DIR 
profit, Part D Plans and PBMs have already started to amend contracts 
to remove DIR fees and reimburse pharmacies at drastically lower rates 
to retain their prior profitability. Some 2024 reimbursement rates have 
become public. In 2024 Express Scripts will reimburse brand medications 
at a standard benchmark of 26.3 percent off average wholesale price or 
AWP-26.3%. Our research shows that virtually no pharmacies, other than 
PBM-owned pharmacies, can acquire brand drugs at costs at or lower than 
Express Scripts' new rate. If Express Scripts can get away with paying 
only AWP-26.3%, often more than 3 percent less than the previous year's 
rates, other PBMs will follow. The result of reimbursement below drug 
acquisition costs will put independent pharmacies, and particularly 
pharmacies dispensing predominantly brand drugs (such as specialty 
pharmacies) out of business. These issues must be addressed before 
these dire predictions become reality.

    I have attached a comprehensive expose that my firm prepared on PBM 
abuses as well as supplemental input for the Senate Committee on 
Finance. Thank you for listening to me, and to the needs of the 
American people. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.

How Pharmacy Benefit Managers Adversely Impact Patients, Taxpayers, and 
                      Other Medicare Stakeholders

 Contributors: Jonathan Levitt, A.J. Barbarito, Steven Bennet, Harini

I. Executive Summary

Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) use their marketplace dominance to 
profit at the expense of nearly every other Medicare and Medicaid 
stakeholder, including Medicare beneficiaries, taxpayers, pharmacies, 
manufacturers, and distributors. Frier Levitt has advocated for 
reasonable oversight of highly vertically integrated healthcare 
conglomerates. When a single corporate entity combines an insurance 
company, PBM, chain pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, rebate aggregator, 
and healthcare providers under one giant corporate umbrella, it wields 
immense power that cannot be responsibly managed. PBMs are becoming 
more adept at extracting and siphoning profits from all other 
stakeholders. Frier Levitt hopes to provide the United States Senate 
Committee on Finance with more information on PBMs' impact on Medicare 
and Medicaid stakeholders.

Based on the information detailed below, Frier Levitt recommends that 
the Senate Committee on Finance take steps to:

        (1) Rectify unreasonable reimbursement terms that PBMs pay to 
        retail and specialty pharmacies and investigate discriminatory 
        pricing in favor of PBM affiliated pharmacies. The Committee 
        should comprehensively study PBMs' contract terms and 
        reimbursement rates that PBMs unilaterally impose on providers. 
        The Committee should also develop standards for reasonable 
        contracting terms and reimbursement rates and instruct the 
        Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish 
        enforcement measures where existing regulations are sufficient 
        and implement new rules where existing regulations are 
        insufficient. Today, we are calling for the Committee to 
        consider whether the reimbursement rates PBMs pay to specialty 
        pharmacies should take into account that PDPs are paid more to 
        manage sicker beneficiaries, resulting in a reimbursement to 
        specialty pharmacies that recognizes their important role.

        (2) Bring PBMs into compliance with applicable laws including 
        Medicare's Any Willing Provider Law. PBMs have ignored key laws 
        such as Medicare's Any Willing Provider Law, having taken the 
        written position in confidential sealed briefs that the laws do 
        not apply to PBMs, or to narrowly interpreted such laws to the 
        detriment of pharmacy providers. CMS should provide clarity on 
        existing Medicare reimbursement rate guidance \1\ and Congress 
        should take steps to amend laws to correct for PBM abuses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ E.g., Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, Chapter 5, 
Section 50.3.

        (3) Reduce the negative impact of vertical integration in the 
        healthcare marketplace. The government should investigate the 
        impact of consolidation, regulate these conglomerates, and 
        enforce the law to offset the negative impact of these 
        organizations.

II.  The Big Picture: Understanding the Impact of PBMs on Medicare and 
                    Medicaid Stakeholders

            A. The Pharmacy Benefits Landscape
The current system of coverage and reimbursement for drug products 
within the United States is complex and opaque. The profit PBMs earn on 
spread pricing when they pay pharmacy providers and the amount of 
profit PBMs earn on rebates demanded from manufacturers remains 
unknown. The costs, extent of coverage, reimbursement rates, out-of-
pocket amounts and applicable rights may vary substantially depending 
on the payor, the state, the type of drug, the method of 
administration, the site of service and the site of care. To sift 
through this morass, we begin by understanding the relevant 
stakeholders, as well as their respective roles in benefits design and 
the provision of care.

     Plan Sponsors: Plan sponsors are the ultimate financial 
guarantors and decision makers when it comes to creating a health care 
benefits plan. Plan sponsors include a variety of public programs, such 
as Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE programs, as well as private 
entities, including employers, union groups, and retirement funds. Plan 
sponsors, in turn, contract with several other entities for the 
purposes of administering the plan. In the context of Medicare Part D, 
the Federal government (through CMS) is arguably the plan sponsor, as 
it contracts with and provides subsidies to private Part D Plan 
Sponsors, known as Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) to offer prescription 
drug plans. CMS outsources the management of Medicare to private PDPs, 
who retain PBMs to manage the drug benefit. In addition, when patients 
exceed the catastrophic coverage threshold, CMS provides reinsurance 
coverage to these plans. In the context of Medicaid programs, the state 
Medicaid agencies are generally considered the plan sponsors, as they 
contract with Medicaid managed care organizations or PBMs directly to 
administer pharmacy benefit plans and provide direct and indirect 
financial subsidies and funding for such programs. In the private 
marketplace, large employer groups are also plan sponsors.

     Health Insurance Companies: Health insurance companies create 
and operate healthcare plans, managing healthcare claims submitted by 
providers for care provided to patients who are employees, 
beneficiaries and/or members of the plan, or their dependents. Health 
insurance companies are private companies, and can operate in several 
ways, including as a licensed health insurer, a managed care 
organization (MCO), or a health maintenance organization (HMO). In the 
context of Medicare Part D, health insurance companies are Part D Plan 
Sponsors (PDPs), which are state-licensed insurance companies that 
offer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to Medicare 
beneficiaries, and who have entered into a contract with CMS to provide 
prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. In the context of 
Medicaid, health insurance companies are private state-licensed 
insurance companies and MCOs who have contracted with state Medicaid 
agencies to provide healthcare services to Medicaid beneficiaries.

     Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs): PBMs are third-party 
administrators of prescription drug programs covered by a plan sponsor. 
The PBM is primarily responsible for processing and paying prescription 
drug claims submitted by participating providers on behalf of covered 
patients. PBMs also provide bundled services related to the 
administration of pharmaceutical benefits, including formulary design, 
formulary management, negotiation of branded drug rebates, and 
controlling network access of participating pharmacies. Although plan 
sponsors may occasionally engage PBMs directly, in many cases, health 
insurance companies procure PBMs' services on behalf of plan sponsors. 
This is also true for Medicare Part D and Medicaid, where the 
responsibility of contracting with PBMs falls on the Part D Plan 
Sponsor and/or Medicaid MCO.

     Rebate Aggregators: Also known as rebate group purchasing 
organizations (GPOs), rebate aggregators negotiate and collect rebates 
from manufacturers on behalf of their members, who include one or more 
PBMs. While rebate aggregators may pass some portion of the rebates 
collected to their members, rebate aggregators may also retain a 
portion of the rebate, which is not always readily known.

     Pharmacy Providers: On the frontline of providing care, pharmacy 
providers include retail, specialty, health-system and mail-order 
pharmacies, and dispensing physician practices. Pharmacy providers 
contract with PBMs to dispense medications to plan members and 
participate in PBM networks.

     Prescribers: Prescribers include licensed healthcare 
professionals, such as doctors and nurse practitioners, who are 
authorized to prescribe medication to patients. Prescribers work with 
pharmacy providers to ensure that patients receive the medication they 
need.

     Patients: Patients include beneficiaries of government-sponsored 
health care programs, as well as the employees (and dependents) of 
employers sponsoring health plans. They are also uninsured or 
underinsured individuals who are left to find a way to cover drug costs 
themselves. In the context of Medicare Part D, eligible patients (i.e., 
individuals who are 65 years of age or older, individuals with certain 
disabilities, etc.) select a Part D Plan and pay premiums to receive 
prescription drug coverage. In the context of Medicaid programs, 
patients who are Medicaid-eligible (i.e., low-income individuals and 
families, individuals with disabilities, etc.) select and enroll in 
Medicaid managed care plans administered by MCOs or enroll directly in 
a fee-for-service program administered by the State Medicaid agency.

     Manufacturers: Manufacturers include both brand manufacturers, 
who develop and produce innovative prescription drugs and biologics, or 
generic manufacturers, who produce medications that are equivalent to 
brand-name medications in terms of active ingredients, dosage, 
strength, quality, and intended use. Manufacturers negotiate drug 
prices with PBMs and are forced to pay PBMs administrative fees, data 
fees and rebates in order to get their drugs on formularies and promote 
their drugs to prescribers and patients.

     Wholesalers: Wholesalers are companies that purchase 
prescription drugs in bulk from pharmaceutical manufacturers and 
distribute them to pharmacies, hospitals, and other healthcare 
providers.

Each of these stakeholders plays a different and unique role in the 
drug delivery process. Historically, each stakeholder has operated 
separate but interconnected entities, working together to provide 
different aspects of patient care. However, as discussed below, 
horizontal and vertical integration has eroded many of the checks and 
balances, particularly in the Medicare Part D context, and has allowed 
a small cadre of multibillion dollar companies to control all the 
levers of decision-making around drug benefits, reimbursement rates, 
provider access and plan benefits design. Unfortunately, because of 
conflicts of interest, patients, manufacturers and plan sponsors have 
been harmed as PBM corporate profits have soared at the expense of 
healthy competition.
            B. Vertical Integration Stifles Competition and Limits 
                    Patient Choice
PBMs traditionally have played a critical role in the administration of 
prescription drug programs. However, over the past ten years, the PBM 
marketplace has transformed considerably. Changes include both 
horizontal and vertical integration among health insurance companies, 
PBMs, chain pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, rebate aggregators, long-
term care pharmacies and more recently healthcare providers. As a 
result, a smaller number of large companies wield nearly limitless 
power and influence over the prescription drug market.

Within the PBM marketplace, over 80% of the covered lives are 
controlled by only three PBMs.\2\ As a result, of this increasing 
concentration (the same PBMs made up 75% of the market concentration 
just three years prior \3\), a pharmacy's access to these three PBM 
networks is critical.\4\ Being out of network with just one PBM (which 
in some regions, could make up more than 85% of the market), and being 
unable to bill that PBM for drug claims, would render it financially 
unviable for any pharmacy provider to operate, period. The lack of 
competition in the marketplace stems, in large part, from a series of 
mergers, integrations and consolidations. These consolidations and 
integrations are undoubtedly a factor in many abusive PBM practices, 
ranging from seeking to exclude independent pharmacy providers, 
retaliation against providers who challenge PBM abuse, to ``under 
water'' reimbursement rates that force pharmacy providers to lose money 
on each fill, to PBM diversion of patients from independent pharmacy 
providers to the PBMs' wholly-owned or affiliated pharmacies. This 
becomes possible due to the increased market power of the top PBMs 
resulting from the consolidation.

    \4\ Of note, CVS Caremark's specialty now maintains a market share 
of more than 30% in terms of in specialty drug revenue among specialty 
pharmacies. Thus, this consolidation at the PBM level has had a direct 
and proximate impact on CVS Caremark's ability to capture specialty 
pharmacy prescriptions. See, https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/
pharmacy/top-15-specialty-pharmacies-by-revenue-2.html.

The breadth of PBM power did not occur suddenly. It initiated through a 
series of vertical consolidations in which certain PBMs acquired large 
specialty pharmacies, while others acquired insurance companies. In 
2007, the shareholders of Caremark Rx, one of the nation's largest PBMs 
at the time, approved a $26.5 billion takeover of CVS Pharmacy, which 
effectively created the first vertically integrated retail pharmacy and 
PBM.\5\ Vertical integration of the industry continued in 2011, as Blue 
Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, one of Medco's largest customers, 
began shifting its PBM business away from Medco to Prime 
Therapeutics,\6\ a PBM that is wholly owned by a group of thirteen Blue 
Cross plans across the country. In 2012, UnitedHealthcare (United), the 
nation's largest insurance company, began migrating the administration 
of its plans from Medco Health Solutions to OptumRx, United's wholly-
owned PBM.\7\

Consolidation of the PBM and payer space has not been limited to 
vertical integration. In 2011, two of the nation's then-largest PBMs--
Medco Health Solutions, Inc. and Express Scripts, Inc.--announced a $29 
billion merger. After a contentious regulatory approval process, the 
Federal Trade Commission ultimately approved the merger in 2012.\8\ 
Thereafter, the industry continued consolidation both horizontally and 
vertically. In 2013, a regional PBM--SXC Corporation--agreed to buy 
another regional PBM--Catalyst, Inc.--for $4.4 billion to form a 
national PBM, known as Catamaran Corp.\9\ In July 2015, Catamaran was 
acquired by United, OptumRx's parent company, for $12.8 billion. The 
two PBMs are now integrating operations and operate under one name, 
OptumRx. In 2015, Rite Aid acquired the PBM EnvisionRx for 
approximately $2 billion.\10\

Unfortunately, in the last five years, the trend of consolidation and 
integration has increased exponentially. In November 2018, CVS Health 
completed a controversial $69 billion acquisition of Aetna, a managed 
health care company specializing in selling traditional and consumer-
directed health insurance along with related services including dental, 
vision, and disability plans. Not to be outdone, in December 2018, 
health insurer Cigna acquired Express Scripts for $54 billion.\11\ 
Since then, Cigna and Express Scripts have continued to expand in 
creative ways. In December 2019. Express Scripts and Prime Therapeutics 
announced a three-year collaboration, whereby Express Scripts took over 
the contracting and administration of the pharmacy benefits for Prime 
Therapeutics' members.\12\ As a result, Express Scripts now manages the

PBMs are extending vertical integration in new and unique ways. 
First, as plan sponsors have become savvier with respect to the rebates 
received by PBMs, several large PBMs created an additional layer 
between themselves and manufacturers to effectively ``delegate'' the 
collection of manufacturer rebates to ``rebate aggregators.''\14\ 
Sometimes referred to as rebate GPOs, these mysterious entities include 
Ascent Health Services, a Switzerland-based GPO that Express Scripts 
launched in 2019, Zinc, a contracting entity launched by CVS Health in 
the summer of 2020, and Emisar Pharma Services, an Ireland-based entity 
recently rolled out by OptumRx.\15\ Even some of the major PBMs (i.e., 
the ``Big Three'' PBMs) sometimes find themselves contracting with 
other PBMs' rebate aggregators for the collection of manufacturer 
rebates (for example, in the case of OptumRx contracting with Express 
Scripts for purposes of rebate aggregation for public employee 
plans).\16\ Worse yet, several such entities have claimed that they are 
not subject to the federal GPO Safe Harbor,\17\ leading to a lack of 
transparency, as well as few limits on the levels of profitability of 
these companies.

Likewise, just as PBMs have moved up the chain of the drug supply 
chain, they have also sought to integrate downward, and are 
increasingly acquiring prescriber businesses, such as physicians' 
practices, and expanding into primary care. For several years, 
UnitedHealth Group's healthcare services division, Optum, has been 
quietly buying up physician practices, and according to recent 
estimates, Optum's physician network--comprising more than 70,000 
physicians--is reported to make up over 5% of all U.S. physicians.\18\ 
Similarly, CVS Health--already known for its operation of in-store 
Minute Clinics, as well as its $8 billion acquisition of Signify Health 
\19\--recently acquired Oak Street Health, an operator of nearly 170 
medical centers--for $10.6 billion.\20\ Possibly based on fear of 
giving up territory, Evernorth, the health services arm of Cigna, 
invested $2.5 billion in Walgreens-backed VillageMD's acquisition of 
medical practice, Summit Health, for almost $9 billion,\21\ 
highlighting the veritable ``arms race'' for primary care providers 
integrated within PBM businesses.\22\ In each instance of creative 
consolidation or integration, medical providers that do not sell out 
are weakened through reduced rates, pharmacies are harmed by reduced 
reimbursement rates and network shut outs, consumers are harmed through 
increased copays.\23\

Finally, each of the big three PBMs has equally sought to find other 
areas of vertical integration to give themselves greater control of the 
marketplace and drug supply chain. PBMs and their affiliated companies 
use their influence over the marketplace to ensure their own specialty 
pharmacies get access to many Exclusive or Limited Distribution Drugs 
(EDDs/LDDs). EDDs/LDDs are sold by drug manufactures to a single or 
limited number of specialty pharmacies. Those pharmacies able to buy 
these EDDs/LDDs gain immediate benefits by way of exclusive or near 
exclusive access to patients that require these unique medications. 
PBMs assert their influence even on more commonly accessible 
medications. For drugs distributed through a broader supply chain, PBMs 
can demand lower price from manufacturers and distributors and then 
distributors are forced to charge independent pharmacies more for the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
same drugs sold to PBM-owned pharmacies.

Further, in a bid to corner the explosive 340B market, CVS Health 
acquired the software provider and third-party administrator, 
Wellpartner, in 2018, giving it direct insight and control into 
millions of 340B reconciliations between covered entities and contract 
pharmacies, even when CVS is not involved as a pharmacy or PBM.\24\ 
This has enabled CVS Health to dominate the 340B contract pharmacy and 
third-party administrator (TPA) marketplace, to the point where State 
Attorney Generals have begun to initiate enforcement actions against 
the conglomerate over antitrust and anticompetition violations.\25\ 
Today, we are calling on the government and manufactures to investigate 
just how much of 340B revenue is siphoned by PBMs and their wholly 
owned TPAs.

Likewise, in 2017, Express Scripts acquired eviCore Healthcare, a 
utilization management and ``medical benefits manager,'' providing 
Express Scripts visibility and access to millions of drug claims billed 
and reimbursed under the medical benefit (as opposed to the pharmacy 
benefit).\26\ Medical providers must take note. Lastly and perhaps most 
concerningly is United HealthGroup's acquisition of Change Healthcare 
for $13 billion, which was completed last year, despite a direct 
(albeit, unsuccessful) legal challenge by the Department of 
Justice.\27\ The Department of Justice had good reason to block this 
transaction, as Change Healthcare operates a ``healthcare claims 
clearinghouse,'' receiving, processing and transmitting claims data 
from many different pharmacy providers and PBMs, and United's ownership 
of the platform would give the company insight into virtually every 
pharmacy claim processed in the country.\28\

This rapid evolution of the PBM and health insurance industry shows how 
a limited number of corporations wield an outsized level of power in 
the prescription drug coverage marketplace. Fewer payers harms 
patients, especially those requiring specialty medications. Powerful 
payers, when integrated with PBMs, chain pharmacies and PBM-owned 
specialty pharmacies, present unique challenges to drug wholesalers and 
manufacturers. These integrated companies have greater abilities to 
control the nature and direction of patients' care, drug formularies, 
including what type of care/drugs patients receive, from whom they 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
receive it, and in what setting they are treated.

Fewer payers means that a provider is not able to survive without 
network access to each PBM. Exclusion from one PBM with a market share 
of 35% means that the provider loses out on a major portion of the 
patient population.

As illustrated in the figure above, consolidation has created 
merged entities that have oppressive power over many stakeholders in 
the supply chain. This creates a virtual chokehold note only on 
independent pharmacy providers, but on pharmacy services administrative 
organizations (PSAOs), plan sponsors, manufacturers, distributors and 
patients alike. Market dominance has allowed PBMs to get away with 
abusive practices. Challenges are met with retaliation, actual, 
threatened or perceived.

Pharmacy Benefit Managers, Drug Channels Institute. Available at http:/
/drugchannelsinstitute.com/products/industry-reports/.

Whether it is outsized manufacturer rebates PBMs demand from 
manufacturers or direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees extracted 
from pharmacies, PBM practices fuel drug prices. Whether it is 
unreasonable barriers to entry such as requiring specialty pharmacies 
to have multiple ``accreditations'', network exclusions or mandatory 
``white bagging''\30\ forcing patients to receive inferior service at 
higher costs. Whether it is employing insidious copay maximizer 
programs \31\ or deceptive pricing and reimbursement techniques. Or 
worse yet, whether it is essentially practicing medicine, through 
``fail first'' step therapy, prior authorization requirements, or 
formulary exclusions, many of which favor not the least expensive 
medication, but the most profitable one for the PBM. Through vertical 
integration, PBMs have become both the ``arsonists and firefighters'' 
of drug prices.\32\ Each tactic is made possible by the PBMs' sheer 
levels of dominance at all levels of the health care continuum. This 
consolidation has hurt medical care, made independent pharmacy 
unprofitable, while fueling both drug prices and costs to patients and 
plan sponsors alike.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \30\ White bagging is a practice involving healthcare providers 
(such as doctors, clinics, and hospitals) and pharmacies, whereby a 
patient's medication to be used in a procedure is sent directly by the 
pharmacy to the provider at which the patient is receiving care. Many 
payers, primarily large national insurers, have recently begun to 
mandate white bagging by requiring that in-
office administered medications be purchased and dispensed through the 
payers' pharmacies, as opposed to being sourced and provided by the 
administering provider. Healthcare providers are then expected to 
receive and administer this medication filled and dispensed by the 
payer-owned pharmacy.
    \31\ Copay maximizers are programs instituted to ensure that the 
maximum value of a manufacturer's copay coupon is realized by the PBM, 
even if normal plan design would yield a lower copay amount. Copay 
maximizer programs often intentionally ``increase'' the patient's out-
of-pocket costs to reflect the maximum availability of support offered 
by a manufacturer copay coupon program. This aims to ensure that the 
full value of the manufacturer's copay savings program is extracted for 
the benefit of the plan.

drug-prices.

            C. Who Chooses PBMs?
This level of horizontal consolidation, combined with vertical 
integration, leaves little choice for patients, pharmacy providers and 
plan sponsors in trying to escape PBM abuses. Because of vertical 
integration, no patient, no plan sponsor, and no pharmacy provider can 
choose a PBM.

As noted above, PBMs are typically contracted directly with plan 
sponsors, or through health insurance companies. But PBMs have 
structured the system to their benefit through consolidation. For 
example, PDPs often give no bid contracts to their wholly-owned PBM 
subsidiaries, i.e., SilverScript/Aetna selects Caremark at its PBM; 
Cigna selects Express Scripts as its PBM; and UnitedHealthcare selects 
OptumRx as its PBM. Why is this practice a cause for concern? When 
these relationships are structured in a vertically integrated manner 
with affiliated entities participating in every aspect of the process, 
it diminishes accountability. For example, PBMs can hide rebates and 
manipulate the drug expense/medical loss ratio. This consolidation also 
has an impact on the quality of patient care. Consider a scenario where 
a patient has received subpar care or been compelled to pay higher 
prices as a result of a PBM's actions. What meaningful choice does that 
patient have in selecting another PBM? If the patient receives 
prescription drug coverage through their job, it is the patient's 
employer (or more likely, the employer's benefits broker) who selects 
the PBM. The patient's only option at that point would be to look for 
another job. Patients' ability to meaningfully select a new PBM does 
not improve if they are a Medicare Part D beneficiary. Patients select 
among Part D Plan Sponsors, not PBMs. When Part D Plan Sponsors are 
owned directly by PBMs, patients are locked into a particular PBM. 
Moreover, the number of standalone Part D Plans has steadily decreased 
since 2006, and geographic market share concentration often result in 
no real choice for patients to switch PBMs.\33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

a-first-look-at-medicare-prescription-drug-plans-in-2022/; https://
www.cms.gov/medicare/prescription-drug-coverage/pre
scriptiondrugcovgenin.

This concept is even more pronounced in the context of Medicaid managed 
care. For example, in Bronx County, New York, eight of the thirteen 
Medicaid MCO plans utilized Caremark as the processing PBM, nearly 
guaranteeing that a Medicaid-eligible patient will have benefits 
processed by Caremark, regardless of the insurance plan selected.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \34\ See https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/managed_care/plans/
mcp_dir_by_cnty.htm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            D. Ripe Conditions for PBM Profiteering
As a result of this control over the marketplace, PBMs have created 
truly ripe conditions to profit at the expense of patients, plan 
sponsors, manufacturers, taxpayers and other pharmacy providers. For 
example, PBMs have used this leverage and vertical integration to pay 
their own pharmacies more money than the PBM pays independent pharmacy 
providers, allowing PBMs to squeeze out competition.\35\ At the same 
time, PBMs continually charge plan sponsors more than what they are 
paying pharmacy providers through a tactic known as ``spread pricing.'' 
Dozens of states have filed suit against numerous PBMs over spread 
pricing in state Medicaid programs.\36\ In addition to increasing 
profits by spread pricing, PBMs actively reduce coverage of potentially 
lower cost products in favor of highly reimbursable products.\37\ In 
particularly egregious examples of this, PBMs have taken to deceptively 
including prescription discount card programs into their benefit, 
literally deceiving Medicare Part D patients into believing that their 
low-cost generic medications are being covered, when in reality, they 
have been processed through a prescription discount card. Thus, rather 
than simply cover a lower cost generic where the patient could pay 
little to no copay, the PBM excludes coverage for the generic 
altogether in favor of a highly-rebated brand, forcing the patient to 
unknowingly pay the entire amount of the generic medication.\38\

d-members-accessing-generics.

The level of PBM profiteering only expands when considering other lines 
of business operated by PBMs. For example, in the context of 340B, in 
addition to fees taken by contract pharmacies owned and operated by 
PBMs, third-party administrators, such as CVS-owned Wellpartner, assess 
additional fees on every 340B eligible claim, which are ``percentage[s] 
of margin,'' and can be as high as 15% of the cost of the drug, 
destroying the intended purpose of 340B.\39\

law-and-business/cvs-facing-twin-lawsuits-over-conduct-in-drug-market.

This all begs the question: just how much do PBMs siphon off? Between 
spread pricing and pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) 
fees,\40\ rebates and transaction fees, 340B third party administrative 
fees, for every dollar spend towards a prescription medication, it can 
be estimated that PBMs (or their affiliates) retain more than $0.50. 
This is illustrated in Figure 3.

    \40\ ``DIR'' stands for ``Direct and Indirect Remuneration,'' and 
describes any kind of remuneration Part D Plan Sponsors (PDPs) or their 
Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) may receive from any source that 
offsets the PDP's costs. ``DIR'' is a colloquial term generally used by 
the pharmacy industry that has been adopted by most stakeholders, and 
even legislators, to describe a particular kind of DIR that CMS 
typically refers to as ``pharmacy price concessions.'' https://

Thus, vertical integration and horizontal consolidation has harmed 
patients, plan sponsors, manufacturers, taxpayers and providers, alike.

III. Top Barriers Erected by PBMs

Alongside consolidation, PBMs and their affiliated entities leverage 
their increasing influence over the marketplace to force manufacturers 
to increase the list price of drugs, increase PBM profits, reduce 
patient drug coverage, and decrease the viability of independent 
pharmacy competitors. Below is a discussion of the top barriers erected 
by PBMs.\41\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \41\ Redactions are made in the remainder of this submission 
because of PBM requirements that certain contract documents, disputes, 
and facts learned in arbitration are required to remain confidential.

With respect to specialty medications, which make up an ever-increasing 
segment of the drug spend, the Department of Health and Human Services 
Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, Office of Science & 
Data Policy released a report \42\ on ``Trends in Prescription Drug 
Spending, 2016-2021'' in September 2022 detailing the impact of 
specialty medications. The report identified that the U.S. health care 
system spent $421 billion for drugs filled in an outpatient setting, 
including standalone pharmacies and mail order prescriptions. The 
report specified, ``[d]rug spending is heavily driven by a relatively 
small number of high-cost products.'' Following the 80/20 rule, 80% of 
prescriptions that Americans fill are for less costly generic drugs, 
yet the 20% brand name prescriptions represent 80% of the cost of drugs 
dispensed. The report also highlighted that ``the top 10% of drugs by 
price make up fewer than 1% of all prescriptions.'' Expensive specialty 
drugs represent about more than 50% of drug spend.\43\ In short, a 
relative few expensive specialty drugs drive a significant portion of 
the drug spend in the United States.

            A.  PBMs Set Unreasonably Low Specialty Drug Reimbursement 
                    Hurting Independent Competition In Violation of the 
                    Law
PBMs know the unique considerations surrounding specialty medications, 
and routinely pay an unreasonably low reimbursement for specialty 
medications dispensed by independent pharmacy providers. The impact of 
this unreasonable reimbursement is acutely targeted to only a few--yet 
critical--specialty pharmacies. According to PBMs' own analyses, less 
than 1% of pharmacies dispense more than 25% of their claims as 
specialty medications.\44\ The most insidious PBM tactic to effectuate 
unreasonable reimbursement is DIR Fees. PBMs assess DIR Fees only after 
the pharmacy is it will be paid a higher price by PBM. Specialty 
pharmacies \45\ pay more than one-half of the total DIR Fees that PBMs 
collect from pharmacy providers.\46\ Incredibly, even CMS found that 
pharmacy DIR fees ``grew more than 107,400 percent between 2010 and 
2020.''\47\ Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an 
independent congressional agency established to advise Congress on 
issues affecting the Medicare program, estimated that in 2021 pharmacy 
DIR Fees totaled $12.6 billion, or 6% of gross Medicare Part D 
spending.\48\ Making matters worse, specialty pharmacies have 
incredibly small profit margins as a proportion of revenue after the 
cost of acquiring expensive specialty medications. The single digit 
gross profit margins after the cost of drug acquisition are easily 
eclipsed by the percentage-based DIR fees now prevalent in the Medicare 
Part D marketplace. Currently, specialty pharmacies regularly 
experience DIR Fees in excess of 10% with the true range of up to 31% 
of ingredient cost. The DIR Fees PBMs charge to specialty pharmacies 
has increased at exponential rates. The below chart plots out the 
exponential increase in DIR Fees experienced by a single provider in a 
PBM network from 2016 through 2022.

New York Cancer and Blood Specialists, LLC v Caremark, LLC et al., 
AAA Case No. 01-21-0016-4612, Expert Report of Laura E. Coe (December 
30, 2022). DIR Fees of this magnitude simply cannot be justified and 
lead directly to unreasonable reimbursement rates notwithstanding the 
clear law, regulation, and guidance that terms and conditions must be 
reasonable and relevant.
            B.  Federal Law, Regulation and Guidance Requires that 
                    Medicare Part D Terms and Conditions be 
                    ``Reasonable and Relevant''--DIR Fees and 
                    Unreasonably Low Reimbursement Terms Violate the 
                    Law

The law creates obligations on PBMs and plan sponsors to not only offer 
standard terms and conditions that allow participation in Medicare Part 
D network, but also require those terms and conditions to be both 
reasonable and relevant, with reimbursement that is not unreasonably 
low. Congress enacted the federal ``Any Willing Provider'' law (AWPL) 
as part of the Social Security Act applicable to Medicare Part D. 42 
U.S.C. Sec. 1395w-104(b)(1)(A) states that ``[a] prescription drug plan 
shall permit the participation of any pharmacy that meets the terms and 
conditions under the plan.'' CMS has enacted additional regulations and 
guidance documents to enforce the AWPL. In doing so, CMS enacted 
regulations to ensure the ``terms and conditions for participation'' in 
Medicare Part D networks are ``reasonable and relevant,'' so that 
providers, themselves, are not only willing to participate, but able to 
do so under objectively reasonable terms. DIR fees violate that 
standard because they are not ``reasonable'' and are also not 
``relevant.'' Congress permits agencies like CMS to clarify statutes by 
enacting regulations that expand upon--but cannot be inconsistent 
with--federal statutes. CMS codified the meaning of the AWPL in 
guidance documents contained in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). 
CMS codified the AWPL to require that Part D plan sponsors must agree 
to have ``a standard contract with reasonable and relevant terms and 
conditions of participation whereby any willing pharmacy may access the 
standard contract and participate as a network pharmacy.'' 42 C.F.R. 
Sec. 423.505(b)(18) (emphasis added). To further clarify the 
aforementioned statutes and regulations applicable to the Medicare 
Program, CMS has issued guidance in the form of the Medicare 
Prescription Drug Benefit Manual (the ``Med D Manual''). CMS is 
cognizant that one of, if not the most important term and condition for 
a provider to effectively participate in the Part D network, is the 
reimbursement rate. To ensure that Plan Sponsors offer a ``standard 
contract with reasonable and relevant terms and conditions of 
participation'' CMS has explicitly stated that:

        Offering pharmacies unreasonably low reimbursement rates for 
        certain ``specialty'' drugs may not be used to subvert the 
        convenient access standards. In other words, Part D sponsors 
        must offer reasonable and relevant reimbursement terms for all 
        Part D drugs as required by [the Medicare AWPL].\49\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \49\ Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, Chapter 5, Section 
50.3.

Unreasonable reimbursement impacts not only specialty pharmacies, but 
also patients. CMS has found that DIR Fees negatively impact patients 
because these fees are ``not reflected in lower drug prices at the 
point-of-sale and are instead used to reduce plan liability,'' and 
``beneficiaries who utilize drugs end up paying a larger share of the 
actual cost of a drug.''\50\ More broadly, though, is that unreasonably 
low reimbursement rates results in significant pharmacy consolidation, 
exacerbating the impact of broader consolidation in the healthcare 
marketplace. Unreasonable low reimbursement rates increase PBM 
acquisition of independent pharmacy providers because the same entities 
that set unreasonable low reimbursement rates (health insurance 
companies and their PBMs) are the entities profiting from DIR and then 
purchasing independent pharmacy providers. After the PBM purchases the 
independent pharmacy provider, the pharmacy will likely receive a 
higher reimbursement. This is because of preferential reimbursement 
agreements between PBMs and their wholly owned pharmacies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \50\ 87 FR 1842, 1911.

To illustrate this consolidation in real-world terms, consider the 
changes in the largest specialty providers from 2015 to 2022. In 2015, 
the total specialty drug spend equaled $98.3 billion. Fifty-six percent 
of the specialty drug spend was channeled through specialty pharmacies 
owned by the same parent company as Caremark, ESI, OptumRx and Humana. 
By 2021 those figures ballooned to total $191.6 billion with $127.1 
billion, or 66.5% of the specialty market captured by specialty 
pharmacies owned by the same parent company as Caremark, ESI, OptumRx 
and Humana. Perhaps even more telling is a comparison between the 
specialty pharmacy market share in 2015 to 2021, below. In short, the 
largest independent specialty pharmacies in 2015 have been acquired by 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PBMs.

            C.  The Post-DIR Fee World Does Not Improve Pharmacy 
                    Reimbursement
In May 2022 CMS released a Final Rule reinterpreting the term 
``Negotiated Prices.''\57\ Effective January 1, 2024, CMS removed an 
exception where contingent pharmacy payment adjustments that ``cannot 
reasonably be determined at the point-of-sale'' (aka DIR fees) were not 
included in the Negotiated Price upon which PDPs submit bids. The real 
impact of the Final Rule essentially eliminates the profitability that 
Part D Plans and PBMs enjoyed arising from pharmacy DIR fees, because 
when DIR fees can be excluded from the Negotiated Price, nearly all DIR 
fee revenue goes right to Part D Plan profits. To make up for that lost 
DIR profit, Part D Plans and PBMs have already started to amend 
contracts to reimburse pharmacies at drastically lower rates to keep 
their past profitability.\58\ Some 2024 reimbursement rates have become 
public. In 2024 Express Scripts (ESI) will reimburse brand medications 
at AWP-26.3%. Our research shows that virtually no pharmacies, other 
than PBM-owned pharmacies or 340B Covered Entities are able to acquire 
brand drugs at rates at or lower than ESI's new rate.\59\ If ESI can 
get away with AWP-26.30%, often more than 3% lower than the previous 
year's rates, more than other PBMs are sure to follow. The result of 
reimbursement below drug wholesale costs will put pharmacies, and 
particularly pharmacies dispensing predominantly brand drugs such as 
specialty pharmacies out of business.

            D.  Even as PBMs Reimburse Specialty Pharmacy Less, 
                    Affiliated Plan Sponsors are Paid More For the 
                    Sicker Beneficiaries Specialty Pharmacies Serve
In the capitated Medicare Part D space, explained below, Medicare Plan 
Sponsors are paid more per member per month for sicker patients, such 
as when a Medicare beneficiary has cancer. Medicare Part D Plan 
Sponsors are paid better for managing patients receiving specialty 
medications.

Medicare Part D is funded using federal monies drawn from the 
government's Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund. The 
Supplementary Medical Insurance trust fund's chief revenue sources are 
contributions from the federal general fund (74%), beneficiary premium 
payments (15%), and state contributions (11%). The monthly premium paid 
by enrollees is set to cover 25.5% of the cost of standard prescription 
drug coverage, with the Medicare program subsidizing the remining 74.5% 
based on bids submitting by PDPs.\60\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \60\ See https://www.kff.org/medicare/fact-sheet/an-overview-of-
the-medicare-part-d-prescription-drug-benefit/.

Medicare Part D is a capitated model, meaning that CMS will make a 
capitated, or fixed, per member per month, payment to the PDP to cover 
the prescription drug benefits for each of the PDP's beneficiaries. 
PDPs base their capitated payments to PDPs based on bids submitted to 
CMS on an annual basis and through a process referred to as ``risk 
adjustment.'' In other words, the amount CMS pays a PDP to manage the 
prescription drug benefits for Part D beneficiaries is not always 
uniform. Rather, CMS' per member per month capitated payments to PDPs 
reflect anticipated costs of providing care to beneficiaries under the 
PDP. Risk adjustment is thus an important process to ensuring adequate 
payments to PDPs.\61\ Without it, PDPs may be incentivized to attract 
healthier patient pools, and discourage sicker (costlier) patients from 
enrolling.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \61\ See https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/primer-
medicare-risk-adjustment/.

Through the ``risk adjustment'' process, CMS adjusts the per member per 
month payments to PDPs to account for cost differences associated with 
various diseases and demographic factors. PDPs are paid based on 
average rates, adjusted, for specific ailments and population base.\62\ 
In other words, the sicker a PDPs beneficiary base is, the higher CMS' 
pays PDP per member per month. Today, we are calling for the Government 
to consider whether the reimbursement rates PBM pay to specialty 
pharmacies should take into account that PDPs are paid more to manage 
these sicker beneficiaries, resulting in a reimbursement to specialty 
pharmacies that recognizes their important role.

Adjustment.

            E.  PBMs Argue Federal AWPL and Other Laws are not 
                    Applicable to PBMs
Medicare's AWPL guides all Medicare stakeholders. The importance of the 
AWPL to curb PBM abuses, which impacts all stakeholders, cannot be 
overstated. But when independent pharmacy providers or other 
stakeholders attempt to leverage the AWPL to gain access to restricted 
networks, challenge DIR fees, or obtain reasonable reimbursement rates, 
PBMs craft legal arguments designed to limit the AWPL. These arguments 
include: (1) the AWPL does not apply to PBMs and only applies to 
separate entities, (i.e., insurance companies and Part D Plan 
Sponsors); (2) even if the AWPL does apply to PBMs, the AWPL does not 
contain an expressed private right of action, cannot be enforced by 
private parties, and only CMS can enforce the AWPL; and (3) even if the 
AWPL applies to PBMs and could be enforced by private parties, the 
scope of the AWPL is narrow and only requires the PBM and Part D Plan 
Sponsors to provide sufficient access for patients (which, in theory, 
could be satisfied solely through the PBMs' wholly-owned pharmacies 
without independent providers). These arguments have consistently been 
successful for PBMs in public venues (court proceedings) and private 
venues (arbitration). Examples can be found in the Eighth Circuit.\63\ 
Emboldened by the lack of expressed private right of action in the 
AWPL, PBMs rely heavily on these arguments and consistently 
discriminate against independent pharmacy providers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \63\ See, e.g., United/Xcel-RX, LLC v. Express Scripts, Inc., No. 
4:19-CV-00221-SRC, 2019 WL 5536806, at *4-5 (E.D. Mo. October 25, 2019) 
(dismissing plaintiff pharmacy's breach of contract claim because the 
AWPL did not confer a private right of action to private parties or 
entities); see also Heartland Med., LLC v. Express Scripts, Inc., No. 
4:17-CV-02873 JAR, 2018 WL 6831164, at *2 (E.D. Mo. December 27, 2018) 
(dismissing plaintiff's complaint entirely because AWPL does not have a 
private right of action). The reason this is prominent in the Eighth 
Circuit is a venue provision in Express Scripts' PBM-pharmacy contract 
mandating all disputes be resolved exclusively by litigation in the 
Eastern District of Missouri.

The PBMs' arguments are crafty but ignore governing federal law. The 
regulatory ``Flow Down'' provisions of the AWPL unequivocally require 
Medicare Part D Plan Sponsors to incorporate the AWPL into the 
contractual agreements with ``first tier''\64\ and ``downstream''\65\ 
entities. Congress enacted the AWPL to govern the administration of 
Medicare Part D benefits. CMS requires that Part D sponsors (e.g., 
Aetna, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Centene, Humana, SilverScript, and 
United Healthcare), the ``First Tier'' entities (e.g., PBMs like 
Caremark, Express Scripts, Humana, OptumRx, and Prime Therapeutics) and 
other ``downstream'' entities (e.g., pharmacy providers), to 
incorporate all Part D Rules (including the AWPL), into all contracts. 
In fact, Congress could not have more clearly articulated the 
requirement that ``each and every contract must specify that first, 
downstream, and related entities must comply with all applicable 
federal laws, regulations, and CMS guidance.''\66\ PBMs cannot 
seriously dispute that, as a ``first tier entity'' like a PBM must 
comply with the AWPL. This conclusion is in accord with other publicly 
disclosed arbitrations against PBMs, including Senderra v. Caremark, 
LLC, et al.,\67\ and Mission Wellness v. Caremark, LLC, et al.\68\ 
Tellingly, in briefing this issue, after year of litigation, Caremark 
was all but forced to admit that the AWPL governs Caremark's contract 
with pharmacy providers as part of an ultimately unsuccessful effort to 
vacate an arbitrator's award.\69\

    \65\ Downstream entity is defined as ``any party that enters into a

(D. Ariz. Sept. 15, 2022) (Wherein Caremark's Post-Hearing Brief 
wherein Respondents admit the Any Willing Provider Law governs 
Caremark's standardized contract with pharmacies).

PBMs posit that the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefits Manual, 
Chapter 5, Section 50.5.3, comes under the title of ``Convenient Access 
to LTC Pharmacies.'' PBMs argue that this only means there needs to be 
a pharmacy within a certain geographic range of patients. To PBMs, the 
AWPL is only designed to ensure network ``access'' even if that means 
patients only have access to PBM-owned pharmacies, ignoring the clear 
regulations and CMS guidance. By virtue of vertical consolidation there 
are few areas where a PBM-owned chain or specialty pharmacy does not 
have a physical location. CVS Pharmacy alone has over 9,600 locations. 
Further, if mail order services are considered, CVS Specialty Pharmacy 
already processes approximately 29% of all specialty drug claims. If 
geographic access alone is the only metric to trigger Medicare's AWPL, 
then Medicare's AWPL would only apply to an incredibly rural area like 
Craig, Alaska (population less than 2,000 people), serviced by Whale 
Tail Pharmacy, where the next closest pharmacy is 2,000 miles away. 
Thus, PBMs take the position that if there is a PBM-owned pharmacy 
across the street from an independent pharmacy, that independent 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
pharmacy can seek no refuge in the AWPL.

CMS is clear that the AWPL is not to be read this narrow. CMS guidance 
states that ``[o]ffering pharmacies unreasonably low reimbursement 
rates for certain `specialty' drugs may not be used to subvert the 
convenient access standards. In other words, Part D Plan Sponsors must 
offer reasonable and relevant reimbursement terms for all Part D drugs 
as required by [the Medicare AWPL].''\70\ We ask that the Senate direct 
CMS to reenforce this clear guidance that reimbursement terms must be 
reasonable and relevant and investigate instances where PBMs are 
forcing competitors out of the market simply to maintain their own 
profit margins.

            F.  Unconscionable PBM Contracts Restrain Pharmacy 
                    Providers Which Further Stifles Healthy Competition
Unconscionable PBM contract provisions impose unreasonable restraints 
on providers who attempt to vindicate their contractual rights. 
However, both arbitrators and courts have agreed that provisions of 
Caremark and OptumRx contract are unconscionable.\71\ Generally, a 
contract or provision must be procedurally and substantively 
unconscionable before a court or arbitrator will decline to enforce it. 
Procedural unconscionability occurs when there is a defect in the 
bargaining process where one party lacks bargaining power or 
competitive advantage to negotiate the contract.\72\ Additional factors 
include who drafted the contract, whether the terms were explained to 
the weaker party, and whether negotiations were possible.\73\ 
Substantive unconscionability occurs when the terms of the contract 
areoverly harsh or one-sided, which can result from procedural 
unconscionability (i.e., lack of bargaining power).\74\

In one of the few public results against CVS Caremark, the Arbitrator 
in Aids Healthcare Foundation v. Caremark (``AHF'') determined that the 
terms and conditions of Caremark's DIR fee program could not be 
enforced because they were unconscionable due to Caremark's 
considerable bargaining power, lack of alternative options, and 
unilaterally imposed contractual terms.\75\ Similarly, the California 
Court of Appeals held that provisions of Optum's contract are 
unconscionable, noting the lack of bargaining power for pharmacies, 
Optum's ability to unilaterally impose new contract terms at will, and 
that Optum can and has denied pharmacies the same remedies that Optum 
has reserved for itself.\76\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \75\ AHF Award, p. 57  4-5.
    \76\ See Platt, LLC v. OptumRx, Inc., 2023 WL 2507259 at *4 (Cal. 
Ct. App. March 15, 2023).

These unconscionable terms are unilaterally imposed upon providers all 
with the purpose of preventing PBMs practices from being challenged. 
The lack of bargaining power, PBM's ability to unilaterally impose new 
contract terms at will, and the fact that PBMs deny pharmacy providers 
the same remedies that they reserve for themselves is a shocking 
standard that is pervasive throughout the industry.
                1.  PBMs Impose Contract Revisions and Updates 
                    Unilaterally Without Negotiations or Even 
                    Signatures by Contracting Providers
Pharmacies are not able to negotiate PBM contract terms and conditions. 
PBMs regularly issue and unilaterally impose contract updates and 
addenda to their Provider Manuals, which are a core contract document 
that govern the relationship between the PBM and pharmacy provider. See 
Trial Testimony of Stephanie Harris, Infinity Pharmacy, LLC et al. v. 
CVS Caremark, LLC et al., AAA Case No. 01-02-0001-1835 T44:18 to 46:16 
(August 3, 2022). Pharmacy providers typically learn that the terms of 
their contract have been altered once a new document is received 
electronically, via facsimile, or sometimes through mail. Most often, 
and contrary to the basic tenets of contract law, a signature is often 
not required for these contract addenda to take effect. Caremark's 
network enrollment forms typically advise that ``[y]ou will be enrolled 
as a Provider [. . .] under the terms detailed in the attached Network 
Enrollment Forms unless you notify CVS Caremark in writing (via 
facsimile) [. . .] that you do not want to enroll.'' See Infinity 
Pharmacy, LLC et al. v. CVS Caremark, LLC et al., AAA Case No. 01-02-
0001-1835 Exhibit J-8, August 17, 2020 Communication.

PBMs also regularly issue Network Enrollment Forms (``NEFs''), which 
are considered part of the contract between the parties but do not 
require providers to sign them. These NEFs contain terms for 
reimbursement and are typically presented to providers without any 
opportunity to negotiate Unfortunately, if a provider opts out of a 
particular network, that provider is typically unable to re-enter that 
network until the next year as illustrated in the figure below:

    See Infinity Pharmacy, LLC, Exhibit J-8, August 17, 2020 
Communication.

Further, providers are required by PBMs to opt-out before they know 
which plans will be participating in which network making it impossible 
for providers to ``model out'' reimbursement because it doesn't know 
which claims will process through which networks. However, providers 
cannot simply opt out of a network because physicians will simply cease 
sending prescriptions to a pharmacy provider unless it is member of 
every major PBM due to administrative costs. See Tri Pharmacy Corp. D/
b/a Hartley Pharmacy v. Caremark, L.L.C. et al., AAA Case No. 01-22-
0005-2609, Verified Statement of Claims,  51. Thus, choosing not to 
participate in a particular network has dire consequences for an 
independent pharmacy provider.
                2.  PBMs Impose Unreasonable Dispute Resolution 
                    Procedures
PBMs impose unreasonable dispute resolution procedures and limitations 
in an attempt to curtail pharmacy providers from filing claims against 
them. For example, Caremark requires that disputes be filed ``within 
six (6) months from the date of the final audit findings; (b) for 
termination related disputes, within six (6) months from the date of 
the notification of termination; and (c) for all other disputes, within 
six (6) months from the date on which the facts giving rise to the 
dispute first arose.'' See 2022 Caremark Provider Manual, 
Sec. 15.09.07. Further, OptumRx requires that such notice ``shall be 
provided [. . .] within one year of the facts giving rise to the 
Dispute.'' See 2023 OptumRx Provider Manual, p. 128. Thus, a pharmacy 
provider's claim will be barred entirely if it is asserted outside of 
this contractually imposed period. PBMs also impose a short statute of 
limitations between dispute notice and filing of an arbitration demand. 
Caremark requires that ``any demand for arbitration must be filed 
within six (6) months from the date of the issuance of the Dispute 
Notice.'' See 2022 Caremark Provider Manual, Sec. 15.09.07.
                3.  PBMs Impose Unilateral Escrow Requirements on 
                    Independent Pharmacies wishing to Initiate 
                    Arbitration or Litigation
Additional barrier to dispute resolution, PBMs impose unilateral escrow 
requirements for providers seeking to initiate arbitration or 
litigation. Providers are required to escrow money in an amount 
contemplated to cover the estimated amount in controversy, including 
attorneys' fees. But smaller stakeholders often cannot escrow large 
sums of money prior to filing for arbitration and are often dissuaded 
from filing suit on this reason alone, or in conjunction with the 
reasons detailed below.
                4.  PBM Contracts with Providers Contain Fee Shifting 
                    Clauses Which Serves as an Additional Barrier for 
                    Providers to Initiate Litigation.
PBM contracts shift fees and costs of the arbitration to the 
unsuccessful party. See 2022 Caremark Provider Manual, Sec. 15.09.02; 
see also 2023 OptumRx Provider Manual, p. 130. However, because PBMs 
unilaterally draft and impose their contracts, the ``deck'' is stacked 
in their favor. As a result, many providers are unwilling to take such 
considerable risk to challenge a PBM's unreasonable conduct, have to 
escrow money, pay their attorneys' fees and arbitration costs, and 
potentially have to pay for the PBM's fees and costs as well.
                5.  As a Further Deterrent to Provider Litigation, PBMs 
                    Often Require a Panel of Three Arbitrators Which 
                    Increases Costs Exponentially
As a further deterrent, PBMs often require a panel of three arbitrators 
which increases costs exponentially. Under the Commercial Rules of 
Arbitration for the American Arbitration Association, unless the 
parties can agree otherwise, ``three arbitrators shall hear and 
determine the case'' where the amount in dispute exceeds $3,000,000. 
Commercial Arbitration Rules, L-2(a). Perhaps recognizing that the cost 
is more prohibitive for providers than it is for PBMs, PBMs simply 
refuse to consent to cases being heard by a single arbitrator, opting 
for a panel of three instead. See Tennessee Oncology, PLLC v. Caremark, 
L.L.C., et al., AAA Case No. 01-20-0001-7548; New York Cancer and Blood 
Specialists v. Caremark, L.L.C., et al., AAA Case No. 01-21-0016-4612. 
Coupled with fee shifting clauses, providers are heavily dissuaded from 
pursuing their rights against PBMs because of these exorbitant costs. 
See Also 2023 OptumRx Provider Manual, Sec. L, p. 128.
                6.  PBMs Require Waiver of Class Action, Multiple Party 
                    Arbitrations, and Consolidated Actions, Preventing 
                    Providers and the Public from Identifying 
                    Widespread Abuses
As a significant bar to litigation and arbitration, PBMs prevent 
providers from engaging in disputes as part of a class, mass, or 
consolidated action. This further prevents providers and the public 
from identifying widespread PBM abuses.\77\ The limitation on class, 
mass, and consolidated actions also prevents pooling of resources to 
challenge PBM abuses that otherwise go unchallenged because it is not 
cost effective to do so. Further, restrictive confidentiality 
provisions prevent providers from talking about PBM abuses and 
determining whether they could be experiencing the same or similar 
legal issues, and disclosing those issues publicly.

Manual, p. 127  2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                7.  Due to Confidentiality, PBM Contracts are Shrouded 
                    in Secrecy and Prevent Their Abusive Tactics from 
                    Becoming Public
PBM contracts with providers are highly confidential, and they take 
great steps to prohibit providers from discussing any information 
obtained during the course of the PBM relationship with any other 
parties outside that relationship, including patients, physicians, plan 
sponsors, and even the general public.\78\ Thus, providers are 
prohibited from communicating with each other, plans, patients, and 
even government entities absent a lawful reason to do so, such as a 
lawful government request or subpoena. As a result, many of the PBM's 
abusive tactics simply never become public because of strict 
confidentiality requirements.

            G.  DIR Performance Measurements Are Incorrect and not 
                    Reasonable or Relevant, and Therefore Violate the 
                    Federal Any Willing Provider Law
Each major PBM has a Medicare Part D Performance Network ostensibly 
designed to measure pharmacies' performance in certain categories, most 
often focused on patient adherence to medication (See, e.g., Caremark 
2021 Medicare Part D Program Overview; Express Scripts Performance 
Network Protocol; Humana Rx Quality Program; OptumRx UHC M&R Specialty 
Network Amendment). If a pharmacy does not meet performance goals, the 
pharmacy is penalized with higher DIR fees, thus greatly reducing 
reimbursement for Part D drugs, and enriching Plans and PBMs.\79\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \79\ See 87 FR 89 at 27850.

PBMs employ secretive, often unreasonable, and simply incorrect metrics 
that are not relevant to pharmacies' clinical goals--especially as the 
metrics are applied to specialty pharmacies and physician dispensing 
practices. Specialty pharmacies often do not dispense the retail drugs 
that PBMs measure. Aside from medication adherence, these programs 
often include metrics focused on other metrics that are not reasonable 
or relevant to some or all pharmacies.\80\ Some of the most egregious 
examples include PBMs focusing on adherence metrics for typical 
``maintenance'' medications--that is, medications that patients are 
expected to take regularly and with few, if any, interruptions, 
typically including drugs treating high cholesterol, high blood 
pressure, and diabetes. Caremark 2021 Medicare Part D Program Overview. 
Most specialty pharmacies do not dispense these drugs, instead focusing 
on specialty disease states.\81\ For some, this means that they are 
subjected to alternative adherence metrics that are equally 
inapplicable to their business, like Generic Dispense Rate (GDR). 
OptumRx 2022 M&R Network Amendment To The Medicare Part D Addendum To 
The Pharmacy Network Agreement. For others, it means they are assigned 
mysterious and un-auditable average scores from other pharmacies in the 
network that actually dispense these products, or a default score. 
Caremark 2021 Medicare Part D Program Overview, Express Scripts 
Performance Network Protocol. Ultimately, these metrics are not 
reasonable or relevant to specialty pharmacies and dispensing practices 
and serve merely as a means to extract DIR fees from pharmacies without 
a benefit to patients and, indeed, often increasing patient co-
insurance.\82\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                1.  PBMs Use Incorrect Methods to Calculate Specialty 
                    Pharmacy Medication Possession Ratio
Medication Possession Ratio (``MPR'') is a method some PBMs use to 
calculate a Medicare beneficiary's adherence to a specialty drug, and 
examines whether a patient had her prescribed medication in her 
possession during the entire period during which she was directed by 
her prescriber to take that medication. However, MPR is a poor measure 
for assessing patient adherence specialty drugs, especially because the 
PBM will incorrectly treat specialty drugs as though they are 
``maintenance'' medications, expecting the patient to remain on the 
therapy indefinitely. Deposition of David Hutchins, New York Cancer & 
Blood Specialists v. Caremark, LLC et al., AAA case 01-21-0016-4612, 
T201:17-203:9.

MPR is problematic in specialty settings like oncology ``because 
adverse events experienced by oncology medications often call for a 
temporary discontinuation of therapy until the patient's status returns 
to an acceptable level.''\83\ Even though a patient has fully complied 
with the physician's order, PBMs will not account for holds in therapy, 
disease progression, referrals to palliative care, or even death in 
their MPR calculation. Tennessee Oncology v. Caremark, Transcript of 
Final Hearing, Volume 1, T179:4-22. This measurement is wholly unfair 
to specialty pharmacies and dispensing practices.

                2.  Some PBMs Incorrectly Use Mean Imputation to Score 
                    Specialty Pharmacies in DIR Fee Programs because 
                    the Specialty Pharmacies have no Relevant 
                    Experience in the Categories that the PBMs Measure
Because PBMs designed DIR fee programs for retail pharmacies, PBMs have 
had difficulty rationally applying adherence metrics to specialty 
pharmacies. Another method employed by PBMs to extract DIR fees from 
specialty pharmacies and dispensing practices is the use of ``Mean 
Imputation,'' in which the average score of all pharmacies in a network 
are ``imputed'' to a pharmacy that has no volume for a particular 
metric. 2022 CVS Caremark Trimester 1 Report for NCPDP 3360271 at 15. 
In other words, specialty pharmacies that do not dispense retail drugs 
are nonetheless assigned a score as though they had an average 
performance in the network, meaning that the pharmacy can never achieve 
the highest score in the network and therefore be assigned the lowest 
possible DIR fees, despite the PBM's assurance that the pharmacy will 
not be ``disadvantaged'' in this process. Ibid. The PBM believes this 
is appropriate because, in their words, specialty pharmacies ``self-
niche . . . [o]r limit their own dispensing[.]'' Deposition of Steven 
McCall, New York Cancer & Blood Specialists v. Caremark, LLC et al., 
AAA case 01-21-0016-4612, 2T122:4-12.

PBMs minimize the importance of specialty dispensing and penalize these 
providers for their focus on these vulnerable populations. This is 
especially egregious where a dispensing oncology practice is legally 
prohibited from dispensing any drugs except for those pursuant to an 
oncological protocol, as is the case in New York.\84\ Thus, even where 
a dispensing practice is legally prohibited from dispensing retail 
drugs, PBMs paradoxically insist that they should dispense those drugs, 
and penalize oncology practices for not doing so. 2022 CVS Caremark 
Trimester 1 Report for NCPDP 3360271 (demonstrating the mean imputed 
assessment of non-specialty DIR fees against a New York dispensing 
practice where that practice was legally prohibited from dispensing 
those drugs). Thus, applying the AWPL regulation at 42 CFR 
423.505(b)(18), mean imputation is not reasonable or relevant to 
specialty providers, and is simply another means by which PBMs assess 
DIR fees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \84\ N.Y. Educ. Law Sec. 1A6807 (``no prescriber who is not the 
owner of a pharmacy or who is not in the employ of such owner, may 
dispense more than a 72 hour supply of drugs, except for: . . . the 
dispensing of drugs pursuant to an oncological or AIDS protocol.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                3.  Formulary Compliance
PBMs also assess DIR fees based on formulary compliance. 2022 CVS 
Caremark Trimester 1 Report for NCPDP 3360271. This metric is measured 
by taking all the claims that were submitted by the pharmacy during the 
measured time period, then dividing that number by the formulary 
medications that were filled in the period, without accounting for 
whether the medication was prescribed for patient health reasons or 
subject to prior authorization by the PBM. Deposition of Steven McCall, 
New York Cancer & Blood Specialists v. Caremark, LLC et al., AAA case 
01-21-0016-4612 T310:9-311:12. This practice harms all pharmacies 
because pharmacies are often not permitted to dispense a different drug 
than prescribed by a physician. Moreover, this metric is particularly 
burdensome for oncology practices. Such practices often use genetic 
testing to identify the oral oncolytic that will provide the greatest 
chance of survival.\85\ These tests may indicate a drug that is not on 
formulary, but is nevertheless the clinically appropriate drug for the 
patient. Regardless, PBMs will penalize this ``off formulary'' 
prescription when the provider dispenses the drug.

                4.  PBMs Maintain a Lack of Transparency that Prevents 
                    Providers from Verifying Accuracy in Performance 
                    Networks, and Requires Providers to Resort to 
                    Arbitration/Litigation Discovery to Properly Audit 
                    DIR Programs
As they assess DIR fees against pharmacy providers, PBMs lack 
transparency, prevent pharmacies from performing any PBM audit absent 
arbitration or litigation. Pharmacies have brought claims in 
arbitration against Caremark over DIR fees multiple times, with some of 
these cases being made public.\86\ Each time pharmacies are forced to 
confirm awards against Caremark, as shown above, Caremark has 
assiduously attempted to hide the results from the public, despite the 
high bar for sealing these matters.\87\ In the Mission Wellness case, 
the now public Award revealed Caremark refused to produce calculations 
related to its assessment of DIR fees, such that the arbitrator applied 
an adverse inference to Caremark for the lack of transparency.\88\ 
Other PBMs are no different, with PBMs refusing to provide such 
information on a regular basis. Biologics, Inc. v. OptumRx, Inc., AAA 
Case 01-20-0007-3159, Order on Claimant's Motion to Compel Documents 
(granting the pharmacy's request for the underlying surveys supporting 
OptumRx's NPS scores for the pharmacy). A lack of transparency makes it 
impossible for pharmacies to truly understand the manner in which they 
are assessed DIR fees, and serves only to advantage the PBMs, who are 
in a better position to afford the expense of litigation.

            H. Patient Steering to PBM-Owned Pharmacy
Patient-steering is a practice where PBMs utilize their position and 
control over (1) plan development and (2) the ``network'' of pharmacy 
providers to direct patients away from non-affiliated providers to 
affiliated providers. PBMs use various methods of steering with the 
ultimate goal of directing patients to the PBM affiliated pharmacy.\89\ 
Examples of patient steering include incentives to plan sponsors and/or 
patients for using affiliated pharmacy operations including lower 
copays. Id. Pharmacies learn of patient steering in different ways but 
often will find that in adjudicating a claim, the PBM requires the 
prescription to be transferred to a PBM owned pharmacy operation. Id. 
There are valid concerns with patient steering including (1) 
eliminating fair competition thus promoting further consolidation and 
(2) interference with patient choice of provider. Id.

            I.  PBMs Utilize Unfair Audit Practices and Policies 
                    Against Network Providers to Increase Profits and 
                    Create Narrow Networks
PBMs have employed several unfair audit practices and policies to levy 
significant and unnecessary chargebacks against pharmacies on 
prescription drug claims. As a result of such aggressive auditing 
practices and associated chargebacks, often in violation of State 
Pharmacy Fair Audit Laws, pharmacies are often subjected to further 
network action (i.e., termination) or are forced to close down.
                1.  Unreasonable Audit Fees Cause Significant Financial 
                    Harm to Providers
In addition to seeking a full chargeback of the claims identified as 
discrepant during an audit, PBMs will also assess audit fees, claiming 
that they need to cover the cost of an audit. As a result, not only are 
pharmacies required to remit the full reimbursement of the claim back 
to the PBM, they are often also required to pay an additional fee up to 
20% of the total audit amount, causing their total chargeback to be 
exponentially higher. It is even more concerning that in some 
instances, PBMs are essentially ``double-dipping'' to cover the cost of 
an audit through audit fees from pharmacies despite already being 
compensated from their Plan Sponsor clients for the cost of conducting 
audits.
                2.  PBMs Seek Additional Network Sanctions Without 
                    Procedural Due Process
Often, even before audit results are issued and before the pharmacy has 
an opportunity to defend against audit results, PBMs will place 
pharmacies on payment suspension. Pharmacies that are placed on payment 
suspension even before they receive any audit results are faced with an 
impossible position because they do not know the amount at issue in the 
audit and have not been given an opportunity to resolve the basis of 
suspension. OptumRx Pharmacy Provider Manual 2023 Second Edition 
Version 2.1. PBMs will even go so far as to prevent pharmacies from 
adjudicating claims, which means that pharmacies cannot service their 
patients, causing an interruption and harm to patient care. Elixir 
Solutions Pharmacy Manual 2022. Similarly, PBMs will take unilateral 
decisions to terminate pharmacies over audit results that are minor and 
do not otherwise justify termination and even before pharmacies have an 
opportunity to appeal or dispute the results. PBMs have guised 
terminations to be justifiable based on audit results even though the 
results might be inaccurate and importantly, do not amount to a 
pharmacy's network termination that in turn impacts patient care.
                3.  Unreasonable Limitations on Third-Party Copay 
                    Processors and Bulk Purchases Create Challenges for 
                    Pharmacies
PBMs also place onerous contractual limitations on pharmacies despite 
there being no similar prohibition under relevant State and Federal 
rules and regulations. For example, PBMs limit the way pharmacies may 
collect copayment from their patients. Similarly, PBMs will also limit 
the window of purchase information to consider when conducting invoice 
reconciliation audits, and by doing so, PBMs ignore standard pharmacy 
practices under which a pharmacy makes continuous, if not bulk, 
purchases based on anticipated patient need. This limitation directly 
conflicts with many PBMs' requirement that pharmacies need to maintain 
``adequate inventory'' of prescription drugs and supplies. OptumRx 
Pharmacy Provider Manual 2023 Second Edition Version 2.1. Though 
pharmacies must maintain sufficient quantities of drugs, they are faced 
with chargebacks when PBMs do not consider their purchases information 
during an audit. A violation of these unreasonable contract terms 
results in significant chargebacks and often network termination.
                4.  PBMs Unreasonably Terminate Pharmacies Despite 
                    Having Sufficient Documentation to Resolve Audit 
                    Discrepancies
During audits, PBMs will identify certain documentation they will 
accept to resolve a discrepancy. However, even though pharmacies 
closely adhere to these documentation guidelines when appealing an 
audit and obtaining the required documentation, PBMs often still deny 
their appeal efforts. For example, a pharmacy may get an attestation 
from the patient to confirm a prescription, but if the PBM cannot later 
get in touch with the same patient to validate the attestation, the 
pharmacy will still be subject to a full chargeback of the claim and 
potential network termination. As a result, PBMs will subject 
pharmacies to chargeback and potential termination for the failure to 
produce medical records, despite the unreasonable requirement that 
pharmacies maintain this information.

IV.  PBM Retaliation and Silencing Opposition: The Medicare Part D 
                    Program Protects Providers with Anti-retaliation 
                    regulation, but PBMs still Retaliate Against 
                    Providers Who Bring Meritorious Claims

PBM and Payor consolidation has resulted in a marketplace in which 
network participation with all PBMs is necessary to remain in 
operation. Consequently, network termination is the worst fear of many 
providers. When discussing litigation or arbitration against PBMs, 
providers prudently express concern over potential retaliatory action 
by a PBMs for asserting statutory and contractual rights. These 
concerns are not always misplaced. Even though the law is clear, PBMs 
often take the position that the law does not apply. However, a review 
of anti-retaliation laws shows the prohibition on retaliation is clear.

The Social Security Act and related regulations expressly prohibit 
retaliation by a prescription drug plan sponsor or Part D sponsor's 
agent, the PBM, against a provider for exercising a right of action. 
Public Health and Welfare Act, Requirements for and contracts with PDP 
Sponsors, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395w-112(b)(4)(F)(ii); 42 CFR Sec. 423.520. 
Medicare statutes and regulations also require that a contract between 
a provider and a Part D plan sponsor, or agents thereof, incorporate 
anti-retaliation provisions. Public Health Welfare Act, Medicare 
Program, Contract Provisions, 42 CFR Sec. 423.505(b)(19) (incorporating 
42 CFR Sec. 423.520). In a scenario where the PBM has ``inadvertently 
omitted'' the anti-retaliation language from the provider agreement, a 
court will likely read the language into the contract because of these 
statutory obligations. Thus, pharmacies should be protected against 
retaliatory conduct, such as network termination or sudden audits.

Providers are also afforded additional anti-retaliation protections 
under ERISA. In addition to the protections that the Social Security 
Act provides regarding Federal healthcare programs, ERISA prohibits 
retaliatory action arising out of commercial plans. As such, PBMs are 
expressly prohibited from engaging in retaliatory action against 
pharmacies for exercising their contractual rights. Employee Retirement 
Income Security Program, Interference with Protected Rights, 29 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1140 (stating that ``it shall be unlawful for any person to 
discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline or discriminate against a 
participant or beneficiary for exercising any to which he is entitled . 
. .''). In addition to the foregoing, providers are also be protected 
under State law directly associated with retaliatory action by 
PBMs.\90\ Thus, providers are entitled to anti-retaliation protections 
in both federal and commercial healthcare programs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \90\ For example, in Massachusetts, PBMs are prohibited from 
refusing to contract with a provider if the provider has advocated on 
behalf of past, current or prospective patients against the PBM. See 
Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 176O, Sec. 4. Moreover, such retaliatory 
action would likely be deemed an unfair trade practice and subject to 
an action under Massachusetts law. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 176D, 
Sec. 3.

Unfortunately, pharmacy providers face a real threat of retaliation by 
PBMs for any challenge to the PBM's DIR Program. Retaliation in this 
manner is prohibited in the Medicare Part D Program. 42 CFR 
Sec. 423.505(b)(19) (incorporating 42 CFR Sec. 423.520(g) (``Anti-
retaliation. Consistent with applicable Federal or State law, a Part D 
sponsor may not retaliate against an individual, pharmacy, or provider 
for exercising a right of action under paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section.''). Heedless of the law, PBMs have retaliated against 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
pharmacies in direct contravention of the law.

In the arbitration Caremark, LLC and CaremarkPCS, LLC v. Senderra Rx 
Partners, LLC, AAA Case No.: 01-20-0007-3182, a PBM retaliated against 
a specialty pharmacy specifically for bringing challenges to its DIR 
Program by attempting to terminate the pharmacy entirely from its 
networks. In their Final Award, the Panel found the PBM had, in fact, 
retaliated against the pharmacy in violation of federal law by 
attempting to terminate the pharmacy because the pharmacy sent a 
dispute notice to the PBM challenging its DIR Program. Caremark, LLC 
and CaremarkPCS, LLC v. Senderra Rx Partners, LLC, AAA Case No.: 01-20-
0007-3182. Final Award, at 17. The Panel entered a permanent injunction 
against the PBM based upon this illegal retaliation. Ibid. 
Unfortunately, due to the lack of transparency in the PBMs' secretive 
contracts with pharmacies, it is unknown whether this or other PBMs' 
retaliatory actions will be brought to light.

Other pharmacies have been similarly retaliated against. In another 
arbitration, a specialty pharmacy had to bring an emergency action to 
prevent its termination from a PBM's network, again because the 
pharmacy had challenged the DIR Program. AON Pharmacy, LLC v. Caremark 
et al., AAA Case No. 01-22-0003-8522. That retaliation was resolved 
when the PBM withdrew its termination during oral argument, but only 
after the pharmacy expended tremendous resources in bringing the 
emergency claim. AON Pharmacy, LLC v. Caremark et al., AAA Case No. 01-
22-0003-8522, Order Approving Respondents' Withdrawal of Termination 
Notice. Yet other Specialty Pharmacies have been threatened with 
termination for bringing similar claims. Caremark letters to Onco360, 
BioPlus. Retaliation is a real and continuing problem, and PBMs can 
hide these retaliative acts behind the cloak of confidentiality.

V.  PBM Conduct Conflicts With Plan Sponsor Interests By Imposing 
                    Spread Pricing to Increase Plan Sponsor Cots and 
                    Using Rebate Aggregators to Avoid Obligations to 
                    Pass Through Drug Manufacturer Rebates

            A. Spread Pricing/Differential Pricing
PBMs retain the margin between what they charge plan sponsors such as 
Medicare or Medicaid, and what they reimburse dispensing pharmacies for 
the same prescription claim--a process referred to as ``spread 
pricing.'' When PBMs retain these margins, or ``spreads,'' the costs to 
plan sponsors are artificially inflated above the actual cost of each 
prescription claim. Plan sponsors are often unaware that their PBM 
Agreements allow PBMs to retain spread--effectively handing the PBM a 
``blank check.'' For example, buried in Exhibit D of Express Scripts, 
Inc.'s (``ESI'') contract with County of Ventura for the Ventura County 
Health Care Plan, it states:

        PBM agreements generally provide that a client pay ESI an 
        ingredient cost, plus dispensing fee, for drug claims at a 
        unform rate. If the rate paid by a client exceeds the rate 
        contracted with a particular pharmacy, ESI will realize a 
        positive margin on the applicable claim.\91\

Management Agreement, Exhibit D, 39, available at https://
nationalprescriptioncoveragecoalition.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/
WebPage-1.pdf.

In the Medicare and Medicaid contexts, taxpayers/patients bear the 
costs of these artificially inflated prices. By way of example, on 
August 16, 2018, the Auditor of the State of Ohio issued an audit 
report on the State Medicaid Managed Care Pharmacy Services wherein the 
audit report revealed staggering ``spread'' findings.\92\ From April 1, 
2017 through March 31, 2018, the Auditor's analysis determined that CVS 
Caremark (``Caremark'') and OptumRx, Inc. (``Optum''), the PBMs 
contracted with Ohio Medicaid's managed care organizations, retained, 
on average, $5.71 as spread across all claims.\93\ With respect to 
generic drugs, which made up eighty-six point one percent (86.1%) of 
all claims, the average spread was $6.14 per claim.\94\ In total, 
Caremark and Optum retained nearly $225 million in spread in only one 
plan year.\95\ Caremark and Optum paid pharmacists nearly $225 million 
less than what they charged taxpayers through Ohio's Medicaid program.

Spread pricing is not unique to Ohio Medicaid's program. 3 Axis 
Advisors, LLC (``3 Axis''), a research and analytics firm focused on 
understanding the prescription drug supply chain and prescription drug 
cost drivers, has ``found strong evidence of spread pricing in Medicaid 
programs in New York, Illinois, and Michigan,'' and noted that state 
government work in Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia, and Maryland ``has 
definitively quantified spread in their state's Medicaid programs as 
well.\96\ Likewise, in their analysis of Florida Medicaid prescription 
drug claims, 3 Axis found that in 2017 and 2018, Caremark retained 
$8.27 per claim--generating just over $10 million in 2018 alone.

3 Axis's analysis of Florida Medicaid also exposes the concept of 
differential pricing. Differential pricing occurs when PBMs charge or 
reimburse different rates for filling the same drug at different 
pharmacies, almost always with the intent of advantaging the PBM-owned 
or affiliated pharmacy.\97\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \97\ See Id., at 61.

To illustrate, one of Florida's top MCOs, Sunshine/Centene (managed in 
part by Caremark), reported a weighted average unit cost of 
aripiprazole of $11.18 when filled at CVS pharmacies.\98\ However, when 
the same aripiprazole was filled at competing pharmacies, the weighted 
average unit cost reported ranged from $0.53 across independent 
pharmacies.\99\ In the aggregate, Sunshine/Centene priced generics to 
create $3.1 million in Margin over NADAC \100\ in 2018--of which $2.9 
million (94%) was reported at a CVS pharmacy.\101\ Although Florida 
determined the cost of dispensing a prescription claim is $10.24 in the 
Medicaid fee-for-service context,\102\ Florida pharmacies participating 
in Medicaid managed care that are not affiliated with PBMs received a 
weighted average of $1.97 per claim as payment for servicing Florida's 
Medicaid patients.\103\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \98\ See Id., at 65.
    \99\ See Id., at 66.
    \100\ It is the total reported MCO claim payment less the claim's 
National Average Drug Acquisition Cost.
    \101\ See Id., at 74.
    \102\ See Id., at 2.
    \103\ See Id., at 142.

Differential pricing is a product of vertical integration in the 
prescription drug supply chain. When differential pricing results in 
independent pharmacies receiving razor-thin payments--as discovered in 
Florida--it is ultimately Medicaid patients and independent pharmacies 
that face the most risk. Disadvantaged patients are put at risk when 
independent pharmacies are forced to close because of minimal or 
negative margins received from PBMs. When local pharmacies are forced 
to close, particularly in low-income and rural areas, patient access to 
medication and medication adherence rates suffer. Consequently, the 
likelihood of disease state complications and hospital visits rises--
resulting in disproportionate financial risk to state and/or federal 
governments and worse healthcare outcomes for Medicare and Medicaid 
patients.\104\

Sends Some Patients Back to the Hospital (August 1, 2016).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            B.  Rebates/Rebate Aggregators

Aside from pricing schemes designed to boost PBM profits at the expense 
of patients, taxpayers, independent pharmacies, and plan sponsors, 
possibly the most significant area of PBM profit arises in the context 
of manufacturer rebate manipulation. Similar to spread pricing 
provisions, PBMs impose misleading or opaque language in the PBM 
Agreements to allow themselves or an affiliated rebate aggregator to 
withhold rebate dollars from plan sponsors. PBMs routinely purport to 
provide their clients with one hundred percent (100%), but these 
``pass-through'' contract provisions are designed to deceive plan 
sponsors. For example, in its contract with Orange County, Optum agreed 
to provide the Orange County the greater of ``100% pass-through of 
actual Total Rebates''\105\ or the minimum guarantees.\106\ By limiting 
the Orange County's entitlement to rebates Optum actually receives, the 
agreement fails to address portions of rebate dollars retained by 
Optum's subcontracted or affiliated rebate aggregators.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \105\ Id., at 24. (``Total Rebates will include all compensation or 
remuneration Contractor receives from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
(branded and generic), attributable to the purchase or utilization of 
covered drugs (including Specialty Drugs) by an eligible member'').

Each of the three major PBMs, Caremark, Optum, and ESI, have vertically 
integrated rebate aggregators tasked with administering their rebate 
programs,\107\ making it difficult to grasp the full extent of rebate 
dollars collected by PBMs and rebate aggregators. PBMs and their 
subsidiary rebate aggregators carefully guard this revenue to prevent 
clients from identifying the payment arrangement. These major PBMs have 
vertically integrated rebate aggregators including Ascent Health 
Services (owned by Cigna/ESI), Emisar Pharma Services and Coalition for 
Advanced Pharmacy Services (owned by UnitedHealth Group/Optum), and 
Zinc Health Services (owned by CVS Health/Caremark). These rebate 
aggregators also provide services to other PBMs. For example, Humana 
and Prime use Ascent Health Services for rebate aggregation. Also, it 
is worth noting that Ascent Health Services is based out of Switzerland 
and Emisar Pharma Services is headquartered in Ireland.

In 2017, Broward County, Florida, released an Audit Report detailing 
the rebate scheme perpetuated by Optum.\108\ Optum utilized a complex 
web of subcontracts that included Optum's arrangement with its wholly 
owned rebate aggregator and additional contract with ESI. Optum 
maximized the rebates it retained at the expense of the Broward County 
and the taxpayers, all while representing that it paid Broward County 
all rebate funds it received.\109\

Rebate aggregators are also prevalent in Medicare Part D space. Frier 
Levitt represented a Medicare Part D Sponsor in its rebate dispute 
against a PBM owned by a publicly traded company. Frier Levitt 
uncovered that the PBM, unbeknownst to the Part D Sponsor, delegated 
its rebate functions to a rebate aggregator, who in turn, subcontracted 
with a major PBM.\110\ We recovered $6.25M in rebates for one (1) 
calendar year for the Part D Sponsor. It is also worth noting that the 
PBM provided rebate-related data to the Part D Sponsor to submit the 
annual DIR reports to the CMS. However, in the DIR reports, the PBM did 
not specify whether the rebates that were not passed to the Part D 
Sponsor included rebates retained by the rebate aggregators. In fact, 
the Medicare Part D DIR Reporting Guidance fails to require PBMs to 
report rebates retained by rebate aggregators.\111\ PBMs drive up the 
total drug spending of plan sponsors including Medicare and Medicaid 
through spread pricing on reimbursement for prescription drugs and 
manufacturer rebates, and by utilizing PBM-owned or affiliated rebate 
aggregators.

VI.  PBMs Have Systematically Warped the Benefit and Intent of the 340B 
                    Drug Program for Their Own Financial Gain By 
                    Redirecting a Significant Portion of 340B Revenue 
                    Intended for Healthcare Providers

Congress implemented and designed the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program 
(``340B Program'' or ``340B'') in 1992 through the Veteran's Health 
Care Act (P.L. 102-585) to assist certain healthcare providers--
referred to as ``Covered Entities''--that serve poor, uninsured or 
otherwise vulnerable populations by permitting them to purchase 
prescription drugs at lower costs from manufacturers.\112\ 
Specifically, pursuant to the 340B Program, drug manufacturers are 
required to charge Covered Entities no more than a significantly 
discounted ``ceiling price'' on certain outpatient prescription, in 
exchange for the manufacturer's drug products being covered by Medicaid 
and Medicare Part B.\113\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \112\ See Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-585, 
Sec. 602 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. Sec. 256b); see also 
Overview of the 340B Drug Discount Program, https://
crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12232 (October 14, 2022).
    \113\ 42 U.S.C. Sec. 256b(a)(1),(4).

Under 340B, Covered Entities can acquire drugs from manufacturers at 
extreme discounts from what is normally available. In turn, Covered 
Entities are (in theory) able to ``pass on'' those savings to their 
patients through lower costs for medications, or, as contemplated by 
340B itself, Covered Entities can seek reimbursement for 340B drugs in 
the normal course and use those greater profit margins to subsidize 
other unfunded areas of their operations. It is fundamental to the 340B 
Program that Covered Entities are credited for their ability to 
``provide direct clinical care to large numbers of uninsured 
Americans'' regardless of the patient's ability to pay.\114\ As 
articulated by Congress itself, the 340B Program's purpose is ``to 
enable covered entities to stretch scarce Federal resources as far as 
possible, reaching more eligible patients and providing more 
comprehensive services.''\115\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \114\ See H.R. Rep. No. 102-384, pt. 2, at 12 (September 22, 1992).
    \115\ Id.; see also HRSA, Notice Regarding Section 602 of the 
Veterans Health Care Act of 1992; Contract Pharmacy Services, 61 Fed. 
Reg. 43,551 (August 23, 1996) (wherein the Health Resources and 
Services Administration (``HRSA''), the federal agency charged with 
administering the 340B Program, opines that 340B is designed so that 
CEs would ``pass all or significant part of the discount to their 
patients.'')

Since its implementation in 1992, the 340B Program has grown 
exponentially. Approximately 14% of all pharmaceutical sales in the 
United States, or $93.6 billion, are accounted for under 340B.\116\ 
340B has grown five times faster than the overall drug market,\117\ 
with 340B expenditures quadrupling since 2014.\118\ In terms of 
magnitude, it is the second largest federal drug program, behind only 
Medicare Part D. By 2026, 340B is expected to exceed the size of both 
Medicaid and Medicare.\119\

Industry experts have opined that ``[t]he enormous growth in 340B 
contract pharmacy arrangements seems to boil down to a single factor: 
outsized profit margins.''\120\ Leveraging their role as the middle-men 
of the prescription drug industry, and substantial vertical integration 
amongst plan sponsors and pharmacies, PBMs have systematically, and 
increasingly, warped the benefit of intent of the 340B Program for 
their own financial gain. These abusive and problematic PBM practices 
are well documented, and negatively affect both patients and providers 
alike.\121\ Astoundingly, through these practices, vertically 
integrated health care conglomerates that own or are affiliated with 
PBMs retain upwards of 63.5% of the total 340B cost to payors and their 
patient beneficiaries.\122\ In effect, PBMs have diverted the 340B 
discounts and ``outsized profit margins''--intended to benefit the 
nation's most vulnerable and the providers that serve them--into the 
coffers of Fortune 500 companies. Put simply, PBMs have mutated the 
340B Program, a well-intentioned community benefit, into a virtual ATM 
cash machine for themselves, at the expense of Covered Entities, 
community contract pharmacies, and the patients they serve.

            A.  While Managing the 340B Drug Program, PBM-Owned 
                    Pharmacies Syphon Benefits Away from Covered 
                    Entities
Because certain Covered Entities, such as small community health 
centers, may not have in-house pharmacies, HRSA issued sub-regulatory 
guidance in 1996 permitting Covered Entities to ``contract'' with 
outside pharmacies (referred to as ``Contract Pharmacies'').\123\ 
Initially, HRSA restricted Covered Entities to contracting with only a 
single Contract Pharmacy.\124\ In 2010, however, HRSA dramatically 
shifted the 340B Contract Pharmacy landscape by permitting Covered 
Entities to maintain an unlimited number of Contract Pharmacy 
relationships.\125\ In the wake of this HRSA guidance, for-profit 
pharmacies, especially those owned or affiliated with PBMs, seized on 
the opportunity to capitalize on substantial 340B drug discounts. In 
fact, Contract Pharmacies owned by or affiliated with PBMs can retain 
upwards of twenty-five percent (25%) of the total 340B cost as their 
dispensing fee.\126\

    \123\ See 61 F.R. at 43549.

    \125\ See 75 F.R. 10272-01 (March 5, 2010).
    \126\ See infra, Section II.D., Figure 3.

Notably, the Contract Pharmacies participating in 340B are primarily 
not independent pharmacies. Rather, the vast majority of Contract 
Pharmacy arrangements are between Covered Entities and large for-profit 
pharmacies that are owned by or affiliated with the largest PBMs.\127\ 
Indeed, CVS Health, Walgreens, Cigna, UnitedHealth Group and Walmart--
now control 73% of all Contract Pharmacy relationships.\128\ Each of 
these entities also operate or are affiliated with a PBM. The three 
largest PBMs (Caremark, ESI and OptumRx), controlling 80% of the total 
prescription drug market, account for 39% of all Contract Pharmacy 
relationships through their owned or affiliated Contract 
Pharmacies.\129\ In 2021, Walgreens and CVS held the greatest 340B 
Contract Pharmacy market share with Walgreens controlling 31% of all 
retail Contract Pharmacies (up from 28% in 2020) and CVS controlling 
19% of all retail Contract Pharmacies (up from 20% in 2020).\130\ More 
than 80% of Walgreens retail pharmacy locations and two-thirds of CVS 
locations are Contract Pharmacies.\131\ Also noteworthy, in 2022, the 
three largest PBMs--Caremark, ESI and OptumRx--collectively owned 500 
mail order, specialty, and infusion Contract Pharmacies.\132\ These 500 
PBM-affiliated mail, specialty, and infusion pharmacies account for 
only 1.5% of all 340B Contract Pharmacy locations, but total a stunning 
21% of the total 340B Contract Pharmacy relationships with Covered 
Entities.\133\ And PBM-affiliated pharmacy's control over these 
channels continues to rapidly increase. As of 2020, there were 16,293 
Contract Pharmacy arrangements between Covered Entities and vertically 
integrated specialty pharmacies, representing a 1,006% growth from 
2016.\134\

Decade-Long 34B Tailwind Gives Way to Significant Pharmacy Headwind in 
1Q 2022, at 10 (noting that CVS controls the largest share of specialty 
Contract Pharmacies, with 30.1% of the market).

Based on this market dominance, Contract Pharmacies affiliated with 
Walgreens, Caremark, ESI and OptumRx are conservatively estimated to 
retain upwards of $2.58 billion in 340B discounts in 2022 alone.\135\ 
This is no small matter. If these corporations retain these discounts 
as profit, which is likely considering the Covered Entity supplies 340B 
drugs to the Contract Pharmacy at essentially no cost to the Contract 
Pharmacy, it would equate to between 6.4% to 17.4% of their adjusted 
operating profit.\136\ Further, in 2021, Walgreens Contract Pharmacies 
retained $994 million of 340B drug discounts, ESI Contract Pharmacies 
retained $561 million and OptumRx Contract Pharmacies retained $281 
million.\137\ Further evidencing the material impact the 340B Program 
is to the bottom lines of PBMs--who are notably not the intended 
beneficiaries of the Program--PBMs and their affiliated Contract 
Pharmacies have indicated that reductions to their 340B Contract 
Pharmacy footprint would significantly and materially affect overall 
profitability. For example, the annual reports of CVS Health and 
Walgreens Boots Alliance confirm that 340B profits are material to 
their business operations and warn that restrictive Contract Pharmacy 
policies enacted by drug manufacturers, which have been the subject of 
recent litigation,\138\ will negatively impact their bottom lines.\139\ 
Clearly, with the huge increase in Contract Pharmacies, 340B has 
mutated away from the original intention of Congress, to serve 
communities and patients in need, to increasing profits for large 
corporations.

            B.  PBM-Owned 340B Third Party Administrators Wrongful 
                    Conduct
The process of determining whether a particular claim is 340B eligible 
is complex, and responsibility for compliance lies with the Covered 
Entity.\140\ Covered Entities hire third-party administrators 
(``TPAs'') to retroactively determine 340B eligibility and rely on them 
to ensure 340B compliance.\141\ TPAs generally provide claims 
processing and management services and retroactively determine which 
claims are 340B eligible. Covered Entities also utilize the services of 
TPAs to appropriately calculate and reconcile the payments between 
themselves and Contract Pharmacies. TPAs are typically for-profit 
businesses and charge Covered Entities a fee for TPA services. For all 
such services, TPAs charge Covered Entities a fee, which is generally 
assessed on a per claim basis as a percentage of the amounts paid by 
the patient and their insurance. Some TPAs charge an estimated 7.5% of 
the total payment per claim for their reconciliation services. Notably, 
the largest TPAs are also vertically integrated with the largest PBMs: 
CVS Health owns the TPA Wellpartner.\142\ Cigna owns the TPA Verity 
Solutions.\143\ Walgreens owns the TPAs 340B Complete and Shields 
Health Solutions.\144\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \140\ Covered Entities are responsible for the compliance of their 
Contract Pharmacy(ies) and must comply with Section 340B of the Public 
Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 256b and relevant HRSA guidance.

Consistent with their virtual stranglehold on the Contract Pharmacy 
market, and motive to divert every 340B discount to themselves, TPAs 
vertically integrated with PBMs require Covered Entities to contract 
with and use their own Contract Pharmacies. For example, beginning in 
2018, CVS Health required Covered Entities seeking to enter into a 340B 
Contract Pharmacy arrangement with CVS to also utilize CVS Health's 
wholly owned TPA, Wellpartner, for 340B claim reconciliation.\145\ 
Covered Entities were presented with a choice: either use the PBM's TPA 
or not contract with CVS' vast network of Contract Pharmacies. CVS's 
Wellpartner now serves as the exclusive TPA for any CVS Contract 
Pharmacy arrangement--accounting for 19% of all retail Contract 
Pharmacies and 30.1% of all specialty Contract Pharmacies.\146\ 
Compounding this situation, Wellpartner charges Covered Entities a 
percentage of each claim they reconcile.

1341, 1347 (M.D.Fl. 2019) (``CVS now requires any covered entity that 
wants to fill 340B Program prescriptions at a CVS pharmacy to use 
Wellpartner as its program administrator. If the covered entity does 
not want to use Wellpartner as its 340B program administrator, it 
cannot utilize CVS as a contract pharmacy for the 340B program.'').

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            C.  PBMs Divert Funds Away from the Intended Beneficiaries 
                    of the 340B Program
Through their business practices described herein, and below, PBMs make 
every effort to divert as much of the substantial savings offered by 
the 340B Program away from their intended beneficiaries--the Covered 
Entities and their patients--to themselves and their affiliates. Two 
particular PBM abusive practices that are most concerning are: (1) PBMs 
collect substantial sums of DIR fees (described above) on 340B claims--
which diverts 340B funds away from Covered Entities, community Contract 
Pharmacies, and the patients they serve, and into the pockets of the 
PBMs; and (2) PBMs pay pharmacies below market pricing on 340B claims, 
further diverting 340B savings away from providers and into the PBM 
(and their affiliate's) pockets.
                1.  PBMs Collect Significant DIR Fees on 340B Claims
PBMs force Contract Pharmacies to pay DIR fees on 340B claims, long 
after the PBM has adjudicated the claim and effected payment to the 
pharmacy. As described above, these DIR fees can be substantial 
percentages (for example 5%) of the overall reimbursement received by 
the pharmacy. By assessing DIR fees on 340B claims, PBMs are reducing 
the reimbursement amounts to pharmacies and pocketing these funds for 
themselves. In other words, the 340B savings intended to compensate 
providers for serving indigent populations, and to promote these 
providers to continue providing these essential services, are 
systematically siphoned away by PBMs through the assessment of DIR fees 
on 340B eligible claims. Making matters worse, the largest TPAs (such 
as Wellpartner) do not account for DIR fees assessed by their 
affiliated PBMs, which causes the TPAs to artificially inflate the 
total reimbursements received by the Covered Entity and/or Contract 
Pharmacy. Again, the TPA's fee is generally based on a percentage of 
the total dollar amount of the claim. Thus, an inflated claim amount 
(i.e., a claim that fails to account for DIR fees, reducing the total 
reimbursement) results in an inflated fee to the TPA. Thus, DIR fees on 
340B claim enrich not only PBMs, but also their TPA affiliates.
                2.  PBMs Pay Less for Medications Dispensed to 340B 
                    Patients
Not only do PBMs take a percentage DIR fee off the top of many 340B 
claims, PBMs reimburse providers at significantly reduced rates on 340B 
claims. This flies in the face of the intention of the 340B Program--
which specifically contemplates Covered Entities and their Contract 
Pharmacies obtaining a profit margin on 340B drugs as a means of 
funding charity care operations, that Congress has deemed essential. In 
other words, PBMs have unilaterally decided that PBMs should also share 
in the 340B Program's savings--even though PBMs do not provide any 
patient care and are not the intended beneficiaries of the Program.

Recently, several PBMs have sought to make the identification of 340B 
claims mandatory by 340B providers specially so that they can pay 
pharmacies less on these claims. ESI, for example, issued notice in 
February 2021 that Contract Pharmacies must retrospectively identify 
340B claims.\147\ Thereafter, PBMs (like ESI) began to impose 
significantly lower reimbursement rates for 340B claims, essentially 
usurping the savings that should have flowed to Covered Entities, even 
when a PBM owned or affiliated pharmacy may not have been the CP.\148\ 
It must be noted that while the PBMs are paying the pharmacy a 
significantly discounted rate, many PBMs are still charging the plan 
sponsor as if the claim were not 340B-eligible. The ``spread'' between 
the higher amounts the PBM charges the plan sponsor and the lower 
amounts the PBM reimburses the pharmacy for 340B claims, is retained by 
the PBM. This ``spread'' is intended for the Covered Entity, the 
Contract Pharmacy, and their patients; not the PBM. In effect, PBMs are 
singling out 340B drugs for reduced reimbursement, ``which essentially 
transfers the benefit of the program from safety net providers to for-
profit payers.''\149\ PBMs have thus ensured that they profit from 340B 
in as many ways as possible.

VII.  Recommendations to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance

Based on the foregoing, we recommend that the Committee take action to 
address the outsized and deleterious impact of PBMs on patients, plan 
sponsors, manufacturers, distributors, taxpayers and pharmacy 
providers. The vertical integration among PBMs has led to reduced 
competition, limited drug access, a lack of transparency, and higher 
costs for patients and plan sponsors. At the same time, PBMs have 
severely harmed the ability of unaffiliated pharmacy providers to 
continue to operate, putting a significant burden on pharmacy providers 
and their ability to provide essential care to patients.

To that end, we recommend the Committee address the following issues:

    1.  Inadequate Reimbursement to Pharmacy Providers by PBMs to 
Maintain a Robust Network of Quality Providers
        Through a variety of tactics, including DIR fees, generic and 
brand effective rate reconciliation, and outright below water 
reimbursement rates, PBMs seriously threaten the viability of a robust 
network of pharmacy providers outside of their affiliated providers. We 
call upon the Committee to investigate reimbursement rates to pharmacy 
providers (both those owned by PBMs and those that are unaffiliated), 
including a comprehensive study of reimbursement rates, network access 
and network adequacy. We further call upon the Committee to take action 
to set appropriate standards for establishing reimbursement rates to 
pharmacy providers. These standards must take into account actual 
available acquisition costs in the marketplace (including the 
differences based on pharmacy provider type), as well as reasonable 
dispensing fees taking into account the actual costs to dispense 
different types of medications. Such standards may either create a 
floor, or, alternatively, establish an appropriate formula for 
determining appropriate reimbursement rates, based on the 
aforementioned standards. Finally, the Committee must act to create an 
enforcement procedure to address instances where PBMs have not offered 
such appropriate reimbursement terms, as well as a dispute resolution 
framework in order for pharmacy providers and PBMs to effectively 
resolve such matters between themselves.

    2.  Bring PBMs Within the Bounds of the Law
        PBMs routinely and consistently maintain that they are not 
bound by a host of laws aimed at regulating conduct within the drug 
supply channel. Most notably, PBMs have asserted (successfully in some 
instances) that they are not bound by the federal any willing provider 
law, and thus, do not take such compliance obligations in mind when 
establishing pharmacy networks within the Medicare Part D program. 
Thus, we urge the Committee to clarify existing guidance regarding the 
applicability of such laws to PBMs, and, where necessary, amend 
relevant federal laws to apply to more clearly PBMs.

    3.  Reduce the Negative Impact of Vertical Integration and Rebate 
GPOs
        Through secretive offshore companies, PBMs have been able to 
circumvent the oversight and regulation intended by recent legislative 
and regulatory efforts aimed at adding transparency to rebates received 
on behalf of plan sponsors. Simply put, PBMs are still not passing 
through rebates received on behalf of their plan sponsor clients. We 
call upon the Committee to investigate the negative impact of PBM-owned 
Rebate GPOs on patients, plan sponsors and the federal government. We 
further call upon the Committee to take action to regulate PBMs' 
vertical integration, to reduce the negative consequences of such 
vertical integration, including the abusive power PBMs hold over 
formularies, and on wholesalers through unchecked buying power. 
Finally, we call on the Committee to recommend enforcement actions 
regarding PBMs' vertical integration, to protect patients, plan 
sponsors, pharmacy providers and taxpayers, alike.

The time for action is now. Pharmacy providers face existential threats 
due to PBM consolidation and integration. Thus, we implore the 
Committee to take action to protect patients, plan sponsors, taxpayers, 
and pharmacy providers, alike.

1 Executive Summary

There is growing awareness of the problems and pitfalls with Pharmacy 
Benefit Managers (PBMs) in the United States health care system. 
Contracted by plan sponsors (including government programs, self-
insured employers and insurance companies) to negotiate on their behalf 
with pharmaceutical companies, these ``middlemen'' corporations have 
quietly become an unavoidable part of our nation's health care system.

Today, fewer than five PBMs control more than 80% of drug benefits for 
over 260 million Americans, which includes the power to negotiate drug 
costs, what drugs will be included on plan formularies, and how those 
drugs are dispensed. Oftentimes, patients are required to receive drugs 
through PBM-owned or affiliated specialty and mail-order pharmacies and 
suffer serious, sometimes dangerous, and even deadly, impact of their 
abuses as a result of medication delays and denials.

However, while the role PBMs play in the U.S. health care system is 
complex and under scrutiny by both federal and state policymakers and 
the public, it is increasingly becoming clear that PBMs make up an 
oligopoly of rich, vertically integrated conglomerates that routinely 
prey on health care practices, providers, and their patients. PBMs have 
done this by overwhelmingly abusing their responsibility to protect 
Americans from this country's drug pricing crisis, instead exploiting 
the opacity throughout the nation's drug supply chain to enrich 
themselves.

Unfortunately, their impact is only becoming more pronounced, 
especially in the world of cancer care. More and more cancer 
medications are coming out in oral formulations, resulting in a shift 
away from the medical benefit and into the pharmacy benefit. And 
because cancer medications are among the most expensive out there, they 
are very attractive to PBMs because they yield higher rebates, higher 
``DIR fees,'' and other pricing gimmicks that yield substantial 
profits.

Through vertical integration and sheer market power, PBMs have also 
been able to creep into other areas of our health care system, such as 
injectable biosimilars and intravenous chemotherapies. Not only can 
PBMs leverage these products for steep originator drug rebates (thereby 
stifling the biosimilar industry for their own gain), but PBMs have 
also begun to institute policies such as mandatory ``white bagging'' to 
take the in-office administration out of the hands of patients' 
oncologists.

The purpose of this expose is to reveal and explain PBMs' advantage and 
leverage by providing transparency where now there is total darkness, 
and by delving into the many ways that PBMs have abused their power. 
This report comprehensively explores and documents the myriad of PBM 
abuses, and their impact on patient care--focusing especially on cancer 
care. It explores how the recent levels of consolidation among PBMs and 
health insurers is adversely impacting cancer care, fueling drug costs, 
all while allowing for massive profits for PBMs and health insurance 
companies. Examining the most pervasive and abusive PBM tactics, each 
section highlights the adverse impact of PBMs on patients, health care 
payers (including Medicare, Medicaid, employers, and taxpayers), and 
providers, while also detailing potential solutions.

Each day that goes by, physicians, practices, and most importantly, 
patients become increasingly powerless because of horizonal PBM 
consolidation and vertical integration with insurers. The result is a 
system designed for patients to receive inferior treatment, while 
paying more out-of-pocket for their medications.

The time for sitting back and hoping for PBMs to become good faith 
actors is over. It is time for action to stop PBM abuses once and for 
all, and this expose provides a road map for tackling them one dirty 
PBM trick at a time.

2 Introduction

In the eyes of many Americans, the problem with drug pricing is caused 
by unscrupulous pharmaceutical manufacturers who have increased drug 
prices over the last two decades with reckless abandon. This has been 
exemplified by a handful of highly visible bad actors, such as 
``pharma-bro'' Martin Shkreli or Nostrum Pharmaceuticals founder Nirmal 
Muyle, who rightfully captured the public's attention, but wrongfully 
over-simplified the causes of our nation's drug pricing issues.

Far more dangerous and insidious actors have quietly grown to dominate 
the nation's pharmaceutical industry and drive high drug prices through 
the secretive pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) industry. Ironically, in 
the country's attempt to rein in ruthless operators like Shkreli and 
Muyle, we ended up inadvertently creating the PBM problem that now 
plagues us. Expanding the role of PBMs, first from simple processors of 
pharmacy claims to middlemen more actively managing the prescription 
benefit initially made some sense. Clients--employers, unions, state 
governments, and other payers of medical care--did not have the 
expertise to manage complex drug benefits. Thus, they could hire a PBM 
to administer their prescription benefit, which would include 
simplifying and streamlining a complicated drug supply chain, designing 
formularies to exclude wasteful drugs, using their size and leverage to 
negotiate better discounts from pharmaceutical manufacturers, and 
managing pharmacy networks to create better outcomes for patients.

However, as this expose on PBM business tactics, dirty tricks, and 
their negative impacts will detail, what seemed like a good idea ``on 
paper'' has not come to fruition. Instead, the nation's largest PBMs 
have capitalized on the complexity of the drug supply chain and used 
the secrecy in which they operate to hide the true cost of drugs. And 
rather than eliminate the costly arbitrage within the supply chain, 
PBMs co-opted and embraced it, exacerbating the very problems of high 
drug prices that they were originally hired to control. They saw the 
financial windfall that would come through vertical integration and 
bought or set up their own mail-order and specialty pharmacies, 
steering patients away from independent community pharmacies and 
medical practices to their wholly-owned or affiliated pharmacy 
facilities where they could retain the inflated prices (and profits) 
they themselves were responsible for creating.

The perverse result is that PBMs have abandoned their most sacrosanct 
function of protecting their clients from high cost or low benefit 
drugs, instead letting higher priced drugs ``buy'' their way onto their 
clients' formularies via rebates that the PBMs mostly retain. They then 
set up affiliated rebate aggregator entities to further obfuscate the 
flow of pharmaceutical manufacturer dollars, retaining a larger portion 
of their clients' rebates, and leaving patients on high deductible 
plans exposed to drugs with exploitative list prices. The result is 
that patients pay more for their drugs off of artificially inflated 
list prices and the PBM clients have higher prescription drug costs.

The PBM's purpose in the drug supply chain was to ``police'' the 
system. Had the largest PBMs not been lured in by the immense profit 
potential borne out of the complete opacity of drug costs, a PBM's 
greatest asset would have been trust--trust from payers and providers 
that they were tirelessly working to protect the American public from 
high drug prices. However, this unfortunately did not come to pass. 
Instead, the PBM's greatest advantage has become the almost total 
opacity of the U.S. drug supply chain and a lack of understanding among 
employers, unions, state governments, and American taxpayers of how 
most PBMs have chosen to abuse it.

The purpose of this expose is to reveal and explain the PBM advantage 
by providing transparency where now there is total darkness and delving 
into the many ways that PBMs have abused their power to become 
``crooked cops.'' Throughout this expose, we comprehensively explore 
and document the myriad of PBM abuses, and their impact on patient 
care--focusing especially on cancer care. Finally, we explore how the 
recent levels of consolidation among PBMs and health insurers is 
adversely impacting cancer care, fueling drug costs, while allowing for 
massive profits for PBM and health insurance companies. We have 
thoroughly examined and detailed the most pervasive and abusive PBM 
tactics, in each section highlighting their adverse impact on patients, 
health care payers (including Medicare, Medicaid, employers and 
taxpayers), and providers.

With the ultimate goal of this expose being transparency, Frier Levitt 
went beyond the law, partnering with 3Axis Advisors LLC to create 
infographics derived from their analysis of millions of prescription 
claims across multiples states. The goal of these infographics is to 
help crystallize and simplify the very complex topics we will discuss 
throughout this expose. Lastly, because PBMs have been known to hold 
themselves out as being ``above the law,''\1\ we have provided the 
applicable law and legal principles governing each topic, and detailed 
the PBMs' thin legal footing as it comes to these abusive practices. 
Finally, we have laid out potential, workable solutions to these 
issues, which may be legislative, regulatory, or legal in nature.

We intend for this report to serve as an authoritative source and 
reference guide for federal and state policymakers, regulators, and 
employers seeking greater understanding of PBM behavior, as well as 
frameworks for reshaping the industry for the better. While not all 
PBMs engage in these types of practices, or the degree with which they 
engage in these practices may vary from plan to plan, program to 
program, state to state, and so on, we believe that a thorough exposure 
of the blind spots, latitude for abuse, and backwards incentives is 
essential for any coherent understanding of the inherent flaws within 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
the drug supply chain.

3 Background

            3.1 The Stakeholders
Any examination of the PBM industry must necessarily begin with an 
overview of the relevant stakeholders. These include five major 
categories of industry participants: (1) plan sponsors, (2) health 
insurers, (3) patients, (4) manufacturers, (5) providers, and (6) PBMs. 
Understanding who the major stakeholders are, and their relationship 
with one another, is paramount.

At the top of the hierarchy are plan sponsors. These include 
governmental health benefits programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid and 
TRICARE), employer-sponsored health plans, Taft-Hartley and union 
welfare plans, and private health insurance companies. These entities 
sponsor a health benefits plan for their members, beneficiaries or 
employees, and provide coverage for pharmacy expenses and drug costs 
(in addition to traditional medical expenses). In the Medicare Part D 
context, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) contracts 
with private insurance companies that submit bids to become Part D plan 
sponsors, and CMS in turn subsidizes certain costs associated with the 
operation of the plans.\2\ Likewise, in the Medicaid space, the 
majority of states operate a managed care model with respect to 
pharmacy benefits, contracting with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations 
(MCOs), who in turn, contract with PBMs to administer the pharmacy 
benefit.\3\ Finally, in the private sector, employers either directly 
or through an insurance company contract with PBMs to administer 
pharmacy benefits. These employer-sponsored plans may either be fully-
insured (meaning the employer hires an insurance company and pays all 
or part of the premiums on behalf of its employees) or self-insured 
(meaning the employer bears all of the financial risk with the costs of 
care).\4\ In any case, these plan sponsors bear the ultimate costs of 
care, and suffer when PBM abuses cause prices to rise or waste to 
occur. Plan sponsors may or may not hire a health insurance company to 
help offset the risks associated with the cost of care, and pay 
premiums on behalf of their beneficiaries. These health insurance 
companies may in turn be the entity that directly contracts with the 
PBM for pharmacy care. However, as noted below, the lines have become 
increasingly blurred between health insurers and PBMs; thus, the key 
distinction between plan sponsors and health insurers is that the plan 
sponsors are typically the ultimate financial guarantors of the costs 
of the health care for their beneficiaries, including not only drug 
costs but also major medical expenses.

0909wellsc.aspx.

At the other end of the continuum are the patients. Patients include 
beneficiaries of government sponsored health care programs, as well as 
the employees (and dependents) of employers sponsoring health plans. 
They are also uninsured or underinsured individuals who are left to 
find a way to cover drug costs themselves. In oncology, they are cancer 
patients needing care from a complex and disjointed health care system. 
As a group, they not only bear a disproportionate share of the out-of-
pocket costs associated with PBM abuses, but also suffer from the 
inferior care caused by certain PBMs' tactics of putting profits over 
patients. These include delays and denials as a result of PBMs' 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
unnecessary obstacles to care.

On the front line of care are the providers. These include retail, 
specialty and mail-order pharmacies, and in oncology, community 
oncology practices. In addition to providing direct medical care, 
community oncology practices provide in-office and outpatient pharmacy 
services, which can take two basic forms (depending on applicable state 
law): dispensing physician practices (i.e., in-office dispensing under 
a plenary medical license), or oncologist-owned pharmacies (i.e., the 
oncology practice owns and operates a licensed retail pharmacy within 
the clinic).\5\ These providers contract with PBMs to dispense 
medication to plan members, and participate in PBM networks. In so 
doing, they are tasked with providing appropriate care to their 
patients, while remaining bound to the PBMs who set reimbursement rates 
and other terms for participation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ See, Mark Munger et al., Emerging Paradigms: Physician 
Dispensing, Presentation to the National Association of Boards of 
Pharmacy (May 20, 2014), available at https://www.nabp.net/system/rich/
rich_files/rich_files/000/000/338/original/munger-202.pdf.

While not directly involved in the provision of care, manufacturers are 
equally part of the continuum and impacted by PBM actions. These 
include drug and biologic manufacturers, including both brand and 
generic companies. Manufacturers have had a particular important role 
in the biosimilar market, becoming captive to PBMs' rebate traps, and 
stifling the biosimilar market before it even has a chance to take 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
hold.

The final piece of the puzzle is the PBM. PBMs are third-party 
administrators of prescription drug programs covered by a plan sponsor. 
The PBM is primarily responsible for processing and paying prescription 
drug claims submitted by participating providers on behalf of covered 
beneficiaries. However, a PBM's role is not limited to processing and 
paying prescription drug claims. Rather, PBMs also provide bundled 
services related to the administration of pharmaceutical benefits, 
including formulary design, formulary management, negotiation of 
branded drug rebates, and controlling network access of participating 
pharmacies. Perhaps most importantly, PBMs often also own and operate 
their affiliated retail, mail-order and/or specialty pharmacies, and in 
so doing, directly compete with independent providers participating in 
PBM networks. They are not just the gatekeepers, but also competitors 
operating in the same marketplace. This blatant conflict of interest 
has serious consequences. Finally, as the result of consolidation and 
vertical integration within the marketplace, virtually all of the major 
PBMs have merged with, acquired or become acquired by health insurers, 
greatly blurring the lines between insurer and PBM. As a result, health 
insurers and PBMs are often referred to jointly as ``payers.''

            3.2 Consolidation of PBMs and Health Insurers, and the 
                    Resulting Influence on Recent PBM Actions
PBMs traditionally have played a critical role in the administration of 
prescription drug programs. However, over the past ten years, the PBM 
marketplace has transformed considerably. Changes include both 
horizontal and vertical integration among health insurance companies, 
PBMs, chain pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, and long-term care 
pharmacies. As a result, a smaller number of large companies now wield 
nearly limitless power and influence over the prescription drug market.

Within the PBM marketplace, over 80% of the covered lives in the United 
States are controlled by only five PBMs.\6\ As a result of this 
concentration, a pharmacy's access to these five PBM networks is 
critical. Being out of network with just one PBM (which in some 
regions, could make up more than 85% of the market), and being unable 
to obtain reimbursement for claims dispensed to those patients, could 
make it financially unviable for any community oncology practice to 
provide dispensing services at all. The lack of competition in the 
marketplace stems, in large part, from a series of mergers, 
integrations, and consolidations. These consolidations and integrations 
are undoubtedly a factor in many abusive PBM practices, ranging from 
seeking to exclude independent providers, to reimbursement rates that 
force providers to lose money by filling prescriptions, to outright 
diversion of patients to the PBMs' wholly-owned or affiliated 
pharmacies. The consolidation increases the market power of the top 
PBMs, which makes this possible.

pbm-drugs-20170611-story.html.

The breadth of PBM power did not arise overnight. It began with a 
series of vertical consolidations in which some PBMs acquired 
pharmacies and other PBMs acquired insurance companies. In 2007, the 
shareholders of Caremark Rx, one of the nation's largest PBMs at the 
time, approved a $26.5 billion takeover of CVS Pharmacy, which 
effectively created the first vertically integrated retail pharmacy and 
PBM.\7\ Vertical integration of the industry continued in 2011, as Blue 
Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, one of Medco's largest customers, 
began shifting its PBM business away from Medco to Prime 
Therapeutics,\8\ a PBM that is wholly owned by a group of thirteen Blue 
Cross plans across the country. In 2012, UnitedHealthcare (United), the 
nation's largest insurance company, began migrating the administration 
of its plans from Medco Health Solutions to OptumRx, United's wholly-
owned PBM.\9\

Consolidation of the PBM and payer space has not been limited to 
vertical integration. In 2011, two of the nation's then-largest PBMs--
Medco Health Solutions, Inc. and Express Scripts, Inc.--announced a $29 
billion merger. After a contentious regulatory approval process, the 
Federal Trade Commission ultimately approved the merger in 2012.\10\

of-express-scripts-and-medco.html.

Thereafter, the industry continued consolidation both horizontally and 
vertically. In 2013, a regional PBM--SXC Corporation--agreed to buy 
another regional PBM--Catalyst, Inc.--for $4.4 billion to form a 
national PBM, known as Catamaran Corp.\11\ In July 2015, Catamaran was 
acquired by United, OptumRx's parent company, for $12.8 billion. The 
two PBMs are now integrating operations and operate under one name, 
OptumRx. In 2015, Rite Aid acquired the PBM EnvisionRx for 
approximately $2 billion.\12\ Later that year, Walgreens announced its 
intention to acquire Rite Aid and EnvisionRx for $9.4 billion.\13\ Also 
in 2015, Aetna, the nation's third largest insurer, announced its 
intention to acquire Humana, the nation's fourth largest insurer, as 
well as Humana's wholly-owned PBM, Humana Pharmacy Solutions, for $37 
billion.\14\ Finally, in 2015, Anthem announced its agreement to buy 
Cigna (including its PBM arm) for $48 billion, which would result in, 
yet again, fewer players in the space.\15\ However, on July 21, 2016, 
the Justice Department filed lawsuits to block both the Aetna-Humana 
and Anthem-Cigna mergers, asserting that the mergers would quash 
competition, leading to higher prices and reduced benefits.\16\

Unfortunately, the last five years has only seen this trend of 
consolidation and integration expand at an exponential rate. In 
November 2018, CVS Health completed a controversial $69 billion 
acquisition of Aetna, a managed health care company that specializes in 
selling traditional and consumer-directed health insurance along with 
related services including dental, vision, and disability plans. Not to 
be outdone, in December 2018, health insurer Cigna acquired Express 
Scripts for $54 billion.\17\ Since that time, Cigna and Express Scripts 
have continued to expand in creative ways. In December 2019. Express 
Scripts and Prime Therapeutics announced a three-year collaboration 
agreement, whereby Express Scripts would take over the contracting and 
administration of the pharmacy benefits for Prime Therapeutics' 
members.\18\ As a result of the arrangement, Express Scripts will now 
manage the prescription benefits for more than 100 million 
Americans.\19\

This rapid evolution of the PBM and health insurance industry shows 
how a limited number of corporations wield an outsized level of control 
and influence in the prescription drug coverage marketplace. Fewer 
payers spells harm to patients, especially cancer patients. These 
integrated companies have greater abilities to control the nature and 
direction of patients' care, including what type of care/drugs they 
receive, from whom they receive it, and in what setting they are 
treated. The level of PBM intrusion into the care received by patients 
borders on the practice of medicine by these PBMs and health insurance 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
conglomerates.

Fewer payers also results in harm to plan sponsors, especially 
employers sponsoring health plans, who have fewer choices based on 
decreased competition. This hits small employers the hardest, who lack 
the overall leverage and resources to either demand competitive rebates 
or restructure entrenched PBM practices.

Fewer payers also exponentially increases the importance of network 
access for providers. Exclusion from one PBM with a market share of 35% 
means that the provider loses out on a major portion of the patient 
population.

[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


As can be seen in the figure above,\20\ consolidation has created 
merged entities that have oppressive power. This creates a virtual 
chokehold note only on community oncology practices and pharmacy 
providers, but on plan sponsors and patients alike. It is through this 
market dominance that PBMs are able to get away with their abuses. 
Whether it is outsized rebates and DIR fees fueling drug prices. 
Whether it is unreasonable barriers to entry, network exclusions or 
mandatory white bagging forcing patients to receive inferior service at 
higher costs. Whether it is employing insidious copay accumulator 
programs or deceptive pricing and reimbursement techniques. Or worse 
yet, whether it is essentially practicing medicine, through ``fail 
first'' step therapy, prior authorization requirements, or formulary 
exclusions, many of which favor not the least expensive medication, but 
the most profitable one for the PBM. Each of these tactics are made 
possible by the PBMs' sheer levels of dominance at all levels of the 
health care continuum. This consolidation has hurt medical care, while 
fueling both drug prices and costs to patients and plan sponsors alike.

4  Manufacturer Rebates, Rebate Aggregators, and the ``Gross-to-Net 
                    Bubble''

It is axiomatic to say that the PBM market is highly concentrated, with 
three companies (i.e., CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx) 
covering nearly 80 percent of the market, or 180 million American 
lives. As a result, pharmaceutical and biosimilar manufacturers face 
exceedingly high stakes when negotiating for formulary placement.\23\ 
Among the different sources of revenue, the most prolific by far is in 
the form of rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers that PBMs extract 
in exchange for placing the manufacturer's product drug on a plan 
sponsor's formulary or encouraging utilization of the manufacturer's 
drugs.\24\ Rebates are mostly used for high-cost brand-name 
prescription drugs where there are interchangeable products and aim to 
incentivize PBMs to include pharmaceutical manufacturers' drugs on plan 
sponsors' formularies and to obtain preferred tier placement.\25\

While drug prices are too high, ironically, the growing number and 
scale of rebates is the primary fuel of today's high drug prices. The 
truth is that PBMs have a vested interest to have drug prices remain 
high, and to extract rebates off of these higher prices. PBM 
formularies tend to favor drugs that offer higher rebates over similar 
drugs with lower net costs and lower rebates.\26\

Apart from increasing costs today, these destructive practices will 
have a long-
lasting impact on the future of health care and drug innovation. 
Traditionally, generic drugs offer significant price relief for brand 
medications; however, there are an ever-growing subset of medications 
that are unlikely to ever have a traditional generic alternative. As a 
result, federal policy was enacted to create eventual competition for 
these brand products such as the biosimilar pathway. However, the PBMs' 
practice of maximizing rebates may effectively neuter the nation's 
biosimilar market before it even gets off the ground. Unlike 
traditional drug products, biologics are unique and complex molecules, 
and represent many of the new breakthrough treatments that have come to 
market over the past ten years. But with such breakthrough comes 
extremely high cost. As a result, biosimilars--that is, products that 
are ``highly similar'' to the reference biologic \27\--have emerged to 
provide alternatives and competition in the biologics space. The first 
biosimilar product in the United States was approved in March 2015 and 
marketed in September 2015.\28\ The greater use of biosimilars has the 
potential to reduce the overall drug spending, while providing greater 
clinical options for providers and patients.\29\ However, PBMs and 
biologics manufacturers have erected ``rebate walls'' that have 
severely depressed biosimilar development and widespread adoption.\30\ 
According to former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, Americans 
could have saved more than $4.5 billion in one year alone, if they had 
bought FDA-approved biosimilars.\31\ While the FDA had approved 11 
biosimilars through 2018, only three were then being marketed in the 
U.S.\32\ As of January 2022, nearly 32 biosimilars have been approved, 
while only 29 are currently being marketed.\33\ PBM rebates represent a 
clear and existential threat to the future of the biosimilar 
marketplace.\34\

As the American public and plan sponsors have become more aware of the 
nature and extent of rebates, they have begun demanding that all or 
nearly all rebates negotiated on their behalf be fully reported and 
passed-through. As a result, PBMs have begun to market themselves as 
transparent and assert that many of their customers are able to 
negotiate ``pass-through pricing'' allowing pharmaceutical manufacturer 
rebates and other concessions to flow directly to plan sponsors.\35\ 
However, a dangerous new trend has grown exponentially over the last 
few years through which PBMs seek to ``circumvent'' these pass-through 
requirements. PBMs have increasingly ``delegated'' the collection of 
manufacturer rebates to ``rebate aggregators,'' which are often owned 
by or affiliated with the PBMs, without seeking authorization from plan 
sponsors and without telling plan sponsors.\36\ Sometimes referred to 
as rebate GPOs, these mysterious entities include Ascent Health 
Services, a Switzerland-based GPO that Express Scripts launched in 
2019, Zinc, a contracting entity launched by CVS Health in the summer 
of 2020, and Emisar Pharma Services, an Ireland-based entity recently 
rolled out by OptumRx.\37\ Even some of the major PBMs (i.e., the ``Big 
Three'' PBMs) sometimes find themselves contracting with other PBMs' 
rebate aggregators for the collection of manufacturer rebates (for 
example, in the case of OptumRx contracting with Express Scripts for 
purposes of rebate aggregation for public employee plans).\38\

Within Medicare Part D, Part D Sponsors are required to submit direct 
and indirect remuneration (DIR) reports to CMS disclosing the total 
amount of rebates, inclusive of manufacturer rebates, retained by PBMs 
regardless of whether such rebates were passed to Medicare Part D plan 
sponsors.\41\ And while PBMs and rebate aggregators are obligated to 
provide, among other things, the aggregate amount and type of rebates, 
discounts, or price concessions to the plan sponsors (who in turn 
provide the same to CMS),\42\ PBMs and rebate aggregators do not have 
to provide claims-level information on the actual amounts received on 
behalf of plan sponsors.

            4.1 Who Is Impacted?
The deleterious effects of rebates, and the furtive work of rebate 
aggregators, are felt across the health care spectrum.
                4.1.1  Harm to Patients
Whether a patient has insurance or not, rebates serve to increase the 
overall costs of drugs and out-of-pocket expenditures for patients.\43\ 
With one in four people in the United States having difficulty paying 
the cost of their prescription medications,\44\ the extent of the 
negative impact of rebates is felt far and wide.

For uninsured patients, the rebates negotiated by a PBM or health 
insurance company do nothing to lower their out-of-pocket costs. 
Rebates promote high drug list prices. ``Higher drug prices hurt 
uninsured patients who pay list prices . . . based on drugs' list 
prices.''\45\ And because these rebates are received and kept among 
secretive health care conglomerates, and not shared with providers or 
other groups, even discount programs like GoodRx do little to help 
uninsured patients receive savings on the most expensive drugs.

Even for patients with insurance, rebates ultimately increase costs to 
the patient for the benefit of PBMs and health insurers. At the point 
of sale, the inflated list prices caused by rebates ``hurt . . . 
insured patients who pay coinsurance and deductibles based on drugs' 
list prices.''\46\ Over the past several years, the number of patients 
on high-deductible health plans has skyrocketed.\47\ This has turned 
the insurance market upside down, causing the relatively small number 
of sick patients who pay high copays off of inflated list prices to 
subsize the cost of care for healthy people. In this form of ``reverse 
insurance,'' the sickest patients (e.g., those taking expensive cancer 
medications) generate a large share of manufacturer rebate payments, 
which in turn are used to ``subsidize the premiums for healthier 
[patients].''\48\ This is the opposite of how insurance is supposed to 
work.

What's worse, PBMs' preference of highly-rebated drugs not only 
increases patients' out-of-pocket expenses, but also creates 
unnecessary burdens in receiving appropriate care, even to the point of 
fatality.\49\ PBMs have an incentive to favor high-priced drugs over 
drugs that are more cost-effective, because rebates are often 
calculated as a percentage of the manufacturer's list price. PBMs 
receive a larger rebate for expensive drugs than they do for ones that 
may provide better value at lower cost. This can also occur ``when a 
brand drug goes generic under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, with the 
first generic version being granted six months of market exclusivity,'' 
and ``[i]n exchange for substantial rebates, manufacturers [are given] 
an exclusive extension of their brand drug, which circumvents Hatch-
Waxman and blocks generic competition.''\50\ PBMs' financial 
motivations often result in more expensive and less efficacious drugs 
being placed on the drug formulary, which in turn hurts patient 
care.\51\

Again, PBMs are able to do this because of the sheer levels of market 
consolidation and integration, which is adversely impacting cancer care 
and fueling drug costs all in the interests of PBM profits.
                4.1.2  Harm to Plan Sponsors
While rebates are intended to lower the ``net price'' of drugs, thereby 
reducing costs to plan sponsors (including employers), there are 
several important ways that PBM rebates increase the costs of drugs for 
both plan sponsors and patients.

The first way relates to the ability of plan sponsors, especially self-
funded employers, to ensure the full amount of rebates are reported and 
passed through to them by PBMs. As noted above, it is extremely 
difficult to gauge the true amount of drug manufacturer rebates 
collected by PBMs, and this is only made more difficult by the advent 
of rebate aggregators.\52\ Unlike in the Medicare Part D program, PBMs 
typically do not legally owe self-funded employers any reporting on 
rebates. PBMs employ exceedingly vague and ambiguous contractual terms 
to recast monies received from manufacturers outside the traditional 
definition of rebates, which in most cases must be shared with plan 
sponsors. Rebate administration fees, bona fide service fees, and 
specialty pharmacy discounts/fees are all forms of money received by 
PBMs and rebate aggregators which may not be shared with (or even 
disclosed to) the plan sponsor.\53\ These charges serve to increase the 
overall costs of drugs, while providing no benefit whatsoever to plan 
sponsors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \52\ See, supra, Office of Broward County Auditor, ``Audit of 
Pharmacy Benefit Management Services Agreement,'' 2017.
    \53\ See, National Prescription Coverage Coalition, ``It's Time to 
Determine How Much Your PBM Is Depriving Your Plan of Rebates: File An 
`Accounting' Procedure,'' available at: https://
nationalprescriptioncoveragecoalition.com/its-time-to-determine-how-
much-your-pbm-is-depriving-your-plan-of-rebates-file-an-accounting-
procedure/.

And while there might be greater reporting and disclosure obligations 
in the Medicare Part D and Medicaid programs,\54\ the growth of rebate 
aggregators has created a way for PBMs (or their corporate affiliates) 
to retain rebates and not share them with plan sponsors. This causes 
the Part D plan sponsor to become liable to CMS to ``true up'' any 
reductions in cost caused by these rebates, despite the fact that the 
Part D plan sponsor never actually received any rebates. Moreover, 
studies have shown that PBM rebates extracted from drug manufacturers 
drive up the drug spending of plan sponsors including Medicare and 
Medicaid.\55\ This is especially draining on already budget-strapped 
state governments. Since Medicare Part D is financed through general 
revenues, beneficiary premiums, and state payments for dual-eligible 
beneficiaries (who received drug coverage under Medicaid prior to 
2006), rebates also drive up the drug spending of the participating 
states and in turn, taxpayers' financial obligations to support 
Medicare Part D and Medicaid continues to rise.\56\ The total drug 
spend of a plan sponsor, regardless of whether it is a federal or state 
governmental program or a self-funded employer, will inevitably 
increase because PBMs are incentivized to favor expensive drugs that 
yield high rebates.\57\ In some instances, PBMs purposely misclassify 
generic drugs as brand drugs to charge higher prices to plan sponsors, 
which ultimately generate higher rebate revenue.\58\ Moreover, the 
gross-to-net bubble (i.e., the dollar difference between sales at 
brand-name drugs' list prices and their sales at net prices after 
rebates, discounts, and other reductions) has been growing at an 
exponential pace.\59\ The upward trend in the gross-to-net bubble 
reached $175 billion in 2019.\60\ Based on this trend and the fact that 
plan sponsors are not receiving full value of the rebates from PBMs, it 
is evident that rebates increase total drug spend of plan sponsors and 
only benefit PBMs.

The final and perhaps most long-term impact that rebates will have on 
plan sponsors is in the suppression of the biosimilar market. The 
greater use of less expensive biosimilars (essentially ``generic'' 
versions of biologic medications) has the potential to reduce overall 
drug spending. However, many health plans do not include biosimilars in 
their preferred tiers.\61\ This is because of the ``rebate trap,'' 
where PBMs prefer the higher cost, branded biologics that offer 
rebates, over cheaper biosimilar alternatives.\62\ The result is that 
when biosimilars do make their way to the market, many patients do not 
have access to them because their PBM does not cover it.\63\ These 
policies stifle advancements, and will, in the long term, keep plan 
sponsors beholden to higher cost, branded medications.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                4.1.3  Harm to Providers
Finally, rebates also impact providers in several ways. First, PBMs 
preference of highly rebated drugs limits providers' choice of optimal 
drug therapy for patients.\64\ Once again, this results in the PBM 
inserting itself in between the prescribers and their patients and 
violates the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship. This is 
especially true with biosimilars. The greater use of biosimilars has 
the potential to reduce overall drug spending and provide greater 
clinical options for providers, including community oncology practices. 
However, due to rebates, many PBMs do not include biosimilars in their 
preferred tier, thereby prevent wide-spread adoption and cost 
savings.\65\

In instances where biosimilars are included on formularies, this is 
done so inconsistently and on a patchwork basis, tied solely to the 
rebates that the PBM can extract from the drug manufacturer, and not 
the efficacy of the product. The result is that community oncology 
practices often are required to stock several different versions of 
very expensive biosimilars based on the rules of the patient's PBM, 
rather than being able to prescribe and dispense the product that is 
best suited for their patients.\66\

Rebates further intrude on the doctor-patient relationship when 
combined with step therapy, prior authorization, or other utilization 
management protocols. ``Fail first'' step therapy requires a patient to 
first fail once or twice on a medication specified by the PBM or health 
insurer before being allowed to ``step up'' to the therapy prescribed 
by the physician.\67\ In many cases, the medication dictated by the PBM 
or health insurer is not the least expensive medication, but rather, is 
the most profitable drug to the PBM due to rebates. The impact of step 
therapy, driven by rebating, is that it ``takes the medical decision-
making out of the hands of doctors'' and puts it into the hands of the 
actuaries, accountants and businesspeople at the PBM, who are not 
choosing the drug that is most efficacious, or cheapest, or even most 
efficient--they are choosing the drug that is the most profitable.\68\

            4.2  What Does the Law Say?
Medicare Part D plan sponsors are required to submit DIR reports to CMS 
disclosing the total amount of rebates, inclusive of manufacturer 
rebates and pharmacy rebates, retained by PBMs regardless of whether 
such rebates were passed to Medicare Part D plan sponsors.\69\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \69\ See, Social Security Act Sec. 1860D-15, 42 U.S.C. [1395w-115].

In the commercial market, many states have enacted laws that require 
transparency from PBMs and ``pass through'' pricing. For example, 
Delaware House Bill 194 enacted into law on July 17, 2019, permits the 
Insurance Commissioner to examine the affairs of PBMs, among other 
things.\70\ Likewise, under New York Senate Bill S1507A enacted into 
State Budget for the 2019-2020 Fiscal Year on April 12, 2019, PBMs are 
required to fully disclose to the Department of Health and plan 
sponsors the sources and amounts of all income, payments, and financial 
benefits.\71\ Similarly, Utah House Bill 272, which was enacted into 
law on March 30, 2020, requires PBMs to report all rebates and 
administrative fees to the Insurance Department including the 
``percentage of aggregate rebates'' that PBMs retained under its 
agreement to provide pharmacy benefits management services to plan 
sponsors.\72\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \70\ See, Delaware General Assembly House Bill 193, An Act to Amend 
Title 18 of the Delaware Code Relating to Pharmacy Benefit Managers,

https://www.cqstatetrack.com/texis/redir?id=5e3cc83dc51.

However, Maine Bill 1504, enacted into law on June 24, 2019, takes 
these reporting requirements a step further, and provides that ``[a]ll 
compensation remitted by or on behalf of a pharmaceutical manufacturer, 
developer or labeler, directly or indirectly, to a carrier, or to a 
pharmacy benefits manager under contract with a carrier, related to its 
prescription drug benefits must be: A. Remitted directly to the covered 
person at the point of sale to reduce the out-of-pocket cost to the 
covered person associated with a particular prescription drug; or B. 
Remitted to, and retained by, the carrier. Compensation remitted to the 
carrier must be applied by the carrier in its plan design and in future 
plan years to offset the premium for covered persons.''\73\

            4.3  What Can Be Done?
If high drug prices meaningfully addressed then outsized negative 
impact of rebates, rebate aggregators, and the resulting high gross-to-
net bubble must be addressed. Luckily there are several varied options 
available to the affected parties:

     Legislative

        <ctr-circle>  Policymakers should enact laws that mandate PBMs

It should be called out that some in Congress have the mistaken belief 
that drug manufacturers are the primary beneficiary of rebates in terms 
of ``buying'' formulary access for their drugs. Although this may be 
true in a limited number of cases, the reality is that PBMs use rebates 
to extract--some would say ``extort''--drug manufacturers to pay the 
rebate ``toll'' in order for PBMs to include these drugs on formulary 
or to avoid being part of a ``fail first'' step therapy scheme. 
Congress has been held hostage to PBMs and their corporate affiliated 
health insurers by threatening to increase plan premiums if rebates are 
eliminated or made illegal.

5  Pharmacy Direct and Indirect Remuneration Fees

As a result of a 2014 CMS rule change that went into effect in Plan 
Year 2016, PBMs have developed shrewd and calculated methods of 
financial engineering, maximizing their revenue at the expense of the 
patient, the Medicare Part D Program, and providers. This was 
accomplished through pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration fees, or 
``DIR fees.'' DIR fees are typically post point-of-sale fees ranging 
from 1.5% to 11% of a drug's list price assessed by PBMs upon network 
pharmacy providers, typically three to six months after the provider 
has dispensed the medication.

The concept of DIR fees arose out of Medicare Part D coverage for 
prescription drugs. Part D plan sponsors and Medicare Advantage plans 
offering drug coverage are paid by the government based on the actual 
cost for drug coverage. The actual cost is based on the Part D plan 
sponsor's ``negotiated price,'' which is then used as the basis to 
determine plan, beneficiary, manufacturer (in the coverage gap), and 
government costs during the course of the payment year, subject to 
final reconciliation following the end of the coverage year.

Unfortunately, very few pharmacy price concessions have been included 
in the negotiated price at the point of sale. All pharmacy and other 
price concessions that are not included in the negotiated price must be 
reported to CMS as pharmacy DIR.\77\ As employers and plan sponsors are 
demanding a greater share of the PBM rebates, and as those rebates have 
been threatened with regulation by state and federal lawmakers, PBMs 
have gone ``downstream'' to make up for any rebate revenue shortfalls 
by assessing DIR fees on pharmacy providers. In fact, DIR fees 
categorized as pharmacy price concessions have increased 45,000 percent 
between 2010 and 2017, and have hit a whopping $9.1 billion in 
2019.\78\

PBMs purport to pass a large portion of DIR fees to their plan 
sponsor clients, especially Part D plan sponsors--ironically, many of 
which are under the same corporation as the PBMs (e.g., CVS Caremark, 
one of the nation's largest PBM, and SilverScript, the nation's largest 
Medicare Part D plan sponsor, are both owned by CVS Health). However, 
no study has been conducted to match the deductions from pharmacy 
remittances for ``DIR'' with the DIR reported to CMS. Unfortunately, 
CMS cannot even perform such an audit today, as it does not require 
plans to submit DIR collected from each pharmacy, but rather requires 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIR to be reported by drug, on an NDC number basis.

Even if pharmacy DIR fees are reported accurately, Medicare risk 
corridors allow a Part D plan sponsor that spends less than its bid 
estimate of costs to keep all savings up to 5% and a portion of those 
savings thereafter, which, in practice, allows PBMs and Part D plan 
sponsors to retain the vast majority of DIR fees collected.\79\ Thus, 
PBMs and Part D plan sponsors financially benefit from DIR fees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \79\ Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefit, Congressional 
Research Services, Suzanne M. Kirchhoff, August 13, 2018, available at: 
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40611.pdf.

Worse yet, DIR fees on expensive specialty drugs are typically 
calculated as a percentage of a drug's list price. As such, DIR fees 
provide another incentive for PBMs to keep drug list prices high--high 
list prices yield not only larger rebates, but also larger DIR fees. As 
such, over the past several years DIR fees have become a larger 
percentage of the overall revenue that PBMs and Part D plan sponsors 
receive. Simply put, PBMs are making their money one way or another--
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rebates or DIR fees from pharmacy providers.

More problematic than the growth of DIR fees is the manner in which DIR 
fees are assessed on providers, especially community oncology 
practices. These fees are charged against community oncology practices 
based on their performance in a number of primary-care focused 
``quality metric'' categories, which are totally unrelated and 
irrelevant to the cancer patients these practices treat. As a result, 
these community oncology practices have no meaningful ability to 
influence their performance scores--with no ability for upside--and 
such fees amount to nothing more than extortion from practices. Given 
the market clout of the top PBMs in terms of the percentage of 
prescription drugs they manage, community oncology practices simply 
have to pay these DIR fees to stay in network, lest they lose the 
ability to provide dispensing services to their patients.

These DIR fees are assessed after the point-of-sale. While they are 
sometimes recouped as soon as PBMs reimburse providers (i.e., extracted 
from initial reimbursements), in most cases DIR fees are assessed 
months after patients receive their medications. The total amount of 
DIR fees assessed on providers may not be known by providers until more 
than a year after a drug has been dispensed, as some PBM contracts 
create the potential for a partial or total refund of DIR fees (though 
a total refund is practically unobtainable).

DIR fees increase patients' cost sharing responsibilities because 
patient out-of-
pocket costs are based on an artificially inflated list drug prices at 
the point-of-sale; thus, in the case of Medicare patients, prematurely 
pushing them into the Medicare Part D ``donut hole.'' The cost of DIR 
fees also shifts the burden of drug costs to the federal government as 
more patients are prematurely pushed into the catastrophic phase of the 
Medicare benefit, resulting in higher financial contribution by the 
Medicare program. Ultimately, DIR fees weakens the overall benefit of 
the Medicare insurance benefit intended to provide health care coverage 
for our nation's oldest and most vulnerable citizens.

Finally, DIR fees extracted from reimbursement to providers often 
results in drugs reimbursed below drug acquisition cost. Some speculate 
that this is yet another strategy by PBMs to ultimately drive pharmacy 
providers out of business so that the PBMs can take over the business 
with their retail, specialty, or mail-order pharmacies.

PBMs are able to effectively ``extort'' DIR fees due to their size and 
hegemony. As of 2018, three companies--UnitedHealth, Humana and CVS 
Health--covered over half of all Medicare Part D patients.\80\ Pharmacy 
providers do not have a meaningful choice but to accept the terms being 
provided to them--rejecting just one Part D plan could mean losing out 
on being able to service nearly a quarter of their Medicare Part D 
patients. PBMs know the power they hold and use it to its fullest 
extent.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            5.1  Who Is Impacted?
The expansion of DIR fees has had a substantial negative impact on both 
Medicare beneficiaries and the program as a whole. As confirmed in 
recent CMS studies, DIR fees ultimately shift financial liability from 
the Part D plan sponsor to the patient, then ultimately to the federal 
government, through Medicare's catastrophic coverage phase. The 
shifting of financial liability away from the Part D plan sponsor and 
to Medicare and the patient is even more pronounced with specialty 
medications, such as oral cancer medications.
                5.1.1  Harm to Patients
The primary harm to patients from DIR fees is that patients' out-of-
pocket costs are higher because they are based on list drug prices. 
Once again, PBMs have a vested financial interest to have drug list 
prices as high as possible as DIR fees are assessed as a percentage of 
the list prices for expensive specialty drugs. Medicare Part D patients 
find themselves paying more for their medications because they pay 
increased copayments and coinsurance on inflated point-of-sale list 
prices, which do not reflect the after-the-fact price adjustment in DIR 
fees that the PBM is clawing back from the pharmacy provider.

The use of DIR fees by PBMs has degraded the quality of the Medicare 
Part D benefit available for beneficiaries, all the while providing an 
additional lucrative revenue source for PBMs and affiliated Part D plan 
sponsors.\81\ It has shifted the benefit of the Medicare Part D program 
from those who rely on it for drugs, to those that do not use it, in 
the form of lower (or zero dollar) premiums. Meanwhile, DIR has put 
upward pressure on drug expenditures for those that use the benefit. 
Studies conducted by CMS have concluded that DIR fees increase out-of-
pocket costs for Medicare patients at the point of sale.\82\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \81\ See, e.g. https://www.communityoncology.org/wp-content/

newsroom/press-releases/cms-takes-action-lower-out-pocket-medicare-
part-d-prescription-drug-costs.

Consider for example, that Medicare Part D beneficiaries' cost sharing 
is based on the PBM-determined rate at the point-of-sale. DIR fees are 
by definition not assessed at the point of sale. Thus, the patient's 
copayment or coinsurance that is based on the price at the point-of-
sale is artificially inflated. CMS similarly concluded that DIR fees 
cost patients money, noting ``[w]hen pharmacy price concessions and 
other price concessions are not reflected in the negotiated price at 
the point of sale (that is, are applied instead as [Direct and Indirect 
Remuneration] at the end of the coverage year), beneficiary cost-
sharing increases.''\83\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \83\ 83 Fed. Reg. 62152, 62176 (November 30, 2018).

Likewise, up until the end of the 2020 plan year when the ``donut 
hole'' existed in the Medicare Part D Program, DIR fee programs pushed 
patients through the coverage stages much faster. Within the donut 
hole, patients pay 25% of the drug cost based on the (inflated) list 
price at the point-of-sale. The concern that patients continue to foot 
the bill for increased costs is not hidden from scrutiny as a group of 
21 U.S. Senators urged HHS to address DIR fees because ``beneficiaries 
face high-cost sharing for drugs and are accelerated into the coverage 
gap (or ``donut hole'') phase of their benefit.''\84\

18%20DIR%20Azar%20Letter.pdf.

In addition, despite PBMs' purported justifications for such programs, 
DIR fees have not benefitted the quality of Part D plans offered to 
Medicare beneficiaries. For example, SilverScript had a 4.0 Star Rating 
from Medicare in 2018 \85\ (based on 2017 data), but saw its score drop 
to a 3.5 Star Rating in 2019 \86\ despite the widespread usage of DIR 
fees. At the same time, as the impact of DIR fees has increased 
dramatically since 2016, patients have also been impacted by diminished 
access to care as providers facing decreased net reimbursement are 
forced out of business, forcing patients to receive services from 
pharmacies owned by or affiliated with the very PBMs and Part D plan 
sponsors extracting DIR fees (see, Section 6, infra).\87\

integrating with healthcare providers.'')

                5.1.2  Harm to Plan Sponsors
Just as DIR fees negatively impact patients, PBM-Imposed DIR fees shift 
costs away from Part D plan sponsors, while increasing the costs to the 
Medicare program (and in turn, the taxpayer) for catastrophic coverage 
and subsidy payments.\88\ As mentioned, when a Medicare beneficiary is 
pushed through the benefits tiers and reaches the ``catastrophic 
coverage'' stage, the cost of services shifts to 80% paid by Medicare, 
while only 15% paid by the plan sponsors.\89\ The government covers 
these costs in part by turning to the reinsurance marketplace. From 
2007 through 2018, a period similar to when CMS saw DIR fees from 
pharmacy price concessions increase by more than 45,000 percent, 
reinsurance costs of Medicare soared by 411%.\90\ Part D plan sponsors 
and their PBMs have a financial incentive to move Medicare 
beneficiaries into the catastrophic phase of coverage, to the detriment 
of the taxpayer.

In fact, the National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA) 
commissioned a report by Wakely Consulting Group, LLC to estimate the 
cost savings that would occur if congress prohibited retroactive 
reductions in payments by Part D plan sponsors in the form of DIR fees.

a nine-year period if these fees were prohibited.\91\

Unfortunately, the harm from DIR fees goes beyond the Medicare program 
and American taxpayers. Like rebates, DIR fees have the effect of 
driving up the cost of drugs, through higher list prices. From 2013 to 
2019, DIR fees rose from $229 million to an estimated $9.1 billion.\92\ 
Most striking, however, is that DIR fees now account for more than 18% 
of all Medicare rebates received by Part D plans.\93\ This increased 
reliance on DIR fees relative to drug rebates, both of which are tied 
to the list price of drugs, highlights the upward pressure DIR fees 
have placed on list prices for drugs. During this same period, drug 
list prices grew between 10-15% per year.\94\ Meanwhile, net prices 
have been relatively flat throughout this time period.\95\ These 
inflated list prices are felt by all plan sponsors--especially 
employers and state Medicaid programs--who do not receive any of the 
supposed benefits of DIR fees (such as lowered premiums).

PBMs have used their consolidation in the marketplace to use DIR fees 
and rebates in concert, fueling higher drug prices, while adversely 
impacting cancer care.
                5.1.3  Harm to Providers
To say that DIR fees have had an adverse impact on providers is an 
understatement. DIR fees decrease pricing transparency creating 
uncertainty as to the true real reimbursement rates for drugs, very 
often driving reimbursement rates below the providers' acquisition cost 
of drugs (see, section 8, infra).

The metrics utilized by PBMs in implementing DIR fee programs are 
typically completely inapplicable to community oncology practices. 
Specifically, community oncology practices dispense primarily (and 
almost exclusively) specialty medications for cancer patients. As such, 
they have virtually no ability to influence their performance based on 
PBMs' ``quality metric'' categories measuring patient drug adherence 
relating to cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes medications, which 
are relevant to dispensing general medications, not specialty 
drugs.\96\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \96\ It is important to note that neither these metrics, nor the 
methodology in determining the performance scores are approved by CMS, 
and in fact, are not permitted by Medicare regulations.

Worse yet, adherence-based metrics are particularly problematic and in 
cases not only wholly inapplicable in treating cancer patients, but 
also may be very dangerous. Community oncologists are extremely 
vigilant about monitoring their patients' cancer medication regimens 
and may temporarily discontinue or ``hold'' medications until a 
patient's status returns to an acceptable level, especially relating to 
adverse drug side effects. The period during which the medication is 
``held,'' or therapy is temporarily discontinued, is wrongly and 
obtusely measured by the PBM as a lack of adherence in one of the few 
areas where the community oncology practices may be measured, 
ultimately causing the community oncology practices' performance to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
decrease, and the DIR fee assessment to subsequently increase.

Consider, for example, Imbruvica (ibrutinib), which is dispensed by 
many community oncology practices to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Studies have shown that 
Imbruvica tends to cause hematologic effects such as neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia in MCL and CLL.\97\ If these adverse events occur at 
certain levels, the standard of care--as articulated directly by the 
FDA-approved package insert--is to hold the medication until the 
patient's lab values return to normal ranges.\98\ This can happen in as 
many as 46% of cases, resulting in discontinuing the patient's 
medication for up to a month. If community oncology practices are 
required to continue to dispense this drug, it will result in 
additional (and avoidable) costs to Medicare for the discontinued 
fills, as well as potential harm to the patient (along with potentially 
increased costs to Medicare for associated medical costs).

Further, due to the high cost of specialty drugs, and in particular, 
oncology medications, any small change in perceived adherence rates due 
to the purposeful physician-directed temporary discontinuation of 
therapy results in unreasonably low reimbursement rates.\99\ Many PBMs 
justify their DIR fee programs as being designed to influence providers 
to deliver better care to patients in their Medicare Part D networks. 
On that clinical basis, if community oncology practices were to be 
``influenced'' by the PBMs' DIR fee metrics by adhering to a medication 
when the FDA-approved label calls for the therapy to be held, patients 
would suffer. As such, community oncology practices are often left 
without any meaningful way to impact PBMs' so-called ``quality 
metrics'' and improve their DIR fee performance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \99\ Notably, most cancer medications entering the market cost more 
than $100,000 per year of treatment.

Ultimately, community oncology practices have no way out. For them, due 
to the clout and market leverage of PBMs, DIR fees are simply a form of 
extortion that community oncology practices are forced to pay.
            5.2  What Does the Law Say?
The most directly applicable legal principles relating to pharmacy DIR 
fees are found in the federal Any Willing Provider law. Within the 
federal Any Willing Provider law, CMS expressly recognized that 
unreasonably low reimbursement, which often result after accounting for 
DIR fees, violates the federal Any Willing Provider law.\100\ As it 
relates to the methodologies being used to assess DIR fees, performance 
criteria, and the manner in which PBMs and Part D plan sponsors are 
using those programs must also be reasonable and relevant.\101\ For 
community oncology practices, performance criteria that they are unable 
to influence or performance criteria that does not reasonably measure 
optimal cancer care can run afoul of the federal Any Willing Provider 
law.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \100\ See, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395w-104(b)(1)(A); 42 CFR 
Sec. 423.505(b)(18) Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, Chapter 
6, Section 50.3.
    \101\ 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395w-104(b)(1)(A); 42 CFR Sec. 423.505(b)(18) 
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, Chapter 6, Section 50.3.

In addition to explicit statutory language and CMS guidance, many of 
these principles are incorporated within, and apply directly to, the 
contract between PBMs and community oncology practices. PBM contracts 
include explicit obligations that the PBMs will comply with federal 
code, statues, rules, and CMS guidance, including but not limited to 
the Medicare Part D Provider Manual. These contractual obligations are 
not included in the contract with pharmacies by choice, but rather 
federal law requires these terms to be included in the contract between 
CMS and plan sponsors, and in contracts with their first tier entities 
(including PBMs, and in contracts between PBMs and pharmacy providers). 
This creates affirmative obligations on PBMs to comply with these laws, 
as well as the ability for pharmacy providers to directly challenge 
PBMs for breaches of contract when PBM actions do not comply with 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
federal law.

In January 2022, CMS introduced a proposed Final Rule that would alter 
the way PBMs and Part D plan sponsors are required to report DIR 
fees.\102\ In particular, CMS has proposed that PBMs and Part D plan 
sponsors report the lowest possible reimbursement to pharmacy providers 
(inclusive of all potential DIR fees) as the ``negotiated price.''\103\ 
While this proposed rule (if finalized) could have the result of 
removing the financial incentive for PBMs and Part D plan sponsors to 
institute retrospective DIR fees, it does little to protect pharmacy 
providers against unreasonably low reimbursement rates or wholly 
irrelevant ``quality'' metrics when assessing DIR fees.

            5.3  What Can Be Done?
     Legislative Solutions

        <ctr-circle>  Federal legislation should be enacted requiring 
that any DIR fee program (i) be tied to relevant quality programs to 
the specialty being measured; (ii) actually measured on an individual 
pharmacy level; (iii) provide equal opportunity for upside performance 
(i.e., not just a way for PBMs to ``rig'' the program to always measure 
downside performance resulting in DIR fees extracted from the 
provider); and (iv) require that DIR fees be applied equally and fairly 
across all network pharmacies, specifically including PBM-owned or 
affiliated pharmacies).

        <ctr-circle>  Federal legislation should require that all 
pharmacy price concessions, including DIR fees, be included in the 
negotiated price at point-of-sale.

        <ctr-circle>  Federal legislation should give CMS greater 
latitude in regulating the reimbursement structure between Part D plan 
sponsors and pharmacy providers.

     Regulatory

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should issue regulation providing ``guard 
rails'' on what constitutes reasonable and relevant terms and 
conditions, and clarify that whether given terms are ``reasonable'' or 
``relevant'' can be adjudicated in a private contractual dispute 
between Part D plan sponsors/PBMs and pharmacies.

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should initiate complaints against Part D 
plan sponsors and PBMs who have failed to pass on negotiated prices to 
patients at the point-of-sale, when DIR fees were known or knowable 
(i.e., the PBM maintained a minimum range of DIR fees that were to be 
assessed against every pharmacy no matter what).

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should initiate complaints against Part D 
plan sponsors and PBMs who have not paid providers based on reasonable 
and relevant terms and conditions, including through unreasonably low 
reimbursements, or irrelevant performance criteria.

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should require reporting of pharmacy DIR fees 
by both NDC number and pharmacy National Provider Identifier (NPI) 
allowing for full end-to-end audits of the flow of money from 
pharmacies to the Medicare program. The results of these audits should 
be made available to the public.

6  Restrictive Networks, Credentialing Abuses, and Artificial Barriers 
                    of Entry

PBMs maintain a monopoly-like grasp on the industry, the natural result 
of which is the inability of patients to freely choose a provider based 
on his or her personal health care decisions, as opposed to the 
mandates of his or her PBM. As noted previously, only three PBMs 
process more than three-quarters of all prescription claims: CVS 
Health, Express Scripts, and OptumRx,\104\ while five PBMs process over 
80% of all prescription claims. Each of the three major PBMs share 
common ownership with a major insurer and in turn with a mail-order 
and/or specialty pharmacy. These vertical, integrated relationships 
allow the PBMs to control the pharmaceutical supply chain, and erect 
superficial barriers to entry or even outright exclude entire classes 
of potential pharmacy providers.

This is particularly pronounced in the context of cancer care, where 
the introduction of new oncology therapies over the past several years, 
specifically, oral treatments for cancer and related conditions, 
presents new challenges for patients, plan sponsors, and providers 
alike. Between 2017 and 2019, there have been over 24 new oral cancer 
medications introduced into the marketplace.\105\ In 2020 alone, ten 
new oral oncolytics were approved by the FDA.\106\ As it stands, oral 
oncolytics make up 25% to 35% of cancer medications in development, 
making it likely that over the next several years, oral therapies will 
encompass an indispensable component of any treatment plan for cancer 
patients.\107\ While traditional chemotherapy infusion therapy that is 
``administered'' is covered under a patient's ``medical'' benefits, 
oral oncolytics that are ``dispensed'' are being shifted to the 
patient's ``pharmacy'' benefits, managed by PBMs. Unlike chemotherapy 
administered in the clinic setting, the advent of oral oncolytics have 
given the PBMs a tremendous new opportunity to control cancer care and 
divert prescriptions and profits to themselves.

These new oral cancer medications can be extremely expensive, often 
ranging more than $10,000 per month.\108\ This is what is attracting 
PBMs, and as a result, PBMs have attempted to use their market size and 
leverage to limit dispensing of oral oncolytics through certain 
specialty and/or mail-order pharmacies, most often their own or 
affiliated pharmacy.\109\

PBMs use several different tactics to maintain their control over where 
patients receive their care. The first and foremost of these is 
creating restricted networks, blocking access to any provider that is 
not affiliated with their PBM. In these instances, the PBM will contend 
that the network is ``closed'' or that there is no ``network,'' and 
thus, pharmacy providers are not even given the opportunity to apply 
for network admission. This occurs more frequently in the commercial 
insurance space involving employer-sponsored plans, but can also 
involve Medicaid managed care programs, where the PBM will require 
patients to receive their cancer medication from the PBM's wholly-owned 
or affiliated pharmacy, and no one else. This is anticompetitive 
conduct--pure and simple--where patients are trapped into using one 
particular provider not based on the quality of care provided by that 
provider but based on the financial arrangements and the corporate 
affiliation between the pharmacy provider and the PBM and/or health 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
insurer.

A related, but slight variation of this tactic is to restrict access to 
certain classes of providers (i.e., retail pharmacies), while excluding 
wholesale other classes of providers (i.e., dispensing physician 
practices). For example, beginning in early 2016, CVS Caremark espoused 
a self-serving stance that dispensing physician practices were now to 
be deemed ``out-of-network'' and no longer able to participate in 
Medicare Part D networks. This would have the effect of dramatically 
interrupting the ongoing relationship between treating oncologists and 
their patients. CVS Caremark later backtracked on this position and 
began allowing ``grandfathered'' dispensing physicians (i.e., those 
that previously held a contract with the PBM) to continue in-network, 
but delayed the processing of any new, non-grandfathered dispensing 
physician practices. In another instance, in January of 2018, Prime 
Therapeutics (Prime)--the PBM owned by a consortium of approximately 
twenty-two Blue Cross Blue Shield plans--announced that it would no 
longer accept any new dispensing physicians into its pharmacy networks 
on the alleged basis of ``fraud, waste, and abuse'' concerns and a 
commitment to maintaining to compliant networks. Without providing any 
further details, Prime claimed that Dispensing Physicians did not 
adhere to Prime's Provider Manual. This trend expanded to existing in-
network dispensing physicians actively servicing patients when, 
recently, Prime announced that it would also terminate existing, or 
``grandfathered'' dispensing physicians from its networks. Despite 
having credentialed, contracted, and paid dispensing physicians as 
``in-network'' Medicare Part D providers for over a decade, Prime 
seemingly unilaterally took the position that dispensing physicians are 
now considered ``out-of-
network providers'' under Medicare Part D. Like wholesale network 
exclusion, these practices disadvantage vital providers while allowing 
PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies to capture a greater share of 
prescription volume.

Even in instances where a PBM nominally allows a community oncology 
practice to apply for network participation, the PBM can still place 
other barriers in the way of providers being able to service their 
patients by imposing onerous credentialing processes. For a community 
oncology practice to service patients within a PBM's network, PBMs 
require that the provider adhere to specific and extremely onerous, 
credentialing requirements, including the requirement that the provider 
maintain certain accreditations. These conditions are made even more 
onerous where PBMs delay the review of credentialing applications 
(seemingly with the intention to avoid admitting these providers), 
enact credentialing applications with terms and conditions designed to 
keep out providers (rather than ensuring the quality of providers) or 
allow participation but at rates so low that reimbursement may not even 
cover the acquisition cost of a drug.

These obstructionist policies harm patients, degrade the quality of 
prescribers and benefit only PBMs that are incentivized to continue to 
these illegitimate practices.

Finally, even when a community oncology practice has ultimately been 
admitted into a PBM's network, PBMs continue to utilize other tactics 
to drive patients away from community oncology practices, and towards 
PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies. This includes tactics such as 
patient slamming and claim hijacking (see, section 7, infra), 
misleading communications aimed at steering patients to PBM-owned or 
affiliated pharmacies, and creating patient incentives for patients 
(such as lower copays, larger days' supply or free products/services) 
to utilize preferred PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies. PBMs also 
utilize other tactics, such as abusive auditing practices (i.e., 
requiring the production of thousands of pages of documentation to 
support claims billed) and terminating providers without cause or on 
pretextual bases (i.e., that they only dispense one class of 
medications).

PBMs employ these tactics to maintain their oppressive market 
dominance. But at the same time, in a vicious cycle, these tactics are 
themselves the consequence of the horizontal and vertical consolidation 
within and between insurance and PBM markets, which has created merged 
entities with such oppressive power that it a virtual chokehold on 
community oncology practices and pharmacy providers. The result of 
these tactics is that patients are steered away from receiving care at 
their community oncology practices, and forced to receive care from 
PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies. This is not only without regard to 
the impact on patient care and outcomes, but as the chart below 
demonstrates, only continues to prop up higher drug prices and charges.

            6.1  Who Is Impacted?
The overall lack of industry standards and oversight in the PBM 
credentialing sphere has led to arbitrary denials and lengthy, costly 
application processes, that ultimately have a negative impact on a 
community oncology practice's ability to focus on patient care. Instead 
of allowing community oncology practices to enter into their networks, 
PBMs attempt to limit the dispensing of oral oncolytics through their 
own specialty pharmacies, leading to poor patient compliance and 
adherence to life-saving treatments, causing the quality of cancer care 
to suffer.\110\

credentialing--challenges and opportunities (August 21, 2017), https://
www.pharmacist.com/article/pharmacy-credentialing-challenges-and-
opportunities. See also, Egerton, supra, at S100.

These tactics have had negative impact all across the spectrum, 
affecting patients, health care payers (including Medicare, Medicaid, 
employers and taxpayers), and providers.
                6.1.1  Harm to Patients
These exclusionary practices--whether they be unreasonable barriers to 
entry or outright exclusion of certain classes of providers--result in 
serious harm to patients, specifically those who are seeking the 
services of community oncology practices that have been excluded from a 
PBM specialty network. For one, these exclusionary practices destroy 
existing patient-provider relationships. In early 2016, when CVS 
Caremark undertook re-interpreting longstanding CMS regulations, it did 
so in such a way as to effectively cut out physicians from continuing 
to dispense medications to their existing Medicare Part D 
patients.\111\ PBMs have no regard for the continuity of these vital 
health care relationships and their impact on patients' well-being and 
outcomes.

    \111\ See, CVS Health Corp., Letter to Congressman Ed Whitfield 
from Senior Vice President of Government and Public Affair Melissa A. 
Schulman (February 19, 2016) [``CVS-Whitfield Letter''].

This is critical, as patients are more likely to raise certain 
questions or concerns about their medications, when these medications 
are dispensed by community oncology practices. To strip patients, who 
are facing serious life-threatening diseases, of that important 
patient-provider relationship could result in serious patient 
harm.\112\ This also has the effect of decreasing medication adherence, 
which would further affect patients, especially those undergoing life-
saving treatments at community oncology practices.\113\

The ultimate outcome of creating restricted networks or excluding 
entire classes of providers, namely, that patients are essentially 
required to obtain medications at a PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacy. 
It is well-documented \114\ that when the PBM-owned or affiliated 
pharmacy is responsible for filling the patients' prescriptions, it 
results in worse care. The near-monopolistic control of the network, 
combined with the lack of patient choice, remove any checks and 
balances on the quality of the care being provided.

Consider, for example, a patient battling cancer was denied life-saving 
medications by a PBM due to the PBM being unwilling to enter 
medications into its computer system.\115\ In another example, a 
patient had been diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-positive + 
chronic myeloid leukemia and had been responding positively to 
``180mg'' of a certain medication. However, according to the patient's 
PBM, the medication had to come from the PBM's mandated mail order 
specialty pharmacy instead of a pharmacy of their choice. Since the 
medication was not available in a single 180mg dosage form, the 
prescription clearly indicated that the patient was to receive a ``100 
mg tablet and an 80 mg tablet.'' Instead, over the course of the next 
several months, the PBM pharmacy dispensed either a 100 mg tablet or an 
80 mg tablet, but never both. Ultimately, the patient did not respond 
well to the lowered dosages of the medication.\116\ Finally, in a 
particularly disturbing example, a colorectal cancer patient was 
prescribed a common oral medication that had been on the market for 
nearly 20 years. The patient's PBM mandated that the patient fill the 
prescription at a large, well-known specialty pharmacy, and the 
patient's oncologist prescribed the medication to be taken in rounds 
with the following specific instructions: ``two weeks on, one week 
off.'' The PBM mail-order pharmacy neglected to include the ``one week 
off'' instruction on the label, and as a result, the patient ended up 
in the intensive care unit of a hospital.\117\

Unfortunately, patients often do not have any ability or choice to 
switch their PBMs in order to have control over which pharmacy provider 
from whom they would like to receive service. PBMs who undertake these 
restrictive practices are typically selected by the patient's employer 
(or sometimes by the insurance company selected by the patient's 
employer). The patients are two, sometimes three steps removed from any 
part of the decision-making process. Since most patient get their 
health care coverage through their jobs, the only way a patient can 
exert any control over the network of pharmacy providers is to change 
jobs and hope that their new employer utilizes a different PBM's 
network. But, in a world where three PBMs account for nearly 80% of the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
marketplace, the odds of getting a better PBM are slim to none.

The PBMs know the level of power that they wield. And their focus is on 
profits, not patients. Ultimately, given the acute focus on patient 
care inherent in community oncology practices, patients suffer when 
those providers are forced out of the space.\118\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                6.1.2  Harm to Plan Sponsors
In addition to patients, these exclusionary practices harm plan 
sponsors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, because they cause an 
artificial rise in the cost of specialty medication, particularly 
within the oncology space. Specifically, the exclusion of community 
oncology practices from PBM networks require more patients to utilize 
PBM-owned or affiliated mail-order and/or specialty pharmacies. This, 
in turn, leads to exponentially more waste of medication, causing 
increased costs to plan sponsors.\119\ Mail-order pharmacies, without 
proper access to patient outcomes, routinely dispense 90-day supplies 
of medications. In several instances, patients continue to receive 
medications despite their repeated requests to have the mail-order 
pharmacy cease sending medication, often due to a change in their 
course of treatment. In more tragic cases, the PBM mail-order 
pharmacies continue to dispense medications to the patient's residence 
despite the patient having passed away, leading to the waste of 
unwanted, expensive medications.\120\

.pdf.

Moreover, when pharmacy care is diverted from community oncology 
practices to PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies, plan sponsors lose out 
on tremendous value-based contracting opportunities.\121\ In the 
Medicare space, CMS is developing new payment and delivery models 
designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of specialty care. 
Among those specialty models is the Oncology Care Model, which aims to 
provide higher quality, more highly coordinated oncology care at the 
same or lower cost to Medicare. The Oncology Care Model ``provides an 
incentive to participating physician practices to comprehensively and 
appropriately address the complex care needs of the beneficiary 
population receiving chemotherapy treatment and heighten the focus on 
furnishing services that specifically improve the patient experience or 
health outcomes.''\122\ PBM exclusionary practices would thwart this 
initiative. Likewise, in the private sector, value-based care (VBC) 
innovations are on the rise, increasing the quality while lowing the 
overall cost to health care payer and their patients. The ability to 
tie benefits to providers and value to patients is critical to aligning 
interests in the health care space and has long been a long-term goal 
of health policy experts. However, this type of integration of medical 
and pharmacy care is against the interest of current PBM practices to 
implement. Absent changes to PBM regulation, the federal government 
will be unable to achieve some of the same cost-saving/quality 
improving measures as is being utilized in primarily the self-funded 
employer sponsor health care space.

Unfortunately, these lost opportunities are not made up for in savings 
garnered by PBMs, and in fact, quite the opposite has occurred. As 
illustrated in the figure on page 36, the exclusion of community 
oncology practices and other independent providers allows PBMs to 
pocket more through their wholly-owned or affiliated mail-order and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
specialty pharmacies.

In a study conducted by Ohio's Medicaid Managed Care Pharmacy Services, 
PBMs billed taxpayers 8.8% more for medications than what they paid 
pharmacies. This difference, commonly referred to as ``spread'' has 
been growing and is typically the highest on specialty medications, 
such as oral oncolytics.\123\ Worse yet, similar data has shown that 
the spread between plan sponsor funded PBM revenue and pharmacy-
captured reimbursement has increased over time. In short, PBMs are 
keeping more and more revenue from health care costs to the detriment 
of others in the health care space.

Ultimately, when compared to costs of PBM exclusionary practices, 
the savings associated with dispensing by community oncology practices 
are palpable. Reports estimate that physician point-of-care dispensing 
could save seniors and taxpayers over $20 billion in Medicare Part D 
alone.\124\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                6.1.3  Harm to Providers
An increasingly important component of the physician-patient 
relationship with oncology is the dispensing of medications to patients 
through the community oncology practice, at the site of care. Excluding 
community oncology practices from PBM networks prevents physicians from 
providing consistent care to their patients.\125\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \125\ See, National Evaluation of Prescriber Drug Dispensing 
(2014), https://dopl.utah.gov/PrescriberDrugDispensing.pdf.

When PBMs impose unreasonably high or arbitrary requirements for 
network admission, designed for no purpose other than to serve as an 
artificial barrier of entry, they place immense and undue burdens on 
community oncology practices seeking to service their patients. As 
noted above, these credentialing standards often require a provider to 
hold multiple forms of accreditation, such as URAC and ACHC. These 
specified accreditations are often not the most relevant or appropriate 
form of accreditation for community oncology practices, and do not 
constitute the most applicable form of endorsement based on the unique 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and specialized services provided by community oncology practices.

Between the standards set forth under the Oncology Care Model (OCM) and 
Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) Certification Program, 
community oncology practices also attain high standards of practices, 
validated by third parties, that obviate the need for separate 
accreditation. For example, QOPI has a certification program 
specifically designed for clinical oncology practices as this process 
``can routinely evaluate practice performance against quality measures 
and standards established by experts in the oncology field.'' Likewise, 
through the CMS-created OCM, community oncology practices have entered 
into payment arrangements that include financial and performance 
accountability for episodes of care surrounding chemotherapy 
administration to cancer patients. The practices participating in OCM 
have committed to providing enhanced services to Medicare beneficiaries 
such as care coordination, navigation, and national treatment 
guidelines for care. The fact that CMS has involved itself in the 
creation of this type of model with standards that directly correlate 
to community oncology providers demonstrates that these two programs 
(OCM and QOPI) would be the best industry standards to judge a network 
provider. Moreover, requiring dual accreditation--including URAC 
accreditation in Specialty Pharmacy--apart from being redundant, also 
increases the risks that the provider will have multiple, sometimes 
contradictory compliance requirements, needing to comply with not just 
ACHC standards, but also URAC standards, which at times can be 
diverging. Finally, these accreditations can be prohibitively expensive 
and costly, making it impracticable for providers to undertake the 
steps necessary to even seek admission to the networks.

Likewise, when PBMs take steps to delay credentialing, this too harms 
pharmacy providers. Community oncology practices have to divert 
considerable amount of time and resources to respond to repeated follow 
ups on their credentialing applications under normal circumstances. 
However, when a PBM ``slow rolls'' an application and takes months to 
review and respond to inquiries, this has often led to the PBM asking 
the provider to provide the same documentation over, and over and over 
again (i.e., licenses that expire and are renewed over the course of 
the sometimes 18-month long credentialing process). This takes time 
away from being able to service patients.

But perhaps the most direct way providers are harmed by these tactics 
is through the actual effects of network exclusion. Due to the size and 
market share of each PBM (see, Section 3, supra), a PBM termination or 
exclusion often spells irreparable harm for a provider seeking to 
participate in pharmacy networks and/or the Medicare Part D 
program.\126\ Particularly alarming is the fact that about two-thirds 
of all Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan enrollees are 
concentrated in networks across just three payers: OptumRx, CVS 
Caremark, and Humana. Exclusion from any one of these payers could make 
dispensing simply not a viable option for a community oncology 
practice.\127\

            6.2  What Does the Law Say?
Among all the barriers that PBMs put in front of providers--including 
onerous credentialing processes, restricting network access, steering 
to owned or affiliated pharmacies--the core legal principles largely 
tie back to rules promulgated around freedom of patient choice and 
network participation. Remarkably, there are several federal and state 
laws on the books that seek to safeguard the rights of patients to 
select the provider of their choice, or to protect community oncology 
practices from undue network termination or exclusion. In the federal 
statutes establishing and governing the Medicare program, Congress has 
included explicit ``Any Willing Provider'' requirements, which relate 
directly to network access for Medicare providers, including community 
oncology practices. These statutes apply to all Part D plan sponsors, 
as Part D plan sponsors are under the purview of CMS, pursuant to 
contracts between the Part D plan sponsors and CMS.

The Medicare Any Willing Provider law (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395w-104) 
explicitly requires that all Part D prescription drug plans permit 
``the participation of any pharmacy that meets the terms and conditions 
under the plan.'' The federal ``Any Willing Provider'' law further 
prohibits health insurers from creating exclusive provider networks--or 
unduly barring entry to such networks (such as through artificial 
barriers of entry)--to which insured patients are directed to the 
exclusion and detriment of non-network providers.\128\ In fact, as it 
relates to credentialing abuses, CMS has also questioned whether 
mandatory accreditations should be considered ``standard terms and 
conditions'' of a network, and whether PBMs should instead explore 
other reasonable and relevant alternatives to ensure quality assurance 
and actual improved patient care, particularly where certain 
accreditation requires may be arbitrary and not directly proven to 
ensure quality assurance.\129\

to the Medicare Advantage, Medicare Cost Plan, Medicare Fee-for-
Service, the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs, and the PACE 
Program, 42 Fed. Reg. 16597 (April 16, 2018)

Likewise, federal law provides protection directly for patients to have 
the freedom to select a provider of their choice.\130\ Pursuant to 42 
CFR Sec. 431.51(a), Medicaid beneficiaries may obtain services from any 
qualified Medicaid provider that undertakes to provide services to 
them. However, plan sponsors commonly use preferred networks to 
incentivize beneficiaries to fill claims at pharmacies of the Plan's 
choice (rather than the beneficiary's choice), by offering reduced co-
pays at preferred pharmacies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \130\ See, 42 CFR Sec. 431.51(a).

Several states also maintain their own versions of ``Any Willing 
Provider'' protections. For example, North Carolina's Any Willing 
Provider Law provides that a health benefit plan shall not ``[p]rohibit 
or limit a resident of th[e] State . . . from selecting a pharmacy of 
his or her choice when the pharmacy has agreed to participate in the 
health benefit plan according to the terms offered by the insurer,'' or 
``[d]eny a pharmacy the opportunity to participate as a contract 
provider under a health benefit plan if the pharmacy agrees to provide 
pharmacy services that meet the terms and requirements, including terms 
of reimbursement, of the insurer under a health benefit plan. . . 
.''\131\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \131\ N.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. Sec. 58-51-37(c).

Similarly, Tennessee's Any Willing Provider Law provides similar 
limitations on the ability to exclude providers such as community 
oncology practices, mandating that ``[n]o health insurance insurer and 
no managed health insurance insurer may . . . deny any licensed 
pharmacy or licensed pharmacist the part to participate as a 
participating provider in any policy, contract, or plan on the same 
terms and conditions are offered to any other provider of pharmacy 
services under the policy, contract or plan'' or ``[p]revent any person 
who is a party to or a beneficiary of any policy, contract, or plan 
from selecting a licensed pharmacy of the person's choice . . . 
provided that the pharmacy is a participating provider under the same 
terms and conditions of the contract, policy or plan as those offered 
any other provider of pharmacy services.''\132\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \132\ Tenn. Code. Ann Sec. 56-7-2359 (a)(1)-(2).

These laws prohibit not just outright network exclusion, but also a 
host of other PBM practices aimed at requiring that patient use their 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
wholly-owned or affiliated pharmacies.

At both the federal and state levels, policy recognizes the importance 
of provider access and, ultimately, competition via the enactment of 
these ``Any Willing Provider'' rules. Unfortunately, these laws have 
not been without attack by the powerful PBMs,\133\ and in few instances 
do they provide pharmacies a private right of action to enforce and 
ensure they are meaningfully applied.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            6.3  What Can Be Done?
     Legislative

        <ctr-circle>  Congress should enact federal legislation that 
provides a private right of action for community oncology practices to 
exercise their rights under the federal Any Willing Provider law, 
particularly when they are unfairly excluded from PBM networks and a 
private right of action will allow the enforcement of a regulation by a 
private party, such as a community oncology practice, allowing for 
litigation or the threat of litigation to incentivize compliance of the 
law.

        <ctr-circle>  Congress should enact state legislation that 
curbs credentialing abuses and provides for stronger Any Willing 
Provider laws and provides for a private right of action for community 
oncology practices to exercise.
     Regulatory

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should pursue complaints against PBMs for 
their construct of artificial barriers of entry and failure to adhere 
to the establishment of reasonable and relevant terms and conditions of 
participation.

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should also enact regulation to specify 
``reasonable'' and ``relevant'' standards of participation to allow for 
defined requirements PBMs must adhere to.

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should issue regulation providing ``guard 
rails'' on what constitutes reasonable and relevant terms and 
conditions, and clarify that whether given terms are ``reasonable'' or 
``relevant'' can be adjudicated in a private contractual dispute 
between Part D plan sponsors/PBMs and pharmacies.

        <ctr-circle>  State Departments of Insurance should pursue 
complaints against PBMs for violations of Any Willing Provider Laws, 
and Medicaid Free-Choice-of-Provider provisions.

     Plan Sponsor Action

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors should require PBMs to seek 
approval from plan sponsors prior to establishing a standard and/or 
qualification for a provider network.

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors should have the full and final 
authority to make any modification to a standard and/or qualification 
for a provider network.

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors should retain the right to 
participate in an administrative hearing requested by a provider who 
has been terminated or rejected from a PBM's provider network.

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors should retain the full and final 
authority to make accept or deny a provider's request to participate in 
a PBM's provider network.

7 Prescription Trolling, Patient Slamming, and Claim Hijacking

A patient's decision on where to fill his or her medication, especially 
a cancer medication, is of immense importance. Cancer patients require 
ease of treatment and as little confusion as possible, in order to have 
a positive outcome. Based on these principles, Section 30.2.2.3 of the 
Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual prohibits PBMs and Part D 
plan sponsors from ``Steering of physicians or beneficiaries to a 
sponsor's and/or PBM's own mail order Pharmacy.'' Such prohibition 
specifically includes steering of prescribers' patients to a specialty 
pharmacy owned by or affiliated with a plan sponsor/PBM and most PBM 
contracts require adherence to CMS Guidance and contain compliance with 
law provisions.

Despite the law, there are innumerable instances where the PBMs haves 
effectively utilized claims or fill data and sought to move the 
prescription away from the provider of the patient's choice and toward 
the PBM's wholly-owned or affiliated pharmacy. This practice, sometimes 
referred to as ``prescription trolling,'' ``patient slamming,'' or 
``claim hijacking,'' plays out fairly consistently. A typical case 
might involve a situation where the PBM allows the provider to submit a 
claim (typically a high-cost specialty medication), then reject it 
claiming that it required a prior authorization (PA). Then, once the 
provider has done all the required work to obtain the approval for the 
PA, it is subsequently rejected once again by the PBM, this time for 
the apparent reason that it ``must'' be filled at the PBM-owned or 
affiliated specialty pharmacy.

Pharmacy providers typically transmit prescription claims (and 
sometimes PA requests) to the patients' PBM for purposes of having it 
adjudicated and receiving reimbursement. Such transmissions clearly 
contain protected health information (PHI) and are directed solely at 
the PBM acting as the claims adjudicator. Instead of simply reviewing 
and processing this claim, in its fiduciary capacity as the PBM, the 
PBM improperly and unlawfully accesses the PHI, and illegally 
communicates the claim information to its related entity (a PBM-owned 
specialty pharmacy). While the PBM is processing the PA, the PBM-owned 
or affiliated pharmacy surreptitiously communicates to the patient, 
prescriber, or both, with the goal of having the prescription filled at 
the PBM-owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy. Community oncology 
practices have documented \134\ some egregious instances where the PBM 
blatantly lied to the patient and pharmacy staff, saying the 
prescribing physician had authorized the transfer, when in fact, they 
clearly had not. Further, with complete disregard to not only patient 
privacy laws, but also state Pharmacy Practice Acts, PBM-owned 
specialty pharmacies have brazenly filled and dispensed the medication 
in complete absence of having an actual, signed prescription in 
hand.\135\

www.frierlevitt.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Hot-Topics-in-SPRX-Law-
Final_PDF.pdf.

Worrisomely, more deceitful and underhanded variations of this also 
exist. In some instances, PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies have 
sought to mislead patients into thinking that their physician wants the 
prescription to be filled at the PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacy, or 
otherwise imbed prescription transfer documentation in the information 
the PBM provides to the physician in order to renew the prescription 
for refill (and the physician unknowingly signs to have the 
prescription transferred).
            7.1  Who Is Impacted?
                7.1.1 Harm to Patients
A direct result of prescription trolling is severe confusion and 
distress for cancer patients, who are caught in the middle, uncertain 
of when or from where they will receive their next dose of their life 
saving medication.\136\ These concerns in the context of prescription 
trolling go beyond those when a PBM takes steps to create a restricted 
network (see, section 6, supra); it is far more insidious here. While 
patients cannot be compelled to fill their prescription from a specific 
dispenser, many report receiving correspondence from their PBM implying 
that they must use a pharmacy owned by or affiliated with the PBM. 
These letters often explain that the insurance company has its own 
``preferred'' pharmacy, from which the patient may already be receiving 
other prescribed drugs and offer for the patient to also get their oral 
cancer drug from this same source. PBMs may try to entice patients to 
select their ``preferred'' pharmacy through lower patient copayments to 
the patient only for the patient to later realize their oral oncolytics 
cost more at the ``preferred'' pharmacy than a non-preferred provider. 
Many patients find this confusing and do not understand the 
repercussions that jeopardize the monitoring, care control, and 
clinical management that they receive at their community oncology 
pharmacy, and they mistakenly, or unintentionally, switch their drug 
dispenser.\137\

Many patients may require special assistance from their community 
oncology practice that has documented and understands their medical 
history, monitors for drug interactions between their medications, and 
is able to make appropriate dosing adjustments at the time of 
administration. Furthermore, a patient who is switched over to a PBM-
owned or affiliated mail-order pharmacy often has his/her medication 
shipped from a distance (sometimes several states away), running the 
risk that the drug could be rendered ineffective in treating that 
patient's condition due to a lack of sufficient temperature control 
during transit.\138\ In short, the harm can literally be deadly for 
patients with cancer, because of the disease and drugs involved--
medications arriving too late or failure to timely amend dosing 
regimens can be the difference for life and death for these patients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scare Tactics, May 26, 2020, available at https://www.truthrx.org/
theputtblog/healthcare-bullying-some-call-it-steering-we-call-it-scare-
tactics.

Perhaps worst of all, PBMs and their wholly-owned or affiliated 
specialty pharmacies have been known to employ underhanded tactics to 
``hijack'' the prescription. In one particularly egregious instance, a 
PBM-affiliated specialty pharmacy contacted a community oncology 
practice claiming that one of the clinic's patients had requested that 
his lung cancer medication be transferred to the PBM-affiliated 
pharmacy and demanded the clinic's immediate compliance in the matter. 
Surprised by the news, the oncologist contacted the patient to inquire 
about his decision, only to discover that this was the first time the 
patient had heard of the matter. ``Please do not transfer it anywhere 
else!'' the patient requested. ``I want to get it filled through the 
dispensary. I did not ask for this. I love being able to get this right 
away and with no hassles. I was on an oral chemo before and it was 
filled by a specialty pharmacy and I always was getting it late, missed 
a few days of medication sometimes and had numerous phone calls from 
them. They never seemed to know what was going on with my 
medication.''\139\ As evidenced by this true story account, patients 
receiving their oral drugs from a community oncology practice have 
access to those drugs within 24 hours of prescribing, and they can 
begin treatment immediately. Patients receiving their oral cancer drugs 
through a PBM, on the other hand, often have a much longer wait, 
sometimes 14 days or more. In addition to the delays, it is clear the 
oncology practices have access to patient records and can more closely 
monitor patients which empowers them to provide the most coordinated 
care.\140\

problems-and-how-practices-can-work-with-them.

In the end, the PBMs' lack of transparency to the patient and the 
general public usurps the patient's right of choice and circumvents the 
prescriber's orders and independent professional judgment.
                7.1.2  Harm to Plan Sponsors
The greatest harm to plan sponsors stemming from prescription trolling 
and claims hijacking is increased potential for waste, particularly 
compared to when the claim would otherwise be filled by the community 
oncology practice. Many times, a community oncology practice can 
identify certain medications that may be difficult to tolerate or 
patients whose conditions may require multiple dosing refinements. In 
these cases, in anticipation of such modifications, practices will 
often dispense a 15-day supply rather than a 30- or 90-day supply. PBM 
specialty mail order pharmacies can lack the expertise for such 
forethought or do not have the experience with care management to know 
when a smaller supply might be the wiser, more economical choice.\141\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \141\ See, PBMs: Their Role, the Problems, and How Practices Can 
Work With Them, May 27, 2020, available at https://www.ajmc.com/
journals/evidence-based-oncology/2017/october-2017/pbms-their-role-the-
problems-and-how-practices-can-work-with-them.

Ultimately, mandatory diversion of patients to PBM mail order 
pharmacies leads to increased waste of often-expensive and unwanted 
medication, thereby increasing overall health care spending, at the 
expense of Medicare and taxpayers.\142\ In a study funded by the 
Community Pharmacy Foundation reviewing medications being returned for 
disposal and destruction, it was found that prescriptions originating 
through mail order were far more likely to have excessive amounts of 
unused medication remaining (i.e., 80% or more of the prescribed 
quantity) when compared to retail pharmacies.\143\ In the cancer space, 
these issues of waste can be extremely costly. ln a particularly well-
documented instance, a battling advanced colorectal cancer was told 
that his health plan would only cover his prescription for oral 
oncolytics if he obtained them through the PBM's mail-order 
pharmacy.\144\ After he waited nearly 2 weeks to receive his 
prescription, when it finally came, it included incorrect dosing 
instructions, and he was told by the PBM-owned pharmacy to send back 
the medication (worth $20,000) so it could be destroyed.\145\ Even when 
the medication was ordered again, it came with fewer pills than were 
prescribed.\146\ While the PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies continue 
to make errors and cause patients to endure life-threatening delays, 
the plan sponsors--like employers and Medicaid programs--are left 
footing the bill for these wasted products to the tune of tens of 
thousands of dollars in this one instance alone.

                7.1.3  Harm to Providers
In addition to circumventing the prescriber's orders and independent 
professional judgment, the PBMs' tactics of prescription trolling 
further serves to push the burden of performing the initial 
administrative functions on to the community oncology practices, while 
removing any attendant benefits, as the first fill is the most 
expensive claim. The first fills of a prescription are typically a 
pharmacy's most expensive claims due to several factors, including 
coordination with prescriber, prior authorization efforts, researching 
and liaising with patient assistance programs, engaging in patient 
training and providing skilled nursing administration.\147\ And 
further, at its core, through these claim rejections, the PBMs are once 
again depriving providers of any ongoing and expected future business 
relationships with patients who initially sought to fill prescriptions 
with their provider.\148\

Final_PDF.pdf.

Apart from just the lost revenue, at their core, these tactics create a 
lot more work for already burdened community oncology practices and 
make patient treatment much more difficult. In the course of the PBMs' 
efforts jockeying for control of the prescription, staff at community 
oncology practices spends hours on the phone with all the disconnected 
and disjointed stakeholders, just trying to get the prescription filled 
and in the patient's hands. This includes speaking with the PBM, then 
the insurance company, then the PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacy, then 
the PBM again--and this all assumes everything goes ``smoothly.'' It is 
well-documented that these additional layers of unnecessary 
administrative complexity burden the health care system, with health 
care stakeholders spending about $496 billion on billing and insurance-
related costs each year.\149\ These additional administrative burdens 
have been found to have a direct negative impact on patient care.\150\

Yet PBMs remained focused on maximizing profits. As the chart below 
show, immense profit comes along with diverting prescriptions to PBM-
owned pharmacies. Within the Florida Medicaid program, the overwhelming 
majority of ``profits'' earned from dispensing brand name drugs 
(including cancer medications) was retained by just three PBM-owned or 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
affiliated pharmacies.

[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


The combination of restricted networks, prescription trolling, and 
the mandating of dispensation of specialty drugs at specific pharmacies 
has been a boon to the specialty pharmacy arms of the nation's largest 
insurers and PBMs, driving disproportionate profit to them vis-a-vis 
their unaffiliated pharmacy peers.
            7.2  What Does the Law Say?
In addition to federal and state Any Willing Provider and Freedom of 
Patient Choice laws, which are certainly implicated by PBMs directing 
patients to their wholly-owned or affiliated pharmacies and excluding 
community oncology practices (see, section 6, supra), several other 
federal and state laws bear on the tactic of prescription trolling. 
First and foremost, this activity runs afoul of the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations promulgated 
thereunder (HIPAA), which limit the disclosure of PHI by covered 
entities, including pharmacies and PBMs,\151\ without patient 
authorization.\152\ In the absence of a valid authorization, 
disclosures of PHI may only be made for purposes of treatment, payment, 
or health care operations of the covered entity.\153\ As such, a PBM's 
access to and use of PHI to steer patients toward the PBM's wholly-
owned or affiliated pharmacy is a breach \154\ of HIPAA, and 
compromises the privacy and security of patients' personal information. 
HIPAA provides, in addition to substantial civil penalties, criminal 
sanctions for the use of PHI in this way,\155\ which demonstrates the 
significance of maintaining patient privacy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \151\ 45 CFR Sec. 160.102.
    \152\ 45 CFR Sec. 164.508.
    \153\ 45 CFR Sec. 164.506.
    \154\ 45 CFR Sec. 164.402.
    \155\ 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1320d-6.

In addition, these practices likely violate many states' Anti-Patient 
Steering Laws which prohibit PBM or insurer-owned or affiliated 
pharmacies from ``steering'' profitable prescriptions to their own 
affiliated PBM and insurance pharmacies. For example, Louisiana 
provides that a PBM shall not directly or indirectly engage in patient 
steering to a pharmacy in which the PBM maintains an ownership interest 
or control without making a written disclosure and receiving 
acknowledgment from the patient; and the PBM is further prohibited from 
retaliation or further attempts to influence the patient, or treat the 
patient or the patient's claim any differently if the patient chooses 
to use the alternate pharmacy.\156\ Likewise, New Jersey makes it 
unlawful for a pharmacist to enter into an arrangement with a health 
care practitioner who is licensed to issue prescriptions, or any 
institution, facility, or entity that provides health care services, 
for the purpose of directing or diverting patients to or from a 
specified pharmacy or restraining in any way a patient's freedom of 
choice to select a pharmacy.\157\ When the PBM engages in these 
underhanded tactics, it is not only directly steering the patient to a 
particular pharmacy without their knowledge or consent, but forcing the 
community oncology practice to go along with the scheme, by consenting 
to transfer the prescription.

    \157\ N.J. Admin. Code Sec. 13:39-3.10.

Lastly, even beyond state laws, prescription trolling may impinge on 
other federal requirements, including section 2 of the Sherman Act 
(i.e., attempted monopolization using their role and leverage as PBM 
gatekeeper to divert business to the PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacy), 
and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and its 
requirements that fiduciaries discharge their duties with respect to 
the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries 
(misappropriate PHI for pecuniary gain certainly could arise to the 
breach of a fiduciary duty for PBMs).\158\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \158\ 29 U.S.C. Sec. 1104(a)(1).

The overarching legal principles are potentially tempered somewhat by 
recent case law involving PBM appropriation of claims data. In Trone 
Health Services, Inc. v. Express Scripts Holding Co., No. 4:18-CV-467 
RLW, 2019 WL 1207866, (E.D. Mo. March 14, 2019), a retail pharmacy 
brought claims against Express Scripts, alleging Unfair Competition, 
breaches of contract, breaches of the implied covenant of good faith 
and fair dealing, interference with economic advantage, violation of 
uniform trade secrets act and fraud for the practice of ``slamming,'' 
that is, collecting claims information received by the PBM at the 
point-of-sale from retail pharmacies submitting claims for their 
patients, and providing that same data to Express Scripts' wholly-owned 
mail order pharmacy for the purpose of soliciting the same patients to 
receive their prescriptions via mail order. The core of all the claims 
was Express Scripts' conduct of collecting and using prescription data 
to boost its mail-order operations. Parsing the ``black letter'' 
language of the one-sided contract of adhesion, the Judge, however, 
held that the conduct was not prohibited and, in fact, was expressly 
allowed under the terms of the agreement with the pharmacies. While the 
Eighth Circuit revised the standard slightly as it relates to the 
pharmacy provider's rights under HIPAA, the Court of Appeals ultimately 
upheld the lower court's decision, serving as a reminder of the 
unbridled power that the PBMs believe themselves to hold.\159\

No. 19-1774 (8th Cir. 2020).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            7.3  What Can Be Done?
Prescription trolling and patient slamming is perhaps one of the most 
deceitful of the PBM tactics and requires a response at many levels to 
end it once and for all:

     Legislative

        <ctr-circle>  Congress should enact federal legislation which 
would protect patient choice of pharmacy and prohibit PBMs from 
requiring patients to use the mail order and specialty pharmacies they 
own, creating a conflict of interest, or exploiting private patient 
data for those purposes.\160\

8 Low-Ball Reimbursement

Low-ball reimbursement--when PBMs reimburse providers less than the 
cost of the drug--is yet another tactic taken by PBMs to effectively 
exclude community oncology practices, in order to retain and ensure a 
higher market share for the specialty drug market for their fully owned 
specialty pharmacies.\162\ Also known as ``below water'' or 
``underwater'' reimbursement, PBMs intentionally lowball the 
reimbursement rates offered in one-sided, take-it-or-leave-it 
agreements with providers. No negotiation is offered. The ultimate goal 
of low-ball reimbursement is to allow the PBM to have it both ways: 
nominally ``comply'' with Any Willing Provider laws by ``offering'' 
open participation in the network, but in reality, effectively 
excluding pharmacy providers by pushing them to reject these 
unsustainable reimbursement rates, thereby diverting more patients to 
their wholly-owned or affiliated specialty pharmacies. While guised as 
a cost saving measure, PBMs actually profit off the low-ball 
reimbursements. As complex, multifaceted health care entities, PBMs are 
able to recoup any losses that might be incurred at the dispensing 
level by charging plan sponsors more money through spread pricing (see, 
section 4, supra) or receiving rebates or other ``fees'' from 
manufacturers at the PBM level (see, section 3, supra).

This recently played out in the wake of the collaboration agreement 
between Prime Therapeutics and Express Scripts, causing low-ball, below 
water reimbursement for community oncology practices. On April 1, 2020, 
Prime Therapeutics began applying Express Scripts' lower reimbursement 
rates and pharmacies have been receiving abhorrently low, even 
negative, reimbursements. Claims specifically for lifesaving 
medications and limited distribution drugs are rendered below water. 
Notably, in June 2020, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama (recognizing 
that these rates may not be sustainable) began increasing rates to 
independent pharmacies in Alabama for Blue Cross Blue Shield Alabama 
plans \163\ (however, this plan was the exception to the rule). Many 
community oncology practices continue to face unsustainable, below cost 
reimbursement, which is only exacerbated when taking into account 
direct costs associated with pharmacy operations (such as salaries and 
benefits of pharmacy staff, accreditation fees, shipping, dispensing 
fees, supplies and equipment, license fee, pharmacy dispensing software 
fees and adherence and symptom management software fee, postage, etc.), 
and indirect overhead (including rent, utilities and telephone 
charges).

drug stores, June 4, 2020, available at https://www.brc.com/2020/06/04/
blue-cross-increasing-reimbursements-independent-drug-stores/.

With the impact that this has across the industry, a question is often 
asked: how are PBMs able to do this? The answer is simple: their 
excessive market power enables them to unilaterally dictate 
reimbursement rates where pharmacy providers have essentially no choice 
but to accept them. As noted above (see, section 3, supra), over 80% of 
the covered lives in the United States are controlled by just five 
PBMs.\164\ In some markets, a single PBM could cover over 85% of the 
patients seen by a community oncology practice. As a result of this 
concentration, and the inability of patients to freely select their PBM 
(see, section 3, supra), being in network with each PBM network is 
critical.

            8.1  Who Is Impacted?
Ultimately, the substantial and unreasonable reduction in 
reimbursements creates a provider ``desert,'' making it impossible for 
them to stay in business because market share is shifted to PBMs. This 
turns patients into ``hot potatoes'' who are passed between different 
providers because no provider wants to fill medications at losses of 
hundreds of dollars, with scant guarantee of whether any of these 
downward prices are actually being passed on to plan sponsors.\165\ As 
vertically integrated models enable PBMs to dominate the pharmaceutical 
supply chain, community oncology practices are often forced to accept 
reimbursement below cost because patients have no other choice but to 
participate in a plan that chooses to use one of these PBMs to manage 
its pharmacy benefit.\166\ Ultimately, low-ball reimbursement harms the 
provider of choice for the patient, which in turns harms the well-being 
of patients.\167\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                8.1.1  Harm to Patients
As a result of low-ball reimbursements, patients are often forced to 
receive care only from pharmacy providers owned by or affiliated with 
PBMs, replete with conflicts of interest between patient care and costs 
of service. This has had disastrous consequences.

For one, it is well-established that provider participation in pharmacy 
networks will be decreased as a result of low-ball reimbursement, 
leaving patients with fewer choices for care.\168\ This, in turn, will 
lead to worse overall care (see, section 6, supra).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pharmacists Association, United States H. Subcomm. on Regulatory 
Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Hearing: Competition in the 
Pharmaceutical Supply Chain: The Proposed Merger of CVS Health and 
Aetna (February 27, 2018), available at http://www.ncpa.co/pdf/
judiciary-statement-on-cvs-aetna-merger.pdf.

Worse yet, this has the possibility of turning patients into ``hot 
potatoes,'' where even contracted specialty pharmacies (including ones 
owned by or affiliated with PBMs) refuse to fill a patient's 
prescription and risk losing money. Sadly, this was the experience of 
many patients in the immediate wake of the Express Scripts-Prime 
Therapeutics collaboration. In one particular example involving a Blue 
Cross Blue Shield of Alabama beneficiary (whose benefits processed 
under Prime Therapeutics), a provider attempted to fill a prescription 
for one of its patients but was unable to because of the unsustainable 
loss the below water reimbursement would have. Consequently, the 
provider had to attempt to transfer the patient's prescription to at 
least four different specialty pharmacies (including several PBM-owned 
or affiliated pharmacies), in order to finally find a pharmacy that was 
able to fill the medication (i.e., had access to the limited 
distribution drug), was contracted with the payer to be reimbursed for 
the prescription (i.e., held the Blue Cross Blue Shield Alabama 
Oncology Specialty Network contract), and was willing to accept the 
reimbursement (i.e., take a substantial loss on the prescription). 
After trying multiple pharmacies in four states, the patient was 
finally able to get their medication from a specialty pharmacy located 
several states away. The whole process took almost two weeks to fill 
the medication for the patient, causing the patient to run out of her 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
life-saving medication.

These low-ball reimbursement practices have not been limited to 
commercial plans. As yet another example of patients being ``hot 
potatoes'' with no regard for their well-being, within the TRICARE 
program, which was established by statute to provide health benefits 
coverage to active duty and retired military service members and their 
dependents, community oncology practices have reported per-fill losses 
of $500.00 on every prescription for Imbruvica (an oral oncolytic used 
to treat certain lymphomas and leukemias), $525.00 on every 
prescription for Jafaki (a common oral oncolytic used to treat certain 
bone marrow disorders), and $740.00 on every prescription for Alecensa 
(an oral oncolytic used to treat lung cancer). Community oncology 
practices have reported that over eighty percent of their TRICARE 
claims reimburse at or below cost, while those that reimburse above 
cost generally have a margin of less than one percent. As a result, 
this has caused veterans to become ``hot potatoes'' passed between 
pharmacy providers (even by PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies), who 
are unwilling to fill the medication at a loss.
                8.1.2  Harm to Plan Sponsors
As noted, any so-called benefits or savings are nebulous at best. In 
reality, vertically-integrated PBMs are able to take a ``loss'' at the 
pharmacy level, and make up for it by overcharging the plan sponsor. 
The anticompetitive nature of low-ball reimbursements further allows 
PBMs to receive ``off invoice'' discounts and manufacturer payments 
that help offset the low and under water reimbursement rates at the 
pharmacy level. For example, PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies can be 
willing to nominally ``accept'' the same reimbursement terms applicable 
to other pharmacy providers, but they are able to recoup those 
``losses'' by either obtaining discounts from the manufacturer in drug 
purchases (which are not passed through to the plan sponsor), or simply 
utilizing spread pricing which is where the PBM charges the plan 
sponsor an amount much higher than what is paid to the provider and 
pocketing the profits, or the ``spread,'' for itself (see, Section 10, 
infra). In a recent examples, patients and providers have studied 
Explanations of Benefits (EOBs) and identified instances where a PBM or 
health insurance company issued, in essence, two separate EOBs for the 
same claim: one to the provider and one to the patient. The EOBs 
transmitted to the provider showed the actual amounts being paid, while 
the one to the patient made it appear as though a much larger amount 
was being paid by the plan sponsor to the provider. In reality, PBM was 
simply keeping the difference. Thus, PBMs are using the plan sponsor's 
money to profit from driving independent pharmacy providers out of the 
marketplace. Ultimately, the fact that plan sponsors will not 
experience increased savings will lead to fewer pharmacy providers in 
the network, making it more difficult for plan sponsors to get fair 
terms in the future.\169\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                8.1.3  Harm to Providers
The harm of low-ball reimbursement to community oncology practices is 
self-evident. Each day, more and more community pharmacy providers go 
out of business due to negative margins as a result of reimbursements 
below the acquisition and dispensing costs of the prescriptions they 
provide to patients.\170\ Providers often times are not able to pick 
and choose which rates they will accept and which ones they will not. 
As a result, if providers challenge low-ball reimbursement at the 
initial contracting stage, PBMs will likely exclude the provider from 
the network. For community oncology practices, that means they would be 
unable to dispense oral chemotherapy to patients.\171\ Likewise, when 
providers have raised concerns about unsustainable reimbursement rates 
after agreeing to participate, they risk being immediately and 
summarily terminated without cause.\172\

For practices that choose to stay and accept the low-ball reimbursement 
rates, they experience a reduction in the ability to provide enhanced 
services and coordinate patient care, as a direct result of the 
underwater reimbursements.\173\ And when combined with the heightened 
credentialing standards necessary to even seek admission to these 
networks, providers face a veritable Catch-22 of having to choose 
between undertaking the high costs and extra workload of becoming 
accredited in order to participate in the network, only to then become 
unable to afford to perform the required services because of low 
reimbursement once admitted.\174\

            8.2  What Does the Law Say?
As in the case of restrictive networks and unreasonable barriers of 
entry (see, section 6, supra), federal and state Any Willing Provider 
laws can offer protection against low-ball reimbursement to the extent 
they require PBMs to offer participation on ``reasonable'' and 
``relevant'' terms and conditions. In this regard, as it relates to the 
federal Any Willing Provider law, CMS expressly recognized that 
unreasonably low reimbursement terms, which would include below water 
reimbursements, violate the federal Any Willing Provider law.\175\ This 
serves as a strong rebuke to low-ball reimbursement in the Medicare 
Part D space.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \175\ See, Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Manual, chapter 6, 
section 50.3; 42 CFR Sec. 423.505(b)(18).

Recognizing this as a growing problem in the private commercial 
insurance sector, many states have passed ``Fair Price Laws.'' For 
example, the recently enacted New Jersey law, codified at N.J.S.A. 
17b:27f-1 to -10, provide PBM pricing transparency and strengthen the 
rights of pharmacies to contest below-cost reimbursement. Likewise, 
Arkansas law prohibits PBMs from setting the price for certain generic 
medications below available pharmacy acquisition costs.\176\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \176\ Ark. Code Ann. Sec. 17-92-507(c)(4)(C)(iii).

Several unfair trade and unfair competition laws may also be implicated 
by a PBM's conduct of setting below water reimbursement to increase 
market share for its 
wholly-owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy. For example, under 
California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL), section 1702 of the 
California Business and Professions Code, known as the ``Unfair 
Competition Law'' or ``UCL,'' ``any person who engages, has engaged, or 
proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
of competent jurisdiction.''

Finally, to the extent such PBM's low-ball reimbursement is deemed to 
be seeking monopolization, Section II of the Sherman Antitrust Act may 
be implicated as well.\177\ The Sherman Act provides that it is 
unlawful to ``monopolize, or attempt to monopolize . . . any part of 
the trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign 
nations.''\178\ And further, in the context of state-level UCL claims, 
conduct may also be deemed to be ``unfair'' under the UCL if it is 
``conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or 
violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects 
are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise 
significantly threatens or harms competition.''\179\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            8.3  What Can Be Done?
Low-ball reimbursement has the potential to fundamentally and 
irreparably impact our health care system for years to come, and 
requires action at many levels:

     Legislative

        <ctr-circle>  Congress should enact federal legislation 
extending Medicare's Any Willing Provider requirements to the TRICARE 
program, requiring that terms and conditions be reasonable and 
relevant, and allow for private enforcement of these requirements.

        <ctr-circle>  States should enact Any Willing Provider Laws 
(where none currently exist) or amend existing Any Willing Provider 
laws to require that health insurance companies and PBMs allow all 
pharmacy providers (including community oncology practices) the right 
to participate in pharmacy networks based on ``reasonable and 
relevant'' terms and conditions, applicable to other similarly situated 
participating providers.

        <ctr-circle>  States should enact laws, like New Jersey's Fair 
Price law,\180\ requiring PBM pricing transparency and prohibiting 
below-cost reimbursement to pharmacies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \180\ N.J.S.A. Sec. 17b:27f-1 to -10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Regulatory

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should pursue complaints against Part D plan 
sponsors and contracted PBMs for unreasonably low reimbursement in 
violation of the federal Any Willing Provider Law and the Medicare Part 
D Drug Benefit Manual, seeking fines, Warning Letters, and injunctive 
relief.

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should issue regulation providing ``guard 
rails'' on what constitutes reasonable and relevant terms and 
conditions, and clarify that whether given terms are ``reasonable'' or 
``relevant'' can be adjudicated in a private contractual dispute 
between Part D plan sponsors/PBMs and pharmacies.

        <ctr-circle>  State Departments of Insurance should pursue 
complaints against PBMs and health insurers for violations of Any 
Willing Provider laws, stemming from efforts to constructively deny 
providers the right to participate in pharmacy networks based on 
unreasonably low, below cost reimbursement rates.

9 Mandatory White Bagging for Cancer Medications

A growing--and extremely concerning--trend that has emerged is the 
concept of mandatory ``white bagging'' of oncology medications that are 
administered in-office by community oncology practices.

``White bagging'' occurs where a physician writes and orders a 
particular medication for an in-office procedure, and rather than being 
sourced from the physician's medication inventory, a separate specialty 
pharmacy fills a prescription, and delivers the drug directly to the 
prescriber or clinic who retains the medication until the patient 
arrives at their office for administration.

Likewise, ``brown bagging,'' which is less common, involves a similar 
concept, except that instead of causing the prescription to be 
delivered directly to the community oncology practice, the specialty 
pharmacy dispenses the medication to the patient him or herself, who 
then brings the medications into their physicians' offices for 
administration in those settings.

In seeming unison, several health insurance companies (who 
coincidentally have integrated PBMs and specialty pharmacies) have 
begun to mandate that certain intravenous (IV) medications that were 
previously purchased by practices and administered in-office to 
patients, are now requiring that they be filled by the PBM-owned or 
affiliated specialty pharmacy through white or brown bagging. These are 
medications that historically have been administered in-office by 
community oncology practices and billed to patients' medical benefit 
(as opposed to their pharmacy benefit). Because these are IV 
medications, they cannot be self-administered by the patient, and still 
need to be infused by a health care provider. In essence, these payers 
(which include Anthem Blue Cross of California, Blue Cross Blue Shield 
of Tennessee, and Cigna) have mandated that cancer patients receive 
their chemotherapy through white or brown bagging, to be supplied by 
the payers' affiliated specialty pharmacy.

Each of these scenarios present immense concerns for patients, plan 
sponsors and providers alike. Community oncology practices note that 
white or brown bagging disrupts the chain of control of expensive 
cancer drugs; risking improper storage and handling of toxic 
substances; can unnecessarily cause delays in the onset of treatment; 
create waste when dosages are changed to, for example, manage adverse 
events; and places an administrative and liability burden on both 
patients with cancer and their oncologists.\181\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            9.1  Who Is Impacted?
                9.1.1  Harm to Patients
Patients stand to suffer the greatest as a result of payer and PBM 
mandatory white or brown bagging policies. Unlike instances where the 
community oncology practice sources the medication from its own 
inventory, the physician has no control over the sourcing, storage, 
preparation, or handling of the specialty oncology medications in white 
or brown bagging situations, and as a result, patients are exposed to 
potentially serious harm. The community oncology practice cannot 
guarantee the integrity and legitimacy of the products being provided 
by the PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacy, especially as it relates to 
the shipment and delivery from the specialty pharmacy to the practice. 
``The difficulties that white bagging policies place on cancer patients 
are a prime example of the potential harm.''\182\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \182\ https://www.aha.org/white-papers/2021-03-08-health-insurer-
specialty-pharmacy-policies-threaten-patient-quality-care.

When medications do not follow the typical chain of custody, the 
integrity and safety of the medication cannot be guaranteed. When a 
community oncology practice sources a medication from its wholesaler to 
be infused in a patient, the community oncology provider is given a 
Transaction Report or ``T3'' that details every single transaction 
involving that medication, going all the way up to the manufacturer 
that made it. This ensures proper pedigree at each stage along the way. 
When the practice receives the drug as a white bag from a PBM-owned 
specialty pharmacy, it is not provided with that information. Worse 
yet, it has no control or insight into how the specialty pharmacy is 
handling that product, or how it ensured stability and integrity during 
the delivery process. This provides risks for patients receiving 
medications of unknown integrity, where chain of custody cannot be 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
guaranteed.

Patients also stand to be impacted by excessive delays and unnecessary 
burdens from white bagging when forced to receive their cancer and 
related treatments from PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies (as compared 
to when the community oncology practice sources products from its own 
inventory for in-office administration). Delays in receiving the 
medication past an anticipated date are commonly caused by a variety of 
factors, including failed delivery, incorrect medications being 
delivered, medications shipped to the wrong address, prior 
authorization issues, out of stock medications, etc. When medications 
are sourced from the community oncology practice, issues such as drug 
shortages can be identified right away, and adjustments made. Requiring 
that the prescription be sent to and filled by a PBM-owned or 
affiliated specialty pharmacy can cause confusion and the potential for 
missed treatment doses.

Finally, patients may be subject to higher out-of-pocket liability when 
prescriptions are ``white bagged'' for in-office administration. In 
addition to having to pay the copayment or coinsurance for the 
administration procedure, patients will also be responsible for a 
separate copayment from the pharmacy associated with the dispensed drug 
product. Required use of the PBM-owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy 
means that ``reimbursement comes not from a patient's medical benefit 
but from the pharmacy benefit, and that can mean higher out-of-pocket 
costs for patients,''\183\ as pharmacy benefit copays are typically 
higher than copays under the medical benefit. Moreover, because PBM-
owned or affiliated pharmacies will require patients to have paid for 
drugs before they are shipped, this can interrupt critical treatment if 
patients cannot afford to pay for the therapies (a problem that is only 
exacerbated if the PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacy does not assist the 
patient in qualifying for payment assistance programs to help meet 
their cost-sharing obligations, which few do).\184\

creates-extra-steps-for-oncology-practices.

Alternatively, even when everything goes ``smoothly,'' waste can result 
if extenuating life circumstances cause a treatment plan to be adjusted 
or an appointment to be rescheduled and the pre-provided ``white 
bagged'' medication will not still be good by the time the appointment 
is rescheduled. This would not occur if the community oncology practice 
were able to simply source the medication from its own inventory at the 
time of the patient's visit.
                9.1.2  Harm to Plan Sponsors
The greatest harm to health care payers stemming from mandatory white 
bagging is in the form of excess drug waste. When a physician utilizes 
drugs the community oncology practice has on hand in its inventory, the 
physician is able to quickly and efficiently address patient care real 
time and avoid waste. Oncology regimens are complex and often require 
dosing adjustments at the time of administration or therapy 
cancellation depending on the patient's laboratory results, scans, and 
other clinical considerations, such as shifts in the patient's 
weight.\185\ When utilizing medications from the onsite inventory, 
physicians are able to make these changes at the time of administration 
without any delays or risk of waste (they can simply select a different 
medication or dose off the shelf). However, the same cannot be said if 
the medications are supplied by PBM-owned or affiliated specialty

Pharmacy. J NCCN Network.

Under white bagging mandates, the physician is required to write a 
``prescription'' and send it to the PBM's wholly-owned or affiliated 
specialty pharmacy to be filled. Circumstances requiring dosing 
adjustments or therapy cancellation could occur in the time between 
when an ``order'' is written by the physician, and when the medication 
is received from a specialty pharmacy. Moreover, once the prescription 
has a patient-specific label, it cannot be returned to stock, unlike 
products kept within the practice's inventory for in-office 
administration. As a result, the entire medication would essentially go 
to waste, costing the plan sponsor and patient potentially thousands of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
dollars.

Moreover, plan sponsors face a great risk of being double billed when 
PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacies bill separately for the drug 
product, while community oncology practices bill for the procedures and 
supplies associated with in-office administration. When a community 
oncology practice submits a claim to an insurer for in-office 
administration of a drug to its patient, it typically submits a CPT 
Code for the professional services associated with the administration 
(e.g., CPT 96413), as well as a J-Code for the medication (e.g., J9271 
in the case of Keytruda). CPT Code 96413 corresponds with 
``Chemotherapy administration, intravenous infusion technique, up to 
one hour, single or initial substance.'' Thus, when submitting claims 
in this manner, the physician receives his or her fee for the 
professional services associated with mixing the drug and administering 
it to the patient but is also reimbursed for the costs of the 
medication, the diluents, the supplies, the tubing, as well as the 
associated overhead.

At the same time, when the PBM-owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy 
uses an NDC number to bill the patient's PBM, the pharmacy may also be 
billing (and receiving reimbursement) for overlapping products/services 
(which it is not actually providing or performing). Many PBM contracts 
prohibit pharmacies from dispensing medications in their unfinished 
form, and prohibit billing medications that require reconstitution 
(e.g., injectable medications) as compounds (suggesting that 
reimbursement for the diluent and other supplies necessary for 
administration are included within the total payment).

In addition, many PBMs pay a ``dispensing fee'' on all claims in 
addition to the reimbursement for the drug, which is intended to cover 
costs that are incurred at the point of sale in excess of the 
ingredient cost of the drug, including the ``measurement or mixing of 
the drug,'' ``filling the container,'' physically providing the 
completed prescription to the patient, ``delivery,'' ``special 
packaging,'' ``salaries of [workers],'' ``costs associated with 
maintaining the [ ] facility and acquiring and maintaining technology 
and equipment necessary to operate the [ ] facility.''\186\ While the 
wholly-owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy that is white bagging 
will be selecting the product, processing the claim, and causing 
delivery to the practice, many of these items for which the wholly-
owned or affiliated specialty pharmacy will be receiving reimbursement 
are actually tasks that will ultimately be completed by the community 
oncology practice. The community oncology practice will continue to be 
responsible for mixing the drug, procuring the diluent and other 
necessary supplies, and physically administering the medication to the 
patient. Thus, this has the risk of the wholly-owned or affiliated 
specialty pharmacy being paid by the patient's PBM for the same 
services that are also being reimbursed by the plan sponsor to the 
community oncology practice (and which in fact are being performed and 
provided by the practice).

                9.1.3 Harm to Providers
Finally, the greatest harm to community oncology practices stemming 
from mandated white bagging are increased, unfunded administrative 
burdens, along with increased legal liability which the providers have 
no choice but to accept. Community oncology practices are faced with 
increased administrative burdens as they are expected to undertake all 
work associated with preparing, diluting, and administering the drug, 
without being able to seek reimbursement for the medication 
itself.\187\ When medications are white bagged, they typically come in 
the original manufacturer vials. Apart from the added burdens of 
storing the products and maintaining them in a separate inventory 
(since they are patient-specific), in order to be administered to the 
patient, the products must also be mixed by the practice's staff and 
placed into a bag to be infused intravenously. In many instances, IV 
chemotherapy products are combined with other drug products, as 
physicians often order a ``cocktail'' of different drugs and therapies 
that must be taken in concert. Community oncology practices have to 
perform these services, despite the fact that they are not being 
reimbursed for the drug itself. This burden is only exacerbated when 
the physician makes changes or amendments to the treatment, often after 
the prescription has been written, but closer in time to when the 
patient is receiving care. Because the prescription has already been 
filled and provided by the specialty pharmacy, the practice's staff 
must engage in extra work to remedy the problem.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \187\ See, Drug Table at Transmittal 10, Chapter 17 of the attached 
Medicare Claims Processing Manual--Payment Rules for Drugs and 
Biologicals; Commun Oncol 2005; 2:173-181.

In addition, and more concerningly, community oncology practices face 
additional liability for their part in prescribing and administering 
drugs received from outside pharmacies. In October 2012, 64 people died 
and over 700 people became sick as a result of contaminated compounded 
steroid injections supplied by New England Compounding Center (NECC). 
The medications had been ordered by physicians for in-office 
administration to their patients in clinics and surgery centers. 
However, due to unsanitary conditions at the pharmacy, several batches 
of the medications had become tainted with fungus, causing many 
patients to develop fungal meningitis and become seriously ill or die. 
In the wake of this, dozens of lawsuits (including multiple class 
actions) were filed against not only the pharmacy, but also the 
clinics, surgery centers and underlying physicians. Under current white 
bagging mandates, community oncology practices are forced to accept 
this additional risk and exposure, as ``the primary onus for patient 
safety remains with providers despite [PBMs and] health plans stripping 
those providers of their control over the quality and handling of drug 
therapies.''\188\ With white bagging, practices no longer control the 
acquisition of these medications, and as drug therapies become more 
complex, thereby requiring additional resources and focus in storing, 
mixing, compounding and administering the products, they are bearing an 
inappropriate share of the risks.\189\

            9.2 What Does the Law Say?
In April 2018, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy issued a 
report entitled ``White and Brown Bagging: Emerging Practices, Emerging 
Regulation.''\190\ The report concluded that while ``the terms and 
conditions of this business model are most often set by third-party 
payers,'' issues regarding authenticity and integrity of the drug and 
adverse patient outcomes are left to the state boards of pharmacy to 
grapple with in an effort to protect the public. As such, some state 
boards (e.g., Massachusetts)\191\ have specifically prohibited these 
practices, under various provisions such as ``re-dispensing of 
medication'' or handling hazardous drugs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \190\ National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. White and Brown 
Bagging Emerging Practices, Emerging Regulation. April 2018.
    \191\ 247 CMR 9.01(4)(5)(6). ``Unless otherwise permitted by law, a 
licensee shall not re-dispense any medication which has been previously 
dispensed.'' ``Unless otherwise permitted by law or regulation, a 
licensee may not accept, store, dispense, package, label or compound 
any medication that was previously processed or dispensed by another 
pharmacy.''

On the state level, several state legislatures have either prohibited 
or allowed white and brown bagging practices. For example, Texas, 
Minnesota, and New York (Medicaid) have prohibited one or both of these 
practices. Other states like California, have laws that require health 
plans to demonstrate that their medical decisions are ``unhindered by 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
fiscal and administrative management.''

At the same time, many states' laws may bear directly on arrangements 
mandating that community oncology practices write prescriptions and 
send them to PBM-
designated specialty pharmacies. For example, many states have ``Anti-
Patient Steering'' laws, which generally prohibit health care providers 
from agreeing to prescriptions to a particular pharmacy. As an example, 
New Jersey law provides that ``[i]t shall be unlawful for a pharmacist 
to enter into an arrangement with a health care practitioner, or any 
institution, facility or entity that provides health care services, for 
the purposes of directing or diverting patients to or from a specified 
pharmacy or restraining in any way a patient's freedom of choice to 
select a pharmacy.''\192\ As another example, Georgia law likewise 
specifically prohibits pharmacies from presenting (and prohibits 
pharmacy benefits managers from paying) claims for reimbursement that 
were received pursuant to a referral from an affiliated PBM.\193\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            9.3 What Can Be Done?
Mandatory white bagging harms both patients and plans sponsors, while 
increasing liability to community oncology practices, and requires a 
response at many levels:

     Legislative

        <ctr-circle>  States should enact laws prohibiting payer-
mandated white bagging for community oncology practices and allow 
patients to receive their in-office oncology medications from their 
treating oncologist.

     Regulatory

        <ctr-circle>  State Boards of Pharmacy should adopt regulations 
requiring pharmacies that fill prescriptions for white bagging obtain 
written consent from the physician's office prior to dispensing the 
medication, and have policies and procedures in place that (i) track 
and assure security and accuracy of delivery for dispensed 
prescriptions until they are administered to the patient; (ii) provide 
for counseling to patients who are administered white bagged products; 
(iii) address the return of any prescription medications not delivered 
or administered to the patient; (iv) assure the confidentiality of 
patient information; (v) obtain consent from the patient for using such 
a delivery process through white bagging; and (vi) provide lowest 
number of vials wherever possible, so as to avoid excess closed-system-
transfer requirements and potential USP <800> exposures.

     Practical Considerations

        <ctr-circle>  Pharmacies providing white bagged medication 
should be required to assume all liability associated with the 
applicable medications/prescriptions and defend/indemnify health care 
providers who accept white bagged medications.

     Plan Sponsor Action

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors should demand that health plans 
allow patients to continue to receive administered IV chemotherapy 
medication provided by their community oncology practice of choice.

10  Spread Pricing and Middleman Profits

Spread pricing occurs when PBMs charge plan sponsors one price for the 
cost of a patient's drug, while on the other side of the transaction, 
reimbursing the dispensing community oncology practice or pharmacy at a 
lower rate, while pocketing the difference, or the ``spread,'' for 
themselves.\194\ It is the classic case of the middleman mark up, but 
played out in a massive and extraordinarily opaque scale. This practice 
has recently come to light in the Medicaid context, where PBMs manage 
benefits for state Medicaid MCOs, and where state governments have 
uncovered immense spreads in drug claims for Medicaid 
beneficiaries.\195\ Ultimately, spread pricing practices reveal how 
PBMs are vertically integrated enterprises that control vast swathes of 
the drug supply chain create an anti-competitive marketplace, 
ultimately driving up the cost of drugs to public health programs and, 
ultimately, to patients themselves.

            10.1 Who Is Impacted?
                10.1.1 Harm to Patients
Spread pricing harms patients by increasing premiums and drug 
prices.\196\ As with many other PBM pricing strategies, spread pricing 
has the perverse tendency to drive drug prices up as the higher the 
overall drug cost is, the greater opportunity for the PBM to earn a 
larger spread. In addition, because pricing strategies put in place by 
PBMs that are not equitable or uniform across different drugs, and 
perverse financial incentives can be created, putting patients at risk 
of having pharmacy providers prioritize certain patients with certain 
disease states over others based on the arbitrary profitability that a 
PBM applies to the therapy.\197\ Finally, in the context of generic 
drugs, where patients expect to realize the greatest pricing relief, 
spread pricing artificially increases the cost of such drugs, thus 
negating such price relief.\198\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                10.1.2 Harm to Plan Sponsors
Plan sponsors, and in particular, state Medicaid programs, have been 
immensely harmed in the inflated prices they--and ultimately the 
taxpayers--have paid to PBMs because of spread pricing. Ohio was one of 
the first states to audit PBMs after a Columbus Dispatch expose 
revealed the extent of spread pricing in the state's Medicaid 
program.\199\ Shortly after the news broke, the Ohio Department of 
Medicaid released a summary of its spread pricing analysis which showed 
PBMs grabbing $223.7 million in hidden pricing spreads within the 
Medicaid managed care program from Q2 2017 to Q1 2018, accounting for 
8.8% of overall (pre-rebate) spending on prescription drugs.\200\

The Ohio revelations have led to other states and the federal 
government investigating spread pricing practices within their states, 
as well as independent efforts. State government work in Kentucky, 
Georgia, Virginia, and Maryland has definitively quantified spread in 
their states' Medicaid programs, while 3Axis Advisors--an independent 
pharmaceutical policy think tank--has uncovered evidence of spread 
pricing in New York, Illinois, Michigan and, notably, a 200-page report 
on spread pricing in the Florida Medicaid program.\201\

                10.1.3 Harm to Providers
Finally, spread pricing has a direct impact on providers, who rely on 
adequate reimbursement to serve Medicaid patients. In Ohio, the same 
state to expose $223.7 million in excess charges through spread 
pricing, many independent pharmacies were reporting such severe loses 
on Medicaid prescriptions that it made it virtually impossible to 
continue to participate in the program.\202\ The exposure of these 
abuses led Ohio Medicaid to require certain PBMs, including CVS 
Caremark, to increase the amount of reimbursements being paid to 
independent providers (who up until that point, were pocketing the 
immense spreads).\203\

            10.2 What Does the Law Say?
Given the perverse impact of spread pricing upon patients, payers, and 
providers, CMS' Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) 
managed care's final rule \204\ adopted standards for the calculation 
of Medical Loss Ratios (MLRs).\205\ More specifically, the final rule 
clarified that spread pricing must be reported and included in the 
calculation of MLRs, which represents the percent of premium revenue 
that goes toward actual claims and activities that improve health care 
quality, as opposed to administrative costs and profits. CMS 
regulations require Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans to report a 
MLR and use and MLR target of 85 percent in developing rates.

A number of states have implemented measures to prevent PBMs from 
utilizing spread pricing schemes when contracting with state Medicaid 
managed care plans. For example, Ohio Medicaid directed its five 
managed care plans to terminate contracts with PBMs with spread pricing 
model and enter into new contracts with PBMs with transparent ``pass-
through'' model in 2018.\206\ In similar vein, Nevada has enacted 
transparency bill specifying that a PBM has a fiduciary duty to a third 
party that contracts with the PBM for pharmacy benefit management 
services and must notify the third party in writing of any activity, 
policy, or practice of the PBM that creates a conflict of interest that 
interferes with the PBM's ability to discharge its fiduciary duty.\207\ 
New York is also planning to no longer use PBMs and instead, to use fee 
for service to pay for its prescription drugs.\208\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            10.3 What Can Be Done?
The practice of spread pricing by PBMs has recently become an area of 
focus for plan sponsors seeking to reign in PBM abuses and reduce 
costs. Potential solutions to spread pricing include:

     Legislation

        <ctr-circle>  Congress should enact federal legislation that 
would require pass-through pricing for covered outpatient drug 
prescriptions in Medicare Part D and in Medicaid (including managed 
care).

        <ctr-circle>  States should enact laws like the Nevada law 
requiring PBMs to be fiduciaries to plan sponsors (i.e., PBMs must act 
in the plan sponsors' interests) and providing plan sponsors with a 
cause of action against PBMs if they utilize opaque pricing not in the 
plan sponsors' best interest or favor the PBMs' wholly-owned or 
affiliated pharmacies over independent pharmacies or community oncology 
practices, if this would ultimately be detrimental to the plan 
sponsors.

        <ctr-circle>  States should enact laws requiring PBMs to report 
drug costs charged to and paid by plan sponsors and disclosure of such 
reports to providers.

     Regulatory

        <ctr-circle>  Like in Ohio, state regulators should take 
immediate action, where such action is permitted under enabling 
statutes, to prevent state Medicaid plans from contracting with PBMs 
using spread pricing methodology.

        <ctr-circle>  The FTC should enhance oversight and revise 
antitrust guidance defining impermissible vertical integration 
structures which could, at the very least, curb the most blatant PBM 
anti-competitive behavior.

     Plan Sponsor Action

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors should implement robust Request for 
Proposal procedure to select transparent PBMs.

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors should review and negotiate 
transparent contract terms including, without limitation, an exclusive 
pricing benchmark.

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors should require PBMs to provide 
reporting of reimbursements paid to the pharmacies on pharmacy claims 
and the corresponding charges made to the plan sponsor.

11 Copay Accumulators and Maximizers

The increased prevalence of high deductible health plans or plans 
involving patient coinsurance \209\ has left more and more Americans 
finding themselves with significant annual out-of-pocket copayments, 
coinsurance obligations or deductibles for their medications. Many 
patients struggle to meet their deductible and pay the copays for the 
high-cost drugs they need to treat serious, sometimes life-threatening, 
illnesses like cancer. In a study published in the Journal of Clinical 
Oncology, the researchers found that drug abandonment and adherence 
problems are increasingly prevalent in patients prescribed an oral 
cancer medication due to higher out-of-
pocket costs.\210\ To help offset these costs--especially in the 
oncology space, where copayments can range in the thousands of 
dollars--many drug manufacturers have created copay discount cards to 
reduce the net out-of-pocket amount to a figure that is affordable to 
many patients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \209\ https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/benefits/
pages/high-deductible-plans-more-common-but-so-are-choices.aspx.
    \210\ Association of Patient Out-of-Pocket Costs With Prescription 
Abandonment and Delay in Fills of Novel Oral Anticancer Agents, Jalpa 
A. Doshi, Pengxiang Li, Hairong Huo, Amy R. Pettit, and Katrina A. 
Armstrong, Journal of Clinical Oncology 2018 36:5, 476-482.

However, beginning in 2018, several large insurance companies and PBMs 
began to implement a nefarious new set of schemes called ``copay 
accumulator programs.'' Copay accumulator programs restrict 
manufacturer contributions to copay discount cards from being applied 
to patients' annual deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums.\211\ 
Normally, the contributions from the drug manufacturer's copay card 
would not only help offset the patient's copay at the point-of-sale but 
would count toward fulfilling the patient's out-of-pocket obligations 
(i.e., the deductible). Thus, after several fills of a high-cost 
specialty medication, the deductible would be exhausted, and the 
patient's out-of-pocket would be lowered to an affordable amount. This 
is important, because many drug manufacturers' copay coupon programs 
have annual limits or caps, preventing patients from receiving 
unlimited copayment assistance. Without copay accumulator programs, 
patients are able to afford their prescriptions throughout the whole 
year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \211\ https://spondylitis.org/spondylitis-plus/copay-accumulator-
programs-what-they-are-and-how-they-might-impact-your-out-of-pocket-
costs/.

Conversely, when a copay accumulator program is implemented, the 
amounts of the patient's copay that have been funded by a drug company 
(through a copay coupon program) no longer count towards the patient's 
out-of-pocket limits. The result is that, after the patient exhausts 
the benefits from the manufacturer's copay coupon program, the patient 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
is still left with excessively high copayment obligations.

The financial impact of copay accumulator programs is demonstrated well 
in an example. Consider an example where a patient is prescribed a drug 
that costs $36,000 per year, or $3,000 per month. The patient obtains a 
copay coupon card from the drug's manufacturer, with an assistance 
limit of $12,000 per year. The patient's benefit plan has a $3,000 
deductible and, after the deductible has been met, a monthly copay of 
$500.\212\ Without the copay accumulator program, the drug manufacturer 
would cover the $3,000 deductible in month one (January), and $500 per 
month each month thereafter. The patient would never run out of 
benefits under the copay coupon program, and would never be saddled 
with excessive out-of-pocket costs, significantly reducing the risk of 
therapy abandonment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \212\ https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/coupon-
accumulators-and-coupon-maximizers-explained.

With the copay accumulator program in place, however, the patient would 
use the copay coupon to cover the monthly drug costs in months one 
through four (i.e., January through April), and would have no out-of-
pocket expenses during those first 4 months of the year. However, 
because the copay accumulator program would prevent the amounts 
received through the coupon from applying toward cost-sharing 
requirements, the patient would still be required to pay the full 
deductible amount ($3,000) in month five (May), and monthly copays of 
$500 per month thereafter. In essence, the maximum benefits under the 
copay coupon program would have been exhausted at the end of April 
(having funded $3,000 per month).\213\ Here, when the patient is now 
saddled with a $3,000 bill to continue therapy he or she has been on 
for four months, there is tremendous risk of therapy abandonment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These programs have been called a variety of things by different 
entities, including ``Out-of-Pocket Protection Programs'' (Express 
Scripts), ``True Accumulation'' (CVS Caremark), and ``Coupon 
Adjustment: Benefit Plan Protection Program'' (UnitedHealthcare).\214\ 
However, the main thrust has been to place financial roadblock in the 
way of patients receiving necessary care, with dubious savings being 
realized by plan sponsors.

Another related concept that has emerged in response to the negative 
patient impact from accumulators is that of ``copay maximizer 
programs.'' Like copay accumulator programs, copay maximizer programs 
are designed to allow payers to ``extract the full value of the 
manufacturer's copay support,''\215\ but in reality, swap the 
``financial cliff'' that the patients face under accumulator programs, 
in favor of a slow and steady drain of resources, without any marked 
benefits to the patient.

scripts-rely-on.html.

For example, assume again a situation where a patient is prescribed a 
drug that costs $36,000 per year, and there is a manufacturer-sponsored 
copay coupon with an assistance limit of $12,000 per year (or $1,000 
per month). In the context of a copay maximizer, the patient will still 
have a deductible of $3,000, but instead of a standard copay, the plan 
will set the monthly copay to slightly more than the coupon's value, 
to, say, $1,200 per month. Each month, the patient will be responsible 
for $200 out-of-pocket (the difference between what is covered by the 
copay coupon and the set copay amount).\216\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \216\ https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/coupon-
accumulators-and-coupon-maximizers-explained.

Worse yet, to the extent maximizer programs do actually deliver copay 
savings to the patient, it invariably comes with underhanded 
restrictions, obligating the patient to obtain the prescription 
exclusively from the PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacy, and allowing PBM 
subsidiaries to reap additional revenue.\217\ PBMs have created 
``secretive and independent private companies'' to operate these 
specialty drug maximizer programs, who sometimes take fees equal to 25% 
of the manufacturer's copay support program.\218\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

drug-channels/.
    \218\ https://www.drugchannels.net/2020/05/why-do-cvs-and-express-
scripts-rely-on.html.

In each of these scenarios, however, the patient is either forced to go 
over the ``financial cliff'' in the middle of the year (when their 
copays skyrocket) and risk drug abandonment, or is forced to utilize a 
PBM-owned or affiliated pharmacy with limited real financial benefits 
(or face exorbitant out-of-pocket costs).
            11.1 Who Is Impacted?
Copay accumulator and maximizer programs have clear negative impact on 
all stakeholders.
                11.1.1 Harm to Patients
The harm of copay accumulators and maximizer programs is felt most 
acutely by patients--especially cancer patients. Unlike instances where 
there might be lower cost generics available to be used as alternatives 
when a brand manufacturer's copay coupon benefits expire, there are no 
alternatives for the high-priced oncology medications, and when 
manufacturer copay coupon programs run out as a result of copay 
accumulator programs, ``the individuals who need assistance the most 
will be unable to receive it, and will end up paying more for their 
treatments.''\219\

``This poses an adverse impact on adherence to medication regimens, 
especially when a support mechanism is not in place.''\220\ Studies 
have shown that patients impacted by copay accumulator programs fill 
their prescription 1.5 fewer times than patients who are not 
impacted.\221\ More critically, data has shown that patients impacted 
by copay accumulator programs have experienced a 13% drop in 
adherence--that is, they've fallen off therapy--between month 3 and 
month 4 of a plan year (coinciding with when they reach the annual cap 
for manufacturer-sponsored copay coupon programs).\222\ This is 
significant as over 75% of impacted patients have said that their 
adherence will suffer as a result of these programs.\223\

These findings and observations of direct patient harm have been backed 
up by literature. In a study published in the American Journal of 
Managed Care, the authors found that after the implementation of copay 
accumulator programs, Health Savings Account patients on certain high-
cost specialty drugs had ``significantly lower monthly fill rates, 
higher risk of discontinuation, and lower [percentage of days 
covered],'' suggesting that copay accumulator programs have ``the 
potential to negatively affect specialty drug use.''\224\ This rings 
true in the cancer context as well. According to a study in the Journal 
of Clinical Oncology, nearly half of patients with cancer abandon their 
prescriptions when out-of-pocket costs reach $2,000.\225\ Nonadherence 
can have dire consequences to patients, and accounts for 10% of 
hospitalizations and 125,000 deaths each year.\226\

Perhaps the best evidence of patient harm is the stories from the 
patients themselves. In one instance, a nurse case manager from Ohio 
with multiple sclerosis had long managed her disease with medications, 
and was able to afford them through copay coupon programs.\227\ 
However, in May 2018, she discovered that her health plan had instated 
a copay accumulator program, that required her to pay $3,600 per month 
for her prescription drugs until she met an $8,800 deductible, forcing 
her to consider rationing her medication that allowed her to function 
in her daily life.\228\ In another well-publicized incident, a 27-year-
old hemophilia patient had been able to afford the $38,000 for his 
maintenance drugs with the assistance of manufacturer copay coupon 
programs.\229\ However, once his health plan instituted a copay 
accumulator program, he was unable to afford the $6,350 
deductible.\230\ As a result of his immediate and unforeseen inability 
to afford the medications, he was left with untreated bleeds, resulting 
in internal bleeding, and needing additional surgeries to correct.\231\ 
``The patient has been in and out of the hospital, is currently in a 
wheelchair, and is not working, all at a cost of $3.5 million.''\232\

One of perhaps the most sinister aspects of copay accumulator and 
maximizer programs for patients is the overall lack of transparency. 
These programs lack any semblance of transparency, and are ``often 
implemented without a patient's knowledge or full understanding of 
their new `benefit.' ''\233\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \233\ https://www.asco.org/sites/new-www.asco.org/files/content-

Ultimately, because patient receiving medications that have lower-cost 
generic products have the ability to switch to such generic products in 
the face of copay accumulator and maximizer programs, it is the sickest 
patients requiring the highest-priced drugs that are most egregiously 
affected by these programs, and are in essence ``subsidizing the 
patients who are adequately served by lower-cost pharmaceuticals that 
have low or no copays.''\234\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

communications/copay-maximizers-have-murky-financial-implications-says-
drug-channels/.

                11.1.2 Harm to Plan Sponsors
When the PBMs created and rolled out copay accumulator programs, they 
were billed as a cost savings tool for plans sponsors, such as 
employers. In theory, it does make sense when applied to high-cost 
branded medications, when a lower-cost, equally effective generic 
product is available. These programs counteract manufacturer efforts to 
retain market share for brand drugs once generics have become 
available, and further the interests of pushing patients to lower cost 
alternatives. However, in the oncology space, cancer care is for life 
saving treatment and does not have the same risks of 
``overutilization,'' nor are there cheaper alternatives available.

Instead, the result of copay accumulator or maximizer programs is that 
the harms and additional costs to plan sponsors caused by drug 
abandonment and non-
adherence will far outweigh any potential savings to be gained from 
them. From increased hospitalizations, additional treatments, and more 
catastrophic care, it is well-established that plan sponsors save money 
when patients stay adherent to the drugs they are prescribed. This is 
especially true in the cancer context, where studies have suggested 
that the increased plan costs caused by non-adherence due to copay 
accumulator programs was more than double than that of all other 
disease groups.\235\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \235\ Cutler, R.L., Fernandez-Llimos, F., Frommer, M., Benrimoj, 
C., and Garcia-Cardenas, V. (2018). Economic impact of medication non-
adherence by disease groups: A systematic review. BMJ open, 8(1), 
e016982. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016982.

Worse yet, many employers and plan sponsors do not even know what they 
are getting or whether such programs have been instituted. While nearly 
20% of commercial medical insurance policies sold in 2018 will have 
copay accumulator/maximizer programs built in, ``most employers who 
have purchased/are purchasing these plans are unaware these programs 
are present in the coverage'' and ``have no idea how it will adversely 
affect their employees' care.''\236\ This is especially alarming 
considering the secretive operations of copay maximizer programs, where 
the prescription is typically required to be filled at the PBM-owned or 
affiliated pharmacy, and related or affiliated companies take up to 25% 
of the copayment assistance made available by the manufacturer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \236\ Who's Stealing My Savings?, by Peter Pitts, January 4, 2018.

For example, with Express Scripts' SaveonSP program, a commercial plan 
sponsor declares specialty drugs to be ``non-essential health 
benefits,'' making them covered by the plan, but not subject to out-of-
pocket maximums mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\237\ In turn, the 
patients' out-of-pocket costs are set to the maximum annual value of a 
manufacturer's copay coupon program.\238\ ``For instance, a program 
with a total value of $20,000 in copayment support would require a 
patient to pay $20,000 annually for their drugs, without regard to the 
plan's out-of-pocket maximums.''\239\ Thereafter, to avoid these 
inflated costs, the beneficiaries must enroll separately in the 
SaveonSP program, and have their prescriptions filled exclusively by 
Express Scripts' Accredo specialty pharmacy.\240\ SaveonSP then charges 
a fee equal to 25% of the copayment support, or $5,000 in the above 
example.\241\ This is in addition to the profit generated by Express 
Scripts' wholly-owned pharmacy by filling the prescription.\242\

Ultimately, while copay accumulator and maximizer programs might seem 
like a good short-term solution, the devil is in the details, and in 
reality, these programs will ultimately increase costs for plan 
sponsors in the long run, including increased hospitalizations, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
additional care, and overall increases to drug prices.

                11.1.3 Harm to Providers
Finally, community oncology practices are harmed by manipulative copay 
accumulator and maximizer practices as well. When physicians prescribe 
a particular oncology treatment to be dispensed out of the community 
oncology practice, they undertake a ``difficult and time-consuming 
process'' involved in finding financial assistance for their 
patients.\243\ This includes finding manufacturer-sponsored copay 
coupon programs, providing resources to patients, and potentially 
providing supporting documentation to these programs. The copay 
accumulator and maximizer programs will add additional complexities in 
the patient coverage process and will only increase ``the 
administrative burden on practice staff, who will now need to 
understand the nuances of co-pay accumulators and maximizers; as well 
as help explain to patients why some of the assistance is not helping 
them to reach their deductible.''\244\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \243\ https://www.asco.org/sites/new-www.asco.org/files/content-

    \244\ https://www.asco.org/sites/new-www.asco.org/files/content-
files/advocacy-and-policy/documents/2019-AccumulatorsPolicyBrief.pdf.

In addition, community oncology practices are further impacted when 
their patients discontinue prescribed therapy due to cost. Many 
community oncology practices are contracted with payers under value-
based arrangements, where they take responsibility--and sometimes 
risk--for the outcomes of patients. If a patient stops taking his or 
her therapy once the copay coupon program is exhausted, that patient 
may wind up in the hospital or needing additional care. This will in 
turn negatively impact community oncology practices' performance under 
value-based contracts.
            11.2 What Does the Law Say?
Federal statutory law is silent on the issue of copay accumulator and 
maximizer programs.

However, in 2019, HHS finalized the Notice of Benefit and Payment 
Parameters for 2020 (NBPP 2020), which only allowed health plans to 
implement copay accumulator programs when both a brand and generic 
medication were available. In essence, this would have allowed plans to 
steer patients to less costly, generic medications when possible, but 
would provide protections for patients--including cancer patients--who 
did not have access to alternative, less costly medications.\245\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \245\ https://aimedalliance.org/hhs-allows-plans-to-implement-

medication%20were%20available.&text=It%20limits%20patients'%20access%20t
o,costs%20to%20
the%20health%20system.

However, on May 7, 2020, HHS released its Notice of Benefit and Payment 
Parameters for 2021 Final Rule, which clarified certain confusion 
created by different agencies' guidance, and now allows health plans to 
implement copay accumulator programs regardless of whether or not a 
generic alternative is available. When patients cannot afford their 
medications, they may rely on copay assistance (i.e., coupon cards from 
drug manufacturers). These coupon cards not only contribute toward the 
patient's copay but also count toward the patient's annual 
deductible.\246\ Thus, as of July 30, 2020, HHS has not only allowed 
health plans to implement these programs but has removed key 
protections for cancer patients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \246\ See, 45 CFR Sec. 156.130(h); https://www.federalregister.gov/
documents/2020/05/14/2020-10045/patient-protection-and-affordable-care-
act-hhs-notice-of-benefit-and-payment-parameters-for-2021.

Fortunately, however, several states have enacted their own laws 
governing copay accumulators (importantly, in NBPP 2021, HHS explicitly 
stated that the Final Rule does not preempt state laws that govern the 
use of copay accumulator programs in state-regulated health plans). At 
this time, four states (Illinois, West Virginia, Virginia, and Arizona) 
have enacted copay accumulator legislation. While these apply to state-
regulated plans (and not to Exchange-based health plans), they provide 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
protection against certain PBM conduct.

For example, Virginia Statute Sec. 38.2-3407.20 requires health plans 
to include any amount paid by or on behalf of a plan enrollee when 
calculating an enrollee's overall contribution to any out-of-pocket 
maximum or any cost-sharing requirement to the extent permitted by 
federal law and regulation. Likewise, in Illinois, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat. 
Ann. 134/30 requires health plans to apply any contributions (i.e., 
third-party payments, financial assistance, discount, product vouchers, 
or any other reduction in out-of-pocket expenses) for prescription 
drugs made by or on behalf of an enrollee toward that person's 
deductible, copay, or cost-sharing responsibility, or out-of-
pocket maximum.

An additional eight states have some form of legislation pending to 
address copay accumulator/maximizer programs.
            11.3  What Can Be Done?
     Legislative

        <ctr-circle>  States should enact laws that require health 
plans to include any amount paid by or on behalf of a plan enrollee 
when calculating an enrollee's overall contribution to any out-of-
pocket maximum or any cost-sharing requirement.
     Regulatory

        <ctr-circle>  HHS should rescind the Notice of Benefit and 
Payment Parameters for 2021 Final Rule, and institute Notice of Benefit 
and Payment Parameters that, at the very least, reinstates, 
strengthens, and clarifies the protections for patients receiving 
medications without lower cost alternatives.

     Plan Sponsor Action

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors should inquire with PBM whether 
copay accumulator and/or maximizer programs are being employed, and 
demand that protections be given for oncology medications that lack 
lower cost alternatives.

12 Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) Pricing

Maximum Allowable Cost pricing, or ``MAC,'' is one of the most 
significant and challenging issues facing independent pharmacies 
throughout the United States today. While not as impactful to community 
oncology practices providing cancer care as many of the other topics 
addressed in this expose, MAC has nevertheless become one of the most 
manipulated and opaque methods by which PBMs control reimbursement to 
independent pharmacies and has become a catalyst for legislative 
efforts to rein in PBM conduct.

MAC is typically defined as the maximum amount of money that PBM will 
pay a pharmacy for certain multi-source drugs, typically multi-source 
generic drugs.\247\ It is well established that generic drugs make up 
the vast majority of drugs dispensed throughout the United States. For 
example, according to the Association for Accessible Medicines, generic 
drugs account for approximately 89% of all prescription drugs dispensed 
in the United States.\248\ Thus, generic drugs constitute the majority 
of drugs dispensed to patients throughout the United States meaning MAC 
pricing present a significant issue as it pertains to provider 
reimbursement.\249\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \247\ See, e.g., NY Pub Health Sec. 280-a(1)(b).
    \248\ Association for Accessible Medicines, Generic Drug Access and 
Savings in the U.S., 2017, https://accessiblemeds.org/sites/default/

(E.D. Ark. 2017) (noting that the parties agree that 70% to 90% of all 
prescriptions are for generic drugs, which utilize MAC pricing); Eugene 
A. DePasquale, Bringing Transparency and Accountability to Drug Pricing 
(December 11, 2018), https://www.paauditor.gov/Media/Default/Reports/
RPT_PBMs_FINAL.pdf (noting that generic drugs make up roughly 85 
percent of all prescriptions filled annually nationwide).

MAC began as a mechanism to save money in health care and incentivize 
selective and intelligent purchasing practices, but MAC has since 
evolved over time into a PBM tool that can be manipulated by PBMs to 
increase revenues in several different ways.\250\ MAC pricing is a PBM 
created pricing benchmark--MAC prices and MAC lists are prepared 
exclusively by PBMs and considered by the PBMs to be proprietary and 
confidential.\251\ Moreover, PBM-set MAC rates need not have any 
relationship to a drug's market clearing acquisition cost.\252\ As 
such, the creation and publication of PBM MAC prices and MAC lists are 
shielded from the public and avoid public scrutiny.\253\

    \253\ See, id.

PBMs' ability to keep MAC lists and MAC prices from the public has 
enabled PBMs to utilize MAC pricing to increase their revenues and to 
effectuate certain PBM practices that lead to higher revenues, 
including the PBM practice of spread pricing, wherein a PBM reimburses 
a pharmacy provider one price for a drug but collects a higher amount 
from the plan sponsor and retains the difference.\254\ The fact that 
MAC pricing is shrouded in secrecy, and there is no requirement for MAC 
rates to have any basis in real costs, creates substantial profit 
opportunities for PBMs and has resulted in substantial challenges for 
independent pharmacy providers over the past several years.

            12.1 Who Is Impacted?
PBMs' secretive MAC pricing tactics have caused harm to payers, 
providers, and most critically to patients.
                12.1.1 Harm to Patients
The improper use of MAC pricing tactics harm patients throughout the 
United States by limiting patient care access--this specific issue is 
on display in the case Rutledge v. PCMA which successfully went before 
the Supreme Court of the United States in December of 2020.\255\ In 
Rutledge, Arkansas enacted a law, Act 900, with the purpose of 
addressing this patient-based issue, which was especially pronounced in 
rural areas.\256\ MAC pricing appears to often disproportionately harm 
patients in rural areas, who often do not have access to a broad 
catalogue of different (sometimes cheaper) products, thereby harming 
these patients specifically.\257\ ``MAC methodologies are resulting in 
pharmacies closing down, especially in rural areas . . . [and] 
approximately 44% of Arkansans live in rural areas.''\258\ The 
potential for patient harm based upon improper pricing and 
reimbursement tactics, including MAC pricing combined with spread 
pricing was also discussed at length in the Pennsylvania Auditor 
General's Report on PBMs, wherein it was noted that ``small pharmacies 
often see the most vulnerable patients . . . [a]nd if small pharmacies 
are forced out of business, these patients will have to travel greater 
distances to get the medications they need[.]''\259\ Thus, there is 
ample objective evidence that PBMs' MAC pricing tactics are causing 
harm to patient populations throughout the United States and that this 
harm may be particularly pronounced in rural settings.

                12.1.2 Harm to Plan Sponsors
In addition to harming patients, improper MAC pricing tactics by PBMs 
also potentially harm all payers including Medicare, Medicaid, 
employers, and taxpayers, although studies indicate this may be 
particularly pronounced in the Medicaid context.\260\ ``PBMs' control 
of MAC definitions allows them to manipulate the MAC concept in 
whatever ways they choose.''\261\ Thus, MAC lists do not afford payers 
and sponsors with the ability to have predictability or in any way 
guarantee savings but instead give PBMs unfettered discretion to 
control precisely which drugs are on a particular MAC list and to 
ensure only those drugs which they are making money on remain on the 
list and those which they are not are removed from the list. In 
assessing potential harm of PBMs' MAC pricing tactics, it is important 
to note that MAC pricing applies to drugs, most commonly generics, and 
not to specific programs (e.g., Medicaid).\262\ The implication is that 
improper MAC pricing tactics can affect all payers, including federal 
and state governments, and by extension, taxpayers.\263\

As mentioned, MAC pricing is one of the primary methods by which PBM 
spread pricing is effectuated, wherein the PBM bills a plan sponsor one 
price and reimburses the pharmacy provider a lower amount.\264\ Several 
studies have shown that improper MAC pricing tactics, in connection 
with spread pricing, has been prominent in the Medicaid context, 
including in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, 
New York, Ohio, and Virginia.\265\ Pennsylvania's report on PBMs noted 
that in 2017 ``three PBMs made between $2 million and nearly $40 
million on spread pricing, earning average profits between 28 cents and 
almost $13 per Medicaid prescription filled.''\266\

In order to implement spread pricing via MAC pricing, PBMs create 
numerous different MAC lists including separate MAC lists for each 
individual payer as well as separate MAC lists for PBM network 
providers which enables a PBM to bill a plan sponsor one rate but pay 
the pharmacy a separate and frequently a much lower rate.\267\ Florida, 
Michigan, New York, and Ohio are three states that exemplify the harm 
caused by PBM MAC pricing tactics to state specific Medicaid programs.

                12.1.3 Harm to Providers
Finally, improper MAC pricing tactics by PBMs also harm providers due 
to unsustainable reimbursement by PBMs.\268\ In Rutledge, the District 
Court acknowledged that numerous pharmacies had been harmed by these 
tactics and were closing down,\269\ noting that ``[i]ndependent 
community pharmacies have had to eliminate employees during the last 5 
to 10 years due to the financial hardships they have faced.''\270\ The 
court further noted that ``[i]ndependent community pharmacies in 
Arkansas are in economic distress.''\271\

These unreasonably low MAC prices are further exacerbated by the fact 
that PBMs are often slow to make price adjustments to MAC drugs when 
there are market conditions that would result in the PBM reimbursing a 
higher amount (i.e., an increase in acquisition cost), but relatively 
quick to make price adjustments based on market conditions that would 
result in the PBM reimbursing a lesser amount (i.e., a decrease in 
acquisition cost).\272\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            12.2 What Does the Law Say?
Given its prevalence in commercial insurance contracts and Medicaid 
programs, MAC pricing has largely been regulated by the states. 
Currently, 36 states have some form of MAC law or MAC appeal law in 
place.\273\ While the different state laws vary in the level of 
protections they afford to pharmacies regarding MAC, there are several 
general characteristics in these state MAC laws. Typically, robust MAC 
laws will establish criteria for placing a drug on a MAC list, 
establish an appeal process for challenging questionable MAC pricing, 
and set requirements for updating MAC lists. Texas and Georgia are 
example of such laws.\274\ In Texas, a PBM may not include a drug on a 
MAC list unless: (1) the drug: (A) has an ``A'' or ``B'' rating in the 
most recent version of the United States FDA's Approved Drug Products 
with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange 
Book; or (B) is rated ``NR'' or ``NA'' or has a similar rating by a 
nationally recognized reference; and (2) the drug is: (A) generally 
available for purchase by pharmacists and pharmacies in [Texas] from a 
national or regional wholesaler; and (B) not obsolete.\275\ Further, 
the PBM must develop a process for pharmacies to appeal MAC prices of a 
drug on or before the 10th day after the claim is submitted and the PBM 
must respond within 10 days.\276\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \273\ Rutledge v. PCMA, Pet'r Br. p. 5; see also, National 
Conference of State Legislatures, 2018 Enacted State Laws Affecting 
Pharmaceutical Costs, Pricing and Payment (February 2019), https://

    \276\ Id.

Texas' MAC appeal requirements also require that when an appeal is 
successful, the PBM must (1) adjust the MAC that is the subject of the 
appeal effective on the day after the date the appeal is decided; (2) 
apply the adjusted MAC price to all similarly situated pharmacies as 
determined by the PBM; and (3) allow the pharmacy that succeeded in the 
appeal to reverse and rebill the pharmacy benefit claim giving rise to 
the appeal.\277\ When appeals are not successful, the PBM must identify 
and disclose (1) each reason the appeal was denied; and (2) the NDC 
number from the national/regional wholesalers from which the drug is 
generally available for purchase by pharmacies in Texas at the MAC 
price that is the subject of the appeal.\278\ Moreover, in Texas, there 
are separate guidelines governing MAC in the Medicaid context.\279\ 
Although there are some functions an MCO may delegate to a PBM in 
Texas, there are also certain functions for which an MCO is ultimately 
responsible despite the delegable nature of the function.\280\ These 
expressly include ``negotiation and establishment of pharmacy provider 
reimbursement rates [and] cultivation and maintenance of MAC pricing 
lists.''\281\ Thus, certain laws in the Medicaid context potentially 
provide additional recourse against payers in addition to PBMs as is 
the case in Texas.

            12.3 What Can Be Done?
Effective responses to improper MAC pricing by PBMs require action at 
various levels:

     Legislative

        <ctr-circle>  Congress should enact legislation at the federal 
level prohibiting MAC manipulation including a requirement as to 
transparency in MAC pricing on both sides of the PBM--at the plan 
sponsor side as well as the provider side.

        <ctr-circle>  States must take more aggressive action against 
PBMs' MAC pricing tactics and enact new laws or else enhance existing 
laws that mandate transparency in reimbursement which should include 
robust laws that protect both plan sponsors and providers from 
manipulative MAC pricing practices, especially as it pertains to claims 
that are paid from taxpayer dollars, e.g., Medicare and Medicaid.\282\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \282\ See, e.g., Eugene A. DePasquale, Bringing Transparency and 
Accountability to Drug Pricing (December 11, 2018), https://
www.paauditor.gov/Media/Default/Reports/RPT_PBMs_
FINAL.pdf.

        <ctr-circle>  For legislative efforts to be effective, the laws 
enacted must provide a deterrent beyond solely relying on government 
enforcement. Thus, it is imperative that states enact laws or enhance 
existing laws by including or adding ``private rights of action'' to 
ensure plan sponsors and providers have recourse against improper PBM 
MAC pricing tactics and also make violation of MAC laws by PBMs an 
unfair or deceptive trade practice act in accordance with existing 
state law.\283\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \283\ See, e.g., AR ST Sec. 17-92-507(g).

        <ctr-circle>  State laws should strive for greater uniformity, 
including in how MAC is defined to prevent inconsistencies in 
reimbursement practices throughout the country, greater/broader appeal 
rights (requiring that the drug utilized as the basis for the MAC rate 
is readily available and conforms with the state's prescription 
substitution laws), and to ensure that PBMs cannot take liberties in 
placing drugs that do not meet a uniform definition of a MAC drug on a 
MAC list.\284\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \284\ Compare V.T.C.A. Sec. 1369.353 and NY Pub Health Sec. 280-
a(1)(b).

        <ctr-circle>  MAC laws should permit providers to choose how 
MAC appeals are filed rather than permitting PBMs to force providers to 
use a pharmacy services administrative organization (PSAO)--this 
ensures that if PSAOs are not responsive to MAC issues, pharmacy 
providers can pursue the appeals on their own or hire third parties 
that may be more effective at addressing MAC issues.\285\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \285\ See, e.g., N.J.S.A. 17B:27F-4.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Regulatory

        <ctr-circle>  There should be increased scrutiny over PBM MAC 
pricing tactics at the federal level through CMS/OIG audits.

        <ctr-circle>  Increased scrutiny over PBM MAC pricing tactics 
should happen at the state level through audits by both the Departments 
of Insurance and Departments of Health and/or state Boards of Pharmacy.

     Plan Sponsor Action

        <ctr-circle>  Plan sponsors must demand more from PBMs during 
the contracting process including specific information on how 
pharmacies are being reimbursed and the use of MAC lists as it pertains 
to both the plan sponsors' relationship with the PBM as well as 
pharmacies' relationships with the PBM to understand if spread pricing 
is being used and/or whether pharmacies are being harmed by improper 
MAC reimbursement.

13 Effective Rate Reconciliation

In yet another opaque and underhanded ploy, PBMs have created and 
utilized the concepts of Generic Effective Rate (GER) and Brand 
Effective Rate (BER) to essentially reprice drugs, and claw back 
pharmacy reimbursements, sometimes more than a year after drugs are 
dispensed.\286\ GER and BER (collectively known as the ``Effective 
Rate'') measure the discount that the PBM contractually must deliver 
for its client (i.e., plan sponsors) to a benchmark called Average 
Wholesale Price (versus) for generic prescription drugs and for brand-
name prescription drugs, respectively.\287\ However, because they are 
assessed retrospectively and on a network level basis, it is tantamount 
to giving PBMs unbridled discretion as to how they will pay a given 
pharmacy, and still technically be in compliance with the reimbursement 
terms of the agreement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Worse yet, PBM methods of imposing and recouping Effective Rate 
assessments are equally deceitful. Not only did many PBMs foist such 
reimbursement terms on pharmacy providers retroactively without their 
knowledge or consent (for example via retroactive contracts with the 
pharmacy providers' PSAOs), but in many instances, the pharmacy 
providers only learned of the Effective Rate reconciliation when the 
PBMs, either directly or indirectly, simply began withholding payments 
due to offset the alleged Effective Rate overpayments.\288\

Because of its after-the-fact assessment applied across an entire 
network of pharmacy providers, Effective Rates allow PBMs to circumvent 
Maximum Allowable Cost laws enacted by many states (see, Section 12, 
supra), and hinders pharmacy providers' ability to challenge underwater 
reimbursements on generic prescriptions.\289\ At its most basic level, 
Effective Rate is not reflected at the point of sale and it provides an 
opportunity for PBMs to take back a substantial amount of 
reimbursements on prescription drug claims that were already dispensed 
to patients.\290\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \289\ See, Complaint, Total Care Rx, Inc. v. Epic Pharmacy Network, 
Inc., No. 1:18-cv-3853 (D.Md. December 14, 2018).

Department of Justice Antitrust Division,'' December 12, 2018, 
accessible online: https://www.justice.gov/atr/page/file/1142771/
download.

Similarly, PBMs have also created another pricing mechanism called 
Dispending Fee Effective Rate (DFER) to recoup dispensing fees already 
paid to providers that provides no purpose to reduce plan sponsors' 
drug spending.\291\ DFER allows a PBM to pay one dispensing fee at the 
point-of-sale, and afterwards claw-back a portion of this dispensing 
fee down to the contractually specified DFER. This particularly 
pernicious type of effective rate undermines the cost-plus pass-through 
contracts that many state Medicaid programs are contemplating, or 
moving to, in response to outrage over spread pricing. DFERs could 
allow the PBM to pass through the state-mandated dispensing fee, only 
to claw it back after the fact, without the state's knowledge.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            13.1 Who Is Impacted?
                13.1.1 Harm to Patients
As with many other PBM tactics, including spread pricing (see, Section 
10, supra), rebates (see, Section 4, supra), and DIR fees (see, Section 
5, supra), Effective Rate reimbursement frameworks have the ability to 
increase the gross price for medications, notwithstanding a potentially 
lower net price. For Medicare Part D patients, Effective Rate forces 
them to reach ``donut hole'' and pushes patients into ``catastrophic 
coverage'' at a much faster rate.\292\ As discussed in detail below, 
this results in the patients being responsible for a greater share of 
the costs of the medication.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \292\ See, American Pharmacy Cooperative, Inc., ``Letter to U.S. 
Department of Justice Antitrust Division,'' December 12, 2018,

download.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                13.1.2 Harm to Plan Sponsors
While it is billed as a ``cost containment'' and pricing guarantee to 
payers, in actuality, Effective Rate reimbursement schemes do little to 
lower the overall costs of drugs. Effective Rate prices are invariably 
tied to percentage discounts off of reported AWP (as shown in the 
graphic on page 78, an inherently unreliable pricing benchmark), 
enabling PBMs to deliver on savings guarantees, while not actually 
lowering overall costs (as lower generic and brand-name prescription 
drug costs for plan sponsors would in turn lower overall revenue for 
PBMs).\293\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \293\ See generally, 3Axis Advisors, ``Analysis of PBM Spread 
Pricing in Michigan Medicaid Managed Care,'' accessible online: https:/

3AA+MI+Medicaid+managed+care+
analysis+-+Final+04.10.19.pdf.

An even more pernicious feature of Effective Rate pricing arrangements 
is that they provide PBMs with the ability to collect ``spread'' 
between what they charge their clients (e.g., employers and plan 
sponsors) and what they pay their providers (e.g., pharmacies and 
community oncology practices) without having to put their clients in 
traditional spread pricing contracts. Instead, PBMs can simply sign one 
contract with a client guaranteeing, say, an 82% discount to AWP and a 
different contract with their pharmacy network guaranteeing an 87% 
discount to AWP. Both contracts are highly confidential, so the 
``buyer'' (the employer) and ``seller'' (the pharmacy) of drugs does 
not know what each other are paying/receiving. Even if the employer 
demands a full pass-through contract, in which no spread is taken off 
the claim, the PBM will simply pass-through what it charges its client 
to the pharmacy at the time of the transaction, and then claw the 
overpayment back at a later time through its effective rate 
adjustments. At the end of the day, in this hypothetical example the 
PBM has locked in 5% of AWP for its services, regardless if it collects 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
that up front or months after the transaction.

The value of Effective Rate contracts to the PBM does not end there. 
That's because for generic drugs, AWP is designed to do exactly the 
opposite of what prices should do over time for generic drugs--AWP is 
designed to increase, not decrease over time. So, in our hypothetical 
example, the hidden 5% of AWP locked in by the PBM becomes more and 
more valuable each year to the PBM as AWPs diverge from true generic 
acquisition costs.

                13.1.3 Harm to Providers
As noted above, Effective Rate reimbursement has had an especially 
damaging impact on providers. By effectively circumventing MAC laws, 
PBMs are able to reimburse many pharmacies below water on claims, 
leaving them without any recourse to challenge such reimbursements 
through legally-mandated appeals processes. This has particularly 
effect on providers who only dispense a limited range of generic 
products, such as community oncology practices. PBMs' reconciliation of 
Effective Rate is a significant financial hurdle to community oncology 
practices because oncologists generally treat patients with a handful 
of drugs compared to other community retail or chain pharmacies who 
have a broad and diverse patient population.\294\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \294\ See, e.g., New York Cancer and Blood Specialists, ``PBM 
Delays for Cancer Drugs May Risk Lives, Warn Oncologists,'' March 13, 
2019, accessible online: https://nycancer.com/blog/2019/03/13/pbm-
delays-cancer-drugs-may-risk-lives-warn-oncolo/.

            13.2 What Does the Law Say?
At the federal level, in addition to the guidance on spread pricing 
generally (see, section 10, supra), GER and BER reconciliations are 
properly considered direct and indirect remuneration (DIR), which 
Medicare Part D plan sponsors must report to CMS.\295\ This at least, 
in theory, requires PBMs and Part D plan sponsors to disclose the 
extent and amount of GER/BER, regardless of whether it is passed-
through to the plan sponsor or retained by the PBM.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \295\ See, Social Security Act Sec. 1860D-15, 42 U.S.C. [1395w-
115].

At a state level, many states have enacted laws that would prohibit 
these types of post-point-of-sale reconciliations and clawbacks with 
respect to private health plans. For example, Tennessee law provides 
that neither a health insurance company nor a PBM may ``charge a 
pharmacist or a pharmacy a fee related to a claim unless it is apparent 
at the time of claim processing and is reported on the remittance 
advice of an adjudicated claim.''\296\ Likewise, Indiana law explicitly 
regulates the practice of ``effective rate of reimbursement,'' and 
provides that a PBM may not ``[r]educe, directly or indirectly, payment 
to a pharmacy for pharmacist services to an effective rate of 
reimbursement. . . .''\297\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \296\ T. C. A. Sec. 56-7-3115.
    \297\ Ind. Code. Sec. 27-1-24.5-19(b)(4).

Finally, Effective Rate reconciliations may impinge on the multitude of 
``Prompt Payment'' laws that exist in virtually every state in the 
country. For example, Mississippi's Pharmacy Benefit Prompt Pay Act 
requires PBMs to pay electronically submitted claims in full within 
fifteen days.\298\ PBMs' later-in-time retraction of the amounts paid 
could violate those requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \298\ See, Miss. Code Ann. Sec. 73-21-155.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            13.3 What Can Be Done?
Effective Rate reimbursement requires a response at many levels:

     Legislative

        <ctr-circle>  States should enact laws, like Tennessee's \299\ 
and Indiana's \300\ that prohibit recoupment of fees on claims that 
were not reflected at the point-of-sale or otherwise ban Effective Rate 
reimbursement as a construct altogether.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \299\ T. C. A. Sec. 56-7-3115.
    \300\ Ind. Code. Sec. 27-1-24.5-19(b)(4).

        <ctr-circle>  States should enact MAC Appeal Laws (where none 
exist) or amend existing MAC laws to prohibit health insurers and PBMs 
from circumventing MAC appeal rights through Effective Rate 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
reimbursement constructs.

        <ctr-circle>  Laws should be enacted, like New Jersey's Fair 
Price law,\301\ requiring PBM pricing transparency and prohibiting 
below-cost reimbursement to pharmacies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \301\ N.J.S.A. 17b:27f-1 to -10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Regulatory

        <ctr-circle>  CMS should audit Part D plan sponsors and 
contracted PBMs to determine whether GER/BER is appropriately reported 
and reconciled to CMS at the end of each Plan Year.

        <ctr-circle>  State Departments of Insurance should pursue 
complaints against PBMs and health insurers for violations of Any 
Willing Provider Laws, stemming from efforts to constructively deny 
providers the right to participate in pharmacy networks based on 
unreasonably low, below cost reimbursement rates.

     Plan Sponsor Action

        <ctr-circle>  As part of the PBM contract, plan sponsors should 
require PBMs to pass through any and all amounts PBMs received from the 
pharmacies after the point-of-sale on a claim-by-claim level.
        <ctr-circle>  As part of the PBM contract, plan sponsors should 
require PBMs to seek a permission prior to implementing a contracted-
rate with the pharmacies (e.g., GER).

14 Conclusion

The list of PBM abuses and games is seemingly never-ending and 
evolving. But the reality is that we are only just scratching the 
surface of understanding what these abusive health care middlemen are 
doing. Simply put, PBMs have overwhelmingly abused their responsibility 
to protect Americans from this country's drug pricing crisis, instead 
exploiting the opacity throughout the drug supply chain to enrich 
themselves. Their many abuses go well beyond just questionable rebate 
practices, and hurt patients and plan sponsors (including employers, 
Medicare, and Medicaid).

Unfortunately, their impact is only becoming more pronounced, 
especially in oncology. More and more cancer drugs are coming out in 
oral formulations, further shifting care away from the medical space 
and into the pharmacy space. These expensive therapies are very 
attractive to PBM's because of the potential for high prices that yield 
high rebate revenues, high DIR fees, and eventually, high spreads--all 
of which are a function of the drug's cost.

And even outside of the pharmacy benefits realm, through vertical 
integration, PBMs have been able to exert considerably more influence 
in the other areas, such as injectable biosimilars and intravenous 
chemotherapies. Not only can PBMs can leverage these for steep 
originator and rebates (thereby stifling the biosimilar industry for 
their own gain), but PBMs have instituted mandatory white bagging 
policies to take even in-office administration out of the hands of 
community oncology practices.

The bottom line is this: today's drug supply chain is designed for 
cancer patients to receive inferior treatment, while paying more out-
of-pocket.

The time for action to stop PBM abuses is now. Each day that goes by, 
community oncology patients, practices, and professionals become 
increasingly powerless because of horizonal PBM consolidation and 
vertical integration with insurers.

Fortunately, however, solutions do exist. These include legislative 
efforts at both the state and federal levels. Many states' existing 
laws serve as prime examples of how they can be successfully 
implemented to protect the interests of patients and health care payers 
(like employers, Medicaid programs, and taxpayers). In addition, based 
on many laws that are currently on the books, regulators (both state 
and federal) have tremendous tools available to them, that up until 
this point, have not been widely utilized.

The time is critical that regulators--including CMS, OCR, the FTC, 
state Boards of Pharmacy and state Departments of Insurance--take much 
need action to rein in the unchecked power of PBMs.

The time for sitting back and letting market forces address the issues 
is over. The time for action to stop PBM abuses is now.

        Questions Submitted for the Record to Jonathan E. Levitt
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
    Question. How can Congress strengthen the Medicare statute to 
improve pharmacy access and protect community pharmacies?

    Answer. To improve pharmacy access and protect community 
pharmacies, we recommend as a starting point, amending Medicare's Any 
Willing Provider Law (``AWPL''), codified at 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395w-104, 
to expressly apply to PBMs. This will preclude PBMs from taking the 
position that the AWPL does not apply to PBMs, a common argument made 
by PBMs and Part D Plan Sponsor in seeking to avoid the law. We also 
recommend amending the AWPL to require PBMs to admit all qualified 
providers and to expressly state that the AWPL requires patients to be 
permitted the option of using any qualified provider of their choice 
regardless of whether that provider is a PBM affiliated provider cross 
referencing to 42 U.S. Code Sec. 1395a (Free Choice by Patient 
Guaranteed). We further recommend that Congress amend the AWPL to 
include mandatory ``reasonable and relevant'' terms and conditions, and 
to provide a framework for determining reasonable reimbursement for 
Medicare pharmacy providers. We recommend that a framework include:

         Reimbursement Rates. Provide that reimbursement below a 
        pharmacy's drug acquisition cost is per se evidence of a 
        violation of the ``reasonable and relevant terms and 
        conditions'' standard. Documentation provided by the pharmacy 
        provider showing that reimbursement was below acquisition cost 
        shall result in a presumption that the reimbursement was 
        unreasonable.

            <ctr-circle>  Reimbursement at or above cost shall be 
        considered but one factor in determining if reimbursement was 
        reasonable.

            <ctr-circle>  Requirement of a reasonable mandatory 
        dispensing fee to pay for labor, operational, and other 
        overhead costs associated with a provider dispensing a drug to 
        a patient. Prohibition on ``$0.00'' dispensing fee to fulfill 
        the requirement for a reasonable mandatory dispensing fee. Such 
        dispensing fee shall represent an amount paid for the 
        professional services rendered by a pharmacy and/or pharmacist 
        for dispensing a prescription and shall not include any payment 
        associated with the medication(s) being dispensed.

         Performance Metrics. Any PBM implemented ``performance 
        metric(s)'' that impact reimbursement must be ``reasonable and 
        relevant'' as applied to a particular pharmacy provider to 
        ensure that: (1) pharmacy providers' performance is being 
        measured on a level playing field (e.g., not measuring 
        specialty pharmacies or community oncology providers' 
        performances against retail pharmacies' performance, not 
        measuring independent pharmacy performance against large chain 
        pharmacies); and (2) performance metrics are clearly reported 
        to the pharmacy provider at the claim level and such 
        performance metrics cannot favor the PBM corporately affiliated 
        pharmacies.

         Dispute Resolution. Require PBM contracts to include a 
        practical mechanism for pharmacy providers to resolve disputes 
        regarding: (1) unreasonable reimbursement; and (2) the 
        reasonableness and relevance of PBM terms and conditions. 
        Dispute resolution requirements should include: (i) mandatory 
        minimum timeline for PBMs to respond; (ii) an ability for 
        providers to resolve disputes in a court of competent 
        jurisdiction; (iii) an ability for providers with common 
        disputes to resolve disputes with PBMs on a consolidated basis; 
        and (iv) prohibitions on retaliation, such as network 
        exclusion, punitive reduction of reimbursement, for such 
        disputes.

         Differential Pricing. PBMs shall not reimburse corporately 
        affiliated pharmacy operations better than non-owned and/or 
        independent affiliated pharmacy operations.

         Monetary Penalties. CMS enforcement mechanism that includes 
        right of pharmacy providers to report PBM non-compliance with 
        these obligations to CMS for further investigation with 
        provider protection from adverse action or retaliation by PBMs 
        for such reporting. Enforcement mechanisms should include the 
        right for CMS to impose monetary penalties for noncompliance.

    Question. Do you believe PBMs reimburse PBM-owned pharmacies at 
higher rates than independent pharmacies or unaffiliated chains? Have 
you seen evidence of this practice through your work?

    Answer. Yes, we have seen evidence that PBMs pay their own 
pharmacies at higher reimbursement rates than PBMs pay to independent 
pharmacies. PBMs often state that they have ``standard terms and 
conditions'' for providers in their networks. But discovery or 
investigation has revealed ``differential pricing.'' Differential 
pricing occurs when PBMs pay their wholly owned pharmacies more than 
PBMs pay to independent pharmacies. We also see evidence of PBMs 
granting themselves longer ``days' supply'' for dispensed quantities, 
as another favorable term. When a PBM is forced to disclose 
differential pricing and terms during discovery, PBMs often settle 
rather than disclose this information. PBMs also assess DIR fees in a 
discriminatory manner, and engage in patient steering to send a higher 
volume of prescriptions to their wholly owned pharmacies. By paying 
unreasonable reimbursement rates to independents, PBMs engage in 
predatory pricing. The PBM's wholly owned pharmacy can sustain 
operating at a loss because the PBM makes ``spread.'' Unreasonable 
reimbursement also helps the PBM decrease competition from independent 
providers. We know for certain that PBMs, even in Medicare, pay their 
wholly owned chain or specialty pharmacies better than independents, 
including possibly in the critical arena of 340B. Gag clauses prevent 
us from revealing this specific data. Even in Medicaid it has been 
publicly reported that PBMs pay their wholly owned pharmacies better 
than independent pharmacies.\1\ The Senate should investigate.

    Question. Recent evidence suggests that specialty pharmacy is a 
growing source of revenue for PBMs. Please describe how PBMs are 
generating revenue through their specialty pharmacy channels. 
Additionally, what tactics do PBMs use within Medicare Part D to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
increase specialty dispensing volume?

    Answer. PBMs generate revenue through specialty drug distribution 
channels in multiple ways. Each of the ``Big Three'' PBMs owns 
(directly or indirectly) its own specialty pharmacy, and these three 
pharmacies--CVS Specialty (affiliated with Caremark), Accredo 
(affiliated with Express Scripts) and Optum Specialty Pharmacy 
(affiliated with OptumRx)--combine for a 65-percent market share of all 
specialty prescription revenues in 2021, and likely more today.\2\ 
Thus, each independent specialty pharmacy competes with each PBM-owned 
specialty pharmacy for prescription revenue. This is particularly 
distressing because PBMs are also the gatekeepers for pharmacy 
networks, so they determine which competitor will be excluded or 
permitted to compete. The fox is guarding the hen house.

    Steering. PBMs also engage in prescription ``steering.'' Because 
each PBM has a pecuniary interest in sending specialty prescriptions to 
their affiliate specialty pharmacy, each PBM engages in prescription 
``steering'' or ``hijacking.''\3\ PBMs use their position as claims 
adjudicators to review patient information and specialty drug claims 
data submitted by providers. PBMs often reject independent provider 
specialty claims, and require providers to secure ``Prior 
Authorization'' for the claim, then reject the claim again to compel 
the patient to use the PBM's wholly owned specialty pharmacy.\4\ PBMs 
often engage in substantial misrepresentations to patients in the 
process of misleading them to their wholly owned pharmacies.\5\

    Below Water Reimbursement. PBMs also engage in ``Low-Ball'' or 
``Below Water'' reimbursement. PBMs use below cost reimbursement to 
independent specialty pharmacies for specialty drugs to drive 
competitors out of networks and drive revenue to their own 
pharmacies.\6\ Specialty pharmacies will often not fill below-water 
prescriptions. PBMs use outsized market power to dictate pharmacy 
reimbursement, which drives independent specialty providers out of 
network, thus increasing PBM pharmacy market share.\7\

    \7\ Ibid.

    Vertical Integration and Loss on Pharmacy Side. It makes no 
difference to PBMs whether their affiliated pharmacies make a profit or 
loss on reimbursement ``up front.'' The affiliated PBM need only drive 
prescriptions to their own pharmacies; that is, regardless of the 
profit to the pharmacy at the point of sale, the vertically integrated 
PBM will profit through manufacturer discounts or spread pricing in 
their capacity as PBM.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ Id. at 51.

    Definitions as Weapons. PBMs seek to increase their specialty 
dispensing volume and costs by controlling the definition of 
medications. The power to define what is categorized as specialty 
medication on plan formulary is the power to profit. PBMs can 
characterize specialty drugs as non-specialty for purposes of driving 
lower reimbursement to pharmacy providers, while continuing to define 
the same products as ``specialty'' when contracting with plan sponsors 
to avoid having to meet cost savings guarantees. PBMs also require 
patients to ``try and fail'' certain specialty drugs before moving on 
to specialty drugs that are not on the PBM's preferred formulary, even 
if the prescriber already knows the best specialty medication for their 
patient. Additionally, PBMs have encouraged specialty dispensing in 
Part D by overpaying on certain specialty drugs and steering those 
claims to their wholly owned specialty pharmacies. These tactics all 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
contribute to increased specialty costs.

    Tying Arrangements. PBMs engage in ``tying arrangements'' to 
generate revenue by virtue of their market dominance. Vertical 
integration of a PBM, Prescription Drug Plan (PDP), specialty pharmacy, 
and retail pharmacy is a recipe for disaster. PBMs decide which drugs 
are placed on formulary, that drug's copay ``tier,'' and the 
reimbursement rate that will be paid to pharmacies. The power to 
control formulary is the power to control manufacturers and 
distributors. PBMs routinely exclude pharmacies that compete with the 
PBM-affilaited specialty and retail pharmacies. A PBM that wants access 
to a new ``exclusive distribution drug'' at its affiliate specialty 
pharmacy can threaten a manufacturer that it must provide the PBM's 
specialty pharmacy access, lest the manufacturer's product not be 
included on the PBM's formulary. The PBM could ``exclude'' the 
independent specialty pharmacy from the network that has been granted 
access to the exclusive distribution drug by the manufacturer. The 
power to exclude pharmacies is the power for PBMs to grow to the 
largest specialty pharmacies. CVS Health/Caremark dominates the 
specialty industry with 28 percent market share. Cigna/Express Script's 
specialty pharmacy controls another 21 percent. UnitedHealthcare/
Optum's special pharmacy controls 13 percent. Just these three PBMs 
affiliated specialty pharmacies control 64 percent of all specialty 
prescriptions.\9\ Because they are the largest pharmacies, they are 
also the largest purchasers of drugs. Armed with formulary power on the 
PBM side and market share on the pharmacy side, PBMs insist that 
manufacturers and distributors give preferential drug acquisition cost 
pricing to the PBMs' affiliate pharmacies. Manufacturers and 
distributors earn very low margins selling to the PBM owned pharmacies. 
Manufacturers and distributors must unfortunately make up for that low 
margin by selling to independent pharmacies at elevated margins. Higher 
acquisition cost for independents contributes substantially to the 
inability of independents to survive. The FTC or Senate must 
investigate these PBM tying arrangements. All manufacturers and 
distributors are afraid to come forward because of retaliation with 
formulary treatment.

2022: Five Key Trends About Today's Marketplace, https://

                                 ______
                                 
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo
                delinking compensation from drug prices
    Question. A growing body of research suggests that compensation and 
contracting structures across the prescription drug supply chain may 
risk incentivizing higher list prices for medications by tying 
stakeholder payments to products' list prices or to list-price-derived 
benchmarks. In its March 2023 report to Congress, for instance, the 
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) contends that ``[a]ll 
levels of the drug supply chain include incentives that drive [point-
of-sale] prices higher, particularly when payments are based on a 
percentage of prices.''\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ See p. 400, https://www.medpac.gov/document/march-2023-report-
to-the-congress-medicare-payment-policy/.

    The potential for these types of incentives has driven some experts 
and supply-chain participants to propose eliminating the use of drug 
prices in establishing payment rates and amounts for PBMs and other 
stakeholders. A coalition of Idaho-based providers, patient advocates, 
and job creators, for instance, recently wrote in support of Federal 
policies aimed at ``delinking PBM compensation from the list price of 
individual medications.''\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ See Endnotes for a copy of the letter.

    How would Federal policies delinking compensation for pharmacy 
benefit managers (PBMs) and plan sponsors from drug prices in the 
context of Medicare Part D affect incentives within the retail 
prescription drug supply chain, and how would this type of change 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
likely impact beneficiary costs and taxpayer spending?

    Answer. When a PBM's compensation, and a plan sponsors financial 
modeling, is tied to a percentage of drug costs, it has the effect of 
incentivizing PBMs to push for higher list prices of drugs. A PBM that 
takes a 15 percent rebate earns more money on a $1,000 drug than a $100 
drug. A PBM that charges a 5-percent DIR fee profits more from a $1,000 
drug than a $100 drug. A plan sponsor saves money (and actually can 
earn money) when patients have to pay full costs of a high-priced drug 
during the deductible phase, while the plan sponsor retains a large 
rebate from the manufacturer. There are many different fees that PBMs 
and their affiliates charge that are tied to the list price of a drug, 
including: rebates, GPO fees, transaction fees, DIR fees, spread 
pricing, contract pharmacy dispensing fees, 340B third party 
administration fees, and mail order pharmacy reimbursement amounts. 
Policies that directed PBMs and plan sponsors to delink their 
reimbursement from drug prices could serve to remove the incentive to 
push for higher list prices. It could mean that PBMs and plans pursue 
drugs for formulary inclusion based on effectiveness, appropriateness, 
and overall cost, not based on what they stand to make off the drug. 
This would also reduce incentives for PBMs and plans to raise the list 
price, which informs the amount that patients have to pay in 
coinsurance and deductible and allow patients to better share in the 
lower net price of the drug.

    It is important to note that delinking PBM and plan sponsor 
reimbursement from drug prices would become far less of a problem if 
some basic changes are made limiting the amount of PBM retained 
rebates, reducing the amount of PBM retained spread pricing, and 
limiting the means and manner of how PBMs could extract fees from drug 
manufacturers. Importantly, PBMs currently seek to rely on the Discount 
Safe Harbor to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute to justify their 
receipt and retention of rebates. Reconfiguring the Discount Safe 
Harbor to place limitations on how PBMs can obtain and keep rebates and 
other payments, other than amounts paid for the fair market value 
(``FMV'') of commercially reasonable administrative services performed 
by the PBM on behalf of the manufacturer in a manner that does not take 
into consideration the volume or value of drugs bought and sold via the 
PBM relationship, would likely have a direct and immediate impact on 
the cost of drugs.

    Question. Apart from PBM payments and services, where else in the 
supply chain do compensation structures rely on drug pricing 
benchmarks, and how should policymakers consider addressing these 
dynamics?

    Answer. While PBMs and affiliates stand to profit most from the 
high list price of drugs--siphoning off as much as 60 percent or more 
of the cost of drug in certain circumstances--other stakeholders are 
also compensated based on the price of drugs, and impacts to these 
stakeholders must be considered in structuring any policy reform. For 
example, independent pharmacy providers are often compensated based on 
the list price of a drug in that they are paid ``Average Wholesale 
Price'' minus a contracted percentage (e.g., AWP - 18 percent). If list 
prices are reduced overall without a modification to what is paid to 
providers, it could drastically reduce what pharmacy providers are able 
to take home (i.e., a 3-percent margin on a $100 drug results in far 
lower gross revenue than the same margin on a $1,000 drug). Likewise, 
there is great variance in the acquisition cost of drugs across 
different provider types. A large chain pharmacy will certainly acquire 
drugs at a lower price than a smaller independent provider. Further, 
different providers have different operating cost structures (for 
example, a specialty pharmacy may require significantly more overhead 
than a community retail pharmacy). If there is no mechanism to account 
for these different costs and pricing structures, such a policy change 
could result in additional harm to independent providers. Finally, such 
policy changes must also take note of differences in specific drug 
products. While a reimbursement of actual acquisition cost plus a fixed 
fee dispensing fee might work for a low-cost generic maintenance 
medication, the same principle might not work for a high cost, complex 
hemophilia medication, requiring home delivery and administration. 
These concerns must be contemplated in any move towards a model that 
delinks pharmacy reimbursement from drug costs.
                         transparency measures
    Question. The shortage of meaningful transparency across the 
prescription drug supply chain emerged as a key theme throughout the 
March 30th hearing. Most hearing attendees signaled that patients, 
policymakers, providers, plans, and researchers require additional 
information and data points in order to inform decision-making and 
reduce costs.

    With respect to Medicare Part D, what additional information could 
PBMs and their subsidiary organizations supply to plan sponsors in 
order to enhance competition and drive down consumer costs without 
compromising credibly proprietary trade secrets?

    Answer. Plan sponsors must be given statutory rights to audit PBMs 
and their subsidiary GPOs or ``rebate aggregators.'' Part D plans need 
to know the total amount that the PBM or aggregator ``retains.'' Rebate 
aggregators are PBM subcontracted (and affiliated) entities that serve 
as intermediaries between a PBM, pharmaceutical manufacturer and plan 
sponsor. The aggregator negotiates and collects rebates and other 
manufacturer derived revenue. PBMs must be compelled to disclose to 
Part D Plans all rebates and other manufacturer revenue, including, for 
example, administrative fees and data fees, their rebate aggregators 
have received on their behalf, regardless of whether they have been 
retained or passed on to the Part D Plan. Of note, the annual DIR 
Reports submitted by plan sponsors to CMS contemplate PBM disclosure of 
both rebates and fees \12\ retained by PBMs. However, the DIR Reports 
fall short of requiring disclosure of rebates retained by rebate 
aggregators and do not mention other types of fees that manufacturers 
remit to PBMs and rebate aggregators (e.g., data fees, price protection 
fees, access fees, etc.). These forms of manufacturer derived revenue 
should not qualify as trade secrets, which would allow PBMs to avoid 
disclosure. All manufacturer derived revenue other than reasonable 
manufacturer administrative fees should be provided to the Plan 
Sponsors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ These fees are either reported as DIR or fees that are in 
excess of bona fide service fees.

    Question. What additional information could policymakers direct 
plan sponsors, PBMs, and other supply-chain participants to supply to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
beneficiaries in order to improve consumer choice and access?

    Answer. Unlike nearly every other market, where a consumer can 
easily compare the costs of one product against a competitor, patients 
seeking to make informed decisions regarding their health care (and how 
they will pay for it) are largely unable to discern the true costs of 
their health care. PBMs, as middlemen, have access to information that 
would enhance competition and improve consumer choice. Yet, they keep 
this information largely hidden from the public eye and scrutiny.

    It is recommended that PBMs be required to report to both 
manufacturers and plans all ``retained rebates'' by the PBM (or its 
affiliated or contracted rebate aggregator). Policymakers should 
mandate that PBMs disclose instances where beneficiaries are pushed to 
high cost, highly rebated brand medications rather than generic 
alternatives to plan sponsors and beneficiaries. PBMs use copay 
tiering, formulary exclusion and rebates to push highly rebated drugs 
to the exclusions of cheaper, generic alternatives, often increasing 
the cost to both beneficiaries and the Plan. Likewise, PBMs should be 
mandated to provide an expansive network of specialty and mail-order 
pharmacies. PBMs should not be able to ``market'' to Medicare or 
Medicaid beneficiaries suggesting the beneficiary should switch 
pharmacies. HIPAA should be clarified to prevent communication from 
PDPs or PBMs to 
Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries that are truly ``marketing'' the PBM's 
affiliate pharmacy. Regularly, PBMs require beneficiaries utilize PBM-
affiliated mail-order and/or specialty pharmacies, regardless of cost 
or the best interest of the patient. PBMs should disclose to plan 
sponsors the rebate and spread pricing profits the PBM and its 
affiliated pharmacy earn by servicing the plan's beneficiaries, 
compared to an independent pharmacy. Differential pricing (described 
above) should be banned. Plan sponsors need accurate data to determine 
whether utilizing PBM-affiliated pharmacies is cost effective and in 
the best interest of beneficiaries, compared to independent pharmacies. 
We further recommend that policymakers mandate that PBMs submit a 
report of all pharmacies that have been denied access into the PBMs' 
mail-order or specialty pharmacy networks, on an annual basis.
                            pharmacy access
    Question. In your written testimony, you noted that statutory and 
regulatory ``any willing pharmacy'' requirements have created 
ambiguities and challenges, particularly for community pharmacies. How, 
specifically, should Congress and/or relevant Federal agencies clarify 
or otherwise update ``any willing pharmacy'' standards to ensure 
beneficiary access and meaningful market competition?

    Answer. As was mentioned in response to a question posed by Senator 
Wyden, we believe there are several steps that can be taken by Congress 
and/or the appropriate Federal agencies to clarify and update ``any 
willing pharmacy'' standards under Medicare. Such steps would achieve 
the laudable goals of (1) ensuring beneficiary access, and (2) allowing 
for and increasing ``healthy'' market competition. As a threshold 
recommendation, Medicare's Any Willing Provider Law (``AWPL''), which 
is codified at 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395w-104, should be amended to expressly 
apply to PBMs--it currently expressly applies to PDPs. This change will 
preclude PBMs from taking the position that the AWPL does not apply to 
PBMs, a common argument. We also recommend amending the AWPL to require 
PBMs to admit all qualified pharmacy providers and to expressly state 
that the AWPL requires patients to be permitted the option of using the 
pharmacy provider of their choice regardless of whether that provider 
is a PBM affiliated provider. This modification is without cost to the 
government because such a requirement is already codified in 42 U.S.C. 
Sec. 1395a. We further recommend that Congress amend the AWPL to 
include mandatory ``reasonable and relevant'' terms and conditions and 
to provide a framework for determining reasonable reimbursement for 
Medicare pharmacy providers. We recommend that a framework include:

         Amending Medicare Part D laws, including Medicare's Any 
        Willing Provider Law (``AWPL''), codified at 42 U.S.C. 
        Sec. 1395w-104, to expressly extend such requirements directly 
        to PBMs.
         Prohibit reimbursement to pharmacy providers below their 
        drug acquisition cost. If a PBM reimburses a pharmacy provider 
        below its acquisition cost, documentation provided by the 
        pharmacy provider showing that reimbursement was below 
        acquisition cost shall result in a presumption that the 
        reimbursement was unreasonable. This is already set forth to a 
        degree within the Part D Manual and would be largely codifying 
        and strengthening existing Medicare guidance.
         Reimbursement at or above cost shall be considered but one 
        factor in determining if reimbursement was reasonable.
         PBMs cannot meet the obligations of the AWPL by merely 
        maintaining a network with ``convenient access'' to retail 
        pharmacies. This ensures the PBMs cannot point to the fact that 
        their wholly-owned pharmacies have agreed to participate as 
        evidence that terms and conditions are reasonable and relevant.
         Expand the scope of the application of the AWPL to other 
        health-care providers and not limited to licensed pharmacies.
         Requirement of a mandatory reasonable dispensing fee 
        reflective of the value the health-care provider added in 
        dispensing the medication with prohibitions on ``$0.00'' 
        dispensing fees. These dispensing fees must take into account 
        the type of medication (a dispensing fee for a straightforward 
        maintenance medication should not be the same as the dispensing 
        fee for a high-touch, complex specialty medication), as well as 
        the type of provider (the cost structure for a dual-accredited 
        specialty pharmacy will not be the same for a PBM-owned chain 
        retail pharmacy).
         To the extent any performance metrics are implemented by 
        PBMs that impact reimbursement, such performance metrics must 
        be ``reasonable and relevant'' as applied to a particular 
        pharmacy provider to ensure (1) that pharmacy providers' 
        performance is being measured on a level playing field, e.g., 
        not measuring specialty pharmacies or community oncology 
        providers' performances against retail pharmacies' performance; 
        not measuring independent pharmacy performance against large 
        chain pharmacies; and (2) performance metrics should be clearly 
        reported at the claim level and cannot favor the PBM 
        corporately affiliated pharmacies.
         Require PBM contracts to include a practical mechanism for 
        pharmacy providers to resolve disputes regarding: (1) 
        unreasonable reimbursement, and (2) the reasonableness and 
        relevance of PBM terms and conditions. Requirements should 
        include (i) mandatory minimum timeline for PBMs to respond, and 
        (ii) prohibitions on retaliation, including network exclusion

        existing regulatory and subregulatory guidance from CMS

    Question. What other steps should Congress consider taking to 
mitigate the risk of patient steering or other alleged practices that 
undermine competition?

    Answer. To mitigate the risk of patient steering and other PBM 
practices that undermine competition, Congress can enact legislation 
banning PBM patient steering. In fact, several States have enacted such 
legislation which provides a good template for legislation on the issue 
of patient steering. One such example is Georgia. Specifically, 
Georgia's anti-steering law, Ga. Code Ann. Sec. 26-4-119, prohibits 
pharmacies from presenting claims for reimbursement that were received 
pursuant to a referral from an affiliated PBM, and Ga. Code Ann. 
Sec. 33-64-11 prevents PBMs from forcing patients to get their 
prescriptions filled at a PBM-affiliated pharmacy including specialty 
pharmacies, with a limited exception regarding certain limited 
distribution drugs. Although pharmacies can often bring a claim against 
a PBM based on compliance with laws contractual provisions, some PBMs 
have been successful in defeating these kinds of claims.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ See, e.g., United/Xcel-RX, LLC v. Express Scripts, Inc., 2019 
WL 5536806, at *4 (E.D. Mo. Oct. 25, 2019).

    As with any legislation governing PBMs, pharmacies would need a way 
to enforce such laws, either through a private right of action, or a 
direct complaint process to the agency responsible for enforcing the 
law (or both) which would require the agency to investigate complaints. 
Such a process would also include a reasonable deadline for a final 
decision, and a right of judicial review for aggrieved parties. At the 
same time, Congress should require PBM contracts with pharmacy 
providers to include a practical mechanism for pharmacy providers to 
resolve disputes regarding: (1) unreasonable reimbursement, and (2) the 
reasonableness and relevance of PBM terms and conditions. This is a 
codification and strengthening of existing CMS regulations and sub-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
regulatory guidance.

    Additionally, Congress can enact a ban on the use of patient 
information to engage in trolling and hijacking activity, like that 
conduct at issue in the Trone Health Services v. Express Scripts matter 
that the Eighth Circuit failed to find gave rise to a cause of 
action.\14\ Congress can and should create a prohibition on PBMs 
requiring patient information that is not necessary to adjudicate 
claims, because this is the information that PBMs use to troll and 
hijack patients to force them into the PBMs' own specialty pharmacies. 
Additionally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(``HIPAA'') should be clarified to prevent communication from PDPs or 
PBMs to Medicare/Medicaid beneficiaries that are truly ``marketing'' 
the PBMs' affiliate pharmacies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ Trone Health Services, Inc. v. Express Scripts Holding 
Company, 974 F.3d 845 (2020).

    With respect to the greater overall problem of PBM market dominance 
that itself undermines competition, Congress should consider strong 
antitrust legislation that prevents the kind of consolidation causing 
these issues, and legislation that mitigates the oversized market power 
currently recognized by PBMs, such as legislation guaranteeing 
reasonable reimbursement for pharmacies, and creating causes of action 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
for pharmacies that suffer these kinds of abuses.

    Question. Innovative contracting mechanisms can drive better value 
for consumers and taxpayers. That said, performance-based contracts 
should assess providers on meaningful metrics aligned with both 
clinical and cost considerations. How, specifically, could Federal 
policymakers provide sufficient flexibility for performance-based 
contracting between PBMs and pharmacies while increasing clarity and 
cohesion?

    Answer. To the extent any performance metrics are implemented by 
PBMs that impact reimbursement, such performance metrics must be 
reasonable and relevant as applied to a particular provider to ensure 
(1) providers' performance is being measured on a level playing field, 
(e.g., not measuring specialty pharmacies or community oncology 
providers' performances against retail pharmacies' performance; not 
measuring independent pharmacy performance against large chain 
pharmacies); (2) performance metrics should be clearly reported at the 
claim level and cannot favor the PBM associated pharmacies; and (3) 
providers are not penalized financially for medical decision making 
that is in a patient's best interest and, in many cases medically 
necessary.

    As noted above, Federal policymakers should require PBM contracts 
to include a practical mechanism for providers to resolve disputes 
regarding (1) unreasonable reimbursement, and (2) the reasonableness 
and relevance of PBM terms and conditions. Requirements should include 
(i) mandatory minimum timeline for PBMs to respond; (ii) an ability for 
providers to resolve disputes in a court of competent jurisdiction; 
(iii) an ability for providers with common disputes to resolve disputes 
with PBMs on a consolidated basis; and (iv) prohibitions on retaliation 
for such disputes, such as network exclusion or punitive reduction of 
reimbursement.

    PBMs must not be permitted to reimburse wholly owned and/or 
affiliated pharmacy operations in a more beneficial manner as compared 
to non-owned and/or affiliated pharmacy operations which shall include, 
but not necessarily be limited to, prohibiting reimbursing an owned 
and/or affiliated pharmacy operation more than non-owned and/or 
affiliated pharmacy operations.

    Congress should provide CMS with enforcement mechanisms that 
include a right of providers to report PBM non-compliance with these 
obligations to CMS for further investigation with provider protections 
from adverse action or retaliation by PBMs for such reporting. 
Enforcement mechanisms should include the right for CMS to impose 
monetary penalties for noncompliance.
      pbm-owned group purchasing organizations/rebate aggregators
    Question. Recent years have seen the emergence of a number of PBM-
owned or affiliated group purchasing organizations (GPOs), often known 
as rebate aggregators, through which certain PBMs have reportedly 
outsourced some of their functions, including with respect to 
manufacturer negotiations. How do these organizations differ from 
traditional GPOs, what are their implications for the broader 
prescription drug supply chain (and for patients), and what additional 
information should policymakers seek to collect and/or monitor with 
respect to these entities?

    Answer. Rebate aggregators owned by or affiliated with PBMs are not 
purchasing an item or service and do not share any meaningful 
similarities with traditional GPOs. Traditional GPOs were established 
to help recognize cost savings and efficiencies by aggregating 
purchasing volume. Rebate aggregators owned by PBMs, which are 
sometimes misleadingly referred to as GPOs, are aggregating claims to 
extract rebates from the manufacturers. Rebate aggregators do not meet 
the definition of GPO under the AKS GPO Safe Harbor, which specifically 
states, ``[n]ote that for purposes of paragraph (j) of this section, 
the term group purchasing organization (GPO) means an entity authorized 
to act as a purchasing agent for a group of individuals or entities who 
are furnishing services for which payment may be made in whole or in 
part under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health-care programs, 
and who are neither wholly-owned by the GPO nor subsidiaries of a 
parent corporation that wholly owns the GPO (either directly or through 
another wholly-owned entity).'' In many instances (if not all) 
instances, rebates and fees paid by manufacturers to the rebate 
aggregators are not visible to the plan sponsors/plans (unless the 
plans are PBM-owned/affiliated plans). The rebates and fees that are 
retained by the rebate aggregators contribute to ever increasing drug 
spend and patients' out-of-pocket expense.

    It was reported that the gross-to-net bubble would exceed $200 
billion in the calendar year 2021.\15\ The term ``gross-to-net bubble'' 
refers to the dollar gap between gross sales of brand-name drugs at 
list prices and their sales at net prices after rebates and other 
reductions. In other words, the gross-to-net bubble is demonstrative of 
the rebates paid by manufacturers to PBMs in exchange of having their 
drugs on the PBM's drug formulary. However, it is clear that at least a 
portion, if not most of these rebates are retained at the PBM level, 
rather than passed through to the benefit of plans and patients.

    The Securities and Exchange Commission should mandate that PBMs 
disclose in their SEC filings revenue and expense derived from rebate 
aggregators including the rebates and the rebates passed through to 
plans. The retained rebate should be considered profit, no matter how 
creatively the PBM defines the revenue. Also, policymakers can require 
PBMs and their rebate aggregators--regardless of whether they maintain 
headquarters in foreign countries--to report the same data to 
government agencies and plan sponsors. By way of example, the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act can be modified to impose prescription 
drug spend reporting obligations upon PBMs and rebate aggregators (the 
current version of the Act imposes reporting obligations upon the 
plans). Those reporting obligations should be a plan specific and not 
on an aggregate basis. Similarly, the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 requires entities like PBMs to disclose the 
sources of all direct and indirect compensation that PBMs and their 
subcontractors (which would include rebate aggregators) will receive. 
However, this provision would be strengthened by explicitly requiring 
PBMs to disclose the precise amount of compensation rebate aggregators 
retain from manufacturers rather than an aggregated total amount of 
compensation. Such disclosure requirements should also be extended to

brokers and/or consultants.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell
                          market manipulation
    Question. The three largest PBMs control 80 percent of the total 
market share by adjusted claims. We know that market competition leads 
to lower prices and better quality outcomes for consumers, and the PBM 
market is no different. In addition to consolidating market share, PBMs 
have also been merging with other players in the drug distribution 
chain. Today, the four largest PBMs also own their own affiliate 
insurers and pharmacies, which creates an obvious conflict of interest. 
PBMs are responsible for developing and maintaining formularies for 
health insurers, while contracting with individual pharmacies to 
reimburse for drugs dispensed.

    How are PBMs supposed to act in good faith when there is a clear 
financial incentive to, for example, include higher priced drugs in 
their formularies even though a cheaper generic is available, so that 
its affiliate insurers can charge a higher premium or coinsurance? The 
answer is, they don't.

    With their massive market influence and vertically integrated 
structure, the big PBMs exert pressure on every part of the drug 
distribution chain. They can demand more rebates from manufacturers, 
exclude pharmacies from their networks if they don't fully comply with 
their one-sided terms, and require insurance companies to utilize step 
therapy or prior authorization. All of this means that the patient at 
the end receives inferior care, while also paying more.

    I am very concerned about the situation where PBMs use 
anticompetitive tactics such as spread pricing to drive smaller 
independent pharmacies out of business. Then they buy the pharmacies to 
integrate them into their sprawling businesses.

    I am working on a bill with Senator Grassley, the Pharmacy Benefit 
Manager Transparency Act, which would shine a light on bad PBM 
practices. Does my bill have adequate enforcement authority to address 
the anticompetitive practices PBMs use on pharmacies that I mentioned?

    Answer. The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2023 would 
make material improvements to the transparency of the U.S. health-care 
system, including by eliminating the use of spread pricing and 
arbitrary, unfair, and deceptive fees and reimbursement reductions on 
providers. The bill provides the Federal Trade Commission and the 
States (through State Attorney Generals or other State officials) 
authority to enforce the provisions of the Act. The Act also provides 
for whistleblower protections for employees reporting violations of the 
Act to government officials. However, PBMs have demonstrated a record 
of refusing to comply with applicable laws or challenging the 
implementation of any law that negatively impacts them financially. As 
such, Congress should consider including private enforcement mechanisms 
into the statutory text of the Act. Reliance on the Federal Trade 
Commission and State officials is not enough, as in many cases the 
specific parties injured by PBM violations of the Act will be health-
care providers who are at the forefront of providing care to patients. 
In addition, Congress should include antiretaliation protections for 
providers who assert claims under the Act against PBMs, similar to the 
protections included in the current text of the bill offered to 
whistleblowers.

    Question. Which other part of the drug distribution chain can this 
bill be used to address anticompetitive practices on?

    Answer. The Pharmacy Benefits Transparency Act of 2023 addresses 
many of the significant anticompetitive practices used by PBMs 
including, but not limited to, arbitrary and unfair fees and clawbacks 
charged to unaffiliated pharmacies, complicated and opaque provider 
reimbursement methodologies, and formulary rebates. The Federal Trade 
Commission's PBM Inquiry seeks information related to these same 
anticompetitive practices. In addition, the Act could be used to 
address PBM anticompetitive practices related to patient steering; a 
practice whereby PBMs directly or indirectly channel patients and 
prescription volume to PBM-affiliated pharmacies and away from 
unaffiliated pharmacies. These practices include, but are not limited 
to, requiring patients to use a particular mail-order pharmacy, 
exclusive provider networks, ``preferred'' provider networks that are 
only accessible by PBM-
affiliated pharmacies, and discounts to patients offered only if they 
receive their prescription from a PBM-affiliated pharmacy. Note that 
due to the limited distribution model of the specialty drug 
distribution chain, certain exceptions might be necessary for limited 
distribution specialty drugs.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
    Question. The Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Transparency Act (S. 
127) requires transparency reporting by PBMs (or an affiliate, 
subsidiary, or agent of a PBM) to shine sunlight on prices and fees 
associated with prescription drugs. Why is transparency reporting by 
middlemen, such as PBMs, important to ensuring taxpayers and patients 
are getting the lowest drug price and associated fees possible?

    Answer. Transparency reporting by PBMs is critical for patients to 
make fully informed decisions about all options truly available to 
them, not just the options available according to the patient's PBM. 
True transparency will facilitate a better understanding of the true 
and actual costs of patients' medications. Once a patient has such an 
understanding, they can select the provider of their choosing. The 
current lack of transparency in the PBM industry has led to hidden fees 
(such as DIR fees assessed on pharmacies and manufacturers but 
improperly excluded from Medicare Part D Bids), inflated drug prices, 
and conflicts of interest. PBMs negotiate drug prices with 
manufacturers, set reimbursement rates for pharmacies, and decide which 
drugs are covered under a plan's formulary, but hold no obligation to 
share this highly relevant information with the patients and public it 
impacts. In the absence of transparency, it is difficult for patients, 
providers, and plan sponsors to understand the factors that influence 
drug pricing and access to medications.

    Question. The Prescription Pricing for the People Act (S. 113) and 
PBM Transparency Act (S. 127) require the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) to look into the vertical integration that is occurring in the 
pharmaceutical supply chain. Why is that important?

    Answer. Requiring the FTC to look into vertical integration in the 
pharmaceutical supply chain is important because the FTC is the agency, 
next to the DOJ, best equipped to understand the anticompetitive 
effects of vertical integration. The FTC also is charged with enforcing 
section 5 of the FTC Act prohibiting Unfair Competition and is 
therefore the appropriate agency to enforce any violations. Using this 
enforcement power, the FTC should focus specifically on the unfair 
trade practices PBMs use to dominate the marketplace and further 
consolidate power to the exclusion of independent providers.

    These unfair trade practices include, but are not limited to PBMs' 
power to control formularies for plans, thereby channeling lucrative 
rebates to themselves and affiliated plans; controlling network access 
for independent pharmacies that the PBMs compete with through their 
affiliate pharmacies; controlling benefit design to their own 
advantage; profiting from ``no-bid'' contracts from affiliate plans; 
setting draconian and inefficient purchasing limits and restrictions on 
who network providers may source drugs from; and engaging in 
``differential'' pricing that advantages their affiliated pharmacies 
over competitors. All of these unfair trade practices and more can be 
investigated, and the FTC can use its section 5 authority to regulate 
against such practices.

    Question. How does vertical integration impact the prices patients 
and taxpayers pay for prescription drugs?

    Answer. Evidence suggests market consolidation, including vertical 
integration, has contributed to rising costs and lower-quality 
care.\16\ Vertical integration affects the prices patients and 
taxpayers pay for drugs in multiple ways. When vertically integrated 
payers use their market leverage to demand higher rebates from 
manufacturers, distortions occur. Manufactures that do not comply with 
the PBM's rebate demands will see their drugs have higher copay, prior 
authorization, step edits or claims denials. More efficacious, less 
toxic, and cheaper drugs are often disincentivized by PBMs in exchange 
for more highly rebated drugs. This results in other less rebated 
drugs--including generic and biosimilar drugs--being placed on lower 
formulary tiers, or having higher copay, step edit, prior authorization 
or being entirely excluded.\17\ Drugs with a lower list price are 
excluded from formulary because the PBM receives a higher rebate from a 
more expensive drug. This costs patients and taxpayers more when their 
coinsurance is based on the list price, or when patients with a high-
deductible plan must pay out of pocket for drugs at list price. In the 
context of Medicare Part D, higher list prices for covered prescription 
drugs pushes beneficiaries through the Part D benefit phases quicker, 
and into the Part D ``donut hole'' and catastrophic coverage phases, 
where patients, taxpayers and drug manufacturers pick up large portions 
of the tab, while the plan sponsors pay less.

    Question. Do spread pricing and clawbacks performed by PBMs (or an 
affiliate, subsidiary, or agent of a PBM) impact the prices patients 
and taxpayers pay for prescription drugs? If so, how? Additionally, how 
do spread pricing and clawback practices differ within the commercial 
insurance market compared to within the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Medicaid/Medicare programs?

    Answer. Yes, both spread pricing and clawbacks harm patients and 
taxpayers by raising prices at the point of sale ``pharmacy counter.'' 
Spread pricing increases premiums and drug prices for patients.\18\ 
Because spread pricing creates a perverse incentive for PBMs to set an 
overall higher price for drugs, including generic drugs (from which 
patients normally expect to see the highest savings), patients face 
higher prices than they would if the PBM was not incentivized to raise 
prices in this manner.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ Frier Levitt, PBM Expose at 60.
    \19\ Id.

    Clawbacks, including DIR fees and ``effective rates'' (Generic 
Effective Rates, or GER, and Brand Effective Rates, or BER), also harm 
patients through raising their out-of-pocket costs in multiple ways. 
With DIR, recall that the price reported to CMS as the ``negotiated 
price'' at the point of sale does not include the DIR fees. Therefore, 
the patient pays coinsurance (which is a percentage of the list price) 
based on the higher list price, which is later reduced by DIR after the 
patient paid their coinsurance. If the patient paid coinsurance on the 
lower, post-DIR price, the patient would have a lower coinsurance. DIR 
fees would otherwise lower the negotiated price if applied at the point 
of sale--but from 2016 through 2023, PBMs were able to profit from DIR. 
This means patients--especially vulnerable patients with the most 
serious disease states--pay a higher out-of-pocket coinsurance based on 
the artificially inflated prices paid at the point of sale, created by 
the DIR. This harms the patient, but also harms taxpayers, because it 
forces the patient into the ``donut hole'' and catastrophic coverage 
more quickly, where the government bears a higher price burden and PBMs 
bear a lower burden.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ Frier Levitt, PBM Expose at 25.

    Effective rates also harm patients in the same way DIR fees do--by 
raising the gross price of medications and forcing patients to pay 
higher out-of-pocket fees at the point of sale before the effective 
rate is clawed back from the PBM.\21\ Unlike DIR fees, which apply only 
to Part D, effective rates affect commercial patients as well as 
Medicare beneficiaries.

    Question. Does the current consolidated PBM market hurt or help 
community pharmacies who serve rural or underserved areas? When a 
community pharmacy closes or a patient cannot access a community 
pharmacy due to being out of network, how does this impact patient 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
access?

    Answer. The current PBM market hurts community providers in rural 
areas. PBMs' excessive market power results in low reimbursement that 
often does not cover the cost of goods.\22\ Such low reimbursement from 
PBMs means that these pharmacies cannot sustain their business. 
Additionally, rural pharmacies are disproportionately affected by MAC 
pricing, because these pharmacies typically do not have access to the 
products receiving lower MAC pricing, causing underwater reimbursement 
for the pharmacies.\23\ This results in rural pharmacies being forced 
to close.\24\

    Additionally, even urban pharmacies can represent underserved 
communities. One such pharmacy--Mission Wellness, based in San 
Francisco--is a minority- and woman-owned pharmacy serving a population 
of underprivileged, often unhoused persons suffering from HIV/AIDS and 
hepatitis. In 2019, Mission Wellness brought an arbitration against 
Caremark because the underwater rates caused by Caremark's DIR program 
was putting the pharmacy out of business. Mission Wellness eventually 
won an award of its full damages and attorneys' fees against Caremark, 
but Caremark has moved to vacate that award (as is typical for Caremark 
when it loses in arbitration), thus prolonging Mission Wellness's wait 
for the infusion of money it desperately needs to remain afloat. All 
this information is available--including the arbitration award--on the 
public docket in the Federal action to confirm (and Caremark's cross-
motion to vacate) the arbitration award. The case and related 
proceedings can be found at Mission Wellness Pharmacy LLC v. Caremark

    When a community pharmacy closes or a patient cannot access the 
pharmacy, this negatively affects patient access. ``[S]mall pharmacies

    Question. Since 2017, 23 States have passed various forms of 
prescription drug transparency laws that require PBMs to report certain 
data (according to National Academy for State Health Policy). Do any of 
these States have effective PBM transparency laws that should be 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
replicated at the Federal level? Why are they effective?

    Answer. Although Senator Grassley's and Cantwell's PBM Transparency 
Bill is thorough and would provide much-needed PBM transparency in its 
present form, State transparency laws are particularly effective to the 
extent they give providers audit rights. For example, Indiana passed an 
act (2020 Ind. Legis. Serv. Pub. L. 68-2020 (S.E.A. 241)), effective 
July 1, 2020, which, among other things, prohibits PBMs from 
reimbursing PBM-affiliated pharmacies more than unaffiliated 
pharmacies, requires PBMs to disclose the amount of rebates they 
receive for drug products, and provides yearly audit rights for all 
parties contracting with a PBM to view the rates at which any other 
pharmacy in the network is being reimbursed and the amount of rebates a 
PBM has received for drug products. This provides for some direct 
transparency to independent pharmacies and plans, allowing each to 
independently determine whether the PBM is complying with the law. This 
level of transparency at the Federal level would greatly strengthen 
transparency for both providers and plans.

    Question. Beginning in 2016, the Texas Department of Insurance 
began public reporting on the use of manufacturers' rebates and other 
payments to PBMs. Similarly, beginning in 2020, the Iowa Insurance 
Division began publicly reporting on the use of manufacturers' rebates 
and other payments to PBMs. Other States have conducted similar public 
reporting. According to an analysis of the Texas data (https://
www.tdi.texas.gov/reports/report3.html), PBMs retained 7 percent to 21 
percent of manufacturers' rebate and other payments between 2016-2021. 
Similar data has been reported in Iowa (https://iid.iowa.gov/pbm-
annual-reports). Is this public reporting accurately capturing the 
amount of rebates and other payments retained by PBMs (or an affiliate, 
subsidiary, or agent of a PBM)? If not, how might policy makers 
accurately capture the amount of revenue retained by PBMs (or an 
affiliate, subsidiary, or agent of a PBM)?

    Answer. The public reporting does not always fully or accurately 
capture the amount of rebates and other payments retained by PBMs and 
rebate aggregators. For example, the Texas Insurance Code section 
1369.502 requires PBMs to file a report with the Texas Insurance 
Commissioner concerning rebates, fees, and other payments received by a 
PBM. However, the statute only requires PBMs to submit, among other 
things, the aggregated rebates, fees, price protection payments, and 
any other payments collected from pharmaceutical drug manufacturers to 
PBMs.\26\ Thus, portions of manufacturer revenue retained by PBM 
affiliates, subsidiaries, or agents are not captured by the mandatory 
reports. States should require plan specific, NDC-level reporting of 
rebates and fees paid by manufacturers to PBMs and PBMs' rebate 
aggregators.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \26\ See Tx. Ins. Code Sec. 1369.502.

    Question. Why do PBMs own or operate affiliated organization such 
as group purchasing organizations or rebate aggregators? What do these 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
entities do?

    Answer. PBMs created rebate aggregators as another level of opacity 
and possibly to avoid mandatory statutory reporting that expressly 
applies to PBMs, but has not ``caught up to'' the creation of rebate 
aggregators. See above for the problem as it relates to Medicare 
reporting of retained rebates. PBM contracts with plan sponsors are 
carefully drafted by PBMs. PBMs contractually promise to turn over to 
the plan sponsor all ``rebates'' that the ``PBM receives.'' PBM 
contracts conceal that the PBM has subcontracted to its affiliate 
company--the rebate aggregator--the task of actually receiving the 
rebate from the manufacturer. PBMs do not reveal to the plan sponsor 
the amount of rebate retained by the aggregator.

    The advent of the rebate aggregator may also be connected to a 
desire by PBMs to avoid the reach of United States laws. Two of the 
major rebate aggregators are based in foreign countries. (Express 
Scripts/Ascent Health Services in Switzerland; OptumRx/Emisar Pharma 
Services in Ireland).

    It is also worth noting that, in the Ohio Attorney General's 
complaint recently filed against Ascent Health Services, among others, 
the Attorney General alleges that Express Scripts and Prime created 
Ascent Health Services to ``use it as a vehicle to share pricing, to 
the detriment of other market participants, including individual 
purchasers of medications like insulin.'' Indeed, PBMs often utilize 
affiliated rebate aggregators as a means to keep certain manufacturer 
derived revenue, including, but not limited to rebates, hidden from 
their plan sponsor clients to preserve the illusion that plan sponsors 
are receiving 100 percent of rebates paid by manufacturers. Regularly, 
PBM-affiliated rebate aggregators retain a portion of rebates paid by 
manufacturers, but PBMs keep the rebate aggregator-retained portion 
hidden from plan sponsors. This occurs with respect to Medicare Part D 
plans as equally as it does in commercial contexts.

    Question. In 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a report (titled, 
``Gaps in Oversight of Conflicts of Interest in Medicare Prescription 
Drug Decisions'') recommending that each Medicare Part D plan's 
Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (P&T) have members who are free of 
conflict from PBMs. HHS OIG specifically recommended that a Medicare 
Part D plan's P&T committee should be free of conflict with any PBM 
that manages the plan's prescription drug benefit. Since this 
recommendation was issued in 2013, CMS updated some conflict of 
interest policies, but not this recommendation. Should CMS require some 
(or all) P&T committee members be free of conflict with any PBM?

    Answer. Yes. CMS should require Medicare Part D Plan P&T committee 
members to be free of conflict with any PBM. P&T committee are 
primarily responsible for making formulary decisions, significantly 
affecting beneficiary access to specific prescription drugs. PBMs use 
formulary exclusion and rebates to push highly rebated drugs to the 
exclusions of cheaper, generic alternatives, often increasing the cost 
to both beneficiaries and the Plan. This preference for high-cost brand 
drugs stems from consistently increasing drug rebates from 
manufacturers, which PBMs typically only earn on branded drugs. Thus, 
because of the perverse incentives for PBMs to select expensive branded 
medications over cheaper alternatives, CMS should require that Medicare 
Part D P&T committee members--who are directly responsible for the 
selection of which branded and generic medications will be covered on 
the formulary--be free of any conflict with any PBM.

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Tim Scott
    Question. I have heard concerns from Federally Qualified Health 
Centers in my State that some PBMs may be intentionally reimbursing 
340B pharmacies at lower rates than non-340B pharmacies for 
prescription drugs simply because these health centers receive a 340B 
discount. Is this the case and, if so, why is that and how common is 
this practice?

    Answer. The 340B program's purpose is ``to enable covered entities 
to stretch scarce Federal resources as far as possible, reaching more 
eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services.''\27\ It 
is fundamental to 340B that Covered Entities, which include Federally 
Qualified Health Centers, are credited for their ability to ``provide 
direct clinical care to large numbers of uninsured Americans'' 
regardless of the patient's ability to pay.\28\ The Health Resources 
and Services Administration (``HRSA''), the agency charged with 
administering 340B, has opined that 340B is designed so that Covered 
Entities would ``pass all or significant part of the discount to their 
patients.''\29\ Thus, the clear purpose of 340B is that uninsured, 
poor, and otherwise vulnerable patients would benefit by receiving 
discounted drugs or charity care.

Act of 1992; Contract Pharmacy Services, 61 Fed. Reg. 43551 (August 23, 
1996).

    PBMs, however, have warped the incentives of the 340B program by 
intentionally reimbursing 340B pharmacies at rates lower than the PBM's 
reimbursement rates for non-340B claims. Relatedly, many PBMs also 
require 340B pharmacies to identify which claims are 340B at the time 
of claim adjudication, to enable the PBM to apply the reduced 340B 
reimbursement rate. These practices are common across many of the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nation's largest PBMs.

    For example, the PBM OptumRx's 2023 Provider Manual, which is a 
publicly available document, explicitly States that OptumRx has the 
right to adjust its reimbursement rates for 340B pharmacies:

        To the extent Network Pharmacy Provider, during the term of any 
        renewal term of the Agreement, is owned operated or contracted 
        with an eligible 340B [Covered Entity] to purchase outpatient 
        Drug Products from drug manufacturers or wholesalers at reduced 
        prices for use by eligible members under the Public Health 
        Service Act, section 340(B) program, Network Pharmacy Provider 
        shall immediately provide [OptumRx] with written notice of such 
        eligibility.

        The parties acknowledge/agree [OptumRx] shall be entitled to 
        modify the rates, fees, as well as other reimbursements offered 
        to Network Pharmacy Provider hereunder in accordance with the 
        [Provider Manual] and/or Agreement to the extent Network 
        Pharmacy Provider becomes eligible to purchase Drug Products 
        under the Public Health Service Act, section 340(B) program. 
        Failure of Network Pharmacy Provider to notify [OptumRx] of its 
        340(B) eligibility as stated above shall constitute a material 
        breach of the Agreement.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \30\ See 2023 OptumRx Provider Manual, section V.U, 340(B) Program.

    The OptumRx Provider Manual is a quintessential contract of 
adhesion, offered to pharmacies on a take it or leave it basis, and 
with no opportunity to meaningfully negotiate. Similarly, the PBM 
Express Scripts Inc. issued notice in February 2021 requiring 340B 
pharmacies to retrospectively identify 340B claims. Thereafter, Express 
Scripts began to impose significantly lower reimbursement rates for 
340B claims, essentially usurping the savings that should have flowed 
to Covered Entities, even when a PBM-owned or -affiliated pharmacy may 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
not have been the Contract Pharmacy.

    Contrary to the stated intent of the 340B program, reducing 
reimbursement to 340B pharmacies allows the PBMs to capture the 
prescription drug revenues intended to benefit the 340B Covered 
Entities and the poor, uninsured, and otherwise indigent patients they 
serve. In effect, PBMs are essentially transferring the benefit of the 
340B program from safety net providers to for-profit payors. Notably, 
although many States have enacted legislation prohibiting PBMs from 
reducing 340B pharmacy reimbursement, there is currently no Federal 
analogue to prohibit these PBM practices. As such, these practices 
provide a particular area of concern that could be appropriately 
addressed through Federal legislation and rulemaking regarding the 
Federal 340B drug pricing program.

    Question. Regarding dispensing, what barriers exist for patients 
seeking to purchase their preferred medication at their pharmacy of 
choice? What patient groups are most impacted?

    Answer. There are several barriers that exist for patients. For 
example, patients are regularly steered away from their preferred 
provider and instead are pushed to PBM-owned pharmacies. Patients are 
also limited in their availability to seek care from their preferred 
providers when PBMs pay unreasonably low reimbursement to independent 
pharmacies. When a pharmacy cannot operate with a reasonable profit, 
patients may be referred over to PBM owned pharmacies even if this is 
not preferred.

    Unfortunately, the most impacted patient groups are among the 
sickest members of society that require closely coordinated care 
utilizing specialty medications. This includes patients with cancer as 
well as those experiencing health conditions only treated by specialty 
medications that are often some of the costliest medications, which is 
typically indicative of the complex conditions they treat.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. James Lankford
                            finger-pointing
    Question. In this industry, the blame for high drug prices is 
always on someone else:

         The pharmaceutical manufacturers blame PBMs for increasing 
        their list prices through rebates.
         The PBMs blame the pharmaceutical industry for setting 
        prices too high, the PSAOs for taking a cut of the rebate and 
        not working appropriately on behalf of their pharmacy clients, 
        and health plans for demanding certain access and pricing 
        standards.
         PSAOs and pharmacies certainly blame both PBMs and health 
        plans for setting low reimbursement rates, for decreasing 
        patient access to certain drugs, and for clawing back DIR fees.
         Meanwhile, patients do not know who to blame and they likely 
        do not care as long as prices remain high. Patients primarily 
        want to be able to afford the drugs that their doctor 
        prescribed to them and to be able access those drugs at the 
        pharmacy of their choice.

    When many of the players in the supply chain are making claims in 
direct opposition of one another, consumers are more confused and more 
frustrated. Which of the above arguments are true? Are they all 
partially true?

    Answer. While all of the stakeholders mentioned in the above 
question owe sacred obligations to patients and taxpayers to ensure the 
costs of health care are reasonable, the three largest PBMs (which 
control 80 percent of the prescription drug marketplace) are owned by 
corporations which also own (a) health insurance plans; (b) retail and/
or mail order pharmacy operations; (c) massive specialty pharmacy 
operations; (d) drug wholesalers; and (e) rebate aggregators. As one 
example, CVS Health, as a parent corporation, currently owns and 
operates the following entities: Aetna and SilverScript (health 
insurance plans); CVS Caremark (largest PBM); CVS Retail Pharmacy 
Operations (approximately 9,600 locations); CVS mail order pharmacy 
operations; CVS Specialty Pharmacy; and Zinc (rebate aggregator).

    PBMs bear the brunt of responsibility for the high drug prices. 
PBMs are uniquely situated (and heretofore uniquely unchecked) to 
extract money from every other stakeholder in the chain of pharmacy 
operations or alternatively ensure that money that changes hands 
remains in one of the corporately affiliated entities' ``pockets'' 
identified above. PBMs benefit from high list prices set by 
pharmaceutical manufacturers because a drug with a high list price can 
afford higher rebates to secure favorable placement on drug formulary. 
PBMs leverage their control and influence over nearly every aspect of 
the prescription drug supply chain to force unfavorable pricing on 
pharmacies and PSAOs (the pharmacies' contracting agents). The 
companies that own PBMs also own a substantial portion of national 
insurance companies (benefiting from lower provider reimbursement), and 
even where PBMs and plan sponsors are separate entities, PBMs still 
benefit from high drug prices through spread pricing practices and by 
retaining outsized portions of drug manufacturer rebates though the use 
of rebate aggregators/GPOs. Ultimately, patients lose out because PBM 
revenue is used to enrich the largest US companies instead of 
decreasing drug prices at the pharmacy counter. PBMs further decrease 
patients' options to obtain care from independent providers and instead 
force patients to receive medications from their wholly owned pharmacy 
(often through mail order).
                                dir fees
    Question. I have worked with my colleagues on and off this 
committee to end the abusive practice of DIR fee clawbacks for several 
years. I am very thankful that CMS took some level of action with their 
final rule last year, which goes into effect at the start of next year, 
requiring that pharmacy price concessions be moved to the point of 
sale. However, CMS did not go as far as I would argue is necessary by 
not including all fees in a definition of ``negotiated price,'' by not 
establishing standardized pharmacy performance metrics, and by not 
requiring PBM transparency.

    Do you agree that the standardization of how pharmacies are treated 
by PBMs and transparency of a PBM's reimbursement to a pharmacy is a 
necessary final step in making the impact of the CMS DIR final rule 
truly impactful to patients and pharmacies?

    Answer. Yes. CMS's actions to change the definition of ``Negotiated 
Price'' did not go far enough to curb PBM abuses. In fact, recent Part 
D network enrollment forms offered for 2024 include new kinds of fees 
being charged against pharmacies that may prove to violate the new 
definition of ``negotiated price,'' though the customary lack of 
transparency from the PBM that created the new network makes it 
difficult to determine the legality of the program, short of litigation 
and discovery. The fact that PBMs have created a program they believe 
is justifiable under the new ``negotiated price'' definition that 
nevertheless continues to take additional fees from pharmacies above 
and beyond the point of sale reimbursement underscores the incomplete 
nature of the new definition and Rule.

    Additionally, with respect to standardization--to the extent that 
PBMs should measure metrics in a manner that is standard and approved 
by reputable organizations that employ peer-reviewed and proven methods 
for performance measurement--yes, CMS should further require such 
standards. To the extent that these metrics are employed for all 
pharmacies, regardless of whether that pharmacy is a corner retail 
pharmacy or a sophisticated community oncology provider, we disagree 
that the same metrics should be applied to all. Retail metrics simply 
do not and cannot apply to specialty providers, and PBMs refuse to 
develop metrics that can apply to such providers. This appears to be 
the case going into 2024, as the new programs lack transparency, 
uniformity, and predictability, and treat specialty pharmacies as 
though they are retail.

    Congress and CMS should take steps to ensure that current law 
clearly applies to PBMs, mandate additional transparency, prohibit PBM 
practices that provide preferential treatment to their own pharmacies--
including differential pricing and steering--to the detriment of 
patients and independent providers, and requiring greater transparency 
across the board to prevent PBM abuses. Legislators and CMS should take 
steps to prohibit confidential arbitrations of disputes regarding 
Medicare Part D, explicitly allow a private right of action by those 
harmed by PBM actions, prohibit class action waivers and allow disputes 
to be heard in Federal courts to increase necessary transparency in the 
industry, among other recommended changes.
                                tiering
    Question. Currently, some plans have no real order to their 
formulary tiers--placement is simply based on who gave them the highest 
rebate--whether the product is a low-cost generic or a high-cost brand-
name drug. When a branded drug is rebated so heavily that it is placed 
on a more favorable tier than a generic, patients not only lose out on 
a lower-cost drug and often end up paying more in coinsurance, but the 
market for generics is deteriorated.

    The government has worked on policies and the pharmaceutical market 
has put in years of work to incentivize the creation of more accessible 
and affordable generic and biosimilar products. However, the current 
system is sending a message to generic manufacturers--that no matter 
how cheap you sell a drug for, you will still lose out to branded drugs 
and patients will lose out on access to low-cost drugs because an 
artificially lower price through rebates is more affective at reaching 
patients than an actual lower price because of PBM practices.

    How would changes to the way plans and PBMs are structuring 
formularies open up possible savings to patients and what incentives 
may it provide for the increased production of lower-cost generic 
products?

    Answer. The anticompetitive effects and downstream consequences 
faced by beneficiaries of Federal health plans caused by PBMs' 
manipulation of plan formularies to favor branded medications is well 
documented. As a result, although the Federal Government's policies 
have expanded the availability of generic drugs in the marketplace, 
patients are precluding from fully realizing the financial benefits of 
generic medications in part through PBM formularies that are profit 
oriented. These PBM formularies prioritize branded medications over the 
cheaper generic alternatives because these branded medications carry 
significant rebates with them, which the PBMs are paid by the branded 
manufacturers in exchange for favorable formulary placement. PBMs keep 
a share of these rebates, increasing their bottom lines, and pass the 
remainder on to the plans they manage. Notably, generic medications, on 
the other hand, typically do not pay rebates to PBMs. As a result of 
this rebate structure, PBMs are incentivized against managing their 
formularies to obtain the most cost effective benefits for the plan and 
its beneficiaries.

    Although this issue is complex and multifaceted, the following 
represent areas where, if material changes are made, the perverse 
incentives for the preference of expensive branded medications on PBM 
formularies can be alleviated:

        1.  Federal restrictions on the rebates PBMs may retain 
        (directly or indirectly) from drug manufacturers would remove 
        the financial incentive for PBMs to prefer branded medications 
        over generics. These Federal restrictions could take the form 
        of a minimum aggregate rebate amount that a PBM may retain from 
        drug manufacturers, or a prohibition on the retention of 
        rebates entirety. If PBMs are restricted by Federal law from 
        retaining manufacturer rebates, there is less financial 
        incentive for PBMs' preference of the costly branded drugs that 
        carry these rebates.

        2.  Impose fiduciary requirements on PBMs to act in the best 
        interests of the plan sponsors and their beneficiaries.

        3.  Federal legislation that sets standard and fixed 
        methodologies through which PBMs can calculate and collect 
        their fees. For example, and generally speaking, PBM contracts 
        with plan sponsors often provide that the PBM's fees are 
        calculated based on a percentage of drug cost. Thus, PBMs are 
        further incentives to place higher cost medications on their 
        formulary, and capture a higher fee from the plan.

        4.  Federal requirements that PBMs include at least one generic 
        alternative at or above the same formulary tier as the branded 
        drug analogues.

        5.  Promote transparency to shed light on the manufacturer 
        rebates the PBM is receiving through use of pass-through 
        contracting, which requires the amount charged to the PBM from 
        the plan to be equal to amount paid to the provider, net any 
        rebates.

Prepared Statement of Karen Van Nuys, Ph.D., Senior Fellow, Leonard D. 
    Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics; and Executive 
  Director, Value of Life Sciences Innovation Program, University of 
                          Southern California

Key Points:

         PBMs play a central role in the economic system that 
        distributes and pays for lifesaving drugs in the United States. 
        Evidence indicates they leverage their position to extract 
        profits in ways that are detrimental to patients, payers, and 
        the drug innovation system more broadly.

         PBMs in some cases increase drug costs to patients and 
        taxpayers; our study suggests Medicare pays 21 percent more for 
        the most common generic drugs than they would if purchased at 
        Costco.

         The rebate system by which PBMs negotiate with manufacturers 
        to gain market access distorts incentives; indeed, it increases 
        list prices for brand drugs, which can have significant adverse 
        impact on patients.

         PBMs sometimes steer patients toward more expensive drugs; 
        there are many examples of PBMs providing more favorable 
        formulary placement to expensive brand drugs than to lower cost 
        generics, presumably in exchange for larger rebates.

         Research on the economic rents earned by different sectors 
        of the distribution system indicates PBMs and other 
        intermediaries earn excess returns after adjusting for risk.

         Increased transparency could shed light on how widespread 
        such practices are, and their overall impact on drug prices and 
        spending. Greater transparency could also provide purchasers 
        better information about the prices and alternatives they face, 
        and help lower costs to patients and taxpayers.

    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and honorable members of the 
committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today about the 
practices of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and their impacts on 
patient costs and drug spending. My name is Karen Van Nuys, and I am an 
economist and senior fellow at the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for 
Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California, 
where I also direct the Value of Life Sciences Innovation research

                               background
    At the Schaeffer Center, my colleagues and I have been studying 
prescription drug markets for well over a decade, with particular 
emphasis on the economic system that distributes and pays for 
lifesaving drugs. That system includes several intermediaries or 
``middlemen,'' who each play a role in getting the physical product 
(the drugs) from the manufacturer to the patients who need them, and 
then managing the financial flows that ensure that everyone along the 
way is paid for playing their part in that system. The Schaeffer Center 
was among the first research institutions to highlight this complex 
market and quantify its role in drug prices, with one of our earliest 
studies \2\ demonstrating that, out of $100 spent on retail 
pharmaceuticals in 2013, $41 went to distribution system 
intermediaries.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/research/flow-of-money-through-
the-pharmaceutical-distribution-system/.

    Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) play an important role in that 
system. They can, and often do, provide much-needed services to drug 
companies, insurers, employers and patients. PBMs sit in the middle of 
nearly all of the financial transactions in that drug delivery system, 
a position that provides them with extraordinary information access and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
leverage.

    Their position has only solidified as PBMs have merged with other 
distribution system participants over the last decade, resulting in an 
industry that has become more vertically integrated. The top three PBMs 
are each part of a corporate structure \3\ that also includes an 
insurer, specialty pharmacy, and health-care provider. Some include 
retail pharmacies as well. Those three companies ranked #4, #5 and #12 
on Fortune's list \4\ of the largest public companies in America last 
year. Using a different yardstick, the top three PBMs handle 80 percent 
of all U.S. prescription volume.\5\

    While their size may make PBMs more formidable when negotiating 
with drug manufacturers and enable them to bring about lower drug 
prices, it can also position them to suppress competition, capture 
excess profits and raise drug costs. Which of these two possibilities 
prevails is ultimately an empirical question that much of our research 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
seeks to answer.

    Estimating pharmaceutical market money flows can be challenging, 
because much of the data on pharmaceutical prices is confidential, 
proprietary, masked, or otherwise opaque to outside researchers. 
Without transaction prices, it is difficult to conduct a broad, 
comprehensive analysis that could prove definitively whether PBMs are 
lowering drug costs. Instead, drug price researchers like myself must 
conduct studies using the incomplete data available to us to shine 
slivers of light into the dark corners of the system, and from these 
glimpses, assemble a kind of collage of the overall picture. I 
summarize some pieces of the picture here:
                   pbms' impact on generic drug costs
    An analysis we published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2021 \6\ 
compared what Medicare paid for 184 of the most common generic drugs 
with what those same prescriptions would have cost cash-paying members 
at Costco. We found that Medicare could have saved $2.6 billion in 2018 
on just those 184 drugs if they had been purchased without insurance at 
Costco. Somehow, involving the PBM and the health plan in the 
transaction increased drug costs by 21 percent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/
fullarticle/2781810.

    PBMs use several commercial tactics that together may explain those 
higher costs. One is the copay clawback, in which PBMs collect a 
patient copay that exceeds the total cost of the drug, keeping the 
excess. My colleagues and I used data from a short-lived Federal survey 
in 2013 (the national average retail price, or NARP) to compare 
patients' copayments with the reimbursement pharmacies collected to 
settle the claims. We found \7\ that 23 percent of prescriptions 
incurred a copayment that exceeded the PBM's cost of the drug. When an 
overpayment occurred, it averaged $7.69 per claim, which went to the 
PBM. The practice was especially common on generic prescriptions, with 
28 percent of generic scripts involving a clawback. Many of the most 
common generic prescriptions involved overpayments \8\ on more than 
half of claims, including prednisone (50 percent), simvastatin (52 
percent), amlodipine besylate (60 percent) and zolpidem tartrate (60 
percent).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2674655.
    \8\ https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/research/overpaying-for-
prescription-drugs/.

    Federal legislation passed in 2018 banned the gag clauses that 
prevented pharmacists from telling clients when their copayment 
exceeded the cash price of their prescription. This has likely curbed 
some copay clawback activity, but the fact that Federal legislation was 
necessary to stop PBMs from blocking pharmacists who wanted to help 
patients save money is telling. PBMs frequently claim they are ``on 
patients' side,'' \9\ but gag clauses, and the one in four 
prescriptions with a copay clawback, appear to favor PBMs rather than 
patients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ https://onyourrxside.org/.

    A second PBM tactic that raises drug costs is ``spread pricing,'' 
in which the PBM pays the pharmacy one price to fill a prescription, 
then charges the health plan a higher price to settle the same claim, 
pocketing the difference. The Ohio State auditor found \10\ that PBMs 
charged, on average, 31 percent spreads for generic drugs in that 
State's Medicaid managed care program between 2017 and 2018.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           the flow of money: pbms impact drugs' list prices
    While PBMs may increase the cost of generic prescriptions, branded 
drugs account for most of drug expenditures,\11\ making PBM impacts on 
prices in those markets especially important. To better understand how 
middlemen impact brand drug markets, my Schaeffer colleagues and I 
studied the money flows to distribution intermediaries \12\ from 
insulin sales between 2014 and 2018. We found that insulin list prices 
rose 40 percent in 5 years while the average net price--what 
manufacturers received after all rebates, fees and discounts--decreased 
by 31 percent. At the same time, the total amount spent per 100mL of 
insulin barely changed, growing just 3 percent.

    PBMs frequently tout the role they play in negotiating lower prices 
from drug manufacturers. Given that insulin manufacturers received 
lower net prices between 2014 and 2018, PBMs were clearly successful in 
negotiating steep price concessions. But they were evidently not 
passing those savings along to patients, since total insulin 
expenditures for consumers and taxpayers remained flat. Instead, 
intermediaries in the distribution chain, including PBMs, were 
capturing the savings: out of every $100 spent on insulin, 
intermediaries claimed $31.29 in 2014, climbing to $53.27--more than 
half--by 2018. PBMs' share alone grew 155 percent, from $5.64 in 2014 
to $14.36 in 2018. Price discounts do not benefit patients or premium 
payers if they don't result in lower expenditures. Patients care about 
the total amount they spend per 100mL of insulin, not whether their 
money is going to manufacturers or to other entities in the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
distribution system.

    Manufacturers do not determine list prices on their own. List 
prices are the result of a complicated dynamic that involves both PBMs 
and manufacturers. The 40-
percent growth we observed in insulin list prices is the result of 
strong incentives for list price increases that are embedded in the 
current rebate system. Manufacturers compete with one another for 
preferred formulary placement on the basis of both list prices and 
rebates. PBMs consider manufacturers' offers, knowing that they will 
get the rebate, while the manufacturer will get (roughly) the list 
price minus the rebate (the net price). All other things equal, PBMs 
have a clear financial incentive to prefer larger rebates (either 
because they retain a share, or because their clients prefer higher 
passed-through rebates), so if insulin manufacturers want to stay on 
the formulary, they need to offer high rebates. This results in upward 
pressure on list prices: as PBMs seek higher rebates, manufacturers 
increase their list prices to accommodate those rebates. PBMs may also 
collect administrative fees from manufacturers that are calculated as a 
percentage of list prices, strengthening their incentives to push for 
higher list prices.

    Schaeffer researchers published a study in JAMA Network Open in 
2021 \13\ that demonstrated the broader impact of these price 
negotiation dynamics. They find that the most competitive drug classes, 
those with both brand and generic competitors, feature the fastest 
growth in list prices, presumably because PBMs can negotiate most 
aggressively when there are multiple competitors to pit against one 
another. The ratio of list price to net price grew fastest for drugs in 
that class as well, from 2.7 in 2014 to 3.4 in 2018, compared with 
drugs with only branded competitors and those without any competition. 
In other words, as competition increases, manufacturers vie for 
preferred formulary placement by offering PBMs larger rebates, which 
creates upward pressure on list prices. This runs counter to 
conventional wisdom--we typically expect greater downward pressure on 
prices the more competitive the market. With drugs, we see greater 
upward pressure on list prices in more competitive markets.

          rebate-driven increases in list prices hurt patients
    Increasing list prices are not purely an accounting phenomenon, 
they have real consequences. Patients without insurance may pay list 
prices directly, while patients who are insured may be exposed to list 
prices while they are in the deductible phase of their benefit. And 
coinsurance amounts paid by patients are frequently defined as a 
function of the list price. The same 2021 JAMA Network Open study \14\ 
found that Medicare Part D participants who were exposed to cost-
sharing based on the list price had out-of-pocket spending that grew 
50-percent faster for drugs with branded competitors compared with 
drugs with no competition.

    PBMs have deflected blame for these rebate and list price dynamics 
by pointing out \15\ that they pass through most of the rebates they 
collect to health plans, who may then use them to keep premiums low for 
beneficiaries. But the ultimate result of such practices is to decrease 
the effective generosity of insurance by reducing premiums while 
increasing out-of-pocket costs--effectively, this transfers resources 
from sick people to healthy premium-paying beneficiaries. This is of 
course the opposite of insurance,\16\ which is supposed to pool funds 
from a large, mostly healthy group of beneficiaries and use it to 
defray the costs of those who experience the misfortune of falling ill.

          pbms can steer patients toward more expensive drugs
    These list price/rebate dynamics can distort formulary design in 
ways that raise total spending. Most dramatically, this occurs when 
patients are steered to expensive brand medications, even when a lower 
cost generic equivalent is available. Researchers studying Medicare 
Part D formularies \17\ found that 72 percent of them placed at least 
one branded product in a lower cost-sharing tier than its generic 
product; 30 percent of formularies adopted fewer utilization controls 
on the branded product than its generic equivalent for at least one 
drug. Among the 222 drugs studied, the median branded product price was 
3.9 times higher than the generic price.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \17\ https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/
fullarticle/2728446.

    Other examples abound. In 2019, well before their patents were due 
to expire, Gilead introduced \18\ authorized generic versions of their 
branded hepatitis C cures Epclusa and Harvoni. These versions were 
identical to the branded products, but had greatly reduced list prices 
and rebates, giving PBMs the choice to prefer the high list/high rebate 
branded version or the lower list/lower rebate authorized generics on 
their formularies. At the time, the manufacturer noted that patients in 
Medicare plans covering the authorized generics could save up to $2,500 
in out-of-pocket costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And yet, when the Office of the Inspector General studied Medicare 
formulary placement \19\ for these drugs, it found that ``[i]n 2020, 
nearly half of Part D plans covered Epclusa or Harvoni but did not 
cover the authorized generic versions that were specifically launched 
to reduce patient costs.'' By the end of 2020, less than 20 percent of 
Medicare patients receiving either branded Harvoni or its authorized 
generic were receiving the cheaper version.

    Recent experiences with the pricing of new biosimilar versions of 
expensive biologics demonstrate the same perverse formulary dynamics. 
FDA recently approved the first insulin biosimilar that is 
interchangeable \20\ with Lantus, an expensive branded insulin. The 
manufacturer, Viatris, launched two versions of the drug--branded 
Semglee, with a list price just 5 percent below that of Lantus, and an 
authorized but unbranded version, Glargine, with a 65-percent lower 
list price than Lantus. Both are interchangeable with the originator 
Lantus product. The net prices to the manufacturer are likely similar 
across the two versions, with the branded Semglee offering 
substantially larger rebates than Glargine. Express Scripts announced 
\21\ that they would prefer the biosimilar on their largest formulary, 
covering 28 million lives, in 2022 and would exclude the originator 
Lantus product. But the preferred product chosen was the high list 
price/high rebate Semglee, while the low list price/low rebate Glargine 
was excluded from the formulary.

    More recently, in January, Amgen launched \22\ Amjevita, the first 
biosimilar to the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira. As in 
the Semglee example, Amgen also went with two options--a high list/high 
rebate version at a 5-percent discount to Humira, and a low list/low 
rebate version at a 55-percent discount. Shortly thereafter, Optum 
released its formulary changes for February 2023.\23\ On both its 
Premium and Select formularies, Optum placed the high-list-price 
version on Tier 2 (preferred brand), preferring it over the low-list-
price version. The low-price version was excluded altogether from the 
Premium formulary, and placed on Tier 3 for the Select formulary, 
requiring that patients first try and fail the high-priced biosimilar 
and the still higher priced Humira before gaining access to the low-
list-price biosimilar.

                        pbms earn excess returns
    In market economies, a firm's quest for profit is both expected 
and, in most cases, desirable. But this quest for profits can be 
harmful if the profits generated are not commensurate with the value 
delivered to society; in such cases, policymakers may be expected to 
intervene. In the present case, the question is whether the profits 
earned by PBMs are justified. To answer it, we must evaluate whether 
the money they make is ``excessive'' in some risk/reward sense. High 
returns may be justified if large risks are undertaken to earn them; 
manufacturers' high profit margins are often justified by the large 
risks involved in developing new drugs, most of which fail to make it 
to market.\24\ By contrast, PBMs' contracts with health plans do not 
typically expose them to financial risk for drug spending, nor do they 
assume significant inventory risk; in the retail drug market, PBMs do 
not even take possession of the product.

    Schaeffer researchers studied the risk-adjusted returns of 
distribution system participants in 2013-2018. Comparing the adjusted 
return on invested capital to firms' weighted average cost of capital, 
they found \25\ that pharmaceutical manufacturers' excess returns fall 
below those of the S&P 500 (1.7 percent vs. 3.6 percent), while those 
for biotech manufacturers (9.6 percent), wholesalers (8.1 percent), and 
insurers/PBM/retailers (5.9 percent) remain significantly above them. 
(PBMs could not be disaggregated from the insurer/PBM/retailer category 
since so many of the companies in the sample were integrated across 
these parts of the distribution system.) They also found that excess 
returns for the insurer/PBM/retailer sector increased over the study 
period, when both horizontal and vertical consolidation were also 
increasing. Broadly, these results suggest that the returns earned by 
companies in that category, including both standalone and integrated 
PBMs, are not explained by the risks they bear, and may instead reflect 
anticompetitive commercial tactics.

      conclusion: greater transparency and oversight is warranted
    The tactics illustrated here demonstrate some of the methods PBMs 
use to leverage their market power and the opacity of the system in 
ways that harm consumers and taxpayers. While it is true that PBMs also 
provide valuable services, the information asymmetry inherent in their 
position in the distribution system, the misaligned incentives that 
govern their behavior, and the trend towards increased vertical 
consolidation, should all be concerning to policymakers and regulators.

    Increased transparency that gives market participants visibility 
into the prices they are facing would enable them to make more informed 
economic decisions and help level the playing field. And stricter 
reporting requirements for more granular transaction data would allow 
regulators (and potentially researchers) to analyze specific markets 
and tactics, identify problems more quickly, and offer more targeted 
solutions.

      Questions Submitted for the Record to Karen Van Nuys, Ph.D.
                  Question Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
    Question. What recommendations do you have for how and where to 
increase transparency throughout the prescription drug supply chain? 
Please specify both the transaction and the stakeholders in your 
response.

    Answer. The current drug pricing system is characterized by a lack 
of transparency at almost every point, which enables sellers to extract 
profits without fear of competitive consequences (for example, loss of 
volume if they charge higher prices than competitors). Increased price 
transparency in such situations helps buyers to understand when they 
are being overcharged (or sellers to understand when they are being 
underpaid), and where they should go for better deals. This essential 
dynamic, in which buyers and sellers compare the deals they are being 
offered to what alternative providers are offering, keeps prices in 
check in competitive markets, but is too often missing in drug markets. 
Increased transparency could strengthen this competitive dynamic at 
several points in the drug distribution system, if high-
quality price benchmarks were available to market participants. Outside 
researchers could also use them to identify trends and anomalies that 
warrant further investigation. For example:

    Pharmacy reimbursement from PBMs: PBM reimbursements to pharmacies 
for filling scripts vary widely, and pharmacies lack quality benchmarks 
to understand whether they are being paid a fair price for their 
services. Pharmacies are now typically reimbursed based on average 
wholesale price (AWP), which is not based on actual transaction prices 
and is subject to manipulation and creates distorted incentives.

    A better benchmark would be a national average of actual 
reimbursements received by pharmacies, collected regularly and posted 
publicly, similar to the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost 
(NADAC)\1\ price series that CMS currently publishes. To construct 
NADAC, pharmacies are surveyed about the prices they pay to acquire 
prescription drugs; a similar survey could gather data about the 
reimbursements pharmacies receive. Average reimbursement values could 
be posted by type of payer (commercial plan, government plan, cash pay) 
and type of pharmacy (independent, chain affiliated with a PBM, 
unaffiliated chain, mail order, etc.) without revealing sensitive trade 
secrets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://data.medicaid.gov/nadac.

    Interestingly, a series similar to this (called National Average 
Retail Price, or NARP) was launched alongside NADAC in 2012,\2\ but was 
quickly withdrawn for reasons that are not clear. NARP was a national 
survey of pharmacies that documented average drug reimbursements 
received by pharmacies from payers; 6 months of data were published. 
Schaeffer researchers were able to use the NARP data that were briefly 
available to establish that 23 percent of commercial pharmacy claims 
involved a patient copayment that exceeded the total cost of the 
prescription.\3\ At the time, PBM representatives were claiming that 
they did not support such practices, and that if they happened, they 
were ``outliers.''\4\ Following our NARP analysis and resulting media 
attention, in 2018 Congress enacted legislation banning the use of gag 
clauses \5\ in PBM contracts that prevented pharmacists from alerting 
patients when their copay exceeded the cash price of the drug. 
Ironically, because NARP data are no longer available, we cannot 
confirm whether the situation has improved for patients since gag 
clauses were banned.

    As originally implemented, NARP did not capture retroactive fees 
such as the DIR clawbacks that have since become widespread in Medicare 
Part D. Any new pricing benchmark would ideally capture these important 
revenue flows between PBMs and pharmacies, which would be difficult to 
do if those fees are imposed retroactively. Fortunately, CMS is 
planning to eliminate retroactive DIR fees beginning next year, 
requiring that any DIR fees and other concessions be reflected in the 
negotiated price at the point of sale. Thus, a NARP-like price 
benchmark implemented after January 2024 could capture all revenue 
flows at the point of sale and would constitute a more comprehensive 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
measure.

    Another complicating factor is that pharmacies that are vertically 
integrated with PBMs can report almost any reimbursement from their 
affiliated PBMs, since the amount could be set arbitrarily, simply 
shifting money from one pocket to the other for the parent company. 
Thus, other changes, such as additional oversight of vertically 
integrated entities, or limiting vertical integration, might also be 
necessary, and pricing benchmarks should be reported separately for 
those pharmacies affiliated with a PBM. But even an imperfect measure 
provides market participants (and outside researchers) with more tools 
than we currently have to make more informed economic choices, and to 
better understand how money flows in the drug distribution system.

    Plan payments to PBMs: Health plans could be surveyed about the 
rates they pay to settle claims, and responses averaged and publicly 
posted by NDC or product, with sub-group results for different payer 
types (Medicare, commercial, etc.) and different PBM types (large/
small, integrated with plan/unaffiliated with plan).

    As above, this measure is also imperfect. Vertically integrated 
organizations could again set payments arbitrarily to realize the 
revenues in whichever unit is most advantageous. Subgroup reporting, 
comparing rates between plans that are and are not affiliated with a 
PBM, would help disentangle this effect. Additional oversight of 
vertically integrated organizations may also be useful.

    Note: Any data measures collected via survey would be more useful 
and closer to ``true'' transaction prices if survey responses were made 
mandatory. This is true of the current NADAC survey, for which response 
is now voluntary. Studies comparing NADAC to similar values collected 
through a mandatory survey suggest that NADAC may overstate generic 
drug acquisition costs by roughly 20 percent. Thus, Congress should 
require participation in these pricing benchmark surveys as a condition 
of participating in the Medicare/Medicaid programs.

    Manufacturer net prices: Drug manufacturers could also be surveyed 
semiannually about the average net prices they receive, after rebates 
and discounts, on each of their products by NDC, and the information 
made available publicly.

    Medicare Part D rebate payments: CMS currently collects data from 
plans about how much they receive in direct and indirect remuneration 
(DIR), including manufacturer rebates. These values could be made 
public. To address potential concerns about reporting proprietary 
information, some degree of aggregation could be applied.

    Premiums for Medicare Advantage-Part D plans (MA-PDs): CMS makes 
information on Part D premiums publicly available, which is useful for 
researchers and analysts to study how competition is working in the 
Part D market (including, for example, the extent to which manufacturer 
rebates are being used by plans to offset premiums). However, the 
premium data reported for MA-PDs are net of any ``supplemental rebate 
buy-down'' applied by the MA plan. (The terminology can be confusing, 
because this is a different type of ``rebate'' than those negotiated 
between PBMs and drug manufacturers.) When an MA plan bids below the 
benchmark to cover the medical benefits for its enrollees, it receives 
a portion of that difference in the form of a ``supplemental rebate,'' 
which the plan then uses to enhance benefits and/or reduce cost sharing 
or premiums. It is very common for MA-PDs to use a portion of that 
supplemental rebate to offset some or all of the Part D premium that 
enrollees would otherwise pay. Indeed, in 2022, 69 percent of MA-PD 
enrollment \6\ was in a plan that fully paid the Part D premium with 
these supplemental rebates. Because CMS reports Part D premium data net 
of any buy-down for MA-PDs, that 69 percent of MA-PD enrollees is 
reported as having a $0 premium. To answer certain research questions 
it is useful to know what beneficiaries actually pay, but these data 
provide limited insight into market competition overall; this is 
particularly limiting because the majority of Part D enrollment is in 
an MA-PD. If CMS were to also make available the data on Part D 
premiums before supplemental rebates are applied (as they do with 
stand-alone Part D plans), this would allow for better evaluation of 
dynamics in the Part D market overall.

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo
                delinking compensation from drug prices
    Question. A growing body of research suggests that compensation and 
contracting structures across the prescription drug supply chain may 
risk incentivizing higher list prices for medications by tying 
stakeholder payments to products' list prices or to list-price-derived 
benchmarks. In its March 2023 report to Congress, for instance, the 
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) contends that ``[a]ll 
levels of the drug supply chain include incentives that drive [point-
of-sale] prices higher, particularly when payments are based on a 
percentage of prices.''\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ See p. 400, https://www.medpac.gov/document/march-2023-report-
to-the-congress-medicare-payment-policy/.

    The potential for these types of incentives has driven some experts 
and supply-chain participants to propose eliminating the use of drug 
prices in establishing payment rates and amounts for PBMs and other 
stakeholders. A coalition of Idaho-based providers, patient advocates, 
and job creators, for instance, recently wrote in support of Federal 
policies aimed at ``delinking PBM compensation from the list price of 
individual medications.''\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ See Endnotes for a copy of the letter.

    How would Federal policies delinking compensation for pharmacy 
benefit managers (PBMs) and plan sponsors from drug prices in the 
context of Medicare Part D affect incentives within the retail 
prescription drug supply chain, and how would this type of change 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
likely impact beneficiary costs and taxpayer spending?

    Answer. Delinking PBM and plan sponsor compensation from drug list 
prices (for example by prohibiting fees and rebates that are set as a 
share of list price) would reduce the upward pressure we now see on 
drug list prices, which should translate into lower patient out-of-
pocket spending. The impact on beneficiary costs and taxpayer spending 
of such moves is less clear, as it depends on several factors, 
including the impact on manufacturer net prices and aggregate PBM fees. 
If PBM and other intermediary fees are reduced by more than any 
increase in drug net prices, spending could decrease. On the other 
hand, if drug net prices increase by more (perhaps because PBMs have 
weaker incentives to negotiate prices after delinking), overall costs 
and spending could increase.

    Separately however, beneficiary costs and taxpayer spending would 
change as a result of delinking, because such a move would restore the 
generosity of the Part D benefit. Since the Part D standard benefit 
design is tied to list prices, as list prices have become increasingly 
inflated, the value of Part D insurance coverage has declined over 
time. Delinking PBM and plan compensation from list prices would reduce 
upward pressure on list prices (and, more specifically, reduce the 
wedge between list and net prices). On its own, reducing this wedge 
would increase taxpayer costs because it would restore the generosity 
of the Part D benefit. Restoring the generosity of that benefit to more 
closely reflect net prices would increase premiums (because it is a 
more valuable benefit), which would increase taxpayer costs. However, 
it would also lead to more generous coverage and reduce out-of-pocket 
spending, particularly for some beneficiaries.

    Question. Apart from PBM payments and services, where else in the 
supply chain do compensation structures rely on drug pricing 
benchmarks, and how should policymakers consider addressing these 
dynamics?

    Answer. Pharmacies are typically reimbursed for brand, generic and 
specialty medications as a percentage of Average Wholesale Price (AWP), 
a benchmark that is not tied to the drug's actual acquisition cost. 
This creates incentives for pharmacies to sell not the lowest cost 
drug, but the one that maximizes the difference between AWP and its 
acquisition costs. For brand drugs, AWP is calculated at 120 percent of 
WAC (wholesale acquisition cost), the list price set by a drug's 
manufacturer. For generic drugs, AWP can vary widely across similar 
drugs, creating incentive distortions. Basing reimbursements on an 
alternative benchmark that reflects actual transaction prices and that 
is publicly available, such as the National Average Drug Acquisition 
Cost (NADAC), as Dr. Gibbs from Capital Rx suggested in his testimony, 
would reduce these distortions.

                    access to affordable biosimilars
    Question. As more biosimilars have come to market, including for 
Part D-covered biologics, some experts have expressed concerns over the 
resulting coverage policies, as a number of plans have opted to 
advantage reference products or biosimilars with higher list prices 
over lower-priced biosimilars, despite the fact that beneficiaries 
often pay cost sharing under Part D as a percentage of a list-price-
based benchmark. This pattern could curb incentives for biosimilar 
development and market entry, undermining competition.

    What concrete steps could Congress take to ensure that Part D 
enrollees can benefit from lower-priced biosimilar options, as well as 
to bolster cost-cutting competition among biologics and biosimilar 
market entrants?

    Answer. The same issues that are noted above with branded drugs--
that rebates and cost sharing linked to list prices create pressure to 
increase drug prices and patient costs--apply to biosimilars in Part D 
as well. The current model, in which manufacturers compete to offer the 
highest rebates rather than the lowest net price, is responsible for 
these dynamics. If Congress were to pursue broader reforms that reduce 
incentives for high list-price, high-rebate drugs over lower-net-cost 
drugs, this would give lower-cost biosimilars an advantage over higher-
cost biosimilars or reference products in Part D. But such a change 
will decrease rebate payments to plans, and put upward pressure on 
premiums, in large part because it would shift beneficiary spending 
away from out-of-pocket costs (among users) to premiums (for all). 
While this may be politically uncomfortable, it will shift financial 
obligations away from sick people (lower out-of-pocket expenses) to 
healthy people (higher premiums), which is the point of insurance.

    Indeed, in Part B drug markets, where dynamics are driven by post-
rebate ASP prices, we have seen biosimilar entrants capture significant 
market shares and drive prices down,\9\ as expected from increasing 
competition, without requiring direct regulatory intervention.

    Congress can also work with the FDA to streamline the process for 
biosimilar approval and entry.
                           reporting measures
    Question. During the March 30th hearing, you referenced the value 
of additional aggregated cost and payment reporting requirements at 
various junctures of the prescription drug supply chain, given the 
potential transparency benefits of the resulting information for 
policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders.

    If Congress were to pursue policies to establish these types of 
reporting and transparency measures, how should legislators go about 
structuring them (i.e., at what junctures of the supply chain should 
the measures be instituted, what information should be collected, and 
what level of aggregation and publication would be most helpful)?

    Answer. Please see my response to question 1 from Senator Wyden, 
above, specifically regarding pharmacy reimbursements from PBMs and 
plan payments to PBMs.

    Question. What other types of reporting (i.e., to Federal agencies, 
from PBMs to plan sponsors, from agencies to the public, etc.) would 
help to improve prescription drug benefits under Federal health 
programs? Response: Please see my response to question 1 from Senator 
Wyden, above, specifically regarding manufacturer net prices, Medicare 
Part D rebate payments, and premiums for Medicare Advantage-Part D 
plans.
                         consumer overpayments
    Question. In a number of past reports, you and your colleagues at 
the Schaeffer Center have identified circumstances under which insured 
patients have paid more than their PBMs and plans for certain 
prescriptions, including with respect to some generic drugs.

    What dynamics or practices seem to drive these types of 
occurrences, and where in the supply chain do we see markups that 
increase consumers' out-of-pocket costs? What steps could Congress take 
to address these patient burdens?

    Answer. In one study \10\ published in JAMA in 2018, we found that 
patient copays exceeded the total cost of the claim on nearly one in 
four prescriptions in a commercially insured population (and nearly one 
in three generic prescriptions). Lack of transparency contributes to 
this practice, because patients have no idea what their prescriptions 
actually cost their insurers, and therefore do not know when their 
copayment is too high. Gag clauses in the contracts between PBMs and 
pharmacies facilitated such practices, because they prevented the 
pharmacist from notifying the patient when their copayment was greater 
than what the drug would cost with cash. Federal legislation in 2018 
banned these gag clauses, although we no longer have access to the data 
that would let us establish if or how much the practice has declined as 
a result.

    In a second study,\11\ published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2021, 
we found that Medicare overspent on claims for the most common generic 
drugs by 20.6 percent compared to what Costco members would have paid 
in cash for the same drugs. Some of this may have been the result of 
copay clawbacks as described above, but more was likely due to spread 
pricing, in which the PBM charges the Medicare plan more than what it 
pays the pharmacy to settle the claim, or vertically integrated PBMs 
reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies more generously. Again, lack of 
transparency is the root culprit for these practices, as plans don't 
know what their PBM is paying the pharmacy to settle the claim, so they 
have no way to judge whether they are being overcharged. Legislation 
that bans or otherwise limits spread pricing could help, but PBMs that 
are vertically integrated with pharmacies could easily reduce spread 
payments by altering their internal transfer prices to realize profits 
in the pharmacy division instead.

    Since much of the Part D market is made up of plans that use their 
own PBM (UnitedHealth, Humana, and CVS Health are the three largest 
Part D carriers and each uses its own PBM), a better understanding of 
whether such overspending reflects generous payments to PBM-owned 
pharmacies is needed. Therefore, a solution that provides increased 
price transparency, such as collecting better drug price benchmarks 
(including their variation across PBM-affiliated vs. non-PBM-affiliated 
entities) and making them publicly available (as suggested above), may 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
be a more robust approach.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell
                          rebate transparency
    Question. The PBM rebate system was originally designed as a way to 
leverage the PBMs' central position in the drug distribution chain to 
reduce costs for consumers and patients. In theory, PBMs negotiate 
rebates with drug manufacturers, and the rebates are then passed 
through to the patient at the pharmacy counter. I am a big proponent of 
the thinking that ``when you buy in bulk, you should receive a 
discount.'' However, the rebate system is not working like it was 
intended to.

    Let's take insulin as an example. Insulin has been used to treat 
diabetes for 100 years, and a vial of insulin costs $2 to $4 to make. 
In the study that you conducted, you discovered that between 2014 to 
2018, the average list price of several insulin products rose 40 
percent, from $19 to $27 per unit. At the same time, total consumer 
insulin expenditures remained the same, while the share of rebates and 
other expenditures accredited to PBMs increased by a whopping 155 
percent. This means that PBMs are demanding and keeping more of the 
rebates, and drug manufacturers respond by increasing the list price. 
The consumer ultimately does not get the full benefit of this system 
because the PBMs pocket most of the rebates.

    To complicate this issue further, we know relatively little about 
the interactions and negotiations between drug manufactures and PBMs. 
The PBMs claim that the information on the amount of rebates received, 
and the amount passed through, are considered trade secrets that cannot 
be disclosed. This shroud of secrecy is contributing to sky-high drug 
prices and hampering our efforts to rein in bad practices.

    I am leading a bill with Senator Grassley, the Pharmacy Benefit 
Manager Transparency Act, which would crack down on PBM's opaque rebate 
practices and ensure that PBMs pass on the full amount of rebates that 
they receive. It would also mandate transparency disclosures to the 
Federal Trade Commission so that PBMs are accountable in this process.

    Do you think that my bill is a good start to tackling the opaque 
practices that PBMs have hidden from the public?

    Answer. I do believe it is a good start, as it places the 
fundamental issue of transparency front and center. Your bill with 
Senator Grassley should make it more difficult for PBMs to hide profits 
from regulators, and reveal anti-competitive practices such as 
differential DIR clawbacks that provide an unfair advantage to 
pharmacies that are vertically integrated with PBMs. However, any 
proposed policy should also consider how PBMs and other supply chain 
entities are likely to respond. We have already seen the large, 
vertically integrated PBMs respond to proposed legislation, such as the 
2019 ``rebate rule,'' with changes (e.g., re-labeling rebate revenues 
as fees and concessions, or creating offshore GPOs/rebate aggregators) 
that would circumvent the proposed legislation without addressing the 
underlying issue.

    Question. In your opinion, what else can we do to crack down on the 
complicated web of bad practices that PBMs engage in?

    Answer. I believe other steps should also be taken to create a more 
comprehensive solution. By themselves, laws that focus on one or two 
practices or revenue flows (like spread pricing, or DIR fees, or 
rebates) are likely to be gamed by the large and highly sophisticated, 
vertically integrated entities that now dominate PBM markets. For 
example, a prohibition on spread pricing can be sidestepped by a PBM 
integrated with pharmacies by (1) steering patients to affiliated 
pharmacies and (2) increasing reimbursements to affiliated pharmacies 
to realize any profits in the pharmacy rather than as spread.

    For this reason, I believe it is equally important that vertically 
integrated entities be carefully studied to better understand and 
quantify the impacts of their integration and, if needed, design policy 
to limit their scope for such evasive moves and ensure robust 
competition in health plan, PBM, and pharmacy markets.

    Question. PBMs have argued that increased transparency will 
ultimately lead to collusion in the industry and decreased 
competitiveness. Do you agree with the statement? If not, why do you 
disagree?

    Answer. The truth is that no one is sure, as we don't have any 
evidence from pharmaceutical markets. But I am not so concerned about 
this issue that I would let it scuttle all efforts to increase 
transparency in these industries. In the current situation, most buyers 
have almost no idea what the ``true'' prices are in these markets, so 
they have no hope of making informed economic choices about which 
alternatives offer the greatest value. And that dynamic--agents making 
informed choices among competing alternatives--is the main channel 
through which competitive forces work to lower prices. Without that 
transparency, and the channels it will open, the current dynamics are a 
near-complete mystery, but they certainly don't appear to be reducing 
health-care costs. And when one hears anecdotes about PBMs designing 
formularies that prefer higher-cost versions of a drug when an 
identical but lower-cost version is available, forcing patients to bear 
higher out-of-pocket costs, I become even more skeptical that more 
transparency will hurt rather than help.

    I also do not find much of the evidence behind the claim that 
increased transparency will increase collusion particularly germane or 
compelling. My colleagues at USC Schaeffer and I have pointed out that 
one of the often-cited empirical examples for this claim is a study 
\12\ of the Danish ready-mix concrete industry in the early 1990s. As 
one of the study's authors noted:\13\ ``I'm sure there are some 
similarities between pricing of various health care services and ready-
made concrete in Denmark in the early 1990s, but I'm also sure there 
might be huge differences.'' Indeed, one very substantial difference is 
that ready-mix concrete--much like retail gasoline, another oft-cited 
example--is identical no matter who is selling it, but branded 
pharmaceuticals typically differ from one another in various ways. The 
economics literature \14\ has found that collusion is much more likely 
in industries with homogeneous goods than differentiated ones. (When 
firms sell identical goods, they have more to gain from tracking their 
rivals' price increases identically too. By contrast, firms selling 
differentiated goods often benefit from pricing and marketing in 
accordance with the unique advantages of their own product.)

    \14\ https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/002205106776162681.

    Finally, the critique of price transparency rests on the quaint 
notion that confidential rebates yield benefits for consumers. The 
evidence suggests otherwise. Powerful PBMs may extract confidential 
discounts, but they do not systematically pass those savings downstream 
to consumers.\15\

                                 ______
                                 
              Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
    Question. Last year, Congress passed and President Biden signed 
into law the Inflation Reduction Act--which capped insulin prices for 
Medicare beneficiaries at $35 per month. Thanks to President Biden's 
leadership, drug manufacturers like Eli Lilly have followed suit and 
have voluntarily capped the price of insulin at $35 per month in the 
commercial market as well.

    What are your thoughts on expanding the insulin price cap to other 
classes of drugs--for example, drugs that are older, highly rebated, 
and/or treat chronic conditions? What are the key things that Congress 
should think about when considering this type of policy? What are the 
tradeoffs and how can we prevent costs from ballooning in other parts 
of our health-care system when designing such a policy?

    Answer. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) capped 
out-of-pocket (OOP) prices (i.e., copayments) for insulin at $35. 
Capping OOP costs for other drugs would create new dynamics. First, 
while patients' spending for those drugs would likely fall, to the 
extent those drugs continue to be highly rebated, capping OOP costs 
could increase premiums (similar dynamics to what would happen if OOP 
costs were tied to net prices). Second, it could also result in higher 
drug prices if the current system that ties OOP costs to list prices is 
depressing those prices because patients will buy less of them when 
their OOP costs increase. Market and policy factors may mitigate this 
effect.

    Overall, capping OOP payments will produce benefits for a certain 
set of patients who rely on the chosen drugs. More patients would 
benefit if the overall dysfunctional rebate dynamics that drive the 
current system could be addressed instead.

    Question. Thanks to the testimony of our witnesses and questions 
from my colleagues, we heard a good amount of discussion about the 
perverse incentives that exist in the market due to how PBMs make their 
money. To summarize, a significant source of revenue for PBMs are 
rebates and administrative fees that are often based on a drug's list 
price. This creates bizarre and perverse incentives that have been 
found to lead to increased drug list prices and higher-priced drugs on 
formulary lists so that PBMs can bring in more revenue. That's bad for 
patients and its bad for taxpayers. Dr. Gibbs in his testimony talked 
about the transparent, flat-fee pricing model that Capital Rx has put 
in place.

    Can we as policymakers learn from Capital Rx's pricing model and 
what proposals would you recommend we pursue to align pricing 
incentives in the various parts of the drug supply chain?

    Answer. Capital Rx's business model contains several elements that 
should be considered as you seek to align incentives in the drug supply 
chain:

    No vertical integration: Capital Rx is a stand-alone PBM that does 
not own pharmacies or health plans. This means they cannot shift 
revenues among business units to hide profits from scrutiny and 
regulation. Whatever profits Capital Rx reports are earned solely 
through their activities as a PBM, and can be benchmarked against what 
other PBM operations are earning, to understand whether they are making 
excessive profits.

    Meaningful, verifiable pricing benchmarks: Capital Rx uses NADAC, a 
national average pricing series that is derived from actual transaction 
prices, to determine what they pay pharmacies and what they charge 
health plan clients. This ensures transparent and consistent prices 
that can easily be explained and verified across the entire business, 
and that potential clients can compare across alternative providers.

    Transparent, pass-through model: Capital Rx passes through 100 
percent of manufacturer rebates, fees and discounts to their health 
plan clients, so clients know and benefit directly from any price 
reductions received. They charge their clients what they pay 
pharmacies, so there is no spread.

    Flat fees: Capital Rx charges for its services via flat fees rather 
than as a share of drug costs, eliminating any incentive to steer 
patients towards more expensive drugs.

                                 ______
                                 
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
    Question. You mention in your testimony that PMBs are ``essentially 
practicing medicine through `fail first' step therapy, prior 
authorization requirements, or formulary exclusions, many of which 
favor not the least expensive medication, but the most profitable one 
for the PBM.''

    Can you discuss how these practices impact patient access to 
medication prescribed by their health care provider?

    Answer. I believe the quote above comes from Mr. Levitt's testimony 
rather than mine, but I agree with it. Of these ``utilization 
management'' (UM) practices used by PBMs, formulary exclusions are the 
most extreme. When a drug is excluded, the PBMs' beneficiaries cannot 
access it using their insurance--they must pay cash or go without. And 
over the last decade, the three largest PBMs have steadily increased 
the number of drugs on their exclusion lists.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ https://www.drugchannels.net/2023/01/the-big-three-pbms-2023-
formulary.html.

    Prior authorization and step therapy practices also impede patient 
access. A growing literature demonstrates that when patients face 
utilization management requirements like these, they experience delays 
in starting new medications, miss doses, and may experience negative 
health consequences as a result. These effects have been documented in 
diseases ranging from epilepsy \17\ to asthma \18\ to atrial 
fibrillation.\19\

    In theory, UM practices could help PBMs manage the cost of care by 
ensuring that patients use the most cost-effective alternatives, and 
only use more expensive alternatives if cheaper ones don't work. But 
this argument ignores the conflicting financial incentives many PBMs 
currently face to use UM tools to increase their profits, and is 
directly undermined by formulary examples \20\ where expensive branded 
drugs are preferred over therapeutically identical authorized generic 
versions that cost less.

    Question. You mention in your testimony that there is evidence that 
some PBMs engage in a tactic known as ``spread pricing,'' which occurs 
when PBMs charge health plans a higher amount than what the PBM 
actually reimburses the pharmacy for a dispensed drug--with the PBM 
retaining the difference. Almost 20 States, including my home State of 
Maryland, have prohibited spread pricing in their Medicaid managed care 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
programs.

    Can you discuss how spread pricing in public health care programs 
impacts patients and taxpayers?

    Answer. Spread pricing permits PBMs to earn money on each 
prescription filled without disclosing the amount earned to their 
clients. As a result, PBMs have been found to capture large profits 
that cost Medicaid managed care programs millions of dollars through 
inflated drug costs. For example, in a 2018 audit of Ohio State 
Medicaid managed care programs, auditors found that the State paid $225 
million in spread in 1 year; for generic scripts, the average spread 
was 31 percent. The practice and the excess costs it generates is not 
limited to Ohio; similar audits in other State Medicaid programs have 
produced similar findings.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
    Question. The Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Transparency Act (S. 
127) requires transparency reporting by PBMs (or an affiliate, 
subsidiary, or agent of a PBM) to shine sunlight on prices and fees 
associated with prescription drugs. Why is transparency reporting by 
middlemen, such as PBMs, important to ensuring taxpayers and patients 
are getting the lowest drug price and associated fees possible?

    Answer. The process of making, distributing, and paying for 
prescription drugs involves numerous entities, including manufacturers, 
wholesalers, insurers, PBMs, and pharmacies. Knowing the real 
transaction prices, including rebates and discounts, at each stage is 
essential to understanding where profits are taken across the supply 
chain. Without this information, it is more challenging to target 
effective policy solutions at the segments that are making excessive 
profits.

    Transparency is especially important in PBM transactions because of 
the likelihood of hidden costs and markups due to the complex and 
opaque nature of their pricing practices, and to the information 
advantage they enjoy because of their involvement in several key 
transactions in the system. The PBM Transparency Act would require 
detailed reports from the PBMs, a major step toward ensuring patients 
and taxpayers are getting the lowest prices for medicines. Increased 
PBM transparency will promote competition and drive down costs as 
pharmacies, insurers and drug makers gain information that will enable 
them to negotiate better prices and discounts.

    Question. The Prescription Pricing for the People Act (S. 113) and 
PBM Transparency Act (S. 127) require the Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC) to look into the vertical integration that is occurring in the 
pharmaceutical supply chain. Why is that important? How does vertical 
integration impact the prices patients and taxpayers pay for 
prescription drugs?

    Answer. Vertical integration in the pharmaceutical supply chain can 
have several anticompetitive effects in PBM, health insurance and 
pharmacy markets:

    First, a PBM that is vertically integrated with a pharmacy 
(specialty, mail, or retail) may require patients to fill the most 
profitable prescriptions at its affiliated pharmacy, while allowing 
less profitable prescriptions to be filled at independent pharmacies. 
By steering more profitable business to its own pharmacy, the 
vertically integrated PBM systematically disadvantages independent 
pharmacies, who face more competitive pressure and may go out of 
business as a result. This leads to increased concentration in pharmacy 
markets, higher consumer prices and reduced patient access to pharmacy 
services.

    Second, an integrated PBM/pharmacy organization can arbitrarily 
choose to realize profits in either business unit, which gives them 
great scope for avoiding legislation that places restrictions or 
reporting requirements on tactics like spread pricing. Suppose the 
pharmacy acquires a drug for $10 and, when a patient fills a 
prescription for it, the PBM charges the health plan $100. The total 
profit to the integrated PBM/pharmacy is $90, but where it is realized 
is determined by the (arbitrary) rate chosen to reimburse the pharmacy. 
If the reimbursement is set at $10, the full $90 will be realized as 
spread in the PBM unit. But the organization can sidestep spread 
pricing restrictions by setting the pharmacy reimbursement at $100, 
thereby realizing the entire $90 profit in the pharmacy unit, with no 
reported spread.

    Third, a PBM vertically integrated with a health plan can offer PBM 
services to other health plans which compete with the PBM's own health 
plan. The vertically integrated PBM has incentives to provide poor 
quality or high cost services to rival health plans, since 
disadvantaging rivals will lead to higher market share for its own 
health plan. Such so-called ``input foreclosure'' leads to reduced 
competition in the health plan market, increasing premiums for patients 
and taxpayers.

    Finally, a health plan integrated with a PBM will not seek PBM 
services from independent PBMs. This limits the size of the market for 
independent PBMs, leading to limited entry, reduced competition and 
higher prices for PBM services.

    Question. Do spread pricing and clawbacks performed by PBMs (or an 
affiliate, subsidiary, or agent of a PBM) impact the prices patients 
and taxpayers pay for prescription drugs? If so, how? Additionally, how 
do spread pricing and clawback practices differ within the commercial 
insurance market compared to within the 
Medicaid/Medicare programs?

    Answer. PBMs' spread pricing and clawback \21\ tactics result in 
patients and taxpayers paying more for prescription drugs than 
necessary. When a PBM engages in spread pricing, it charges the health 
plan more than it pays the pharmacy to settle the claim, and keeps the 
difference. The practice has been well documented in Medicaid 
programs--in Ohio, the State auditor found average spreads of 31 
percent \22\ for generic drugs in its Medicaid managed care program; 
other States have documented similar results.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \21\ With the term ``clawback,'' I am referring to a copay that 
exceeds the total cost of the prescription, with the PBM keeping the 
overage, as described in our JAMA 2018 article. The term clawback is 
also used to describe the direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) fees 
that PBMs charge pharmacies after a drug claim is settled. These are 
different from the type of clawback I am referring to here.
    \22\ https://ohioauditor.gov/auditsearch/Reports/2018/
Medicaid_Pharmacy_Services_2018_
Franklin.pdf.

    Using Medicare claims, my Schaeffer colleagues and I found that 
Medicare overpaid by 21 percent \23\ on the most common generic 
prescriptions in 2018, compared to what Costco members paid for the 
same drugs with cash. The resulting $2.6 billion overpayment was more 
likely due to spread and/or vertical integration than to copay 
clawbacks, as the latter appeared to be relatively uncommon in our 
data. I am unaware of any empirical study establishing the frequency or 
magnitude of spread practices in commercial plans.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/
fullarticle/2781810.

    In a copay clawback, the patient's copayment exceeds the total cost 
of the prescription, and the PBM keeps the difference. In one study of 
commercial claims, we found that patient copays exceeded the total cost 
of the claim on nearly one in four prescriptions, and nearly one in 
three generic prescriptions. Federal legislation in 2018 banning gag 
clauses in commercial and Medicare plans may have diminished the use of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
these tactics, although we lack the data to confirm this conjecture.

    Lack of transparency contributes to these cost-increasing tactics. 
In the case of spread pricing, neither the payer nor the pharmacy is 
aware of what the other is paid or charged, and don't see when the PBM 
is capturing excessive profits from the transaction. In the case of 
copay clawbacks, patients do not know the actual cost of their 
medication, so they cannot see when their copayment is being siphoned 
off to enrich the PBM. In the case of vertical integration, the PBM has 
an incentive to pay its own pharmacies higher prices. In all these 
cases, PBMs are inflating costs in the drug supply system. The amount 
of money in each transaction might be small, but spread over billions 
of prescriptions each year the cost to payers is significant.

    Question. Does the current consolidated PBM market hurt or help 
community pharmacies who serve rural or underserved areas? When a 
community pharmacy closes or a patient cannot access a community 
pharmacy due to being out of network, how does this impact patient 
access?

    Answer. In a recent study,\24\ Schaeffer colleagues and others 
found that the total number of community pharmacies, after increasing 
steadily since 2010, began declining in 2018. This timing coincided 
with increasing consolidation in the PBM industry, with the CVS/Aetna 
merger in 2017 and the Cigna/Express Scripts merger in 2018. Net 
pharmacy closures were only observed among chain pharmacies, and were 
primarily observed in rural areas and in predominately Black/Latinx 
urban neighborhoods.

    A second study \25\ exploring a national cohort of older Americans 
using cardiovascular medications found that pharmacy closures have an 
immediate and persistent effect on medication adherence, including 
among patients fully adherent prior to their pharmacy closing. These 
declines were greater among patients living in low-access 
neighborhoods.

    Question. Since 2017, 23 States have passed various forms of 
prescription drug transparency laws that require PBMs to report certain 
data (according to National Academy for State Health Policy). Do any of 
these States have effective PBM transparency laws that should be 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
replicated at the Federal level? Why are they effective?

    Answer. I have not studied recent State transparency laws, or what 
impact they are having. That said, I am somewhat skeptical. In 2019, my 
Schaeffer colleagues analyzed 166 State drug pricing laws that were 
passed between 2015 and 2018, of which 35 had a clear transparency 
component. They concluded that only 7 laws passed in 6 States could be 
labeled ``informative,'' meaning they would result in disclosure of 
previously unavailable information. Furthermore, since sophisticated, 
vertically integrated PBMs can shift revenues internally among business 
units, they can skirt reporting requirements that focus on individual 
revenue flows (such as rebates, spread pricing, or clawbacks) in 
isolation. To the extent that these State transparency laws are looking 
at flows in isolation, I suspect they may be circumvented by large, 
vertically integrated PBMs.

    Question. Beginning in 2016, the Texas Department of Insurance 
began public reporting on the use of manufacturers' rebates and other 
payments to PBMs. Similarly, beginning in 2020, the Iowa Insurance 
Division began publicly reporting on the use of manufacturers' rebates 
and other payments to PBMs. Other States have conducted similar public 
reporting. According to an analysis of the Texas data (https://
www.tdi.texas.gov/reports/report3.html), PBMs retained 7 percent to 21 
percent of manufacturers' rebate and other payments between 2016-2021. 
Similar data has been reported in Iowa (https://iid.iowa.gov/pbm-
annual-reports). Is this public reporting accurately capturing the 
amount of rebates and other payments retained by PBMs (or an affiliate, 
subsidiary, or agent of a PBM)? If not, how might policymakers 
accurately capture the amount of revenue retained by PBMs (or an 
affiliate, subsidiary, or agent of a PBM)?

    Answer. It is hard to know if these reports are accurate, although 
I have my doubts. There were 66 PBMs in the U.S.\26\ in 2022, while the 
Texas reports contain data from 19 PBMs in 2019, 23 in 2020, and 13 in 
2021. This seems like a relatively small number of respondents, and I 
can't think of a reason why the number would fall so much between 2020 
and 2021. I do not believe the reports are audited. We have also seen 
PBMs engage in some evasive tactics when rebates are in the spotlight. 
When policymakers began paying more attention to rebates around 2018-
2019, some PBMs responded by proliferating the number of ``fees,'' 
``concessions,'' and ``allowances'' collected from manufacturers, 
without labeling them ``rebates.'' The suspicion is that by relabeling 
the rebate revenue stream, PBMs were shielding it from new rebate 
reporting requirements. Such seemingly evasive maneuvers raise my 
suspicion that State rebate reports are not capturing the full story.

    Question. Why do PBMs own or operate affiliated organizations such 
as group purchasing organizations or rebate aggregators? What do these 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
entities do?

    Answer. These frequently offshore entities negotiate for and 
collect rebates from drug manufacturers, retain a portion of that 
revenue and distribute the remainder to their affiliated PBMs. Those 
PBMs then generally pass that rebate revenue to their health plan 
clients. Over time, health plan clients have been negotiating for an 
increasing share of rebates--many of them have contracts that specify 
100 percent rebate pass-through. By creating the offshore GPO which 
retains a portion of the manufacturer revenue before it is passed to 
the PBMs, these integrated organizations are able to keep more of the 
manufacturer revenue for themselves, while still claiming to pass 
through ``all'' or ``most'' of the rebates to health plans. Indeed, 
they may pass through 100 percent of the rebates that the PBMs get, but 
they are not passing through 100 percent of the rebates that the 
manufacturers pay, because the GPO is retaining a share. There may be 
tax advantages as well.

    Question. In 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services 
(HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) published a report (titled, 
``Gaps in Oversight of Conflicts of Interest in Medicare Prescription 
Drug Decisions'') recommending that each Medicare Part D plan's 
Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (P&T) have members who are free of 
conflict from PBMs. HHS OIG specifically recommended that a Medicare 
Part D plan's P&T committee should be free of conflict with any PBM 
that manages the plan's prescription drug benefit. Since this 
recommendation was issued in 2013, CMS updated some conflict of 
interest policies, but not this recommendation. Should CMS require some 
(or all) P&T committee members be free of conflict with any PBM?

    Answer. Yes, I believe CMS should require P&T committee members to 
be free of conflict with any PBM. Current rules only define conflicts 
of interest in relation to pharmaceutical companies and plan sponsors, 
but PBMs can also exert influence on P&T decision-making in a way that 
harms beneficiaries. Because PBMs may benefit from manufacturer 
rebates, they may recommend high rebate drugs that have higher list 
prices, thereby exposing beneficiaries to higher out-of-pocket costs.

    Furthermore, negotiated rebates are confidential, making it 
impossible for PBM-conflicted members to disclose their conflicts 
related to specific drugs and manufacturers to enable committee 
deliberations to specifically take those financial interests into 
account. That is, disclosure--a common conflict of interest remedy--is 
not a feasible remedy for conflicts in this case. Requiring that 
members be free from a PBM conflict would be an efficient way to remove 
potential bias from the financial influence of PBM rebates.

    If a PBM's perspective is required to make a formulary decision, it 
can be obtained through other channels, without requiring PBM-
conflicted members on the P&T committee. Outside stakeholder 
perspectives are routinely gathered by P&T staff for specific issues 
and presented to the committee for consideration. A PBM's perspective, 
if needed, could be collected and presented in the same way.

                Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
    Question. Your testimony indicates that more oversight and 
transparency of the PBM industry is needed as a result of the 
concentrated market and the opaque system that they operate in.

    What other solutions do you need as appropriate? Do you think 
consolidation of the industry is the main driver of some of these 
issues?

    Answer. I do believe consolidation, and especially vertical 
integration in this industry, has been very problematic. It has led to 
many of the commercial tactics we are concerned with today, that reduce 
transparency, inhibit competition, and raise health-care costs for 
patients and taxpayers. It has also increased the scope these large and 
sophisticated organizations have to evade transparency and other 
requirements that could be effectively brought to bear if they were 
standalone businesses.

    For other suggested solutions I believe appropriate, please see my 
responses to Senator Wyden's question 1 above.

    Question. During the hearing, you mentioned one idea to take 
generics out of health insurance coverage. In your Washington Post op-
ed, you write ``yet insurance coverage has enabled middlemen to feast 
on billions of these prescriptions each year, keeping prices higher 
than they need to be.''

    Are there other intermediaries in the supply chain that are 
contributing to this issue excluding PBMs?

    Answer. Some pharmacies may also be contributing to the issue here, 
although it is hard to disentangle definitively, especially because we 
do not have good data on pharmacy DIR fees. We compared what Medicare 
paid for common generic prescriptions to what Costco members paid with 
cash, and found a 21-percent difference.\27\ Costco's pharmacy was 
still earning a margin on those cash scripts--Costco's pharmacy margins 
are not included in the 21-percent overage. But if other pharmacies are 
taking a larger margin than Costco (and I find that plausible), then 
that 21-percent overpayment may include some pharmacy margin as well.

    Question. Do you think biosimilars should remain a part of health 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
insurance coverage?

    Answer. Yes. Most biosimilars are still rather expensive, and many 
patients would struggle to pay for them without insurance. While health 
insurance coverage through the existing system probably increases the 
costs of these drugs overall, those drawbacks must be weighed against 
the significant benefits of insuring patients from large, unpredictable 
health-care costs. By contrast, the majority of common generic 
prescriptions can be purchased for less than $20 at Costco, so insuring 
them does not protect patients from large, unpredictable expenditures.

                                 ______
                                 
                  Question Submitted by Hon. Tim Scott
    Question. HHS's Office of the Inspector General issued a report in 
2022 that concluded that Medicare Part D, a highly successful program, 
could realize significant spending reductions with increased biosimilar 
use. Additionally, an ERISA Industry survey released that same year 
found that employers are concerned about rebate gamesmanship and prefer 
all biosimilars to be included on formularies.

    If formulary access for biosimilars continues to be restricted, 
will patients see any significant savings in out-of-pocket costs?

    Answer. A growing literature has demonstrated that in Medicare Part 
B, biosimilar entry corresponds with greater availability and use of 
lower-priced alternatives to the reference product, and falling prices 
for the reference product. Forthcoming Schaeffer research additionally 
finds that biosimilar prices--as measured by both the average sales 
price and net manufacturer price--continue to fall the longer the 
biosimilar products are on the market, particularly in markets with 
multiple biosimilar competitors. This evidence suggests that market 
competition in the biosimilar market is reducing prices, and that 
competition can help patients see significant savings in out-of-pocket 
costs. But these dynamics occur in the context of Medicare Part B, 
where payment is based on the Average Sales Price (ASP), a price 
benchmark that is net of rebates.

    Biosimilars in Medicare Part D are a more recent phenomenon, and 
may be following a different path. We have seen biosimilar 
manufacturers launch the same biosimilar product with two prices--a 
high-list-price/high-rebate version, and a low-list-price/low-rebate 
version--and PBMs respond by preferring the high-list-price version 
over the low-list-price version, or excluding the low-list-price 
version entirely. Such tactics expose patients to high costs when their 
out-of-pocket expenses are tied to the drug's list price. If new 
biosimilars are to reduce patients' financial burden, their out-of-
pocket costs may need to be decoupled from the drug's list price, 
either using a flat copayment, or tying out-of-pocket charges to the 
drug's net-of-rebate price.

               Questions Submitted by Hon. James Lankford
                          vertical integration
    Question. Many PBMs are now a large part of massive conglomerates 
that include an insurer, a retail pharmacy chain, the PBM that 
negotiates between plans and drug manufacturers, and now even physician 
practices.

    How does this ownership structure, where the same company is able 
to decide what drug is prescribed, whether a lower-cost generic is 
available to a patient, what drug is covered by insurance and on what 
formulary tier it is placed, how much the patient's out-of-pocket 
requirements are for a drug, and where a patient can access their 
prescription: (1) create an anticompetitive monopoly, and (2) impact 
patient health?

    Answer. Vertically integrated firms have more information and 
increased opportunities for extracting economic rents at the expense of 
independent pharmacies and patients. Please see my response to Senator 
Grassley's question 2 about vertical integration above for more detail.
                                rebates
    Question. When previous rules have been proposed from an 
administration regarding the elimination of rebates, hysteria ensued 
because some estimates showed it would increase costs for the Federal 
Government and patients' premiums may increase.

    Have model systems been created to test what would really happen if 
rebates were removed from the pharmaceutical pricing supply chain? Do 
such models show that pharmaceutical products' list prices will drop 
and drugs may be able to compete using their prices for formulary 
placement?

    Answer. While I am unaware of any specific model system that would 
test what would happen if rebates are removed, in general, these kinds 
of models rely very heavily on assumptions. For example, as my USC 
Schaeffer colleagues have described, the hysteria to which you refer 
largely reflected CBO and CMS OACT estimates of the 2019 ``rebate 
rule,'' which was based on assumptions that manufacturer rebates would 
be reduced by 15 percent in Medicare Part D. We do not know how CBO and 
CMS OACT arrived at those assumptions, but alternative assumptions--
such as those modeled in an analysis \28\ conducted by Milliman 
prepared for the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services--projected potential Federal 
savings from the rule. In the Federal Register, DHHS noted \29\ that 
they engaged multiple analyses from OACT and actuarial firms precisely 
because ``it is difficult to predict manufacturer and Part D plan 
behavior in response to this regulation.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2019-02-06/pdf/2019-
01026.pdf.

    In fact, CBO estimates of other proposals have projected savings 
from policies intended to increase transparency in PBM markets. For 
example, in 2019, CBO scored \30\ the Lower Health Care Costs Act. 
Section 306 would have required PBMs operating in commercial health-
care markets to (in short) provide information on costs, aggregate 
rebates, and fees; fully pass rebates, fees, discounts, or other 
remuneration to plan sponsors; and prohibit spread pricing. CBO 
estimated these provisions would reduce average premiums in the private 
insurance market and decrease the deficit by $1.7 billion over the 
2019-2029 period.

                 Prepared Statement of Hon. Ron Wyden, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Oregon
    The Finance Committee meets this morning to continue our 
longstanding efforts to lower the cost of health care for taxpayers and 
patients. Today the committee focuses on pharmacy benefit managers, in 
particular the new strategies--like charging administrative fees tied 
to the price of a drug--that these multibillion-dollar corporations 
have aggressively adopted in the last 4 years since the Finance 
Committee previously held a hearing about PBMs.

    Pharmacy benefit managers had a strong case for themselves back in 
the 1980s and 1990s. The original goal was to use their access to 
limited data to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of their 
clients--insurance companies and employers. When prescription drug 
coverage came to Medicare with Part D in the 2000s, PBMs shifted into 
overdrive with a larger market and more sophisticated drugs.

    In recent years, it's increasingly apparent that PBMs are using 
their data, market power, and know-how to keep prices high and pad 
their profits instead of sharing the benefits of the prices they 
negotiate with consumers and the Medicare program. I believe this is an 
industry that is going in the wrong direction, and that's having a big 
impact on the prices Americans are paying at the pharmacy counter.

    There are serious consequences for the Federal health programs the 
Finance Committee is responsible for. Between Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, 
and the individual health insurance marketplace, the committee oversees 
health coverage for more than half of all Americans, or roughly 180 
million people. Prescription spending for these Americans constitutes a 
significant portion of the amount that the United States as a whole 
spends on pharmaceuticals each year--which totaled $577 billion in 
2021. That's why it's so critical for this committee to examine what 
needs to be done to modernize the rules of the road for PBMs.

    I'm proud to say that this is a hearing with strong bipartisan 
interest, and Senator Crapo and I have agreed to take on this issue 
together. That means looking at pharmacy benefit manager practices with 
a thorough eye and taking any legislative steps necessary to ensure 
taxpayers and patients aren't getting a raw deal. The Finance Committee 
has a long history of tackling big-league issues on a bipartisan basis, 
and the results speak for themselves.

    Before I turn it over to Senator Crapo, I want to illustrate just 
one example of PBMs practices that result in high prices. In a 
competitive market, if two products have equal quality, a business 
should prefer the lower-cost option. However, oftentimes PBMs charge 
administrative fees to drug makers which are calculated as a percentage 
of a drug's list price. That means PBMs get a higher payment if they 
favor higher-cost drugs. In my view, that's a clear example of the 
perverse incentives PBMs have created that leave so many Americans fed 
up and outraged at the health-care system in this country.

    The consequences of this out-of-whack market are felt by taxpayers 
and American families every time they pick up a prescription at the 
pharmacy counter. Discounts negotiated by PBMs play an important role 
in driving down premiums for seniors. But the games PBMs play behind 
the scenes also appear to be driving up drug costs for many seniors, 
who are forced to pay top dollar for their prescriptions at the 
pharmacy counter while PBMs profit at their expense.

    Today's hearing is an important opportunity for committee members 
to get up to speed on the latest practices being employed by pharmacy 
benefit managers and the impact these tactics are having on taxpayers 
and Americans who count on expensive medications for a decent quality 
of life.

    Thank you to our witnesses for joining the committee this morning.

Senator Ron Wyden, Chair
Senator Mike Crapo, Ranking Member
Committee on Finance
United States Senate

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo,

Thank you for your focus on the pharmacy benefits management (PBM) 
industry. While PBMs serve several important functions in our system of 
drug procurement and reimbursement, the dominant business model also 
creates unintended consequences that are not in the interest of 
individual consumers. While much attention has been paid to the effect 
of PBM rebates on the cost of branded drugs, we wish to draw your 
attention to potential for increased costs to individual consumers, 
health plans and the Medicare program related to generic specialty 
drugs.

Civica is a non-profit generic drug company established to reduce drug 
shortages and ensure a reliable supply of essential medicines to 
hospitals at fair prices. CivicaScript, a public benefit corporation, 
is the operating unit of Civica that was established in partnership 
with health plans to lower costs for consumers at the pharmacy counter. 
CivicaScript was founded in partnership with 18 BlueCross and 
BlueShield plans and the BCBS Association. Additional members include 
health plans Elevance (formerly known as Anthem) and HCSC and two PBMs, 
Navitus and Emsana Rx.

In 2022, CivicaScript launched abiraterone 250mg. Abiraterone is a 
generic oral drug used in combination to treat prostate cancer. The 
average cost of a month's supply of abiraterone 250mg to Medicare Part 
D in 2021 was over $3,000. However, CivicaScript's selling price is 
$160. Our recommended maximum price to the consumer, allowing for a 
fair pharmacy dispensing fee, is $171.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ CivicaScript is the first company to introduce quality 
affordable generics with a transparent consumer price by making our 
maximum retail price (MaxRPTM) of $171 publicly available including 
through a QR code on the packaging.

One might hope that our health system would take advantage of the 
availability of CivicaScript abiraterone at a low cost to lower costs 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
for consumers and for the Medicare program.

Unfortunately, while CivicaScript and its health plan partners have 
attempted to work with all the major PBMs, most have not been willing 
to deliver this drug to patients at low cost, and average costs per 
claim remain high (Table 1).

Based on publicly available pricing information,\2\ it is certainly 
likely that large vertical health-care companies acquire competing 
products at lower cost than CivicaScript's $160. But if so, the 
question remains: why are consumers, health plans and Medicare paying 
such high prices?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ On March 25, 2023, the publicly advertised cash prices for 
abiraterone 250mg ranged from $186.90-$8,661.38 (GoodRx, accessed 27 
March 2023). The National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) 
published by Medicaid is $229.10 for 2022.

One possible reason is that because of its cost, abiraterone is still 
classified as a ``specialty drug,'' products that are normally 
dispensed through a ``specialty pharmacy.'' We note that the vast 
majority of the specialty pharmacy dispensing in the United States 
occurs through PBM-owned specialty pharmacies. Therefore, the same 
entity that is theoretically working on behalf of health plans, 
consumers, and Medicare to reduce drug costs also has an incentive to 
maximize its revenues from dispensing.

CivicaScript's health plan partners have been creative in their 
attempts to get PBM-owned specialty pharmacies to dispense CivicaScript 
abiraterone, proposing a number of models, mechanisms and workarounds 
to get this drug to consumers at low cost. To date, with the exception 
of Navitus, a CivicaScript founding member, none of the largest PBM-
owned specialty pharmacies have purchased or dispensed CivicaScript 
abiraterone.

Specialty pharmacy dispensing accounts for an estimated 32 percent of 
total PBM gross profits.\4\ In addition to abiraterone, numerous other 
specialty drugs have approved generic versions available which should 
reduce the cost of medications.

Chair Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Committee:

On behalf of our nations over 310,000 pharmacists, the American 
Pharmacists Association (APhA) is pleased to submit the following 
Statement for the Record to the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance 
hearing ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply 
Chain: Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.''

APhA is the largest association of pharmacists in the United States 
advancing the entire pharmacy profession. APhA represents pharmacists 
and pharmacy personnel in all practice settings, including community 
pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care facilities, specialty pharmacies, 
community health centers, physician offices, ambulatory clinics, 
managed care organizations, hospice settings, and government 
facilities. Our members strive to improve medication use, advance 
patient care, and enhance public health.

APhA applauds the Committee's ongoing leadership and recognition 
federal legislation must be passed to address pharmacy benefit 
managers' (PBMs) harmful business practices that are increasing 
prescription drug costs at the expense of patients and creating 
``pharmacy deserts'' in minority and underserved communities, where the 
neighborhood pharmacy may be the only health care provider for 
miles.\1\ PBMs' business practices have undermined the community 
pharmacy business model, resulting in many pharmacies having to make 
the challenging choice of taking a loss when filling a prescription to 
ensure patients are not denied access to their needed medications. As 
the most accessible healthcare professional, pharmacists should be able 
to provide the high-quality care they are trained to provide without 
fear it will cause them to go out of business. In a February 2023 
national survey conducted by APhA, 91.5% of respondents reported that 
current PBM practices negatively impact their practice and ability to 
provide patient care.\2\ As explained during APhA's recent PBM 101 
briefing for congressional staff,\3\ there are already mountains of 
data for Congress to take action from Medicare, Medicaid and commercial 
plans on PBMs' uncompetitive and deceptive trade practices that target 
patients with chronic conditions, and force them to use PBM-owned 
specialty and mail order pharmacies rather than their local pharmacy. 
It's way past time to put patients over PBM profits, and Congressional 
action is overdue.

Background

     PBMs originally emerged over 40 years ago as middlemen between 
health plans and pharmacies to adjudicate claims.
     Over the years, three PBMs have come to control 80% of the total 
market share \4\ and have vertically integrated with insurers, chain 
pharmacies and specialty pharmacies.

Imperatives. Hirc. Available at https://www.hirc.com/PBM-market-
landscape-and-imperatives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Numerous reports from pharmacists and media over the years have 
documented unfair and anticompetitive practices from PBMs on community 
pharmacies. These include clawbacks (known under Medicare as direct and 
indirect remuneration (DIR) fees which PBMs often assess weeks, or even 
months, after Part D beneficiaries' prescriptions are filled, resulting 
in pharmacies realizing only long after the prescription was filled 
that they did not recoup their costs), gag clauses (preventing sharing 
cash prices with patients), spread pricing (overcharging the payer, 
underpaying the pharmacy and keeping the spread), patient steering to 
PBM-owned pharmacies, mandatory mail-order raising patient safety 
concerns, and many other concerning practices.
     In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled on 
Rutledge v. PCMA in the pharmacy communities favor, opening the door 
for state oversight of PBMs.\5\

Why PBM Reform is Needed

     The pharmacy reimbursement and drug pricing scheme in the U.S. 
has grown out of control, with misaligned incentives that neither 
benefit the patient nor lead to better health outcomes. These 
misalignments are causing pharmacies across the country to shut their 
doors, leaving patients without access to their local pharmacies.
     As a result of the predatory practices of PBMs:

     Patients' access to their medications and their trusted 
healthcare professional, the pharmacist, should not be jeopardized due 
to misaligned incentives in the PBM industry that prioritize profits 
over patients.
     The unsustainable reimbursement model for medications caused by 
PBMs has contributed to negative workplace conditions for pharmacists 
and pharmacy teams.

PBMs are Costing Medicare and the U.S. Taxpayer

     Between 2010 and 2020 the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid 
Services (CMS) reports that pharmacy direct and indirect remuneration 
(DIR) fees increased by more than 107,400 percent.\9\ The increase in 
point-of-sale and retroactive pharmacy price concessions have 
contributed to an unsustainable environment for community pharmacies to 
keep their doors open.

Congressional Ask

     Transparency: APhA supports transparency and accountability in 
reimbursement and pricing to ensure consistent practices throughout the 
drug supply chain.
     Sustainability: APhA supports pricing models that allow for the 
fair reimbursement of drug products and dispensing fees that can 
support a sustainable business model within community pharmacies.
     Accountability: APhA encourages appropriate oversight from state 
and federal agencies to prohibit pricing manipulations and 
anticompetitive practices that harm patient access to their medications 
and their pharmacist.

Legislation

     APhA supports the amended Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency 
Act (S. 127) that recently passed the Senate Commerce, Science and 
Transportation Committee. Initial estimates from the Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO) found that S. 127 saves taxpayers $740 million. We 
would also support removing the exemption for passing along 100 percent 
of rebates to health plans or payers as this provision does not 
guarantee plans and payers will pass these ``savings'' on to patients 
or ensure adequate pharmacy reimbursement.
     APhA also supports the Drug Price Transparency in Medicaid Act, 
which would reign in PBMs' unfair use of ``spread pricing.'' Spread 
pricing is a practice in which a PBM charges the state or health plan 
more than they pay the pharmacy for a medication and then keeps the 
``spread'' as a profit, often reimbursing the pharmacy for less than 
their cost to acquire the drug. This hurts pharmacies' ability to stay 
in business and provide care to the vulnerable Medicaid beneficiaries 
whom they serve. This legislation would also move all state Medicaid 
managed care programs to a market-based reimbursement model that more 
closely reflects the true acquisition costs of prescription drugs in 
Medicaid plus a fair professional dispensing fee. APhA previously 
sponsored a study that found that utilizing a model of Medicaid's 
National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) plus a professional 
dispensing fee offered an overall point-of-sale spending decrease for 
prescription drugs at pharmacies, which would result in billions of 
projected savings to Medicare beneficiaries as a result of their 
reduced cost-sharing obligations.\11\

Patient Need

     Patients are harmed by insurer and PBM practices that mask the 
real prices of medications, increase the amount they pay at the 
pharmacy counter, and interfere with pharmacists' ability to provide 
patient care.
     As a result of anticompetitive practices, PBMs have caused 
pharmacies to close, contributing to pharmacy deserts which are 
especially prominent in racial and ethnic minority communities.\12\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     These practices impact taxpayers as they contribute to inflated 
prices of medications reimbursed under public health plans. A study 
found that PBM tactics forced Oregon Medicaid to overpay $1.9M on a

looks forward to working with the Committee to restore transparency, 
accountability, competition, and equity to our nation's supply chain 
and health care marketplace. Please contact Doug Huynh, JD, APhA

Re: Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply Chain: 
Impact on Patients and Taxpayers (March 30, 2023).

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) play an important role in managing 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees' individual and group plan, 
as well as Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Managed Care plans, and 
prescription drug benefits. However, some PBM practices have put 
participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees' health and safety at risk, 
as well as restricted underserved individuals' access to safe and 
affordable prescription drugs. ASHP is the largest association of 
pharmacy professionals in the United States, representing over 60,000 
pharmacists, student pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians in all 
patient care settings, including hospitals, ambulatory clinics, and 
health-system community pharmacies. Our members have seen firsthand how 
PBM practices can limit and put at risk patient care.

Bring Transparency to PBM Rebates: Manufacturer drug rebates for 
patient out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses that are being taken by PBMs are 
opaque and need greater transparency. At a minimum, rebates intended 
for patients' OOP expenses should be provided at the point-of-sale 
(POS) and instituted in a manner designed to simplify reimbursement and 
promote transparency for both patients and pharmacies. Often the 
negotiated rate between a PBM and a manufacturer so adversely impacts a 
pharmacy's ability to cover its acquisition cost for a product, the 
cost to the pharmacy is greater than a dug's acquisition cost. POS 
reimbursement should, in all cases, be sufficient to cover a pharmacy's 
acquisition cost for a drug. Additionally, we recommend that all 
contracts clearly outline prescription and pharmacy performance 
measures, fees, and expectations, as they relate to reimbursement. 
There should be complete transparency about expectations and comparator 
benchmarks related to performance and outcomes.

Pharmacy Fees: Pharmacy fees have increased exponentially over the last 
few years. According to data released by CMS, ``performance-based 
pharmacy price concessions, net of all pharmacy incentive payments, 
increased, on average, nearly 170 percent per year between 2012 and 
2020 and now comprise the second largest category of DIR received by 
sponsors and PBMs, behind only manufacturer rebates''\1\ These fees 
were originally created to incentivize quality. However, they have 
become arbitrary in nature and purpose and quite extensive. For 
instance, many times the quality metric a pharmacy fee is based on is 
irrelevant to the setting and medical condition a drug is used to 
treat. Pharmacy fees are also usually unknown until a drug is dispensed 
and the claim adjudicated. Until recently, these fees were enforced 
retroactively, placing pharmacists in financial peril. While the 
retroactive collection of fees is expected to terminate based on CMS's 
recent ruling, vague administrative fees and unclear performance 
measures may not be impacted.\2\ We recommend that no administrative, 
prescription, quality, performance, or other care-related fees be 
collected retroactively, but clearly outlined at the POS. We also 
recommend an individual or group plan, and its PBM, be prohibited from 
enforcing pharmacy fees except when the quality measure on which a fee 
based is directly relates to the condition a patient is being treated 
and is appropriate for the setting the patient is being treated in. 
Lastly, we recommend that any fee to be collected and related to 
performance be clearly outlined in scope and magnitude within the 
contract with a pharmacy, allowing pharmacies to properly forecast 
budgeting and understand expectations.

and Regulations; page 27834.
    \2\ Id.

Prohibiting White and Brown Bagging: White bagging occurs when a PBM 
requires patient medications be distributed through a narrow network of 
specialty pharmacies that are often affiliated with the PBM before the 
pharmaceuticals are then sent to a site of care, such as a hospital, 
where they will be dispensed by a provider. Hospitals have strict 
quality controls and by circumventing the traditional and regulated 
hospital supply chain, white bagging raises patient safety risks by 
enabling diversion and heightening the possibility of drug spoilage/
wastage. Brown bagging occurs when a PBM ships medications to a 
patient, who then must take the pharmaceutical to the provider for 
administration. These medications typically require special storage and 
handling. White bagging and brown bagging put pharmaceuticals at risk 
of spoilage, contamination, and diversion, putting patients' health at 
risk. We recommend Congress prohibit PBMs from imposing white and brown 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
bagging.

Protecting the 340B Program and Providers Against Discrimination: 
Safety net hospitals rely on the 340B Drug Pricing Program to provide 
healthcare services, including care for uninsured and underinsured 
patients. However, PBMs have been discriminating against 340B 
providers, including excluding them from networks or making them use 
their software and other services at additional costs with the intent 
of reducing reimbursements for 340B purchased drugs. We recommend 
Congress prohibit PBMs from discriminating against 340B providers with 
the intent of reducing reimbursements for 340B purchased drugs, 
including such practices as excluding 340B providers from networks or 
requiring payment of fees or the use of specific claims software as a 
means of increasing drug costs beyond 340B levels.

Expanding Access to Biosimilars: Uptake of biosimilars lags behind 
coverage of small molecule generic drugs. Insurers and their PBMs 
typically only cover one preferred brand of any given biologic product, 
excluding all other biosimilar products. This is contrary to how plans 
cover small molecule drugs where they are required to cover all 
commercially available generics. We recommend Congress require that an 
individual or group plan, and its PBM, that covers multiple generic 
small molecule drugs in a formulary, treat biosimilars in a similar 
fashion. Thus, an individual or group health plan, and its PBM, that 
cover a reference (brand name) biologic or any biosimilar of the 
reference product, must cover all biosimilars of that product.

ASHP thanks you for considering these recommendations regarding PBMs, 
which will ensure participants, beneficiaries, and enrollees have 
access to safe and effective drugs. We look forward to continuing to 
work with you on this issue. If you have questions or if ASHP can 
assist in any way, please contact Frank Kolb at fkolb@ashp.org.

      Statement of Lori J. Pierce, M.D., FASCO, Chair of the Board

The Association for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is pleased to submit this 
statement for the record of the hearing entitled, ``Pharmacy Benefit 
Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply Chain: Impact on Patients and 
Taxpayers.'' ASCO is pleased that the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance 
is exploring this issue.

ASCO represents more than 45,000 oncology professionals who care for 
people living with cancer. ASCO works to ensure that all individuals 
with cancer have access to high quality, equitable care; that cancer 
delivery systems support optimal cancer care; and that our nation 
supports robust federal funding for research on the prevention, 
screening, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

ASCO has endorsed the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 
2023. This bill, which advanced out of the U.S. Senate Committee on 
Commerce, Science, & Transportation, would provide transparency and 
hold pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) accountable for unfair and 
deceptive practices that may lead to an increase in prescription drug 
prices for patients with cancer.

Cancer drugs are a critical component of treatment for many cancer 
types as well as for the prevention and control of symptoms. They also 
represent an increasing component of cancer care costs. While PBMs were 
originally created to serve as third-party administrators of pharmacy 
claims, they now leverage their market power to obtain lower prices on 
drugs, often without passing those savings along to patients.

Further, ASCO members have reported that some patients have had their 
medication or dosage changed by PBMs without prior approval by or in 
consultation with the treating physician. PBMs are also increasingly 
shifting drug dispensing away from physicians and toward pharmacies 
they own, which can negatively impact patient access to treatment. In 
these ways, PBMs are interfering with the doctor-
patient relationship and lowering the quality of care for people with 
cancer.

ASCO supports efforts to shed light on PBM practices and prohibit 
unfair or deceptive practices that impact patients with cancer. For a 
more detailed understanding of our policy on this issue, we invite you 
to read the ASCO Policy Brief: Pharmacy Benefit Managers by our 
affiliate, the American Society of Clinical Oncology. We are committed 
to working with you as Congress continues to have meaningful dialogue 
about these issues. If you have any questions, please contact Kristine 
Rufener, Director of Congressional Affairs, at 
Kristine.Rufener@asco.org or 571-483-1547.

                                 ______
                                 
                  Letter Submitted by David Bagot, RPh
Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Committee,

    My name is David Bagot. I own and operate a small community 
pharmacy that services Rural Menard County, in Central Illinois. I want 
to thank you for holding this hearing today, and implore you to craft 
bills to curb the damaging business practices used by the PBM industry.

    It would take me way longer than the amount of time I have to write 
this statement to describe all of the things I know about PBMs and how 
they are degrading the quality of health care in this country while 
simultaneously driving up the cost. So, I will just make a short 
statement.

    PBMs make brand named medication more expensive by charging Big 
Pharma companies for formulary access. I do not believe I have to 
explain why that makes them more expensive. These kickbacks should be 
illegal and I hope that is the first thing done to reign in PBMs, 
remove their ``Safe harbor'' from laws that make kickbacks illegal.

    PBMs damage everyone who is involved in the transaction surrounding 
a patient buying a prescription drug:

         The patient. Must pay more for expensive prescriptions, must 
        settle for what drug the PBM wants them to have and not what 
        their doctor wants them to have, are told where and when they 
        can get their prescriptions. Is cut off from medications not 
        paying kickbacks to their PBM.
         Pharmacy. The pharmacy is under paid (spread pricing, AWP 
        minus contracts, claw backs like DIR fees . . .), patient 
        steering and the list goes on and on.
         Drug manufacturer. Must pay kickbacks to get their drug 
        covered and are then watch their reputation smeared by PBMs 
        saying they alone are the reason for high prices. If they do 
        not pay a high enough kickback their drug doesn't make the 
        formulary and is not used.
         Payers. Employers, government and folks purchasing Market 
        Place Plans. Everyone pays higher premiums because drugs cost 
        more than twice as much in the USA than anywhere else in the 
        world.

    PBMs have driven the price of many generic medications so low that 
they are no longer produced in our country. They have done this by 
under paying pharmacies, who then turn to their wholesaler for cheaper 
prices who then turn to the manufacturers for lower prices. Pretty 
soon, the only way the manufacturer can lower their price is by moving 
production to countries with super cheap labor. This is bad for all the 
obvious reason.

    Please fix our broken health care system, it is way past time!

    Thank you again for having this hearing, I look forward to 
listening in.

         Statement of Steven M. Nordstrom, Director of Pharmacy

Introduction

Big Y Foods, Inc. appreciates the opportunity to submit a statement for 
the record for the United States Senate Committee on Finance on 
``Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply Chain: 
Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.''

Big Y is a family owned and operated supermarket chain located in 
Massachusetts and Connecticut. We operate 72 grocery stores with 33 
locations offering pharmacy services. Big Y is one of the largest 
independently owned grocery chains in New England. The company was 
started in 1936 by founders Paul and Gerry D'Amour. The third 
generation of D'Amours are actively involved in the day to day 
operations of the business.

Great Concern about Pharmacy Benefit Manager Tactics

We are extremely concerned about pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) tactics 
that have significant negative effects on patients, communities, 
taxpayers, employers, and pharmacies. PBMs are hired by insurance plans 
and others to negotiate lower drug prices. Unfortunately, they 
manipulate the system and keep billions in profits while:

     Forcing patients and others to pay more for their medicines;
     Limiting patients' ability to choose their pharmacist;
     Restricting access to medicines that doctors and other 
prescribers determine to be right for the patient; and
     Jeopardizing pharmacies' viability--harming not only the 
pharmacy but also the patients and communities that rely on them.

The dominance of PBMs is significant. Three PBMs control 80 percent of 
the prescription drug market. These are the practical effects of PBM 
tactics:

     Over-payments: The University of Southern California Leonard D. 
Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics found that Medicare Part 
D standalone plans paid $2.6 billion more in one year for 184 common 
generic medications compared with prices for the same drugs available 
to cash-paying customers of one retailer.

     Restricting medications: Drug Channels analysis found that from 
2014 to 2022, 1,357 medications were excluded from at least one PBM 
formulary for at least one year. The exclusions of drugs from these 
lists have escalated since starting in 2012.

     Putting the squeeze on pharmacies: The Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services found that direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) 
fees charged by PBMs and payers to pharmacies have exploded by 107,400% 
over the last decade.

Big Y continues to grow as a company, building clean modern stores 
while adding jobs in the communities we serve. Unfortunately, we have 
not opened any new pharmacy locations in several years due to the 
incredible financial pressures being placed on the pharmacy industry by 
unfair PBM practices. As these behaviors go unchecked, operating a 
pharmacy becomes increasingly more difficult. Many independent 
pharmacies have been forced to close in our market area, unable to keep 
the doors open with rising costs and declining reimbursements. Big Y 
had to make the tough decision to close several pharmacies in 2019 
facing those same rising costs and declining reimbursements, making 
these pharmacies no longer viable. As more and more pharmacies close, 
customer access to convenient, friendly service is being limited, 
leaving only the big chains with long lines for many.

During the pandemic, our pharmacy team was a vital part of vaccinating 
our communities along with providing treatments to those infected and 
offering test kits as they became available. Incredibly, our 33 
pharmacy locations were able to administer 120,000 COVID vaccinations 
over the last two years. Teams of our pharmacists and technicians 
visited nursing homes, schools, and businesses to administer a variety 
of vaccinations, including COVID and Flu. Several of these locations 
reached out to us as the big chains would not service them because they 
were unable to meet the chains' minimum requirements. As independent 
pharmacies continue to close, this kind of service will go away; people 
will be left vulnerable and underserved.

At Big Y, the health and wellness of our employees and customers is our 
highest priority. Offering Pharmacy services is paramount to that goal. 
We would love to play a larger role providing those services, but we 
are limited by current PBM practices. Although the industry was excited 
by the CMS ruling on the elimination of D.I.R. claw backs starting in 
2024, we are already seeing PBMs enacting unfair business practices to 
recoup those lost profits. New contracts are being submitted with 
reimbursements well below our cost of goods and cost to dispense. These 
negative terms will force us to decline participation, in some cases 
limiting consumer access. This could lead to more potential job loss 
with scripts going to the major chains. Pharmacies need to be protected 
from these tactics in order to keep us as a viable business model. Our 
ask is simple; require PBMs reimburse us at a fair rate allowing us to 
provide our employees great pay and benefits while offering great 
service to our communities

We want to take this opportunity to define ``PBM reform.'' This is 
important to maximize the effectiveness of Congress' work in this area 
for patients, and to roll-back the current jeopardy posed by PBMs to 
pharmacies. For this purpose, we call to your attention the Principles 
of PBM Reform advocated by the National Association of Chain Drug 
Stores:

     Stop explosive retroactive fees. Stop PBMs and payers from using 
``DIR fees'' and other tactics to grab back the payments made and owed 
to pharmacies--often many months after the fact and often resulting in 
below-cost pharmacy reimbursement.

     Stop below-cost reimbursement. Adopt a reimbursement rate floor 
that prevents PBMs and payers from reimbursing pharmacies below the 
true cost of acquiring and dispensing prescription drugs.

     Stop gaming of performance measures. Standardize performance 
measures to help improve patient outcomes and reduce costs--rather than 
allowing PBMs and payers to play ``gotcha'' with pharmacies using 
arbitrary measures and exorbitant fees.

     Stop ``specialty definitions'' from steering patients from their 
pharmacy. Prevent PBMs and payers from defining ``specialty drugs'' in 
ways that steer patients with rare or complex diseases away from their 
preferred pharmacy of their choice and toward another pharmacy--
including those owned by the PBMs and payers.

     Stop mandatory mail-order. Prohibit PBMs and payers from forcing 
patients to use mail-order pharmacies--including those owned by the 
PBMs and payers--and prohibit them from imposing penalties on patients 
for choosing a convenient and trusted pharmacy in their neighborhood.

     Stop limited networks. Require PBMs and payers to include in 
their networks all pharmacies willing to accept terms and conditions 
established by the PBM.

     Stop overwhelming audits. Bring efficiency, transparency, and 
standardization to the processes by which PBMs audit pharmacies without 
sacrificing continuity of care.

     Stop the undercutting of PBM reform laws. Prioritize the 
implementation, enforcement, and oversight of PBM reform laws--to 
maximize results for patients and fairness for pharmacies and other 
stakeholders, and to ensure laws are not undermined by inaction of PBMs 
or of government.

Conclusion

In closing, we want to put to rest one of the myths perpetuated by 
PBMs. It is shocking that they have been able to stave off reform 
efforts by alleging that premiums will increase. This is nothing short 
of a scare tactic, and one that cannot be allowed to be used so 
flippantly and without substantiation. PBM reform will reduce 
prescription drug costs by cracking down on middlemen's manipulation. 
It does not follow logically that reductions in prescription drug costs 
will result in increased premiums. It is time to address the 
manipulative business practices of PBMs, as well as to end the negative 
effects of their tactics.

Big Y thanks the Committee for the opportunity to provide our 
perspective on PBM reform. For questions or further discussion, please

     Humira<SUP>'</SUP> Biosimilars: Opportunities and Barriers for
                        Patient Access Placement

       Common Sense Policies for Pharmacy Benefit Manager Reform

At least eight lower-cost, FDA-approved biosimilars for 
Humira<SUP>'</SUP> (adalimumab) are expected to become available to 
patients by the summer of 2023. Their launches will be consequential in 
determining the future success of the biosimilars market in the U.S. 
and could save patients and the U.S. healthcare system more than $5 
billion dollars a year, if--and only if--patients can actually access 
these medications at affordable costs.\1\

As Congress and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) examine pharmacy 
benefit manager (PBM) reform, recent biosimilar launches show how PBMs 
prioritize profits and backend rebates over patients. Most notably, the 
recent launches of Humira<SUP>'</SUP> (adalimumab) and insulin 
biosimilars highlight the market challenges presented to patients that 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
need them.

Actions must be taken now to accelerate biosimilar preferential 
placement on formularies as they become available. The following policy 
solutions and market reforms to address market challenges would 
increase access to lower-cost biosimilars for patients, promote 
prescription drug affordability, and support health equity.

  Existing PBM Practices: Perverse Incentives for Biosimilar Adoption

As Humira<SUP>'</SUP> (adalimumab) biosimilars launch, PBMs are 
expected to continue to favor the branded Humira<SUP>'</SUP> reference 
product by either placing it on a preferable formulary tier or 
requiring fewer restrictions for a patient to access it relative to it 
biosimilar competitors. This lack of access to lower-cost treatment 
options will stifle free market competition, limit patient savings, and 
harm the long-term viability of the biosimilars industry.

PBMs also often use rebates from biosimilar manufacturers to control 
formulary placement and uptake. Biosimilar manufacturers intend to 
offer patients significantly more affordable treatments options, but 
they are forced into rebates with PBMs to earn formulary access. These 
rebates increase the price of the biosimilar and patients' out-of-
pocket costs.

Biosimilar developers can be forced to launch biosimilars with high 
list prices, in order to accommodate PBM demands for the high rebates 
when the biosimilar developer would prefer to make the treatment 
available to patients at a lower list price. In an attempt to support 
patients, dual pricing strategies have emerged from biosimilar 
manufacturers. These pricing strategies focus on the traditional higher 
price/high rebate compared to using a lower list price strategy that 
could lower overall costs for patients and the healthcare system. 
However, a lower list price strategy will only benefit the patient if 
the PMB chooses the most competitive lower list price version to place 
on a preferred position on the formularies. This would mean giving up 
retroactive rebates in favor of point of sale discounts. When given 
this choice, the PBM has continued to prefer high WAC options.\2\ These 
PBM schemes thwart robust, transparent competition that will lower 
overall drug costs for patients and taxpayers.

from-semglee-early-perspectives-on-pharmacy-biosimilars.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
High List Prices Hurt Patients
     For example, Semglee<SUP>'</SUP>, an insulin biosimilar, was 
launched at two different prices. The unbranded version (insulin 
glargine) carries a wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of $147.98 for a 
package of five 3-ml pens. That price is 65% cheaper than the reference 
product's list price.
     Brand-name Semglee<SUP>'</SUP>, meanwhile, has a WAC of $404.04 
per package of five 3-ml pens. That version comes in only slightly 
cheaper than the reference product, which carries a list price of 
$425.31 for five pens.
     Uptake for the unlabeled Semglee<SUP>'</SUP> was slow for the 
first 10 months prior to the launch of labeled Semglee<SUP>'</SUP>, 
with Lantus holding onto 99% of the market share through November 2021. 
After interchangeable Semglee<SUP>'</SUP> launched, market share jumped 
to 15% of commercial prescriptions by March 2022. Authors of a recent 
IQVIA paper noted that payer formulary constraints were the main 
driver.\3\

www.iqvia.com/locations/united-states/library/white-papers/lessons-
from-semglee-early-perspectives-on-pharmacy-biosimilars.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This dual pricing strategy effectively provides payers with the 
option to choose between a high price, high rebate product, etc., that 
carries a lower price and features a lower rebate.
     A recent study showed that patients would rather pay slightly 
higher insurance deductibles to save out-of-pocket costs at the 
pharmacy.\4\

Faced-with-High-Cost-Sharing-for-Brand-Medicines.pdf.

Opaque volume-based rebate agreements that favor high list prices that 
do not save patients money when there is a lower list price option 
available is contrary to the intent of the U.S. healthcare system. 
Biosimilar manufacturers want to serve patients, but when our customers 
are plans and PBMs that have opposite goals than that of the patient, 
that task is impossible. The end result of not rebalancing the market 
will jeopardize healthcare costs long term.
Changes Required to Promote a Path Forward for Biosimilar Access
     PBMs must be willing to place biosimilars on their formularies--
as they are approved, including mid-year--in preferred positions 
without restrictions and make them accessible to patients and 
providers.\5\ Merely listing biosimilars on a formulary at parity with 
the brand biologic is not enough to ensure full patient access or 
maximum affordability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ Rebate walls may thwart biosimilar savings. Published September 
13, 2022. Accessed March 23, 2023, https://www.modernhealthcare.com/
supply-chain/humira-biosimilar-savings-may-face-delays.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PBMs must prioritize patients over profits and backend rebates 
by placing Humira<SUP>'</SUP> (adalimumab) biosimilars on formulary 
tiers that are affordable and unrestricted for patients. This will 
achieve full cost-savings for patients, instead of using them as 
leverage for larger rebates. For example, as it stands, brands may have 
opaque agreement that guarantees volume in exchange for a retroactive 
rebate at the end of the year. This takes decision-making away from 
patients and providers and disallows multiple points of competition 
from biosimilars.
     This situation results in limited formulary coverage for the 
biosimilar, as the reference product is ``preferred'' on formularies 
because of sizeable and anti-competitive volume contracting strategies.
     Currently, the launch of the first wave of pharmacy benefit 
biosimilars (Semglee<SUP>'</SUP> and Amjevita<SUP>TM</SUP>) has shown 
list prices close to that of the brand necessary to gain access to the 
PBM formulary. This may continue with the launch of additional Part D 
biosimilars and is not conducive to lowering drug prices for patients 
in 2023, as the patient will pay a percentage of high-rebated list 
price and lose most of the savings they could have had with the low-
rebate list price

                        Policy Solutions Needed

Lawmakers must lead in looking at savings in the long-term, which will 
be achieved with robust free-market competition, even if there are 
short-term costs with changing the current system. Increased patient 
access and cost-savings can be achieved by the following strategies.
 Congress Should Demand the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Immediately 
        Investigate PBM Actions Specifically Toward Biosimilars
     PBM rebate walls create de facto exclusivity and foreclose 
biosimilars from effectively competing with the reference product. The 
FTC's policy statement on Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act 
(FTC Act) (15 U.S.C. 45) states that ``de facto . . . exclusive 
dealing, or loyalty rebates that use market power in one market to 
entrench that power or impede competition in the same or a related 
market'' is anticompetitive and a clear violation of Section 5.\6\ We 
encourage the FTC to act quickly and decisively to bring challenges to 
this anti-competitive behavior.

of Unfair Methods of Competition Under Section 5 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act, Commission File No. P221202 (November 10, 2022) at 14.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The FTC must require PBMs to issue a market share report of 
patient uptake, by plan and drug mix, to establish biosimilar Humira 
access and uptake by January 1, 2024, with a final report and 
recommendations by January 1, 2025.
 Policymakers and Regulators Must Implement Commonsense Solutions to 
        Promote Biosimilar Access in Medicare Part D
     The Biden Administration, Congress, and federal regulators must 
ensure biosimilars are available to Medicare patients by allowing them 
the chance to compete on list price for preferred positions on 
formularies.
     CMS and policymakers must support a clear and expedited pathway 
to add biosimilars to Medicare Part D formularies.
        <ctr-circle>  Policies must not support artificial barriers 
        that do not allow replacement of the reference product from 
        Part D formularies.
        <ctr-circle>  Policies should not favor the ability for 
        formularies to prefer reference products and interchangeable 
        products over biosimilars without the interchangeable 
        designation. This includes policies related to biosimilar 
        formulary substitution and utilization management that favor 
        reference products and interchangeable biologics over 
        biosimilars.
 Enact Federal Legislation for Point-of-Sale Rebates to be Passed to 
        Patients
     Congress must pass legislation to remove barriers that prevent 
patients from accessing lower-cost biosimilars. These efforts could 
include:
        <ctr-circle>  De-linking fees for PBMs that have a direct 
        relationship with high list prices.
        <ctr-circle>  Promoting health equity and patient convenience 
        by disallowing anti-
        competitive vertical integration maneuvers, such as driving 
        patients to specialty pharmacies owned by the corresponding 
        PBMs and plans.
        <ctr-circle>  Charging PBMs more if they use other providers.
     Lawmakers must mandate that rebates are provided at the point of 
sale so that patients benefit from the cost-savings--not PBMs.
     Policymakers must promote transparency to patients, and 
employers on what agreements are taking place between PBMs, plans, and 
manufacturers.

   Biosimilars Forum Applauds the U.S. Senate Finance Committee for 
    Holding PBMs Accountable for Prioritizing Profits over Patients

Juliana M. Reed, executive director the Biosimilars Forum, released the 
following statement about the United States Senate Finance Committee 
hearing ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and the Prescription Drug 
Supply Chain: Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.'' At least eight lower-

``The members of the Biosimilars Forum and I applaud the Senate Finance 
Committee for holding PBMs accountable for their opaque and anti-
competitive pricing schemes that force higher prices on patients, while 
denying them access to the treatments they need.

``Biosimilars can save the health care system $133 billion by 2025 if 
they are fully available and accessible to the patients who need them. 
Unfortunately, PBMs often prevent patients from accessing these lower-
cost, FDA-approved treatments by forcing biosimilar manufacturers to 
launch biosimilars with high list prices and high rebates to gain 
access on their formularies. PBMs have proven time and time again that 
they prioritize higher list prices with high rebates over making 
treatments more affordable and accessible for patients.

``PBMs must be willing to support free market competition and place 
biosimilars on formularies--as they are approved, including mid-year 
updates--in preferred positions without restrictions. Particularly, 
PBMs must prioritize patients over profits and backend rebates by 
placing biosimilars--especially Humira<SUP>'</SUP> (adalimumab) 
biosimilars--on formulary tiers that are affordable and unrestricted 
for patients.

``Even though biosimilar manufacturers would prefer to make treatments 
available to patients at a lower list price, they are often forced to 
meet PBM demands for higher rebates to gain formulary access. This has 
led to dual pricing structures that focus on the traditional higher 
price and high rebates compared to using lower list prices for 
patients. These PBM schemes thwart robust, transparent competition.

``PBM transparency is not enough. Lawmakers and regulators must ensure 
biosimilars have preferential placement on formularies as they become 
available. This would increase access to lower-cost biosimilars for 
patients, promote prescription drug affordability, and support health 
equity.''

Chairman Wyden and the Ranking Member Crapo, thank you for the 
opportunity to submit these comments for the record.

This testimony relies on my experience as a member of the Cost 
Management Systems project of what was then called Computer-Aided 
Manufacturing--International, now the Consortium for Advanced 
Management--International. The project produced Cost Management for 
Today's Advanced Manufacturing. I created a handbook based on the 
project, the U.S. Air Force Orientation Guide to Advanced Cost 
Management.

A key concept in cost management, supply chain management and cost 
accounting is non-value-added cost. Pharmacy Benefit Managers are a 
non-value-added cost. While they do have an impact on the price 
manufacturers can charge, they are the primary, if not the sole, 
beneficiaries.

The answer to this problem is some form of single payer healthcare, 
whether it be through Medicare for All, an expanded Public Option (to 
replace Medicaid) or having employers pay for medications, healthcare 
workers (and education) and specialist/hospital care either directly or 
as a part of the organization. Please see our Single Payer Attachment 
for more on this issue.

The other significant driver of drug prices is the question of funding 
orphan drugs. The answer is easy. Keep control of orphan drug 
intellectual property in the hands of the National Institutes of 
Health. Let them, and other agencies such as the National Science 
Foundation, fund grants and research contracts to generate 
breakthroughs, as well as to manage clinical trials for FDA approval 
(if appropriate for the population that needs the drug). When the drug 
is approved, NIH can then contract for its manufacture and 
distribution.

This methodology will get more done faster, without relying on 
profiteering to do what is necessary to help our most vulnerable 
patients.

Thank you for the opportunity to address the committee. We are, of 
course, available for direct testimony or to answer questions by 
members and staff.

Attachment: Single Payer discussion from HHS Budget FY 2022

We address the funding of the Affordable Care Act, the need for an 
immediate COLA for retirees, funding the Social Security 
Administration's non-fund costs, and the idea of cost savings for 
Social Security.

So far, the Administration has not yet addressed changes to the 
Affordable Care Act, at least not publicly. We suggest that the 
Committee ask the Secretary about any such plans.

At minimum, the individual and employer mandates, with associated 
penalties, that were repealed must be restored. The President 
campaigned on restoring and perfecting the Act, adding a public option. 
We agree, although the public option need not be self-supporting. It 
must be subsidized through a broad-based consumption tax. Such a tax 
burdens both capital and wage income.

The current funding stream seems to have been designed to draw 
opposition from wealthier taxpayers. It is an open secret that the 
Minority does not oppose most of the Affordable Care Act (which was 
designed by their own Heritage Foundation as an alternative to Mrs. 
Clinton's proposals). Broaden the tax base to fund the program and the 
nonsense on repeal will end.

The current funding stream from student loan initiation and interest, 
which was included in the baseline, should also be ended. Graduates 
(and non-graduates) with student loan debt cannot afford both their 
loan payments and insurance payments under the Affordable Care Act. 
When they apply for lower loan payments, which are always granted, they 
face either a balloon interest payment or capitalized interest, which 
makes their funding situation worse. No one should have to retire with 
student loan debt, yet quite a few soon will (or already have).

Forgive capitalized interest and apply any overpayments to principal. 
There should not be a one-size-fits-all subsidy. Also, when payments 
are deferred, return to the practice of deferring interest (or allow 
debts to be discharged, at least partially, in bankruptcy).

To deal with these issues, whatever is budgeted for analytical support 
in the Department should likely be doubled.

The following analysis comes from the Single Payer attachment that has 
previously been provided. Because of the President's preference for 
establishing the public option, we will repeat those analyses here. 
Aside from a broader base of funding, other compromises are necessary 
to enact a public option.

To set up a public option to end protections for pre-existing 
conditions and mandates. The public option would then cover all 
families who are rejected for either pre-existing conditions or the 
inability to pay. In essence, this is an expansion of Medicaid to 
everyone with a pre-existing condition. As such, it would be funded 
through increased taxation, which will be addressed below. A variation 
is the expansion of the Uniformed Public Health Service to treat such 
individuals and their families.

The public option is inherently unstable over the long term. The profit 
motive will ultimately make the exclusion pool grow until private 
insurance would no longer be justified, leading-again to Single Payer 
if the race to cut customers leads to no one left in private insurance 
who is actually sick. This eventually becomes Medicare for All, but 
with easier passage and sudden adoption as private health plans are 
either banned or become bankrupt. Single-payer would then be what 
occurs when insurance companies are bailed out in bankruptcy, the 
public option covers everyone and insurance companies are limited to 
administering the government program on a state by state basis.

The financing of the Affordable Care Act should be broadened. It should 
neither be funded by the wealthy or by loan sharking student loan 
debtors. Instead, it should be funded by an employer-paid consumption 
tax, with partial offsets to tax payments for employer provided 
insurance and taxes actually collected funding a Public Option (which 
should also replace Medicaid for non-retirees). Medicaid for retirees 
and Medicare should be funded by a border adjustable goods and services 
tax, which should be broad based.

Why the difference? The goal is to not need a public option as 
employers do the right thing and cover every worker or potential 
worker. Using an employer-based tax is an incentive to maximize 
employee coverage. Medicare, however, is an obligation on society as a 
whole.

Re: Full Committee Hearing: Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the 
Prescription Drug Supply Chain: Impact on Patients and Taxpayers

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

On behalf of patients with chronic conditions, the Chronic Care Policy 
Alliance applauds the Finance Committee's focus on Pharmacy Benefit 
Managers (PBMs) and the role they play in the healthcare marketplace. 
While patients and families struggle to access the medications needed 
to manage their health and chronic conditions, PBMs exacerbate those 
challenges by driving up costs, limiting access to medications, and 
instituting harmful policies that limit the usefulness of financial 
assistance. We urge this committee to investigate the role of PBMs and 
institute policies that protect against measures that shift cost 
burdens to patients.

While PBMs were originally designed to create greater efficiency in 
processing pharmacy claims, their role has expanded over time. Taking 
advantage of a lack of transparency and oversight into their role, PBMs 
have implemented policies that create barriers for patients seeking to 
access medications and shift a greater share of the cost burden onto 
patients, all in the interest of increasing profits for PBMs.

For example, PBMs negotiate rebates on prescription drugs with 
manufacturers in the interest in lowering costs. Unfortunately, rather 
than pass these rebates on to patients, PBMs instead recoup the profits 
of these rebates. Meanwhile, patients who are already struggling to 
afford needed medications are left paying the original, undiscounted 
price for their medications.

Additionally, PBMs work alongside insurers to implement policies within 
health plans that further limit patient access to medications. 
Practices including limited drug formularies, adverse tiering, 
requirements for prior authorizations, and other discriminatory 
practices make it more difficult for both doctors and patients to 
identify effective therapies and maintain drug treatments.

Alongside these policies, we have also seen a sharp increase in copay 
accumulator rules within health plans. These rules exclude certain 
copay assistance programs from counting towards patient deductibles and 
out-of-pocket maximums. Millions of patients rely on copay assistance 
programs to help them afford their critically needed medications; 
therefore, these copay accumulator policies drive up patient costs and, 
in some instances, can put medications out of reach for patients.

If PBMs continue to have the ability to implement discriminatory 
practices and fail to share rebates with patients, they will be 
partially responsible for millions of patients foregoing their 
treatment regimens. Therefore, we urge this committee to protect 
patients by bringing transparency to these operators.

Sincerely,

Liz Helms

Chairman                            Ranking Member

On behalf of the nearly 40,000 children and adults with cystic fibrosis 
in the United States, we write to share additional perspectives on the 
topics discussed at the recent hearing on pharmacy benefit managers 
(PBMs), including concerns about the opaque influence of PBMs and the 
confusing, labyrinthian system they have created for patients.

The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is a national organization dedicated to 
curing cystic fibrosis (CF). We invest in research and development of 
new CF therapies, advocate for access to care for people with CF, and 
fund and accredit a network of specialized CF care centers. Cystic 
fibrosis is a life-threatening genetic disease that causes the body to 
produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and digestive system, 
which can lead to life-threatening infections. As a complex, multi-
system condition, CF requires targeted, specialized treatment and 
medications. If left untreated, infections and exacerbations caused by 
CF can result in irreversible lung damage, and the associated symptoms 
of CF lead to early death, usually by respiratory failure. 
Transformative therapies--such as CFTR modulators--have been paramount 
in changing what it means to live with CF. However, PBM cost 
containment strategies have created a convoluted system that patients 
struggle to navigate and often results in significant barriers to care.

PBMs manage prescription drug benefits on behalf of health insurers, 
Medicare Part D drug plans, large employers, and other payers. By 
negotiating with drug manufacturers and pharmacies to determine drug 
coverage and reimbursement, PBMs can exert significant control over 
total drug costs for insurers, patients' access to medications, and how 
much pharmacies are paid.\1\ PBMs often focus cost mitigation 
strategies on specialty drugs because of their high cost but low 
utilization within the overall population. PBM practices and the 
opacity of the system are extremely problematic and burdensome for 
chronic conditions like CF that primarily use specialty drugs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CF Community's Experience with PBMs

Overall, PBMs cause significant barriers to care for people with CF in 
navigating insurance. This is largely due to the lack of understanding 
of the role of PBMs in coverage decisions and evolving strategies that 
PBMs put in place to mitigate their own costs and those of their 
clients, which add out-of-pocket costs or administrative burden for 
patients.
Transparency
There is a lack of transparency on the role of PBMs, insurers, and 
subcontracted third-party entities in coverage and cost-sharing 
decisions, especially in the self-funded insurance market. This causes 
confusion on the appropriate point of contact for coverage decisions, 
increasing administrative burden on both patients and their care teams, 
and causing gaps in access to important therapies. PBMs and insurance 
companies both regularly claim that the other entity makes the final 
determinations on coverage for a therapy, resulting in an avoidance of 
responsibility from both parties and delays and confusion for the 
patients they cover. Patients and care teams frequently report being 
``passed back-and-forth'' between the two entities when seeking to 
understand coverage decisions. The result is that people with CF do not 
know who is ultimately responsible for decisions about their drug 
coverage, or where to appeal in order to access their essential 
treatments.

Third-party entities such as maximizers--many of which are owned by 
PBMs--and alternative funding programs add complexity to an already 
opaque system. Maximizers often outsource a patient's drug coverage to 
a third-party entity that sets the patients' cost-sharing at a level to 
maximize use of manufacturer copay assistance. Alternative funding 
programs also rely on third-party entities that seek to enroll patients 
in manufacturer patient assistance programs that provide free drugs, 
which are usually intended for people without insurance. Without 
transparency on the 
decision-maker (PBM vs. payer vs. third-party), patients often face 
unnecessary, confusing, and time-consuming administrative barriers and 
unacceptable and inappropriate treatment gaps. New coverage tactics 
emerge frequently, requiring patients and care teams to consistently 
learn and adapt to new, opaque, and confusing policies. PBMs are often 
at the center of these challenges.
Increased Out-of-Pocket Costs
In addition to maximizers and alternative funding programs, PBMs and 
insurers are increasingly implementing accumulator programs--which 
prevent third-party payments from counting towards deductibles and out-
of-pocket limits and therefore increasing out-of-pocket costs for 
patients. Many people with CF rely on third-party financial assistance 
to cover some of the costs associated with their care, as CF is an 
expensive disease. The CF Foundation recognizes that copay that copay 
assistance programs mask bigger cost and affordability issues; however, 
cost containment strategies like accumulator programs that further 
burden patients are unacceptable.

Recommendations

The CF Foundation appreciates the committee's attention to this issue. 
We urge Congress to ensure that the legislative proposals seek to 
improve the experience for patients, in addition to regulating the 
business and financial structure of PBMs. We provide the following 
recommendations:

HELP Copays Act: The CF Foundation recommends including the Help Ensure 
            Lower Patient Copays Act (HELP Copays Act; HR 830) in to 
            any PMB reform legislation. This bill reduces patient 
            administrative and financial barriers imposed by PBMs and 
            payers by (1) requiring payers to apply third party 
            assistance to out-of-pocket maximums and other patient 
            cost-sharing requirements; and (2) ensuring any item or 
            service covered by a health plan is considered part of 
            their essential health benefits (EHB) package. Together, 
            these policies would prohibit accumulators, maximizers, and 
            alternative funding programs in federally-regulated 
            insurance plans, eliminating some of the most problematic 
            PBM practices for patients.

Transparency: CF Foundation recommends Congress direct the FTC and HHS 
            to expand transparency measures for PBMs and insurers to 
            ensure patients receive better information about coverage 
            policies for specialty drugs, including relationships with 
            third-party entities. Specifically, Congress should direct 
            the FTC and HHS to require PBMs and payers to provide 
            enrollees with notices and disclosures on which entity is 
            responsible for coverage determinations and provide clear 
            contact information.

Oversight and Enforcement: The CF Foundation supports efforts by 
            Congress to require the FTC to determine whether there is 
            more information about PBMs that should be available to 
            consumers and whether there are any legal or regulatory 
            obstacles the FTC currently faces in enforcing the 
            antitrust and consumer protection laws in the PBM 
            marketplace.

Thank you for your leadership on this important issue. The CF 
Foundation stands ready to work with you to ensure patients' health and 
financial well-being are not sacrificed in the ongoing systemic debate 
among payers, PBMs, and drug manufacturers.

Sincerely,

            EmployersRx Coalition: Employers' Prescription 
                      for Affordable Drugs et al.
U.S. Senate
Committee on Finance

Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Committee, on 
behalf of the Employers' Prescription for Affordable Drugs 
(EmployersRx), and our undersigned members, we want to thank you for 
holding this important and timely hearing on Pharmacy Benefit Managers 
(PBMs) and the drug supply chain. We offer our appreciation to all of 
the witnesses and Members focused on the impact unaffordable 
prescription drugs have on Americans and thank you for your actions in 
support of meaningful PBM reform. EmployersRx stands ready to help as 
you begin this critical work.

EmployersRx is a nationwide effort led by the Purchaser Business Group 
on Health that includes The ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC), American 
Benefits Council, National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, 
Silicon Valley Employers Forum, HR Policy Association, and the Small 
Business Majority. Our members share a common goal--to bring more 
transparency to health care, ensuring employers and their employees are 
empowered by information. This is especially important with regards to 
PBM transparency to ensure employees have access to affordable 
prescription drugs.

Growing awareness around the lack of transparency, layers of 
complexity, and the many activities PBMs have devised that contribute 
to our country's spiraling drugs costs has created an unprecedented 
opportunity to compel change. The U.S. has a health care affordability 
crisis and employers, workers, and clinicians are all struggling in a 
health care system that incentivizes high cost, low quality care.

This crisis is greatly exacerbated by health care industry 
consolidation, including the fact that the three largest PBMs, which 
control 80 percent of the market, are now integrated with the country's 
largest health insurers as well as affiliated pharmacies and provider 
organizations. Their collective market power to determine where 
patients receive care, which drugs they can access, how much they pay 
and where their prescriptions are filled raises real questions about 
conflict of interest.

PBMs and their insurer parents exert enormous and often-harmful 
influence over drug cost and access for the 158 million Americans 
receiving health care through employer-sponsored coverage.\1\ Employers 
have a legal responsibility as plan fiduciaries--we are bound by law to 
act in the best interest of the plan beneficiaries and to be 
financially responsible of plan assets. For PBMs, the exact parameters 
of their responsibilities should align with the best interest of plan 
beneficiaries.

Strengthening-Employer-Sponsored-Insurance-Oct-2022.pdf.

Selecting and monitoring good health care services for workers and 
their families and paying for reasonable plan expenses is not only an 
employer's obligation under the law, but also good business as it helps 
companies recruit and retain top talent. However, despite being the 
primary customers for PMBs and even some of the country's largest 
companies and purchasers of health care--employers are no match against 
PBMs' significant market power. Employers continue to encounter 
barriers to PBM pricing and other data and simply lack the bargaining 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
power to require it.

For all these reasons, employers strongly believe the market is not 
functioning as intended and Americans are being denied access to 
affordable health care, including needed medicines. Therefore federal 
action is essential to address the anticompetitive aspects of the PBM 
business model by establishing clear regulatory oversight of the 
industry.

These actions should include:

    1.  Strong transparency and reporting requirements. Transparency 
for the primary customers of PBMs--employers--is a critical aspect to 
reform. Contracts between PBMs and employers typically do not provide 
details about fee or rebate schedules or amounts, prices, and fees 
generated from manufacturers and other parties, drug definition 
criteria, or amounts charged to pharmacies. Sometimes PBM control of 
information extends to an employer's effort to enforce contract 
compliance, as they may either prohibit an employer from auditing the 
PBM or require a PBM-designated auditor.

    2.  Prohibition or limits on spread pricing. PBMs should not be 
allowed to charge employers, health plans, or patients more for a drug 
than the PBM paid the pharmacy for that drug. Confidentiality clauses 
make it difficult for employers to identify what pharmacies pay and 
vice versa. This strategy has been especially profitable to PBMs, as 
exposed in numerous state Medicaid program audits.

    3.  Pass-through of 100 percent of all rebates and volume or 
access-based administrative fees by PBMs. The exploitation and 
manipulation of manufacturer rebate revenues and fees charged to 
employers for an ever-growing array of service and administrative fees 
has historically been a critical aspect of a PBM's business model. Due 
to significant pressure to pass rebate funds through to employers, PBMs 
are creating and/or increasing fees (over and above rebates) on 
manufacturers, pharmacies, other supply chain entities, and employers.

    4.  Prohibition on all ``workarounds.'' Falling rebate revenues has 
led to the creation of group purchasing organizations (GPOs), or rebate 
aggregator entities by the big three PBMs--of which two are established 
outside of the U.S. These workarounds must be addressed in any 
legislation put forward this year to guard against current and future 
gamesmanship of a PBM's legal requirements.

    5.  Transparency regarding PBM-owned pharmacies. American workers 
and their families rely on local pharmacies in many communities, 
especially in rural and low-income neighborhoods. PBMs should be 
required to submit information regarding transactions between the PBM 
and any pharmacy wholly or partially owned, including mail-order, 
specialty and retail pharmacies, by the PBM.

    6.  Definition and regulation of bona fide service fees. PBMs 
should be required to disclose the fees they receive from drug 
manufacturers for nonspecific services affecting plan design and costs 
to employers and their plan beneficiaries.

    7.  Establishment of clear regulatory oversight. Employers are 
required as plan fiduciaries to ensure they are good stewards of the 
health care benefits they provide for their employees. To fulfill that 
obligation, employers believe any legislation must require clear 
oversight and accountability of PBMs and specify the exact parameters 
of PBM responsibility.

The Senate Finance Committee has a key role in both uncovering the 
concerning practices of the PBM industry, as well as leadership in 
addressing this important issue. We support and applaud the committee's 
desire to act. We also encourage you to work with your colleagues in 
the other Senate and House committees of jurisdiction to ensure this 
important legislation lays the critical foundation and groundwork to 
reduce spending on prescription drugs and make health care more 
affordable and attainable for America's workers and their families.

EmployersRx looks forward to working with you to design and enact 
bipartisan, commonsense legislation that can pass Congress and be 
signed into law by President Biden. Together, we can bring true 
accountability and reform to the PBM industry. Please contact Alan 
Gilbert, Vice President for Policy, The Purchaser Business Group on

  Statement of Gregory J. Jones, R.Ph., MBA, Director of Pharmacy and 
                   Health/Wellness, Harmon City, Inc.

Introduction

Harmon City, Inc. appreciates the opportunity to submit a statement for 
the record for the United States Senate Committee on Finance on 
``Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply Chain: 
Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.''

Harmons is a family owned chain of 20 grocery stores. 19 of the grocery 
stores also have pharmacies. We have served the residents of Utah since 
1932, including pharmacy patients since 1945.

Great Concern about Pharmacy Benefit Manager Tactics

We are extremely concerned about pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) tactics 
that have significant negative effects on patients, communities, 
taxpayers, employers, and pharmacies. PBMs are hired by insurance plans 
and others to negotiate lower drug prices. Unfortunately, they 
manipulate the system and keep billions in profits while:

     Forcing patients and others to pay more for their medicines;
     Limiting patients' ability to choose their pharmacist;
     Restricting access to medicines that doctors and other 
prescribers determine to be right for the patient; and
     Jeopardizing pharmacies' viability--which obviously harms the 
pharmacy and also the patients and communities that rely on them.

The dominance of PBMs is significant. Three PBMs control 80 percent of 
the prescription drug market. These are the practical effects of PBM 
tactics:

     Over-payments: The University of Southern California Leonard D. 
Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics found that Medicare Part 
D standalone plans paid $2.6 billion more in one year for 184 common 
generic medications compared with prices for the same drugs available 
to cash-paying customers of one retailer.

     Restricting medications: Drug Channels analysis found that from 
2014 to 2022, 1,357 medications were excluded from at least one PBM 
formulary for at least one year. The exclusions of drugs from these 
lists have escalated since starting in 2012.

     Putting the squeeze on pharmacies: The Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services found that direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) 
fees charged by PBMs and payers to pharmacies have exploded by 107,400% 
over the last decade.

We want to take this opportunity to define ``PBM reform.'' This is 
important to maximize the effectiveness of Congress' work in this area 
for patients, and to roll-back the current jeopardy posed by PBMs to 
pharmacies. For this purpose, we call to your attention the Principles 
of PBM Reform advocated by the National Association of Chain Drug 
Stores:

     Stop below-cost reimbursement. Adopt a reimbursement rate floor 
that prevents PBMs and payers from reimbursing pharmacies below the 
true cost of acquiring and dispensing prescription drugs.

     Stop gaming of performance measures. Standardize performance 
measures to help improve patient outcomes and reduce costs--rather than 
allowing PBMs and payers to play ``gotcha'' with pharmacies using 
arbitrary measures and exorbitant fees.

     Stop ``specialty definitions'' from steering patients from their 
pharmacy. Prevent PBMs and payers from defining ``specialty drugs'' in 
ways that steer patients with rare or complex diseases away from their 
preferred pharmacy of their choice and toward another pharmacy--
including those owned by the PBMs and payers.

     Stop mandatory mail-order. Prohibit PBMs and payers from forcing 
patients to use mail-order pharmacies--including those owned by the 
PBMs and payers--and prohibit them from imposing penalties on patients 
for choosing a convenient and trusted pharmacy in their neighborhood.

     Stop limited networks. Require PBMs and payers to include in 
their networks all pharmacies willing to accept terms and conditions 
established by the PBM.

     Stop overwhelming audits. Bring efficiency, transparency, and 
standardization to the processes by which PBMs audit pharmacies without 
sacrificing continuity of care.

     Stop the undercutting of PBM reform laws. Prioritize the 
implementation, enforcement, and oversight of PBM reform laws--to 
maximize results for patients and fairness for pharmacies and other 
stakeholders, and to ensure laws are not undermined by inaction of PBMs 
or of government.

Conclusion

In closing, we want to put to rest one of the myths perpetuated by 
PBMs. It is shocking that they have been able to stave off reform 
efforts by alleging that premiums will increase. This is nothing short 
of a scare tactic, and one that cannot be allowed to be used so 
flippantly and without substantiation. PBM reform will reduce 
prescription drug costs by cracking down on middlemen's manipulation. 
It does not follow logically that reductions in prescription drug costs 
will result in increased premiums. It is time to address the 
manipulative business practices of PBMs, as well as to end the negative 
effects of their tactics.

Introduction

Hy-Vee, Inc. appreciates the opportunity to submit a statement for the 
record for the United States Senate Committee on Finance on ``Pharmacy 
Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply Chain: Impact on 
Patients and Taxpayers.''

Hy-Vee is an employee-owned company operating more than 280 retail 
pharmacy locations across eight Midwestern states--Illinois, Iowa, 
Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin--with 
sales of more than $12.5 billion annually. We have more than 80,000 
employees in our region serving millions of customers and patients each 
week. We also care for patients through our national specialty 
pharmacy, Amber Specialty Pharmacy, which serves vulnerable patients 
across the nation who often are facing severe illnesses that can only 
be treated by rare and speciality drugs.

PBM Concerns

We are extremely concerned about pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) 
strategies that have significant negative effects on patients, 
communities, taxpayers, employers, and pharmacies. PBMs are hired by 
insurance plans and others to negotiate lower drug prices. 
Unfortunately, they manipulate the system in a way that potentially 
keeps billions in profits while also:

     Forcing patients and others to pay more for their medicines;
     Limiting patients' ability to choose their pharmacist;
     Restricting access to medicines that doctors and other 
prescribers determine to be right for the patient; and
     Jeopardizing pharmacies' viability--which harms the pharmacy, 
and the patients and communities who rely on them.

The astronomical increase of DIR fees, in particular, continues to have 
a devastating impact on our patients as well as our company. Our 
communities rely on us as often the closest provider of health care 
services; however, the economic impact of the current PBM landscape is 
becoming unmanageable. Hy-Vee has incurred a 309.44 percent increase in 
DIR fees over the past four years, and continual increases are 
unsustainable.

Hy-Vee stores serve a number of smaller, rural communities and see 
other businesses in these areas struggle under the unsupportable weight 
of increasing DIR fees. These fees are placing the ecosystem that 
boasts unparalleled access to care--where 90% of Americans are within 5 
miles of a pharmacy--in jeopardy. According to the RUPRI Center for 
Rural Health Policy analysis report (Update on Rural Independently 
Owned Pharmacy Closures in the United States, 2003-2021), the total 
number of retail pharmacies in micropolitan and noncore areas declined 
by 836 between 2003 and 2021, and the number of independently owned 
retail pharmacies in micropolitan and noncore areas decreased by 9.1% 
and 16.1%, respectively.

The recent Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rulemaking 
(Medicare Program; Contract Year 2023 Policy and Technical Changes to 
the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs; 
CMS-4192-P) fell short of expectations and will further disadvantage 
those pharmacists who serve the customers directly.

Critical elements were neglected in the final rulemaking, and we ask 
Congress to address these key principles of PBM reform to maximize the 
effectiveness of any proposed legislation and help keep our current 
pharmacy network strong and stable for all Americans:

     Stop below-cost reimbursement. Adopt a reimbursement rate floor 
that prevents PBMs and payers from reimbursing pharmacies below the 
true cost of acquiring and dispensing prescription drugs.

     Stop gaming of performance measures. Standardize performance 
measures to help improve patient outcomes and reduce costs--rather than 
allowing PBMs and payers to play ``gotcha'' with pharmacies using 
arbitrary measures and exorbitant fees.

     Stop ``specialty definitions'' from steering patients from their 
pharmacy. Prevent PBMs and payers from defining ``specialty drugs'' in 
ways that steer patients with rare or complex diseases away from their 
preferred pharmacy of their choice and toward another pharmacy--
including those owned by the PBMs and payers.

     Stop mandatory mail-order. Prohibit PBMs and payers from forcing 
patients to use mail-order pharmacies--including those owned by the 
PBMs and payers--and prohibit them from imposing penalties on patients 
for choosing a convenient and trusted pharmacy in their neighborhood.

     Stop limited networks. Require PBMs and payers to include in 
their networks all pharmacies willing to accept terms and conditions 
established by the PBM.

     Stop overwhelming audits. Bring efficiency, transparency, and 
standardization to the processes by which PBMs audit pharmacies without 
sacrificing continuity of care.

     Stop the undercutting of PBM reform laws. Prioritize the 
implementation, enforcement, and oversight of PBM reform laws--to 
maximize results for patients and fairness for pharmacies and other 
stakeholders, and to ensure laws are not undermined by inaction of PBMs 
or of government.

Conclusion

Our Hy-Vee pharmacies continue to be a trusted, convenient, and 
equitable access point for health and wellness in urban and rural 
communities. We remain a critical access point for prescription drugs, 
chronic care management, wellness and prevention services, testing, 
vaccines, and health and wellness education. PBM reform is crucial to 
preserving pharmacies' role in their communities and to retain this 
vital health care access for all patients. Without action in the near 
future, our pharmacies will suffer.

In closing, we want to put to rest one of the myths perpetuated by 
PBMs. It is unfortunate that reform efforts have been thwarted by 
alleging that premiums will increase. PBM reform will reduce 
prescription drug costs by addressing the middlemen's tactics. It does 
not follow logically that reductions in prescription drug costs will 
result in increased premiums. It is time to address the business 
practices of PBMs, as well as to end the negative effects of these 
tactics.

Hy-Vee, Inc. thanks the Committee for the opportunity to provide our 
perspective on PBM reform. For questions or further discussion, please

                  Letter Submitted by Edward Kitlowski
U.S. Senate
Committee on Finance

Re: Poor Health Care for Federal Employee

I am writing on behalf of my wife Mary Kitlowski, a Federal employee 
with the Patent and Trademark Office. Mary is a GS12 at the PTO and has 
won two Bronze medals for exemplary work. All her ratings have been 
classified as exceptional. She works from home. The complaint is with 
the Federal Carefirst, Blue Choice Insurance plan which has denied 
covering two prescriptions Mary had when covered by Blue Cross/Blue 
Shield Federal insurance. Mary's health is deteriorating and will 
probably entail hospitalization in the coming week.

I am writing as she is exhausted from the scenario I will describe. As 
background, she was born with a genetic condition called Primary 
Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Persons with this condition have flaccid 
cilia, meaning the mechanisms in our body which protect and expel 
irritants from the nasal and pulmonary systems do not work. This causes 
infections in the sinuses and lungs which build up. The infections 
cause damage to the lungs called bronchiectasis. My wife has a daily 
routine that is very similar to a person with Cystic Fibrosis. PCD is 
considered a rare disease, which complicates treatment. It is also a 
progressive disease. More information on the disorder can be found at 
Living with PCD--PCD Foundation Website.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://pcdfoundation.org/living-with-pcd/.

As previously stated, it is a progressive disease. She now has only 30% 
lung capacity. She requires supplemental oxygen when walking and even 
sleeping. She is under the supervision of Dr. O'Donnell of Georgetown 
Medical and Dr. Shah of Johns Hopkins Transplant Center. On several 
occasions, she has had prescriptions denied by insurance companies, and 
fought to receive the treatment ordered by her doctor. Dr. O'Donnell 
monitors Mary's medical care which involves prescriptions, and medical 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
devices.

When the annual health insurance renewal for Federal employees opened, 
she re-evaluated her plan which was the Federal Blue Cross/Blue Shield. 
She enrolled in the Federal Carefirst Blue Choice plan believing it 
provided the same level of care but with different levels of 
deductions. What she did not expect was the new plan denied the 
prescriptions she had been taking for many years. Her health has been 
deteriorating because of the policies of the insurance company.

One of the medications is Theo 24. She had been taking one tablet of 
200mg a day. Carefirst denied covering the prescription. She was 
informed by phone of the denial without the name and title of the 
medical person who made the denial. Mary was told Theo 24 was not part 
of their medical formulary. Dr. O'Donnell is a recognized expert on PCD 
and Theo 24 has specific properties that are ideal for patients with 
PCD. Mary has been paying out of pocket to continue taking the 
medication. Carefirst has been unresponsive in responding to Mary's 
appeal and contacting both Dr. O'Donnell and Mary to cover this 
necessary medication. They have made statements unsubstantiated by Dr. 
O'Donnell's office and do not return calls by Mary. Meanwhile, time 
passes, and she is not covered for the necessary medication.

A second prescription that was denied is Budesonide, an inhaled 
steroid. Mary has been taking this for over five years. It reduces 
bronchospasms and allows for easier expiration of mucus from the lungs, 
alleviating breathing and reducing the scarring of lung tissue, 
(bronchiectasis). Again, Carefirst not has been responsive to phone 
calls and emails. Mary's health has been compromised by Carefirst's 
inaction.

Mary uses an Airway Clearance System, an inflatable vest attached to a 
machine which provides oscillation to loosen the mucus and pus in her 
lungs to facilitate expiration. There is a new device called the Volara 
System which has preliminary results and anecdotal reports of increased 
lung capacity from its use. It is currently classified as experimental 
by the FDA, which allows insurance companies the ability to deny 
coverage. Mary was denied the device by an RN. I have included 
information on the system and review of the efficacy by members of the 
American College of Chest Physicians.

This scenario raises numerous issues in the health insurance business, 
as it is a for-profit enterprise, and specifically of a policy for 
Federal employees. Insurance companies should be required to maintain 
current prescriptions for transferred patients for a period of possibly 
two months. When Mary reviewed the two plans, there was little to no 
transparency on the prescriptions covered. Mary would not have changed 
plans if she knew Carefirst would deny two of her prescriptions. Mary 
is possibly going to have to be hospitalized, a cost much higher than 
the price of the prescriptions. Insurance companies should not have the 
preponderance of judgement in patient care.

Mary is a Federal employee having problems with a health insurance plan 
for Federal employees. I believe Mary's suggestion of legislation 
requiring insurance companies to continue prescriptions for at least 2 
months and not be allowed to deny on-going medical coverage is 
brilliant.

Senators, I am watching my wife's health deteriorate. The frustrations 
with dealing with Carefirst are contributing to the decline along with 
the lack of medical care. I suggest Mary is not the only person 
experiencing the same issue. I am a retired Baltimore County teacher, 
experiencing my own trials and tribulations with health care plans. As 
a country, we can do better. I know you believe the same.

Respectfully,

Edward Kitlowski

                                 ______
                                 
I have included descriptions of the disease and medications from The 
Cleveland Clinic, NIH, and the PCD Foundation.

Bronchiectasis is a condition where damage causes the tubes in your 
lungs (airways) to widen or develop pouches. It makes it hard to clear 
mucus out of your lungs and can cause frequent infections. Coughing a 
lot with pus and mucus is the main symptom of bronchiectasis. 
Bronchiectasis can't be cured but can be managed with treatment.

Theophylline is used to treat lung diseases \2\ such as asthma \3\ and 
COPD \4\ (bronchitis,\5\ emphysema \6\). It must be used regularly to 
prevent wheezing \7\ and shortness of breath. This medication \8\ 
belongs to a class of drugs known as xanthines. It works by relaxing 
the muscles around the airways so that they open up and you can breathe 
more easily. It also decreases the lungs' response to irritants.

One drug Carefirst said is covered is Salmeterol (Serevent)

Long-acting beta agonists (LABAs)

These bronchodilator medications open airways and reduce swelling for 
at least 12 hours. They're used on a regular schedule to control 
moderate to severe asthma and to prevent nighttime symptoms. Although 
they're effective, they've been linked to severe asthma attacks. For 
this reason, LABAs are taken only in combination with an inhaled 
corticosteroid.

Volara System

Purpose: The Volara System is a novel device that is intended for the 
mobilization of secretions, lung expansion therapy, and the treatment 
and prevention of pulmonary atelectasis. Oscillation and lung expansion 
(OLE) therapy can be used in the acute care as well as the home 
setting, in patients with cystic fibrosis [CF], chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease [COPD], Bronchiectasis, neuromuscular disease [NMD], 
and other conditions requiring airway clearance therapy. In this study, 
we aimed to evaluate the trends in clinical outcomes in patients 
started on OLE, as documented in the OLE patient reported outcomes data 
repository.

Conclusions: Patients receiving at home OLE therapy showed improved 
self-reported clinical outcomes in various disease states, as evidenced 
by the reduction in hospitalizations and antibiotic use, and subjective 
improvement in ease of breathing in the first 6 months of therapy. This 
was accompanied by high levels of patient satisfaction and adherence to 
therapy. Longer term studies with established correlation with EMR data 
as well as clinical studies are needed to support these findings.

           Statement of Steven C. Anderson, FASAE, CAE, IOM, 
                 President and Chief Executive Officer

Introduction

The National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) appreciates the 
opportunity to submit a statement for the record for the Senate 
Committee on Finance's hearing, ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) and 
the Prescription Drug Supply Chain: Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.'' 
NACDS appreciates the Committee's work to explore PBMs' lack of 
transparency and standardized performance measures, inflationary 
effects on drug prices, restrictions on patient access, and unfair 
pharmacy reimbursement practices that threaten pharmacies and the 
patients who rely on them for access. The prescription drug supply 
chain is largely controlled and manipulated by the three largest PBM-
insurers, with significant consequences for patients and taxpayers.

Retail pharmacies are critical healthcare access destinations for 
patients and population health. The nation called on pharmacies to 
deliver COVID-19 testing, vaccinations, and other critical care 
services to communities during the pandemic. Pharmacies seamlessly rose 
to the challenge, in large part due to more than a decade of pandemic 
preparedness and collaborative planning. Consider, the nation's 
pharmacies administered over 300 million COVID vaccines, performed more 
than 42 million tests, dispensed nearly 7 million antiviral courses, 
and were the top provider of over-the-counter COVID tests in CMS' 
demonstration program. Using conservative estimates, pandemic 
interventions by pharmacists and pharmacy personnel averted more than 1 
million deaths, more than 8 million hospitalizations, and $450 billion 
in healthcare costs.

A poll of adults conducted March 4-6, 2022, by Morning Consult and 
commissioned by NACDS found that retail pharmacies received the highest 
ratings for ease of access among the destinations tested. Of note, 79 
percent of those surveyed also support pharmacists helping patients 
prevent chronic diseases. America's pharmacies have been dealing with 
these legacy issues for over a decade and it has been exacerbated by 
the absence of oversight and understanding of the offensive and 
competition-eroding practices of PBMs that impact timely patient 
access, pharmacy sustainability, and pharmacy's innovative vision to 
empower patients' total health and wellness.

NACDS applauds Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo for keeping this 
issue top of mind on a bipartisan basis and for their continued 
commitment to fight for meaningful reform. Comprehensive reform is 
needed to instill increased transparency and accountability for PBM's, 
to help ensure the economic viability of pharmacies, and to foster 
increased access to care and improved health outcomes for the patients 
they serve.

The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Marketplace and Impact on Pharmacies

Prescriptions filled by patients who are paying cash without any form 
of insurance or discount card account for only about 3% of the total 
volume of prescriptions.\1\ While approximately 91% of prescriptions 
filled have a payment component coming from Medicare Part D, Medicaid, 
or a commercial insurance plan, these plans are ordinarily administered 
by PBMs. The top three PBMs manage about 80% of the volume.\2\ The top 
six PBMs and plans manage about 96% of the volume.\3\ Five of those six 
PBMs are owned by large national health insurers. This business 
environment makes it very difficult for pharmacies to negotiate fair 
business practices and transparency because the PBMs and health 
insurers have more commercial market power and leverage in the 
relationship due to their size and scale. This creates a one-way street 
with negative consequences for patients, pharmacies, employers, 
taxpayers, and communities--seemingly for all but the PBMs and payers.

Retail pharmacies are in crisis, facing unsustainable financial 
pressures as they are increasingly reimbursed by payers below the cost 
of buying and dispensing prescription drugs. Dire financial pressures 
have forced an alarming number of pharmacies to take drastic steps, 
such as possibly paring back hours and placing on hold innovative care 
services that otherwise could improve health outcomes. Payers have 
increasingly reduced reimbursements; in many cases, pharmacies dispense 
prescriptions below cost. Retroactive fees and claw backs often occur 
weeks or months after a transaction closes, when a payer decides to 
recoup a portion of the pharmacy's reimbursement. These fees have made 
the economic viability of community pharmacies increasingly difficult, 
due to the unpredictability of reimbursement and the increased damage 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
to bottom lines.

It is important to look at the pre-COVID pharmacy closures. According 
to IQVIA, between December 2017 and December 2020, almost 2,200 
pharmacies closed nationwide.\4\ Some of the PBMs' abuse of pharmacies 
were abated during the pandemic and the nation's reliance on pharmacies 
over the past three years further mitigated pharmacy closures. However, 
the ominous situation for pharmacies is worse than ever before.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ IQVIA Data, 2020. Closures disproportionately impacted rural 
areas.

The epidemic of pharmacy closures is reducing access to vital 
healthcare services, especially in rural areas where options are 
already limited. Communities across the nation depend on neighborhood 
pharmacies among all healthcare destinations. A recent study published 
in the Journal of the American Medical Association also found that 
pharmacy closures led to a significant drop in medication adherence for 
older adults taking cardiovascular medications, which has obvious 
implications for patient health and healthcare costs. Preserving 
patient access to robust pharmacy provider services and networks like 
health screenings, disease state management, vaccinations (e.g., flu, 
COVID-19), patient counseling, medication adherence, and testing--all 
in addition to essential medication access can help improve health 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
outcomes and generate overall healthcare savings for Americans.

We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to stop the 
manipulation by PBM go-betweens that increases patients' medication 
costs, limits patients' choice of pharmacies, restricts access to 
medicines that are right for them, and jeopardizes the pharmacies and 
pharmacy teams on whom patients rely.

To that end, please see below NACDS' policy recommendations to increase 
transparency and ensure comprehensive reform of harmful PBM tactics and 
practices:

 I.  Help to Preserve Patient Access to Pharmacies by Addressing PBM's 
Retroactive Pharmacy Fees

    Retroactive DIR Fees/Claw Backs--Pharmacy access can be undermined 
when health plans and their middlemen, PBMs, arbitrarily ``claw back'' 
fees retroactively from pharmacies weeks or months after a claim has 
been adjudicated/processed. This manipulation of pharmacy 
reimbursements may diminish access to care (e.g., pharmacies being 
forced to close their doors or pare back hours and healthcare services) 
when PBMs are unpredictable, not transparent, and payment falls below a 
pharmacy's costs to acquire and dispense prescription drugs. 
Policymakers should consider enacting laws that prohibit payers or PBMs 
from retroactively reducing and/or denying a processed pharmacy drug 
claim payment and obligating them to offer predictable and transparent 
pharmacy reimbursement to better protect pharmacies as viable and 
reliable access points of care for patient services.

II.  Provide Fair and Adequate Payment for Pharmacy Patient Care 
Services

    Reasonable Reimbursement and Rate Floor--Pharmacy access remains at 
risk when PBMs reimburse pharmacies below the cost to acquire and 
dispense prescription drugs. Pharmacy reimbursement that falls below 
the costs to acquire and dispense prescription drugs threatens future 
sustainability for pharmacies to continue providing valuable medication 
and pharmacy care services to communities. Policymakers should enact 
laws to adopt a reimbursement rate floor that requires PBMs to use 
comprehensive reimbursement models that are no less than the true cost 
to purchase and dispense prescription drugs to help maintain robust 
public access to pharmacies.

    Standardized Performance Measures--A crucial part of comprehensive 
DIR fee reform is advancing pharmacy quality that improves outcomes for 
beneficiaries and drives value in care which are essential to 
controlling costs in the healthcare system. Arbitrary performance 
measures developed by PBMs assess the performance of the pharmacy 
without pharmacies' input and create a moving target for pharmacies to 
show value and improve health outcomes. Measures vary across the 
various plans and dictate DIR fees (or claw backs at the State level) 
imposed on pharmacies, as well as help create substantial system 
dysfunction and unnecessary spending in the Part D program. 
Policymakers should enact laws to standardize PBM's performance 
measures for pharmacies to help set achievable goals for pharmacies 
before signing a contract to promote harmonization in the healthcare 
system and improvements in health outcomes.

III.  Protect Patient Choice of Pharmacies

     Specialty--Some PBMs require patients with rare and/or complex 
diseases to obtain medications deemed ``specialty drugs'' from 
designated ``specialty pharmacies'' or mail-order pharmacies which 
impedes patient access to their convenient local neighborhood 
pharmacies where specialty drugs are filled as well. Prescription drugs 
should not be classified as ``specialty drugs'' based solely on the 
cost of the drug or other criteria used to limit patient access and 
choice--instead, should focus on clinical aspects such as requiring 
intensive clinical monitoring. Policymakers should enact laws to 
establish appropriate standards for defining and categorizing specialty 
drugs to ensure comprehensive and pragmatic patient care and access and 
prohibit PBMs from steering patients to only specialty pharmacies, 
including those owned by the PBMs, for their prescription needs.

     Mail Order--Medication access and care can be weakened when PBMs 
manipulate the system by requiring patients to use mail-order 
pharmacies only. Some plans impose penalties such as higher copays or 
other financial disincentives for choosing a retail pharmacy instead of 
a mail-order pharmacy which is often owned by the PBM. Policymakers 
should support patient choice and access by enacting laws to prohibit 
PBMs from requiring or steering patients to use mail-order pharmacies.

     Any Willing Pharmacy--Due to PBMs' network and contract barriers, 
pharmacies willing and ready to serve patients may be ineligible to 
provide important pharmacy services and patients may experience 
unnecessary delays and interruptions in patient care. Patients should 
have the choice and flexibility to utilize the pharmacy that best meets 
their healthcare needs. Policymakers should enact laws that require 
PBMs and plans to include any pharmacies in their networks if the 
pharmacy is willing to accept the terms and conditions established by 
the PBM to help maximize patient outcomes, and cost savings and ensure 
patient access to any willing pharmacy of their choice.

IV.  Enforce Laws to Stop PBM Manipulation and Protect Pharmacies and 
Patients

    Audits--PBMs routinely conduct audits to monitor a pharmacy's 
performance and reverse or claw back pharmacy payments when there are 
alleged issues with a particular pharmacy claim. PBM audits interrupt 
the pharmacy workflow, can extend wait times, and detract attention 
from the quality-of-care patients receive. Policymakers should enact 
laws that support fair pharmacy audit practices to ensure timely 
patient care delivery at community pharmacies and bring efficiency, 
transparency, and standardization to the PBM audit process.

    Oversight Authority--There are growing concerns that pro-pharmacy 
and pro-patient legislative successes might be undercut if PBMs fail to 
comply with such laws and/or states fail to fully enforce these laws. 
Such failure could significantly impact pharmacy reimbursement and 
overall patient access. Policymakers should establish and enforce laws 
already on the books to regulate harmful PBM reimbursement practices 
that may harm patients and the healthcare system as we know it, 
especially at the pharmacy counter, and empower state regulators to do 
the same to enforce PBM transparency and fair and adequate pharmacy 
reimbursements.

Conclusion

NACDS thanks the Committee for the opportunity to provide our 
perspective on PBM reform \5\ and our support for your dedicated work. 
We implore you to act on these principles \6\ and ensure proper 
safeguards are established to protect pharmacies and Americans from 
PBMs and to promote transparency, accountability and fairness in the 
prescription drug supply chain. For questions or further discussion,

Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo and Members of the Committee:

I write today on behalf of the National Association of Specialty 
Pharmacy (NASP) to express support for the Senate Committee on 
Finance's efforts to address unfair and anticompetitive practices that 
narrow the pharmacy marketplace and negatively impact patients. Thank 
you for holding today's hearing and for all of your efforts to work 
with specialty pharmacy.

NASP represents the entire spectrum of specialty pharmacy industry 
stakeholders, including the nation's leading specialty pharmacies and 
practicing pharmacists; nurses; technicians; pharmacy students; non-
clinical healthcare professionals and executives; pharmacy benefit 
managers (PBMs); pharmaceutical manufacturers; group purchasing 
organizations; wholesalers and distributors; integrated delivery 
systems and health plans; patient advocacy organizations; independent 
accreditation organizations; and technology, logistics and data 
management companies. With more than 170 corporate members and 3,000 
individual members, NASP is the unified voice of specialty pharmacy in 
the United States.

What is Specialty Pharmacy

Specialty pharmacies support patients who have complex health 
conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, hemophilia, 
cancer, organ transplantation and rare diseases. Specialty pharmacies 
operate as independent pharmacies, academic medical center and 
hospital-health system based pharmacies, regional and national chain 
pharmacies, grocery store owned specialty pharmacies, health plan-owned 
specialty pharmacies and home infusion pharmacies. The medications a 
specialty pharmacy dispenses are typically expensive. Historically, 
there are limited generic or biosimilar alternatives to brand specialty 
drugs. Specialty prescription medications are not routinely dispensed 
at a typical retail pharmacy because the medications are focused on a 
limited number of patients and require significant patient education 
and monitoring on utilization and adherence. Typical retail pharmacies 
are not designed to provide the intense and time-consuming patient care 
services that specialty medications require. Though many specialty 
medications are taken orally, still many need to be injected or 
infused. The services a specialty pharmacy provides include patient 
training in how to administer the medications, comprehensive treatment 
assessment, ongoing patient monitoring, side effect management and 
mitigation, and frequent communication and care coordination with 
caregivers, physicians and other healthcare providers. A specialty 
pharmacy's expert services drive patient adherence, proper management 
of medication dosing and side effects, and ensure costly and complex 
drug therapies and treatment regimens are used correctly and not 
wasted.

Anticompetitive Practices and Impact on Specialty Pharmacy

While the number of specialty medications only comprises 2.2 percent of 
the total number of prescriptions dispensed in the United States, these 
medications represent approximately 50 percent of overall drug spend in 
the U.S., which by the end of 2021, was estimated to be about $600 
billion. Distribution for most specialty medications is limited, with 
payers working to keep them even smaller. The market is heavily 
dominated by the largest PBMs and the health insurers that own those 
PBMs.

Over the years, anticompetitive market practices, including the 
escalation in pharmacy DIR claw back fees have led to a significant 
narrowing of pharmacy networks. Efforts by Congress are needed to 
address comprehensive pharmacy DIR reform and ensure patient access to 
specialty pharmacies.
Pharmacy DIR Fees and Implications for Patient Access to Specialty 
        Pharmacies
For many years, Medicare Part D Plans and their Pharmacy Benefit 
Managers (PBMs) have opted for higher negotiated prices to pharmacies, 
and in some cases, even preferred a higher net cost drug over a cheaper 
alternative because they plan to collect retroactive fees from 
pharmacies and rebates from manufacturers. Receipt of such fees and 
rebates contributes primarily to plan profits and does nothing to lower 
drug costs or drug cost sharing requirements for beneficiaries.

Retroactive fees on pharmacies include ``Direct and Indirect 
Remuneration'' fees--commonly known as ``DIR Fees.'' Pharmacy DIR fees 
are collected through retroactive claw back charges on specialty 
pharmacy providers and other pharmacies months and sometimes a year 
after the pharmacy has dispensed the drug and after a beneficiary has 
already purchased the drug at a higher price. The Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a Medicare Part D rule in 2022, 
showing that pharmacy DIR fees grew from $8.9 million collected in 2010 
to $9.5 billion in 2020.\1\ Fees on pharmacies grew more than 107,400 
percent,\2\ with much of that growth occurring after Part D sponsors 
stood up so-called DIR ``performance-based metrics'' for pharmacy 
payment arrangements. CMS data shows that pharmacies are hardly ever 
paid for meeting performance metrics and are instead financially 
penalized in relation to performance measures. For specialty 
pharmacies, nearly all of the metrics utilized by Plans/PBMs are 
irrelevant to the drugs specialty pharmacies dispense or services they 
provide.

Costs. February 11, 2020. https://www.xilang

    \2\ 87 FR 1910.

In the 2022 Medicare Part D rule, CMS took some initial steps in 
addressing pharmacy DIR fees by eliminating the regulatory loophole 
(exception) that has permitted the significant growth of pharmacy DIR 
fees. Beginning in January 2024, CMS will require that all pharmacy 
price concessions--as newly defined for the first time--be counted at 
the point-of-sale, when a beneficiary receives their prescription. The 
specific purpose of this change is to ensure that patient out-of-pocket 
costs are assessed with all concessions applied, giving the beneficiary 
the lowest possible price, and therefore, the lowest possible co-pay. 
However, the 2022 Part D rule did not eliminate the practice of 
pharmacy DIR claw back fees, allowing Plans to continue to impose claw 
backs and the rule did not establish any standards or protections to 
ensure that the negotiated price inclusive of all price concessions 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
paid to pharmacies is reasonable to cover a pharmacy's costs.

NASP supports CMS' effort to reduce prescription drug prices for 
Medicare Part D beneficiaries by removing the reasonably determined 
regulatory exception and adopting a revised definition of ``negotiated 
price'' for a covered Part D drug that includes all pharmacy price 
concessions, requiring them to be applied at the point of sale. It is 
our hope that doing this will better align marketplace competition with 
the interests of Medicare beneficiaries and lead to lower out-ofpocket 
costs. However, NASP is concerned that the final rule did not address 
comprehensive DIR reform, which is necessary to meet patient needs. To 
prevent anticompetitive DIR practices, we request further action by 
Congress.

Impact of the Part D Rule on Beneficiary Access to Pharmacies

Over the years, pharmacy DIR claw back fees have significantly harmed 
specialty pharmacies forcing many to decline participation in Medicare 
Part D networks, resulting in limiting beneficiary access and pharmacy 
choice; restructuring their operations, laying off staff and cutting 
back on higher-cost inventory; and ending the stocking and dispensing 
of certain drugs to treat certain conditions. Other specialty 
pharmacies have been forced to sell their pharmacies or be acquired due 
to the harm caused by excessive pharmacy DIR claw back fees.

While the Calendar Year Part D rule is viewed as a first step toward 
needed pharmacy DIR reform, we want the Committee and CMS to understand 
the problems that are negatively impacting pharmacy network 
participation and patient access persist. Specialty pharmacies have 
faced significant 2023 upfront reimbursement reductions and continue to 
see terms in their contracts that say their pharmacies will continue to 
be subject to retroactive DIR claw backs.

Congress can help address these significant concerns by taking action 
to pass legislation that would allow for comprehensive pharmacy DIR 
reform. NASP recommends that the Senate Finance Committee work to 
advance legislation that will:

     Encourage CMS to ensure pharmacy reimbursement does not violate 
the any willing provider statute and is reasonable to ensure network 
participation by pharmacies;

     Require the standardization and oversight of Part D pharmacy 
performance measures; and

     Ensure pharmacies are provided pricing transparency.

Any Willing Provider Statute--Reasonable Pharmacy Reimbursement to 
                    Support Pharmacy Network Participation

NASP is very concerned that the Calendar Year 2023 Medicare Part D rule 
continues to permit post-sale pharmacy price concessions. That 
allowance in addition to the continued significant reductions to the 
``negotiated price'' pharmacies receive, could continue to escalate 
pharmacy acquisitions and closures. CMS provides no regulatory 
protections for ensuring that pharmacies will not be reimbursed at such 
a low level that they are unable to remain in a network, and therefore, 
accessible to patients.

In other Medicare Part D rules issued over the years, CMS has 
recognized that any willing provider statutory requirements permit the 
agency to regulate reasonable reimbursement provisions.\3\ NASP has 
commented to CMS that the agency exercise its authority in enforcing 
this part of the statute to protect pharmacy payments going forward. 
CMS acknowledged these comments, stating in the final Calendar Year 
2023 Part D rule that the agency would consider future rulemaking to 
address stakeholder concerns over CMS establishing safeguards to 
guarantee that pharmacies participating in Medicare Part D receive a 
reasonable rate of reimbursement.\4\ Considering that the final rule 
did not address the impact that retroactive DIR fees have had on 
pharmacy viability and beneficiary access to pharmacies, we are pleased 
that CMS acknowledged the need for this long-overdue rulemaking, and we 
urge the Senate Finance Committee to request that the agency begin the 
rulemaking process immediately through legislative action or direct 
request.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pharmacy Performance Evaluations and Metrics

The final Calendar Year 2023 Part D rule continues to permit contract 
agreements between pharmacies and plans that allow for performance-
based evaluations to determine price concessions and/or incentive 
payments. Also, the final rule provided no incentives for plans/PBMs to 
offer incentive-based opportunities to pharmacies and the rule did not 
establish any process for standardizing pharmacy performance metrics or 
any parameters to ensure pharmacy performance evaluations are 
appropriate, fair, and relevant based on the drugs a pharmacy dispenses 
and the services a pharmacy provides. In the absence of these important 
issues being addressed by CMS, pharmacy cannot expect or rely on 
incentive payment opportunities to address reimbursement concerns and 
there is serious concern that metrics will continue to be abused in an 
effort to claw back fees from pharmacies.

NASP continues to advocate for the standardization of pharmacy 
performance-based metrics. We also want to ensure that there are CMS 
requirements for fair pharmacy performance evaluation, and regulatory 
incentives for plans to offer pharmacy performance-based agreements to 
pharmacies. We believe it is important that CMS immediately work with 
pharmacy stakeholders to conduct a review to ensure pharmacy 
performance evaluations are fair and are associated with Part D plans' 
Star Ratings, thus aligning incentives for Part D plans and pharmacies 
toward better quality, equity, and reductions in preventable spending 
for beneficiaries.

Specifically related to action we believe CMS can and must take 
immediately, in the 2023 Part D final rule, CMS stated the following:

        We addressed reporting of pharmacy performance measures to CMS 
        in the January 2021 final rule (86 FR 5864). In the January 
        2021 final rule, we finalized a proposal to give CMS the 
        authority to establish a Part D reporting requirement for Part 
        D sponsors to disclose to CMS the pharmacy performance measures 
        they use to evaluate pharmacy performance, as established in 
        their network pharmacy agreements. This authority to establish 
        a reporting requirement is effective January 2022; however, the 
        actual data elements must be proposed through the Office of 
        Management and Budget (OMB) Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
        process in a future package.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ 87 Fed Reg. at 27704 (May 2022)

CMS' delay in exercising its authority to establish a Part D reporting 
requirement for Part D sponsors to disclose the pharmacy performance 
measures they use is especially disconcerting, given the concerns 
expressed by the pharmacy community and CMS' reporting that such 
measures have directly resulted in the substantial growth of pharmacy 
DIR fees. We implore the Committee to address this delay and urge CMS 
action to conduct this oversight. We also urge the Committee to request 
that CMS work in collaboration with the Federal Trade Commission on 
this review, as the FTC considers anticompetitive market practices 
impacting pharmacies that are not affiliated with plans or PBMs.

Part D Bidding Process

Under the current Medicare Part D bidding process, Plans are encouraged 
to underestimate their DIR fees, which they submit to determine the 
total bid amount, the direct subsidy payment the Plan will receive from 
Medicare, and the premiums that beneficiaries pay. If a Plan 
underestimates their pharmacy DIR fees, they can keep subsidy 
overpayments up to five percent, this process has encouraged Plans to 
underestimate their DIR fees to make a profit.\6\ Current regulations 
concerning the bid and reconciliation processes do not meaningfully 
protect unaffiliated specialty pharmacies (those not owned by Plans/
PBMs) from post-sale price concessions or unreasonably low 
reimbursement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Neither the Bid Pricing Instructions nor Part D bid regulations 
strictly prohibit Plans from under-projecting expected DIR fees.

The overbidding (and underestimation of DIR fees) directly harms 
beneficiaries by inflating the premiums they pay. This is because CMS 
calculates premiums based on the Plan's bid amount. CMS uses approved 
Plan bids to calculate a national average monthly bid which determines 
CMS's subsidy payments to Plans and a national base beneficiary 
premium.\7\ The base premium is then used to determine the actual 
beneficiary premium for each Plan.\8\ For example, if a Plan's bid 
exceeds the national average bid, its beneficiaries are responsible for 
the excess through a higher monthly premium which the beneficiary must 
pay. The bid-reconciliation profit incentive harms: beneficiaries 
through inflated premiums, pharmacies through unreasonable post-sale 
price concessions that are used to generate overpayments, and taxpayers 
through retained Medicare overpayments through reconciliation.

As the pharmacy negotiated price/DIR provisions of the Calendar Year 
2023 Part D rule go into effect in 2024, NASP urges the Committee to 
require CMS to closely review plan bid estimations and the reporting of 
pharmacy DIR and other fees placed on pharmacies. CMS must 
disincentivize plans from underestimating prospective DIR during their 
bid submissions and should be overseeing this process to understand to 
what extent plans are retaining overpayments obtained from DIR and 
administrative or other fees that are in excess of their DIR bid 
estimates. Ultimately eliminating this practice should be a priority 
focus of Congress and CMS.

Transparency Regarding Pharmacy Claims Processes

In the 2023 Part D Rule, CMS notes that one of the purposes of the 
regulations addressing pharmacy negotiated price and remuneration is to 
foster price transparency and consistency among pharmacies with respect 
to their reimbursement.\9\ The 2023 Part D rule is intended to require 
Plans to calculate the lowest possible reimbursement to lower the 
patient's out-of-pocket costs; however, the Rule does not explicitly 
state whether the lowest possible price will be disclosed to 
pharmacies. Such information is of critical importance if CMS' goal of 
ensuring transparency with respect to pharmacy reimbursement is to be 
recognized. This data will be critical to business planning for 
specialty pharmacies who today and going forward have no understanding 
how or to what extent their reimbursement will be altered after the 
point of sale.

NASP requests that the Committee work with CMS to address the lack of 
clarity in the final 2023 Part D rule regarding pharmacy claims 
processes and information transparency to pharmacies. To ensure full 
transparency for pharmacies at the point-of-sale, we request that CMS 
clarify that Part D plans must provide a mechanism for pharmacies to 
know the lowest possible reimbursement at the point-of-sale. Part D 
plans must ensure that the appropriate fields are included and 
populated in the claims response so that this information is provided 
to the pharmacy.

Conclusion

NASP is pleased that with the Chairman's support and the efforts by the 
Senate Finance Committee on a bipartisan basis, initial efforts have 
been made to address pharmacy DIR fees and needed Part D reforms to 
reduce beneficiary drug costs. We now want to work with the Committee 
and ultimately CMS to achieve needed comprehensive pharmacy DIR reform 
that will support the viability of pharmacies, network competition, and 
allow for beneficiary access to the pharmacy of their choice. We urge 
the Committee to take additional action this year to establish 
protections as detailed in this testimony to ensure pharmacies are no 
longer exploited by Plans or their partners, particularly as the 
Calendar Year 2023 Medicare Part D rule addressing negotiated price and 
pharmacy remuneration (DIR fees) goes into effect in January 2024.

NASP appreciates the opportunity to provide testimony for the record 
for today's hearing. If we can provide additional information as the 
Committee proceeds with its review of anticompetitive pharmacy market 
practices, please contact our organization.

Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the committee:

Thank you for conducting this hearing on pharmacy benefit manager 
practices and their impact on patients and taxpayers. In this 
statement, the National Community Pharmacists Association will offer 
support and suggestions on several policy considerations that would 
lower out-of-pocket costs for patients' prescription drugs, provide 
certainty for pharmacies, and protect taxpayers by bringing more 
transparency to prescription drug spending.

NCPA represents America's community pharmacists, including the owners 
of more than 19,400 independent community pharmacies. Almost half of 
all community pharmacies provide long-term care services and play a 
critical role in ensuring patients have immediate access to medications 
in both community and long-term care settings. Together, our members 
represent a $78.5 billion health care marketplace, employ 240,000 
individuals, and provide an expanding set of health care services to 
millions of patients every day. Our members are small business owners 
who are among America's most accessible health care providers.

Our pharmacies and the patients they serve have long had concerns about 
pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), their anticompetitive practices, and 
the role they play in ever-increasing drug costs. These concerns have 
been further exacerbated because of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on 
small businesses. Independently owned pharmacies have served as 
lifelines as essential businesses during the pandemic. However, PBM 
practices are causing these small businesses to struggle to remain 
viable and keep doors open to provide continued access and care.

NCPA and the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy and 
Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics have 
collaborated to develop a web tool that shows pharmacy shortage areas 
at the neighborhood level and generates information on pharmacy 
closures and populations affected. High-level findings include:

     Twenty-five percent of the U.S. population (81,203,948) lived in 
pharmacy shortage areas across urban, suburban, and rural areas in 
2020.
     Only one-third of pharmacy shortage areas calculated within the 
web tool carry the Health Resources and Services Administration 
designation of Medically Underserved Areas, or MUAs. This means that 
two-thirds of pharmacy shortage areas are unaccounted for when 
considering low access to health care in geographical areas under the 
MUA definition.
     Populations with the highest pharmacy shortage area population 
were Black (37.1 percent), Medicaid (33.2 percent), and low-income 
(36.7 percent).
     States with the highest percentage of census tracts calculated 
as pharmacy shortage areas are Alaska, Mississippi, Montana, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.
     Independent pharmacies were the most dynamic factor in terms of 
creating and closing pharmacy shortage areas.

Pharmacies have also faced significant closures in recent years:

     From 2012 to 2019, over 1,000 independent pharmacies closed, 
going from approximately 23,000 to less than 22,000.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ From historic NCPA Digest data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Both chain and independent pharmacies closing contribute to 
creating pharmacy shortage areas, but in most states, independent 
pharmacies closing contribute far more gaps than chains.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Data from 2018 to 2020, from University of Southern California 
School of Pharmacy and Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy 
and Economics.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Independent pharmacies are at greater risk of closure than 
chains in urban and non-urban areas. Additionally, pharmacies serving 
disproportionately low-
income and uninsured populations are at greater risk of closure.\3\

We appreciate the efforts of the chair and ranking member to discuss 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PBM practices and their effect on drug prices for patients.

PBMs are not transparent about the rebate process and their profit 
margins. Moreover, we often do not know how much the PBMs make on 
administrative service fees and spread pricing (the difference between 
how much they reimburse the pharmacy and the higher price they charge 
the plan for the same prescription). More accurate reporting is needed 
to provide this transparency. To get a complete picture of PBM 
financials, we also need greater clarity on:

     Complicated and opaque methods to determine pharmacy 
reimbursement.
     Methods to steer patients towards PBM-owned or affiliated 
pharmacies.
     Fees and clawbacks charged to pharmacies.
     Potentially unfair audits of independent pharmacies.
     The prevalence of prior authorizations and other administrative 
restrictions.
     The use of PBM-defined specialty drug lists and associated 
specialty drug policies.
     The effect of rebates and fees from drug manufacturers on 
formulary design and the costs of prescription drugs to payers and 
patients.

 Bring transparency to the Medicaid program and prevent the use of 
                    spread pricing by PBMs

H.R. 1613, the Drug Price Transparency in Medicaid Act, was introduced 
by Reps. Buddy Carter (R-GA), Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Rick Allen (R-
GA), Jake Auchincloss (D-MA), Elise Stefanik (R-NY), and Deborah Ross 
(D-NC). It would bring transparency to the Medicaid program by:

     Prohibiting spread pricing/requiring a full pass-through in all 
Medicaid managed care programs.
     Requiring that pharmacy reimbursements in all state Medicaid 
managed care programs be at a rate of pharmacy's average acquisition 
costs and the state's Medicaid fee-for-service dispensing fee.
     Limiting payments to PBMs to solely administrative fees.
     Mandating National Average Drug Acquisition Costs reporting to 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services by all pharmacies 
participating in state Medicaid programs. This provision would provide 
much needed transparency in drug pricing and allow reimbursements to 
reflect the true acquisition costs of prescription drugs in Medicaid.

 Bring transparency for employers and consumers and greater enforcement 
                    authorities

S. 127, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager Transparency Act of 2023, 
introduced by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), 
would increase drug pricing transparency for employers and plan 
sponsors and hold PBMs accountable for unfair and deceptive practices 
that drive up the costs of prescription drugs at the expense of 
consumers. The bill:

     Prohibits deceptive, unfair pricing schemes, including spread 
pricing and arbitrary clawbacks of payments made to pharmacies.
     Incentivizes transparent PBM practices by making clear that a 
PBM would not be in violation of the law if it:
          <ctr-circle>  Passes along 100 percent of rebates to the 
        health plan sponsor; AND
          <ctr-circle>  Provides the full disclosure of cost, price, 
        reimbursement and all charged fees, mark-ups, and discounts to 
        the plan sponsor and pharmacy; OR
          <ctr-circle>  Provides the aggregate remuneration fees it 
        receives from drug makers to health plans, payers, and any 
        federal agency.
     Mandates transparency by requiring that PBMs file an annual 
report with the Federal Trade Commission, including the total amount 
they pocket through spread pricing and pharmacy fees.
     Clarifies the enforcement authority of the FTC and state 
attorneys general to prohibit unfair or deceptive business practices 
PBM-insurers use in commercial health insurance.

On March 22, 2023, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation marked up the legislation in an executive session. An 
amendment by Senators Jon Tester (D-MT) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) 
was adopted that closes a loophole which could have allowed PBMs to 
continue to engage in the abusive practice of clawbacks and protects 
the CMS direct and indirect remuneration final rule regarding post-
adjudication clawbacks. S. 127, as amended, advanced out of the 
committee on a bipartisan 18-9 vote. NCPA hopes the full Senate will 
promptly take up this legislation to ensure PBM business practices that 
impact employers, patients, and pharmacies are fair and transparent.

 Ensure patient access to pharmacies and pharmacy market competition

Opaque and convoluted PBM and insurance plan pricing structures prevent 
pharmacies from being able to plan their business operations, as they 
are currently unable to understand what they will be reimbursed for a 
given drug or the services they provide for dispensing a given drug. 
Pharmacy performance/quality measures are being abused by plans/PBMs to 
secure fees from pharmacies rather than to fairly assess pharmacy 
performance.

Draft legislation in development by Reps. Morgan Griffith (R-VA), 
Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX), Buddy Carter (R-GA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-
DE), and others would improve patient access to pharmacies and pharmacy 
market competition. This bill requires:

     The secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to 
promulgate regulations to ensure Medicare Part D prescription drug 
plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA-PDs) 
reasonably reimburse pharmacies.
          <ctr-circle>  This regulatory effort would help to ensure 
        total reimbursement paid--net of all price concessions, fees, 
        incentive payments, and any other form of remuneration is 
        reasonable for a pharmacy to acquire and dispense drugs and 
        provide necessary pharmacy services.
     PDP sponsors and MA-PD plans, beginning on January 1, 2024, to 
only use standardized measures established by the secretary and 
relevant to the performance of a pharmacy based on the drugs a pharmacy 
dispenses.
     PDP sponsors and MA-PD plans to promptly furnish all pricing 
components to pharmacies, so that a pharmacy understands its final 
reimbursement and the purpose of any adjustments in reimbursement.

We are grateful CMS has finalized its rulemaking which applies all 
pharmacy price concessions at the point of sale after years of 
congressional efforts in support of DIR fee reform. However, while the 
final rule is a good start, additional statutory authority and clarity 
is needed that would allow CMS to address other issues, such as 
adequate pharmacy reimbursement. We hope Congress will work with us to 
ensure that more comprehensive pharmacy DIR fee reform can be 
implemented in 2024.

More on PBM practices

PBMs protect profits at the expense of competition and consumer 
welfare. Our additional comments below demonstrate the staggering scope 
of such practices. NCPA believes Congress and CMS could correct many of 
these harms by focusing immediate attention on adhesion contracts 
between PBMs and independent community pharmacies, patient steering to 
PBM-affiliated pharmacies, and discriminatory reimbursement.
 The effect of PBM rebates and fees on net drug prices to patients, 
        employers, and other payers
NCPA has sought reforms on rebates and fees for more than 10 years to 
address ballooning expenses for patients. NCPA is hopeful that CMS' 
attempt to bring transparency to pharmacy DIR fees through the recently 
issued final rule \5\ is a step in the right direction. With vertical 
integration both upstream and downstream, there is a need to level the 
playing field between independent pharmacies and PBM-
affiliated pharmacies to protect patients from paying too much at the 
counter. NCPA believes it is incumbent on Congress to engage with CMS 
to address PBM market power exacerbated by rebates and clawback fees. 
The vertical integration of PBMs into monoliths with an affiliated 
upstream insurance provider and downstream pharmacies has only 
increased the incentives for PBMs to disfavor independent pharmacies. 
The current CMS fee and rebate structure creates incentives for PBMs to 
disfavor competing independent pharmacies, resulting in pharmacy 
deserts and increased patient costs. The final CMS rulemaking, however, 
also illustrates that CMS is not equipped to address the issues without 
the assistance of Congress.

 Utilization management, other ``cost controls,'' and the effect on 
        patients and independent pharmacy
Due to contractual obligations with PBMs, NCPA members frequently must 
explain to their patients that due to ``utilization management'' (e.g., 
prior authorization and step therapy) and formulary exclusions, 
patients are unable to get access to their prescribed medication. While 
described as ``payer controls,'' used to ``control costs,'' PBMs, 
through their offshore group purchasing organizations (GPOs) Ascent 
Health Services (Cigna/Express Scripts), Zinc Health Services (Aetna/
CVS Caremark) and Emisar Pharma Services (United Healthcare/Optum), use 
these cost controls to direct utilization to the drug with the best 
manufacturer rebate, which is often not the best drug for the patient, 
while also using the GPOs to hide rebates from plan sponsors.\6\ PBMs 
also use these ``cost controls'' to control manufacturer access to the 
market, creating a ``pay-to-play'' game to get new drugs to the 
marketplace. In a recent analysis by IQVIA, two-thirds of patients who 
want to start a new prescribed drug were unable to do so because of 
these controls, with the largest PBMs blocking about 450 products.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ PBMs claim that they no longer retain rebates but that is 
because the rebates have shifted to their offshore GPOs.

On Monday, March 27, 2023, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a 
lawsuit against Cigna/Express Scripts, Prime Therapeutics, and Ascent. 
In the complaint, Yost accuses PBMs Express Scripts and Prime 
Therapeutics of colluding with Ascent, based in Switzerland, to 
illegally drive up drug prices which resulted in higher out-of-pocket 
costs for patients. Additionally, the state of Ohio argues, ``PBMs also 
use their market power to hurt competing pharmacies, and particularly 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
independent pharmacies.''

Ascent is one of the new contracting entities, or GPOs, that Cigna/
Express Scripts has added to their vertically integrated corporate 
structure, adding another layer of confusion and deception to drug 
pricing. The three largest PBMs (Caremark, Optum, and Express Scripts) 
have all created their own contracting entities or GPOs. Two of these 
entities are located in Ireland and Switzerland. Many believe these 
GPOs are corporate shells created for the purpose of hiding the actual 
amount of rebates PBMs receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers.
 PBM drug substitutions and their effect on patient costs
PBMs operating in the commercial, Medicare Part D, and Medicaid spaces 
alike contribute to artificially inflating drug costs using expensive 
name brand medications when less expensive generic alternatives are 
available. For example, PBMs continue to require the use of the more 
expensive brand asthma inhaler Symbicort over the generic budesonide; 
Symbicort costs over $150 per month more. One PBM mandated that a state 
Medicaid program use Lamictal, at over $16.50 a tablet, which is 
significantly more expensive than its generic counterpart that costs 
less than $0.10 a tablet. PBMs similarly give wasteful, preferential 
treatment to other brand medications like Advair, Concerta, Colcrys, 
Ventolin, Adderall XR, and Focalin XR. Common sense would dictate that 
where you have a choice between two equivalents, you take the less 
expensive one, unless there is a compelling reason not to.

In these cases, PBMs claim that they secure large rebates from the 
manufacturer to bring the net cost of the product down to below the 
cost of the generic. Even if this were true (which would require 
complete transparency and a 100 percent pass-through of all monies that 
flow from a pharmaceutical manufacturer to a PBM), it does not negate 
the consumer harm that exists to patients when they are in the 
deductible phase and paying more out of pocket for their medication 
costs. PBMs will also blame these formulary placements on plan 
sponsors, but plan sponsors like others in this industry are at the 
mercy of PBMs and their constant threats of rate hikes.

 PBMs' use of potentially unfair, deceptive, or anticompetitive 
        contract terms and all related practices when calculating 
        pharmacy reimbursements and disbursements
NCPA members have received Medicare Part D contract amendments that 
appear predatory. One PBM offered an anticompetitive contract amendment 
that would compensate independent pharmacies 10 percent below their 
wholesale acquisition cost, provide no dispensing fee,\8\ and assess a 
per-transaction performance pool fee. The intended effect of such an 
amendment and discriminatory pricing can only be to force independent 
pharmacies to opt out of the Medicare Part D networks or stay in them 
only to face financial ruin. The end result is the strengthening of 
PBM-
affiliated mail-order, specialty, and retail pharmacies at the expense 
of independent pharmacies.

It is important to understand the lengths to which PBMs go to obfuscate 
how they price and reimburse drugs. Such distortion begins with 
terminology: an average wholesale price (AWP) is generally a mark-up 
(typically 20 percent) of the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) and can 
be thought of as the manufacturer's list price.\9\ It is generally 
accepted that WAC is the amount paid by the wholesaler to the 
manufacturer.

Benchmark. www.drugs.
com. Retrieved 5 May 2022, from https://www.drugs.com/article/average-

The maximum allowable cost (MAC) is the amount set by the PBM and is 
the amount the PBM will reimburse a pharmacy for generic drugs 
(pharmacy MAC). MAC is also the amount the PBM will charge a plan 
sponsor for a drug (plan sponsor MAC). The pharmacy MACs and plan 
sponsor MACs can change by the hour or even minute. The price 
difference between the pharmacy MAC and the plan sponsor MAC is the 
``spread.'' Many understand that the spread is a revenue stream 
retained by the PBMs. As an example of the amount of money generated by 
this arbitrage, spread pricing cost the state of Ohio $225 million in 
2018.\10\

A generic effective rate (GER) represents a reimbursement baseline 
calculated as a percentage discount (e.g., 86 percent) off the average 
wholesale price (AWP) of a generic drug. A PBM will calculate across 
all generic drugs dispensed for a specified period (e.g., 1 year) 
either at an individual pharmacy level or often across all the 
pharmacies represented by a pharmacy services administrative 
organization (PSAO). However, PBMs reimburse generic claims at varying 
MAC, WAC or discounts off AWP, not at the GER. Accordingly, at the end 
of the specified evaluation period, PBMs reduce the AWP of all the 
individual generic drugs dispensed by the GER discount (e.g., 86 
percent) and that number is compared to the actual reimbursement 
originally paid to a pharmacy. The PBM will then reconcile the total 
dollar difference. If, after the PBM completes the calculations and 
determines a pharmacy has received excess reimbursement, the PBM will 
claw back the money. Given the vast differences between generic 
reimbursements based on MAC, WAC, and discounts of AWP, it is 
particularly difficult for pharmacies to know where they stand in 
comparison to the contracted GERs. Notably, PBMs do not refund 
clawbacks to patients; the PBMs retain the clawbacks for themselves. 
Brand effective rates (BERs) work the same, except the PBMs use them 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
for brand drugs.

This effective rate contracting/payment method allows PBMs to play 
games with individual drug reimbursements to the detriment of patients, 
pharmacies, and employers. Effective rate contracts allow a PBM, at its 
sole discretion, to reimburse a pharmacy artificially high or low 
knowing the PBM will reconcile the pharmacy reimbursement dollars at 
the end of the evaluation period to the contracted effective rate, as 
described above. For patients who have a percentage-based cost share, 
when a pharmacy dispenses a drug at a higher price artificially 
inflated by the PBM, based on the point-of-sale adjudication, the 
patient will pay a higher copayment. The patient will not receive the 
benefit of the end of the year reconciliation--the PBM will keep that 
money.
 PBMs' use of unconscionable contract terms
PBMs control market access, and they use that control to force 
unconscionable contract terms. PBM adhesion contracts include random 
basis audits, aberrant drug list compliance, inventory management 
limitations, specialty drug limitations, complicated performance 
metrics, complex pricing schemes, ``flexible contracting'' (which means 
unilateral, no-notice contract changes), and other such provisions. The 
PBM can base an audit off any of those unconscionable contract terms. A 
PBM audit is an existential threat to an independent pharmacy's 
business. Nevertheless, it is common for a single pharmacy to face 
several PBM audits a month. One of the most common audits is an invoice 
audit. Invoice audits require the pharmacy to prove that it bought the 
drugs it billed to the PBM. While that sounds reasonable, it is the 
frequency with which the PBM conducts such audits and the penalties 
that are not reasonable. If a PBM finds even a minor discrepancy, the 
pharmacy faces substantial financial penalties, and potentially even 
termination of the network agreement.

Termination of the network agreement can be fatal. In 92 percent of 
metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), at least one insurer with a PBM 
has a 30 percent market share. In 50 percent of MSAs, one insurer has 
at least 50 percent market share.\11\ With PBMs controlling access to 
the upstream insurer networks, they are able to control the downstream 
pharmacy market, and conflicts of interest abound.

 PBMs steering patients away from unaffiliated pharmacies and toward 
        PBM-
        affiliated specialty, mail-order, and retail pharmacies
PBMs use a variety of methods to steer patients away from unaffiliated 
pharmacies. PBMs create arbitrary lists, such as specialty and aberrant 
drug lists, to limit independent pharmacies' access to patients. These 
lists require patients to obtain certain drugs from a PBM-affiliated 
pharmacy.\12\ The PBMs use contract provisions that require independent 
pharmacies to ``walk'' their patients to ``specialty pharmacies,'' a 
term PBMs arbitrarily define. Any independent pharmacy can potentially 
be a specialty pharmacy, however, the PBMs make the sole determination 
of who meets the opaque ``criteria.'' If the PBMs do not determine the 
independent pharmacy meets PBM-established specialty pharmacy 
accreditation requirements, the pharmacy cannot be part of the 
specialty pharmacy network. Such a process begs the question: when 
would a PBM with a downstream affiliated specialty pharmacy ever 
determine an independent pharmacy is worthy of such designation?

Other methods include refill walk requirements. Below is a screenshot 
from an independent pharmacy's pharmacy management system. As you will 
see, the PBM requires the independent pharmacy to inform its patient 
that the patient must seek an alternative way of getting their refills. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The alternative way is through the PBM-affiliated pharmacy.

Failure to follow these exclusionary procedures often leads to audits 
and threats of termination of the pharmacy's network agreement. At the 
very least, PBMs force pharmacies to choose between filling the refill 
free of charge (real-time claims adjudication would prevent the 
independent pharmacy from submitting a claim) or letting the patient go 
untreated until they find a PBM-affiliated alternative.
 PBMs' policies and practices related to specialty drugs and pharmacies
On behalf of PBMs, sPCMA, a division of the Pharmaceutical Care 
Management Association representing the specialty pharmacy industry, 
released a white paper to defend PBM specialty drug practices.\13\ In 
it, sPCMA admits that the definition of specialty drug continues to 
evolve. It lists a number of attributes that on the one hand apply to 
many non-specialty drugs, and on the other hand begs the question: if 
specialty drugs are used to treat complex or chronic medical conditions 
that require lab monitoring; additional patient education, adherence 
and support; and administration technique training beyond traditional 
dispensing activities, why would a PBM want to send specialty drugs 
through its affiliated mail-order pharmacy? sPCMA provides the answer--
money.\14\<SUP>,</SUP> \15\

Other criteria cited in this document reveal the lack of 
differentiation between most designated specialty drugs and more widely 
used drugs. In fact, sPCMA notes that patients use specialty drugs for 
a wide range of conditions. When addressing why specialty drugs have 
limited distribution, sPCMA cites criteria that is relevant with all 
non-specialty designated drugs too: drug inventory tracking, supply 
chain integrity, and dosing and lab monitoring. Therefore, the criteria 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PBMs use is nebulous at best.

The impact on patients is clear. PBMs cut off patients who often have 
complex or chronic medical conditions from specialty options and force 
them into mail order at significant risk to their health.\16\ The PBM 
practices prevent patients from accessing prompt care, education, 
injection training, adherence, and related support that only an in-
person pharmacist can provide. Additionally, this practice is hurting 
consumers because when a mail-order drug fails to arrive at a patient's 
home, patients are forced to fill their specialty drugs at a pharmacy 
that is out of network, or not authorized to distribute specialty 
drugs.

 Potential conflicts of interest and anticompetitive effects arising 
        from horizontal and vertical consolidation of PBMs with 
        insurance companies, specialty pharmacies, and providers
In 2018, the auditor of the state of Ohio produced a State Report on 
Ohio's Medicaid Managed Care Pharmacy Services that spoke to PBM 
conflicts of interest.\17\ In it, the auditor found discriminatory 
reimbursement because PBMs compensated their affiliated pharmacies at a 
higher rate than independent pharmacies. This discriminatory 
reimbursement occurs nationwide, based on evidence reviewed from 
Arkansas, Florida,\18\ and Oklahoma. In fact, in February 2018, the 
Arkansas Pharmacists Association, joined by Arkansas Lieutenant 
Governor Tim Griffin and almost half of the General Assembly, held a 
press conference unveiling data demonstrating that PBMs pay their own 
affiliate pharmacies more than independent pharmacies.\19\ The Arkansas 
data contained over 200 examples of discriminatory reimbursement. Of 
the top generic drug prescriptions, Arkansas found that the PBMs were 
paying themselves, on average, over $60 more per prescription than they 
were paying independent pharmacies. The PBM was steering patients to 
its wholly owned affiliate so that it could pay itself more. Such 
anticompetitive behavior results in increased costs and harm to 
patients.

Conclusion

Prescription drug prices continue to grow at an alarming rate, while 
transparency and competition are decreasing. As we have shown above, 
there are many factors in the pharmaceutical supply chain and delivery 
system that may contribute to these negative factors, including PBM 
``middlemen.'' NCPA stands ready to work with Congress and the 
administration to implement policies that will lower drug prices at the 
pharmacy counter for our patients.

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

On behalf of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (Society), thank 
you for the opportunity to provide a statement for the record for the 
hearing ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply: 
Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.'' We appreciate this hearing's focus 
on examining the role that pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) play in the 
American healthcare system and the ways that these entities contribute 
to the high cost of prescription drugs.

We appreciated this Committee's commitment and focus on passing key 
provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that reduce the cost of 
prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries by allowing Medicare to 
negotiate for a select number of medications, setting a $2,000 cap on 
what beneficiaries must pay out of pocket, and enacting rebates to 
Medicare if the cost of a specific prescription drug rises faster than 
inflation. The IRA was a critical first step at systemically lowering 
the prices of prescription drugs for Americans. Still, more work 
remains to ensure that people can get life-changing medications when 
they need them. We are pleased that the Committee is now turning its 
attention to advancing solutions that ensure transparency and 
accountability of PBMs and their practices and that any savings that 
they negotiate are passed along to the patients and the healthcare 
system at large.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable disease of the central 
nervous system. Currently, there is no cure. Symptoms vary from person 
to person and may include disabling fatigue, mobility challenges, 
cognitive changes, and vision issues. An estimated 1 million people 
live with MS in the United States. Early diagnosis and treatment are 
critical to minimize disability. Significant progress is being made to 
achieve a world free of MS. The Society, founded in 1946, is the global 
leader of a growing movement dedicated to creating a world free of MS. 
To fulfill this mission, we fund cutting-edge research, drive change 
through advocacy, facilitate professional education, collaborate with 
MS organizations around the world, and provide services designed to 
help people affected by MS move their lives forward.

PBMs have played an increasingly important--but often hidden--role in 
the U.S. healthcare system. PBMs manage prescription drug benefits for 
health insurers, Medicare Part D drug plans, large employers, and other 
payors. Today, PBMs play an outsized role in determining the cost of 
prescription drugs for payors, influencing the access to medication 
that people with MS and other patients need, and determining how much 
pharmacies are paid for these medications.

High-priced MS medications are targets for PBM negotiations--creating 
both cost and access challenges for people with MS.

MS is a highly expensive disease. The average total cost of living with 
MS is $88,487 per year.\1\ The total estimated cost to the U.S. economy 
is $85.4 billion per year, and the direct medical cost to live with MS 
is an average of $65,612 more than a person who does not live with 
MS.\2\

Evidence demonstrates that early and ongoing treatment with an MS 
disease-
modifying therapy (DMT) is the best way to manage the disease course, 
prevent the accumulation of disability, and protect the brain from 
damage due to MS.\3\ There are now more than twenty DMTs on the market, 
including generic options. These medications have transformed the 
treatment of MS over the last 30 years. Unfortunately, these DMTs are 
incredibly expensive. The full range of MS DMTs represents various 
mechanisms of action and routes of administration with varying 
efficacy, side effects, and safety profiles. No single agent is `best' 
for all people living with MS \4\ and as MS presents differently in 
each person, every person's response to a DMT will vary. It is common 
for people with MS to move through several different DMTs throughout 
their life as they may ``breakthrough'' on medication or have disease 
activity and need to try a different DMT.

When the first MS DMT came to market in 1993, the price range was 
$8,000 to $11,000 for one year of treatment. The price of MS therapies 
has dramatically risen since that time. As of January 2023 (see 
appendix I), the median annual price of brand MS DMTs is nearly 
$98,000. The annual cost for individuals on an MS DMT ranges from 
$57,202 to $92,719, depending on an individual's age and sex,\5\ and 
people with MS stay on these medications for years. Cost increases have 
also impacted MS symptom management medications. For example, H.P. 
ActharGel (Acthar), approved in 1952, is used as a short-term treatment 
for acute exacerbations of MS. For years, this medication was priced at 
less than $40 per vial. However, today, a vial of Acthar is priced at 
around $40,000--approximately 140,000% more expensive than when it was 
approved 68 years ago. The price increases have made MS medications 
targets for both PBMs and payors, increasing out-of-pocket costs for 
people with MS, costs to the system, and creating access issues that 
impact the health and well-being of those living with MS.

PBMs Impact Access to Medications

PBMs play a powerful role in determining what access people with MS 
have to their DMTs and symptom management medications. PBMs can 
determine which medications are covered by payors and, what tier those 
medications are on, even what pharmacies people can use to get their 
medications. As the costs for these medications have increased, health 
plans and PBMs employ increasingly strict utilization management 
practices, like prior authorization and step therapy, to minimize the 
use and cost liability for these therapies. These practices present 
significant hurdles for prescribers and cause real delays and barriers 
for people with MS in accessing medications that they and their 
provider decide is right for them.

While PBMs often cite part of their role as keeping pharmaceutical and 
health costs down, there are documented examples that PBM practices can 
add costs to the healthcare system overall and inhibit patient care. 
Physicians in the United States complete an average of 33 prior 
authorization (PA) requests every week, taking an average of 14.4 hours 
to process.\6\ Eighty-six percent of surveyed physicians described the 
burden of PA as either high or extremely high. This burden is 
detrimentally impacting patients, with 90% of physicians reporting that 
PA requirements hurt patient clinical outcomes and 74% of physicians 
reporting that issues associated with PA can lead to patients 
abandoning or being nonadherent to a recommended course of treatment. 
Twenty-four percent of physicians report that PA has led to a serious 
adverse event for a patient in their care, and 16% of physicians say 
that PA has led to a patient's hospitalization. The healthcare system 
must do better for patients and providers.

Personal stories from the MS community echo these findings. For the 
past several years, people with MS and their healthcare providers have 
described egregious step therapy practices and prior authorization 
delays that have resulted in MS exacerbations, worsening health, and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
increased costs to the healthcare system.

MS Activist Marguerite from CA:

        I have had the not-uncommon experience of running out of my 
        critical medication while I wait for my neurologist to jump 
        through the prior authorization hoops. With MS, it's critical 
        to take medication regularly, as scheduled, to avoid 
        progression of the disease and potential disability.

These utilization management practices can include requiring three to 
five DMTs to fail a person with MS prior to accessing the individual's 
and their provider's medication of choice, requiring someone to use a 
DMT they already know does not work for them, and requiring people with 
needle phobia to use self-injectable medications even though oral 
medications are available. These practices result in nonadherence and 
dangerous delays to people getting on the DMTs that will work for them. 
With every delay, people with MS risk disease activity and underlying 
progression from which they may not recover. MS Activist Therese from 
Florida shared her experience:

        I almost gave up in January when it was time to coordinate with 
        insurance, hospitals/doctors, and the specialty pharmacy for my 
        Ocrevus infusion, which happens every 6 months. I almost give 
        up every 6 months. Why? Because it's hard. It's hard to 
        understand the steps that need to happen for approval because 
        they seem to change every time. The people that I speak with on 
        the phone are busy and talk fast, which is difficult for me to 
        understand. I'm spoken down to by representatives, often making 
        me feel dumb or that I'm a burden. And all I want is the 
        medication that I'm already taking and is working. The 
        medication that my medical team and I have deemed appropriate 
        for me. It's nothing new, yet the problems to get it approved 
        and dispensed are always new and ever-changing.

There is often little transparency into how formularies or step therapy 
protocols are developed, especially for MS DMTs, where no publicly 
available algorithms describe how to progress through the different MS 
DMTs. In 2019, in response to a Society funded survey, people with MS 
reported that the greatest challenge in getting their DMT comes from 
insurance companies.\7\ Too often, formularies designed by PBMs, and 
health insurers are driven not by medical practice but by rebates in 
the system. For example, according to a 2020 staff report from the 
House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Teva Pharmaceuticals pressured 
PBMs by tying contractual rebates on Copaxone 20 mg/ml to adding 
Copaxone 40 mg/ml to their formularies.\8\

The combination of vertical integration of PBMs, payors and pharmacies, 
rebating, and other business-related practices often result in 
formulary placement of medications that often steers individuals 
towards more expensive medications, while generics and biosimilars are 
becoming increasingly available. For example, PBMs often place generic 
drugs and biosimilars in higher formulary tiers alongside brand 
medications, thus negating the cost savings to the health system and 
the patient. We have seen this practice in the MS space, as MS 
generics, due to higher cost than regular generic medications, are 
covered more like specialty medications, resulting in higher cost 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
sharing for people with MS.

PBMs may also prefer a higher cost drug because it will increase their 
revenues; so, despite lower cost alternatives being available, a higher 
cost product may receive favorable formulary placement. These practices 
do not serve the best interest of the patient and Congress should act 
to ensure that what works best for the patient guides all elements of 
health-care decision-making.

Society's Recommendations for PBM Reform

The Society's analysis of policy recommendations is guided by two sets 
of recommendations, both developed by teams comprised of people 
affected by MS, MS healthcare providers, policy experts, and Society 
staff. The Access to High Quality MS Healthcare Principles \9\ and the 
Access to MS Medications Recommendations \10\ serve as the basis for 
the Society's support for any policy proposal and our recommendations 
to ensure that proposals best meet the needs of people with MS.

msnationalfiles/advocacy/recommendations-make-ms-meds-accessible.pdf.

The Society's full set of policy recommendations for PBM reform is 
outlined below, and we support many of the solutions that were raised 
during the hearing. We believe that comprehensive PBM reform should 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
include the following policies:

     Ensure transparency by requiring disclosure of specific costs, 
prices, reimbursements, fees, mark ups, discounts and aggregate 
payments received with respect to their PBM service.
     Prohibit unfair and deceptive pricing models including spread-
pricing and arbitrary claw backs of payments.
     Require pass-through pricing models.
     Require oversight and reporting on PBM behavior and allow the 
FTC to take legal action when a PBM is found in violation of the law.
     Allow for patients to have a choice of the pharmacy where they 
receive their medications.
     Ban PBMs from using discriminatory formularies.
     Eliminate copay accumulator and similar policies that put 
greater burden on patients.
     Allow patients to receive the benefits from rebated savings and 
pay the lesser amount of copay/co-insurance, the amount charged by the 
PBM to the pharmacy, or the cost of the drug.
     Include a substantial monetary penalty for those PBMs who act in 
violation of the law.

Recommendations for Medicare and Part D

While many of our recommendations may fall outside the jurisdiction of 
the Senate Finance Committee, we believe that these areas are an 
important first step to reform--both in the government and commercial 
markets.

Transparency and consistency of reporting are key.
As noted above and by many at the hearing, the opaqueness of the 
American healthcare system makes reform especially challenging. We 
support policies to improve transparency so that all stakeholders are 
working with the same level of information. There is increased pressure 
on people with MS and other chronic health conditions to make informed 
choices about the cost of their care and prescription drug medications. 
Yet, there is very little true transparency to provide the level of 
information needed to guide these decisions. We do not believe data 
like net price, mark-ups, payments, or rebates should be a trade 
secret. The Society supports proposals that would grant CMS the 
authority to require more granular data in reporting requirements and 
publish prescription drug prices throughout the year to level the 
playing field and give all stakeholders access to information necessary 
to guide their decision-making.

Additionally, due to the vertical integration between payors and PBMs, 
we support Congress granting authority to CMS to define an acceptable 
profit threshold for PBMs. CMS has a fiduciary duty to its 
beneficiaries and to taxpayers and this is consistent with the policies 
that CMS has around profit margins for plans under the Affordable Care 
Act.

Align incentives to ensure that PBMs have a responsibility to act on 
what is best for the patient.
Many members acknowledged during the hearing that PBMs are not charged 
to act in the best interest of the patient, so they often act in ways 
that are more profitable for them as a business. Vertical integration 
has only served to further remove the patient's interest from the 
center of decision-making. As mentioned above, the Society supports 
proposals that would prohibit unfair and deceptive pricing models 
including spread-pricing and arbitrary claw backs of payments, ban PBMs 
from using discriminatory formularies, and pass through all savings 
from the system to plans and patients. It is our understanding that 
these practices stem from PBMs not having a requirement to act on what 
is best for the patient.

Patients should not be paying the highest prices for any prescription 
drug.
It is unconscionable that patients are sometimes paying the highest 
prices for medications, particularly when the role of payors and PBMs 
is to negotiate for lower costs yet, because so much data on 
pharmaceutical prices is confidential, researchers and policy makers 
often have a hard time ensuring that patients really are getting the 
best deal. The Society believes and would support proposals that, would 
allow patients to pay whatever price is the lowest--the copay or co-
insurance, the cost not utilizing insurance, or the price charged by 
the PBM to the pharmacy. Additionally, we would support reforming how 
co-insurance is calculated and ensuring that amount is calculated based 
off the rebated price, not the list price. This change could be truly 
transformative for people living with MS, where the median annual price 
of brand MS DMTs is close to $98,000.

Additional Considerations for PBM Policy Reform

The specialty drug market needs further examination.
As noted during the hearing and throughout the Inflation Reduction Act 
hearing in the 117th Congress, the rise in specialty drugs has 
transformed the prescription drug and health coverage landscape. Dr. 
Burns noted in his testimony that ``PBMs are not heavily focused on the 
dispensing of specialty drugs.'' We believe that the entire specialty 
market needs examination to truly understand its impact on the 
prescription drug enterprise and pipeline. There are some significant 
differences between specialty drugs, and the Society believes that they 
may not function the same as other types of drugs or follow traditional 
supply/demand market dynamics, particularly due to their frequent use 
off-label. The Society believe that Congress should ask the GAO to 
examine specialty drugs and the impact on the research, development, 
and healthcare sector broadly.

End gaming of the regulatory and patent systems.
As multiple Senators and the panel noted during the hearing, vertical 
integration has made it more urgent that Congress act to address 
regulatory and patent gaming of the system. The Society appreciates the 
attention from the Committee around improving the regulatory process to 
ensure speedy regulatory approval and access to generic medications and 
biosimilars. We believe that industries should be compensated fairly 
for the research and development required to bring innovative products 
to market. However, market exclusivity and patent protections are vital 
tools created by Congress to reward innovation, and the Society 
believes that minor tweaks to existing products should not receive 
lengthy patent protections. We support the bills that passed out of the 
Judiciary Committee in February: S. 79, the Interagency Patent 
Coordination and Improvement Act of 2023, S. 113, the Prescription 
Pricing for the People Act of 2023, S. 142, the Preserve Access to 
Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act, S. 148, the Stop Stalling Act, 
and S. 150, the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act of 2023. 
While large scale patent reform and pay for delay legislation should be 
examined, these bills provide a good first step at addressing common 
practices that are utilized to delay competition in the prescription 
drug market which artificially creates higher prices and less choice 
for patients. 

Conclusion

We are encouraged that the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees 
have already advanced legislation that would align with the Society's 
recommendations and urge you to pass comprehensive PBM reform out of 
Committee that provides accountability from PBMs to the Medicare system 
and for beneficiaries. The Society believes many of these proposals can 
and should be implemented in the commercial market and will work with 
your Colleagues in the Senate HELP Committee on complimentary 
legislation to ensure all patients have access to the life-changing 
therapies they need to live their best lives.

Thank you again for holding this important hearing and your work to 
address harmful PBM practices that hurt patients and raise costs for 
them and the healthcare system at large. If you have any questions 
about our comments or recommendations, please contact Leslie Ritter,

U.S. Senate
Committee on Finance

Introduction

The Nevada Pharmacy Alliance appreciates the opportunity to submit a 
statement for the record for the United States Senate Committee on 
Finance on ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply 
Chain: Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.''

The Nevada Pharmacy Alliance was created to address the need in our 
state to have an association that focused on the greater good of the 
pharmacy profession. To make sure that pharmacy professionals were 
supported so that they are able to take care of their patients. We are 
committed to connecting, educating, and advocating for the profession 
of pharmacy to optimize patient care and public health.

 Great Concern about Pharmacy Benefit Manager Tactics

We are extremely concerned about pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) tactics 
that have significant negative effects on patients, communities, 
taxpayers, employers, and pharmacies. PBMs are hired by insurance plans 
and others to negotiate lower drug prices. Unfortunately, they 
manipulate the system and keep billions in profits while:

     Forcing patients and others to pay more for their medicines;
     Limiting patients' ability to choose their pharmacist;
     Restricting access to medicines that doctors and other 
prescribers determine to be right for the patient; and
     Jeopardizing pharmacies' viability--which obviously harms the 
pharmacy and also the patients and communities that rely on them.

The dominance of PBMs is significant. Three PBMs control 80 percent of 
the prescription drug market. These are the practical effects of PBM 
tactics:

     Over-payments: The University of Southern California Leonard D. 
Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics found that Medicare 
Part D standalone plans paid $2.6 billion more in one year for 184 
common generic medications compared with prices for the same drugs 
available to cash-paying customers of one retailer.
     Restricting medications: Drug Channels analysis found that from 
2014 to 2022, 1,357 medications were excluded from at least one PBM 
formulary for at least one year. The exclusions of drugs from these 
lists have escalated since starting in 2012.
     Putting the squeeze on pharmacies: The Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services found that direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) 
fees charged by PBMs and payers to pharmacies have exploded by 107,400% 
over the last decade.

We hear daily, as medical providers, the struggles that Nevada patients 
of all ages have affording their prescriptions. One reason that the 
cost of prescription medications are rising is because of the lack of 
transparency of PBMs. There are multiple studies that show PBMs are 
failing to pass saving on to states, insurance companies, and patients. 
Many of these were highlighted in the 2020 Interim Study Concerning the 
Costs of Prescription Drugs that happened in the Nevada Legislature.

We hear all of the time, as an association, the negative effects that 
the big PBMs (the top three have a 80% market share) are having on 
patient care and non-PBM owned pharmacies being sustainable in Nevada. 
As you are aware, pharmacies that are not managed by a company that 
owns a PBM are closing rapidly.

We want to take this opportunity to define ``PBM reform.'' This is 
important to maximize the effectiveness of Congress' work in this area 
for patients, and to roll back the current jeopardy posed by PBMs to 
pharmacies. For this purpose, we call to your attention the Principles 
of PBM Reform advocated by the National Association of Chain Drug 
Stores:

     Stop explosive retroactive fees. Stop PBMs and payers from using 
``DIR fees'' and other tactics to grab back the payments made and owed 
to pharmacies--often many months after the fact and often resulting in 
below-cost pharmacy reimbursement.
     Stop below-cost reimbursement. Adopt a reimbursement rate floor 
that prevents PBMs and payers from reimbursing pharmacies below the 
true cost of acquiring and dispensing prescription drugs.
     Stop gaming of performance measures. Standardize performance 
measures to help improve patient outcomes and reduce costs--rather than 
allowing PBMs and payers to play ``gotcha'' with pharmacies using 
arbitrary measures and exorbitant fees.
     Stop ``specialty definitions'' from steering patients from their 
pharmacy. Prevent PBMs and payers from defining ``specialty drugs'' in 
ways that steer patients with rare or complex diseases away from their 
preferred pharmacy of their choice and toward another pharmacy--
including those owned by the PBMs and payers.
     Stop mandatory mail-order. Prohibit PBMs and payers from forcing 
patients to use mail-order pharmacies--including those owned by the 
PBMs and payers--and prohibit them from imposing penalties on patients 
for choosing a convenient and trusted pharmacy in their neighborhood.
     Stop limited networks. Require PBMs and payers to include in 
their networks all pharmacies willing to accept terms and conditions 
established by the PBM.
     Stop overwhelming audits. Bring efficiency, transparency, and 
standardization to the processes by which PBMs audit pharmacies without 
sacrificing continuity of care.
     Stop the undercutting of PBM reform laws. Prioritize the 
implementation, enforcement, and oversight of PBM reform laws--to 
maximize results for patients and fairness for pharmacies and other 
stakeholders, and to ensure laws are not undermined by inaction of PBMs 
or of government.

Conclusion

In closing, we want to put to rest one of the myths perpetuated by 
PBMs. It is shocking that they have been able to stave off reform 
efforts by alleging that premiums will increase. This is nothing short 
of a scare tactic, and one that cannot be allowed to be used so 
flippantly and without substantiation. PBM reform will reduce 
prescription drug costs by cracking down on middlemen's manipulation. 
It does not follow logically that reductions in prescription drug costs 
will result in increased premiums. It is time to address the 
manipulative business practices of PBMs, as well as to end the negative 
effects of their tactics.

The Nevada Pharmacy Alliance thanks the Committee for the opportunity 
to provide our perspective on PBM reform. For questions or further 
discussion, please contact Ken Kunke, Executive Secretary,

                    Patients For Affordable Drugs Now

                          1120 20th Street, NW

Patients For Affordable Drugs Now is the only national patient 
organization focused exclusively on policies to lower drug prices. We 
are independent, bipartisan and we do not accept funding from any 
organizations that profit from the development or distribution of 
prescription drugs.

Prescription drug prices are set by pharmaceutical companies, and our 
organization is dedicated to effective implementation of the 
comprehensive drug price reforms included in the Inflation Reduction 
Act (IRA) that will hold drug companies accountable by giving the 
federal government leverage over prices through negotiation and by 
implementing penalties on companies that price gouge. The policy 
provisions in the IRA finally authorize Medicare to negotiate prices 
directly for some of the most expensive prescription medicines; 
institute a hard cap on out-of-pocket drug costs for people on 
Medicare; limit copays on insulin for millions of Americans to $35 each 
month; and limit annual price increases to no more than the rate of 
inflation.

But drug companies are not the only actors in the drug pricing supply 
chain, and there is ample evidence that pharmacy benefit managers 
(PBMs) do not always act to minimize prices and costs for patients as 
intended under U.S. policy. Our concern about the impact of PBMs--and 
the need for more oversight and accountability--is why we submitted the 
following comments in response to the Federal Trade Commission's 
solicitation for public input on the business practices of PBMs.\1\ Our 
comments urged the FTC to investigate PBMs in order to highlight 
specific areas needing reform and potential solutions, and we are 
pleased the FTC has opened an investigation into the major PBMs. But, 
even while the FTC pursues its work to examine PBM practices, Congress 
can act now to increase accountability for PBMs by requiring 
transparency into the secret actions of PBMs, giving the FTC the 
necessary tools to regulate PBMs, and passing legislation to ensure 
that PBMs are accountable first to their beneficiaries, rather than 
their shareholders.

we submit the following comments for the record in the hope that they

access and affordability.

Patients For Affordable Drugs Now is the only national patient 
organization focused exclusively on policies to lower drug prices. We 
are bipartisan and independent. We don't accept funding from any 
organizations that profit from the development or distribution of 
prescription drugs.

Today, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) administer prescription drug 
benefits for more than 266 million Americans, or 80% of the 
population.\2\ While drug prices are set by manufacturers, there is 
ample evidence that indicates the profit-driven and secretive practices 
of PBMs play a major role in the cost of and access to drugs for our 
patient community. In order to better understand PBMs' impact on 
patients--and to guide future government and industry reforms--we urge 
the Federal Trade Commission to conduct a study of PBMs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PBMs Are Shrouded in Secrecy

PBMs are supposed to act as intermediaries, leveraging the buying power 
of insurers, employers, and government purchasers in order to capture 
savings, which at the end of the day are supposed to accrue to the 
benefit of patients and consumers. But because the business practices 
of PBMs are shrouded in secrecy, policymakers and the public are left 
in the dark about the amount of savings actually passed on to payers 
and patients through lower premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\3\ While 
PBMs claim to be utilizing their bargaining power on behalf of 
patients, they are simultaneously fighting to ensure their rebate 
practices stay hidden from view.\4\ As a result, a patient cannot know 
if the preferred drug on the formulary is placed there because it is 
the best, most cost-effective option or because it is the one for which 
the PBM received a substantial rebate. Without further transparency and 
accountability, PBM decision-making and its impact on patients will 
remain a mystery.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Are Patients Actually Paying More for Some Drugs Because of Rebate 
                    Practices?

Because larger rebates can be exchanged for more favorable formulary 
placement, PBM rebate practices may in fact incentivize drug companies 
to raise list prices in order to be able to provide deep enough rebates 
to gain and maintain placement. This ongoing cycle demonstrates how 
rebate practices can contribute to ever-
increasing list prices.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/article/new-evidence-shows-
prescription-drug-rebates-play-a-role-in-increasing-list-prices/.

Pay-for-position rebate practices also lead to higher costs for 
patients. A PBM may receive a substantial rebate from a brand-name drug 
company in exchange for placing that brand-name drug--instead of a less 
expensive generic option--in a preferred tier. Because patient cost-
sharing is most often based on the full, non-discounted price of the 
drug, this structure exposes insured patients to higher costs even 
though an equally effective, more affordable option may exist. The 
impact on uninsured patients is even more severe because they must pay 
the entire, rebate-inflated list price without the benefit of insurance 
coverage to absorb some of the costs. The relationship between rebates 
and higher out-of-pocket costs has been substantiated in academic 
research.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PBM Practices May Be Used To Block Competition

Our drug pricing system is designed around the expectation that the 
market entry of generic and biosimilar drugs will generate competition 
and promote affordability. Unfortunately, PBM practices may make it 
difficult or impossible for generic and biosimilar drugs to gain uptake 
in the market. Current incentives in the negotiations between 
drugmakers and PBMs leave contracts vulnerable to gaming.

For example, as part of drug manufacturer Teva's effort to delay 
generic competition for its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug 
Copaxone, the company developed a higher concentration version of the 
drug and began efforts to switch patients to this dosage before the 
existing dosage faced generic competition.\7\ The House Committee on 
Oversight and Reform uncovered documents that show that Teva pressured 
PBMs ``by tying contractual rebates on [the previously marketed 
concentration] to adding [the newly developed concentration] to their 
formularies.''\8\ The participating PBM conceded, seeking the sizable 
rebates in question. Teva's efforts to impede generic competition 
resulted in considerable costs to our health system and kept affordable 
alternatives out of reach for patients. In addition, in 2017, Pfizer 
filed a lawsuit \9\ accusing Johnson & Johnson of offering PBMs larger 
rebates to incentivize them to place its blockbuster rheumatoid 
arthritis drug Remicade in a favorable formulary position instead of 
Pfizer's new biosimilar competitor, Inflectra.\10\ Both examples 
illustrate instances in which drug companies worked in tandem with PBMs 
to hinder market penetration of more affordable generic and biosimilar 
medications.

PBMs Put Shareholders First, Not Patients

PBMs have become some of the most profitable players in the health care 
sector. In 2021, PBMs handled more than $422 billion \11\ of gross drug 
revenues in the United States. The profitability of PBMs has risen in 
recent years as a result of vertical mergers between PBMs, insurance 
companies, and pharmacies. Almost 90% \12\ of those gross revenues in 
2021 moved through the ``Big Three'' alone--CVS, Express Scripts, and 
OptumRx. The gross profit \13\ of PBMs grew 12% between 2017 and 2019, 
increasing from $25 billion to $28 billion. Because they are profit-
driven entities with a duty to shareholders but without a fiduciary 
responsibility to beneficiaries, additional transparency could clarify 
whether their practices best serve patients or shareholders. We believe 
U.S. law and policy should be amended to give PBMs a fiduciary 
responsibility to beneficiaries, requiring them to put beneficiary 
health and financial interests first.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lack of Competition Leads to Profits Over Patients

Concentration in the PBM industry is yet another factor that appears to 
contribute to a drug pricing system where profits come before patients. 
Because three large PBMs \14\ have a stranglehold on the market, these 
companies have a disproportionate impact on what medications patients 
have access to. For example, at the end of last year, CVS Caremark 
announced \15\ that it would no longer cover the blockbuster 
anticoagulant Eliquis in 2022 and would instead cover only warfarin and 
Xarelto. This decision had enormous implications for patients since CVS 
Caremark has the largest market share (34% \16\) of any PBM. As a 
result, many patients were forced to switch products in order to remain 
on a covered drug. For some medications--especially biologics--a forced 
switch can carry with it significant health and safety implications for 
the patient. Patient choice can be further limited by PBMs, like CVS 
Caremark, that own retail pharmacies and may be directing or requiring 
beneficiaries to fill prescriptions with their retail affiliates.

    \16\ https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/pbms-ranked-by-
market-share-cvs-caremark-is-no-1.html.

Recent mergers \17\ have also made the lines between PBMs and insurance 
companies increasingly difficult to distinguish. This trend creates 
conflicting incentives stemming from the fact that PBMs are typically 
more profitable than insurance companies.\18\ Insurers, which are 
typically motivated by cost-containment, may pivot to direct patients 
to treatments with higher rebates instead of acting in the best health 
and financial interests of their beneficiaries. This dynamic could 
exacerbate all the aforementioned effects that PBMs have on patients

Conclusion

PBMs were created with the stated purpose of negotiating on behalf of 
patients. Today, PBMs handle more than $420 billion \19\ and cover more 
than 266 million lives.\20\ Nevertheless, their work is shrouded in 
secrecy, so their practices remain unclear and their effects on 
patients are at best uncertain--and at worst deleterious. The Federal 
Trade Commission should investigate PBMs in order to reveal the 
practices and effects of these large and growing entities. Such an 
investigation could be critical for identifying problem areas and an 
important step in building a foundation for policymakers to utilize as 
they seek to develop appropriate legislative solutions to ensure PBMs 
can best serve consumers.

Introduction

The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) appreciates the 
opportunity to provide this statement about the role of the pharmacy 
benefit manager (PBM) industry in the market for prescription drugs, 
focusing on how PBMs benefit patients and taxpayers. PCMA is the 
national association representing America's pharmacy benefit companies, 
which administer prescription drug plans and operate home delivery and 
specialty pharmacies for more than 275 million Americans with health 
coverage through public and private employers, labor unions, Medicare, 
Medicaid, the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, and the 
exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Our members 
work closely with health plans and health insurance issuers to secure 
lower costs for prescription drugs and achieve better health outcomes.

 Pharmacy Benefit Companies Support Policies to Encourage Competition 
                    as the Best Way to Lower Prescription Drug Costs

PBMs work to improve prescription drug affordability by providing 
prescribers with information about less expensive generic alternatives, 
setting performance standards for pharmacies to encourage generic 
fills, and ensuring patients are aware of lower cost alternatives. Due 
in large part to these efforts by PBMs, 90 percent of prescription drug 
fills are generics.\1\ Pharmacy benefit companies also support 
increased uptake of biosimilars through business decisions, such as 
preferring both the brand and a biosimilar to ensure patients and 
providers have the proper incentives to choose lower cost options and 
the choice to continue with a drug they may be reluctant to move away 
from, and policy proposals, including eliminating the 
interchangeability designation to reduce costs and confusion, stopping 
patent abuses, and making it easier for Medicare Part D plans to update 
formularies as new biosimilars come to market.

Report-web.pdf.

Toward that end, PCMA recently proposed the following three keys in a 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
policy platform supportive of a more sustainable health care future:

        Key #1: Ensure System Sustainability by Promoting Competition. 
        Enabling a robust private prescription drug marketplace that 
        promotes competition is the best way to drive down prescription 
        drug costs and make more affordable alternatives available for 
        patients.

        Key #2: Support and Equip Clinicians with Tools and Data to 
        Serve Patients Optimally. Pharmacy benefit experts support 
        efforts to help clinicians, including pharmacists and other 
        health care practitioners, ``practice at the top of their 
        license'' to optimize use of their clinical expertise and 
        counseling abilities. Pharmacy benefit companies also work to 
        increase clinicians' administrative efficiency by offering 
        information and tools to help serve patients.

        Key #3: Enhance Patient Outcomes and Improve the Patient 
        Experience. Pharmacy benefit companies use their prescription 
        drug expertise to support better health outcomes and provide 
        recommendations to meet each patient's needs.

Our Affordable Future policy platform proposes numerous solutions to 
build on the private market system and facilitate collaboration among 
patients, regulators, PBMs, clinicians, health plans, and pharmacies to 
work toward a more functional, equitable, and affordable prescription 
drug market.

PCMA supports numerous bills introduced by members of the Senate. These 
measures align with the solutions proposed by our organization: the 
Interagency Patent Coordination and Improvement Act of 2023, the 
Prescription Pricing for the People Act of 2023, the Stop STALLING Act, 
the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act, the 
Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act, and the Expanding Access to 
Affordable Prescription Drugs and Medical Devices Act to improve the 
competitive landscape for prescription drugs.

Pharmacy Benefit Companies Improve Care for Patients

PBMs Simplify the Patient Experience
People with insurance filled more than 6.4 billion prescriptions in 
retail pharmacies in 2021.\2\ Every day, that amounts to nearly 15 
million prescriptions, so it is critical that patients can pick up 
their prescriptions as quickly as possible at the pharmacy counter (or 
at home via mail delivery) to establish and maintain medication 
adherence. PBMs perform many essential functions that combine disparate 
information and expertise, as well as advanced technology to facilitate 
and streamline getting a prescription filled as seamlessly as 
possible.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

technology-and-expertise-improves-patient-health-outcomes/.

To optimize the patient experience when a pharmacy initiates the 
process of filling a prescription drug, once the pharmacy enters the 
prescription into its system, the prescribing information is sent 
electronically to the patient's PBM, which checks the pharmacy benefit 
information to confirm the patient's insurance status and cost-sharing 
amount, as well as the patient's medication history for any errors or 
possible harmful drug interactions. When a patient uses insurance, 
their PBM can see all their prescriptions. Technology allows real-time, 
almost instantaneous access to this information which the PBM uses to 
determine if there is any reason that a prescribed drug should not be 
taken by a patient and can alert the pharmacist to any dangerous 
interactions before the patient receives any medication and pays any 
associated cost sharing. All of this happens rapidly, seamlessly, and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
behind the scenes to improve patient safety and care.

Part D plans and the PBMs that administer them are also required to 
provide real-time benefit tools to give patients and prescribers cost 
sharing and benefits information at the point of prescribing.
PBMs Lower Drug Costs for Patients
PBMs, working with those providing insurance, encourage patients 
through formulary design and cost-sharing incentives to use the most 
affordable drugs, which are usually generics. For brand drugs, PBMs 
negotiate directly with drug manufacturers, who compete for formulary 
placement by offering a type of discount called rebates.\4\ For drugs 
on the preferred tier of a plan's formulary, patients typically have 
lower cost sharing.\5\ As competing products enter the market, PBMs 
gain leverage competitor products to negotiate deeper drug discounts 
for patients and employers.\6\

01/57050-Rx-Spending.pdf.

PBMs have also created contracts that account for the value of 
specialty and high-cost medications.\7\ Value-based arrangements are at 
the forefront of new drug payment designs and will be critical to 
managing the costs of next-generation therapies like cell and gene 
therapies, orphan drugs, and ultra-expensive specialty drugs. Value-
based contracts will better allow plans to manage these high costs, and 
plan sponsors will need broad flexibility to craft and employ value-
based contracts.

Problem_whitepaper_FINAL2.pdf.

The Medicare Part D program, where older Americans and those living 
with disabilities can choose among private plans to get their drug 
benefits, is a great example of PBM value. PBMs support Part D plans by 
negotiating rebates and discounts and promoting better pharmacy 
quality, passing 99.6 percent of rebates to the Part D plans, which in 
turn use them to enhance drug benefits and keep premium costs reliably 
low for beneficiaries.\8\

Savings from PBMs benefit health plans, employers, retirees, and 
patients directly. Prescriptions cost health plans and employers an 
average of $1,315 per person per year, with patients paying an average 
of $180 for their prescriptions, or 14 percent.\9\ Without PBMs and the 
savings they generate, drug costs could be $2,000 per person per 
year.\10\

Pharmacy Benefit Companies Reduce Costs for Employers

Employers need choice and flexibility when designing prescription drug 
benefits that meet the health and affordability needs of unique 
employee populations. Employers and other health plan sponsors vary 
dramatically in size, resources, and function and serve diverse 
populations.

PBMs have an established record of negotiating price concessions from 
drug manufacturers (through formularies and other tools) and pharmacies 
to reduce drug costs. No employer, union, retiree health plan, pension 
fund, or other health plan sponsor is required to hire or use a PBM, 
but virtually all choose to because PBMs lower the cost of providing 
health care coverage and allow them to better serve the patients they 
represent. Health plan sponsors choose PBMs through a transparent and 
highly competitive bidding process. With more than 70 full-service PBMs 
in the market, including regular new entrants, health plan sponsors 
have diverse options, allowing them to select the PBM that best meets 
their unique needs.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ PCMA. 2021. Available at https://www.pcmanet.org/wp-content/
uploads/2021/04/PBM-Landscape-2021.pdf.

For health plan sponsors, it is important to maintain a competitive 
market that provides choice among PBMs and the ability to decide how to 
set up drug benefits to best serve their unique populations. Some may 
choose a PBM based on its scale, ability to negotiate deep discounts or 
manage the risk of price changes. Others choose to hire PBMs based on 
their innovative care management programs or different levels of 
service. For small employers, many of whom may struggle to provide 
health insurance to employees, PBMs both lower drug costs and provide 
cost predictability, enabling them to stretch their benefit dollars 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
even further.

Plan sponsors should have the option of determining how they would like 
to pay the pharmacy benefit company they select for their services. 
``Spread pricing'' is a risk-based contracting model in which employers 
choose to let the pharmacy benefit company hold the risk that plan 
participants may use more expensive pharmacies to acquire drugs in 
exchange for the option to keep the savings when a patient uses a less 
expensive pharmacy, as well as to take a loss when they use costlier 
pharmacies. Today, employers can choose spread pricing or ``pass-
through'' contracting, in which the plan sponsor pays whatever the 
pharmacy charges. While larger employers typically select pass-through 
contracts, as they have the scale to deal with the variability of 
pharmacy charges, smaller employers often choose spread contracts 
because of the pricing predictability and savings they derive.

As a result, PBMs have a pro-competitive influence on the prescription 
drug marketplace, and PBM services provide a significant and measurable 
benefit for businesses and others providing health insurance. Without 
PBMs in the marketplace, those organizations would be left to negotiate 
drug costs on their own or pay the full costs of these drugs.

 PBMs Save Taxpayers Money and Improve the Efficiency of Government 
                    Programs

Pharmacy benefit companies play an important role in federal health 
coverage programs, providing prescription drug benefits to 
approximately 67 million people across Medicare Part D, TRICARE, and 
the FEHB program. Pharmacy benefit companies save the Part D program an 
average of $2,026 per Part D beneficiary per year and will save the 
program over $430 billion over the next 10 years.\12\ In addition to 
drug savings, pharmacy benefit companies provide important clinical 
services that help patients lead healthier lives. For example, over the 
next 10 years, they will prevent 1 billion medication errors.\13\ 
Across the three federal programs, pharmacy benefit companies 
facilitate affordable prescription drug access to enable better health 
outcomes.

PBMs Keep Medicare Part D Spending Down
The Medicare Part D program covers 49 million Medicare beneficiaries 
through private prescription drug plans. Beneficiaries enrolled in 
original Medicare can choose from 801 (as of 2023) stand-alone 
prescription drug plans (PDPs),\14\ while those with Medicare Advantage 
(MA) have their benefits prescription drug benefits (MA-PDs) integrated 
into their plans. Overall, in 2021, Part D had total spending of $110.8 
billion.\15\

uploads/2023/03/Ch12_Mar23_MedPAC_Report_To_Congress_SEC.pdf.

Part D has grown both in terms of the number of prescriptions filled 
and expenditures since its inception in 2003. However, despite its 
growth, during its first ten years in operation, according to the 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO), total Part D spending was 50 percent 
lower than expected.\16\ Again in 2023, CBO has found that spending in 
Part D has been much lower than anticipated.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ CBO. 2023. Available at https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-
03/58997-Whitehouse.pdf.

In both 2013 and 2023, one major driver of low spending has been the 
steady increase in the generic utilization rate among patients 
participating in the program. Across MA-PDs, the generic dispensing 
rate with just 63 percent in 2006, but had climbed to 90 percent by 
2016.\18\ And nationally, when a generic alternative is available, the 
generic version is substituted for the branded drug 97 percent of the 
time, a substitution rate that has been stable since 2013.\19\ Because 
of the promotion of generics to beneficiaries by pharmacy benefit 
companies, an estimated additional 15 percent of drugs are dispensed as 
generics. Pharmacy benefit companies use formularies as a tool to 
incentivize beneficiaries to use generic drugs. According to academic 
research, ``Part D plan formularies are designed to encourage the use 
of generics rather than their brand name counterparts.''\20\

2019.01694.

In addition to the increased use of generics, lower than predicted Part 
D net spending--after discounts and rebates--was also in part due to 
higher rebates negotiated by pharmacy benefit companies. Between 2011 
and 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of 
the Inspector General (OIG) found that rebates on brand drugs nearly 
doubled, while growth in Part D spending was substantially reduced.\21\ 
The average net price of a prescription, after all pharmacy benefit 
company-negotiated discounts and rebates, fell from $57 in 2009 to $50 
in 2018.\22\

pdf.

Additionally, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 
rebates negotiated by pharmacy benefit companies kept Part D spending 7 
percent lower than it would have been without rebates. And pharmacy 
benefit companies do not keep rebates in Part D, according to GAO, 99.6 
percent of rebates get passed through to plan sponsors. Plan sponsors 
use these rebates to keep premiums affordable for beneficiaries.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \23\ GAO. 2019. Available at https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-19-
498.pdf.

Beneficiary premiums in Part D have been relatively stable since 
2010,\24\ and the average monthly premium declined by 1.8% to $31.05 in 
2023.\25\ GAO found that ``downward pressure [by rebates] on premiums 
is one reason that premiums remained relatively unchanged between 2010 
and 2015, according to the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS), even though total gross Part D drug costs grew about 12 percent 
per year in that period.'' The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 
(MedPAC) agrees, finding that growth in rebates has helped keep the 
average premium affordable for beneficiaries.\26\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Fully Implementing PBM Tools in Medicaid Could Provide Substantial 
        Savings for the Program
PBMs also manage pharmacy benefits for state Medicaid programs with 
both health plan and fee-for-service (FFS) coverage. Nationally, PBMs 
saved Medicaid $22 billion from 2013 to 2018 combined; however, the 
potential for additional savings remains untapped.\27\ In the 
commercial market, PBMs have the flexibility to drive use of the 
highest therapeutic quality, lowest-cost drugs and shift utilization 
from brands to generics as clinically appropriate; develop preferred 
pharmacy networks; advance evidence-based, clinically effective 
utilization; and leverage data analytics to detect and prevent fraud, 
waste, and abuse. As drug prices continue to increase and expensive 
gene and cell therapies come to market, state Medicaid programs will 
face increasing budgetary pressures. Optimal use of PBMs tools in state 
Medicaid programs would save a total of $112 billion over 10 years, $43 
billion for states and $69 billion for the federal government.\28\

PBMs Support Meaningful, Actionable Transparency to Enhance Market 
                    Competition

Transparency that helps patients and payers is necessary across the 
entire prescription drug chain. PBMs support and practice actionable 
transparency that empowers patients, their physicians, those sponsoring 
health coverage, and policymakers, so that they can make informed 
decisions that can lead to lower prescription drug costs. Actionable 
transparency encourages consumers to shop for coverage that best fits 
their health needs and budgets, and once covered, use the most cost-
effective, highest-value health care goods and services. It enables 
prescribers and patients to avoid pharmacy-counter surprises and helps 
ensure that physicians can prescribe drugs that are affordable for 
patients. To that end, PBMs provide patients and prescribers with real-
time benefit tools (RTBTs), which provide real-time information on 
exactly where the patient is with respect to progressing through a 
deductible or another benefit phase, what drugs are on the patient's 
formulary, and exactly what cost sharing to expect for a given drug at 
the pharmacy. PBMs also provide patients with information on in-network 
pharmacies, premiums, general cost-sharing, and benefits for their 
prescription drug coverage.

PBMs provide health plans, employer plan sponsors, and consumers with a 
broad array of accurate, actionable information on price and quality to 
make efficient purchasing decisions. PBMs' customers are able to set 
the terms of the transparency and information they want to receive, as 
well as their audit rights, as part of their contracts.

In recent years, Congress has added more requirements for PBMs to 
report to federal agencies, as well as public reporting in more 
aggregated form, in both cases with appropriate protections for 
confidential data to avoid encouraging tacit collusion, efforts that we 
support.

The Congressional Budget Office has framed the transparency and 
disclosure considerations clearly in this often quoted statement:

        The disclosure of drug rebates could affect Medicare spending 
        through two principal mechanisms. First, disclosure would 
        probably make rebates less varied among purchasers, with large 
        rebates and small rebates tending to converge toward some 
        average rebate. Such compression, for reasons discussed below, 
        would tend to reduce the rebates that PDPs received and thus 
        would raise Medicare costs. Second, for a range of medical 
        conditions, drugs appropriate for treatment are available from 
        only a few manufacturers; disclosure of drug-by-drug rebate 
        data in those cases would facilitate tacit collusion among 
        those manufacturers, which would tend to raise drug prices. 
        (CBO March 12, 2007)

Likewise, the Federal Trade Commission has noted that there are limits 
to the benefits of transparency and unintended consequences that can 
result.\29\ Thus, PBMs encourage the Committee, as it reviews how to 
improve the prescription drug market to help lower costs for patients 
and businesses, to focus its efforts on actionable transparency that 
reduces drug costs versus transparency that raises them.

PBMs Already Comply with Numerous Disclosure Requirements

Pharmacy benefit companies already operate under federal transparency 
requirements and adhere to myriad contractually required transparency 
provisions imposed by their own business and government partners.

PBMs are subject to regulations promulgated by HHS, the Department of 
Labor, the Department of Treasury, the Food and Drug Administration, 
and states. PBM practices are overseen by state Medicaid agencies, 
state-based consumer protection agencies, private accreditation 
organizations, and their own clients--health plan sponsors and PBMs are 
directly regulated by state departments of insurance or other state 
agencies.

Exchange plans must report data on numerous administrative processes 
like coverage determinations and prior authorization in a way that 
potential enrollees can access and understand them. Exchange plans must 
also report data confidentially to CMS regarding generic dispensing 
rates for retail and mail-order pharmacies; aggregate amounts and types 
of rebates, discounts, price concessions, and service fees; total 
prescriptions covered; and the difference between the amount the health 
plan pays the PBM and the amount that the PBM pays retail and mail-
order pharmacies.

Medicare Part D plans must make available to enrollees and potential 
enrollees all relevant aspects of their benefit design, and report 
confidentially to CMS the same information as exchange plans, through 
annual reporting. Part D plans also submit Prescription Drug Event 
(PDE) data, which is a summary of Part D claims activity with 
additional data elements including pharmacy dispensing fees. As part of 
the bid and reconciliation processes, PBMs (via the Part D plans) must 
report estimated pharmacy and manufacturer Direct and Indirect 
Remuneration (DIR), including rebates and other price concessions.

It is important to note that government reporting by PBMs is not static 
but an ongoing, evolving construct. Indeed, CMS routinely updates 
required Part D filings to encompass more information, including with 
respect to PDE and DIR filings. For example, new pharmacy DIR rules 
take effect on January 1, 2024. Under these new rules, the negotiated 
price for a Part D covered drug must reflect the lowest possible 
reimbursement a network pharmacy will receive for a drug and must 
include all pharmacy price concessions. CMS has already issued detailed 
guidance on how these changes are to be included in PDE and DIR 
filings, including changes related to calculating beneficiary cost 
sharing taking into account the application of pharmacy price 
concessions at point of sale.\30\ Also, CMS has several other major 
expansions underway to the PDE submissions for 2025 related to 
Inflation Reduction Act implementation, and we expect to see more for 
2026.

httpseditcmsgovresearch-statistics-data-and-systemscomputer-data-and-
systemshpmshpms-memos-archive/hpms-memos-wk-2-october-10-14.

Moreover, reporting is not limited to federal health care programs and 
the exchanges. For commercial plans, Departments of Treasury, HHS, and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Labor as well as OPM require PBMs to report:

     The 50 most frequently dispensed brand prescription drugs.
     The 50 costliest prescription drugs by total annual spending.
     The 50 prescription drugs with the greatest increase in 
expenditures from the previous year.
     Prescription drug rebates, fees, and payments by drug 
manufacturers in each therapeutic class of drugs, as well as for each 
of the 25 drugs that yielded the highest amount of rebates.
     The premium and out-of-pocket cost impact of prescription drug 
rebates, fees, and other payments. PBMs may report these data directly 
to the government or to their clients. The clients (plan sponsors, 
issuers, and the FEHB program carriers generally) are required to 
submit this information, along with some of their own data regarding 
premiums, aggregated at the state/market level, rather than separately 
for each plan.

    The Departments must biannually issue a report based on the data,

Conclusion

The PBM industry is the only stakeholder in the chain dedicated to 
seeking lower costs. PBMs do that work for the employer, union, retiree 
plan, health plan, and government entities who hire them, and, most 
importantly, for the patients for whom those health plan sponsors 
provide coverage. As pharmacy benefit experts, PBMs generate tremendous 
value, estimated at $145 billion annually for society,\31\ and save 
payers and patients an average of $1,040 per person per year.\32\ For 
many years, evidence has also shown a return of 10:1 on investments in 
PBM services for their private sector and government partners.\33\ As a 
result, PBMs will lower the cost of health care by $1 trillion this 
year alone.\34\

PBMs are able to negotiate for lower drug costs when they can bring 
competition between pharmaceutical manufacturers and between pharmacies 
to bear. PBMs lower prescription drug costs by using these negotiations 
to deliver discounts and rebates, promoting the use of generic 
medications, encouraging better pharmacy quality, and offering things 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
like home delivery for those on chronic medications.

Through their work, PBMs are contributing to lower costs for health 
coverage, lower costs for medications, and better and more affordable 
access for patients, which means more people getting the medications 
they need to lead healthier lives.

PCMA would be happy to provide additional information to the Committee 
on the value pharmacy benefit companies bring to patients, health plan 
sponsors, and society, and looks forward to working collaboratively 
with Congress and other stakeholders to build on the existing private 
market framework to make medications more affordable and accessible for 
patients.

Introduction

The Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin appreciates the opportunity to submit 
a statement for the record for the United States Senate Committee on 
Finance on ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply 
Chain: Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.''

With ``One Voice, One Vision'' on January 1, 1998, Wisconsin 
successfully united all pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and student 
pharmacists within one advocating organization. The Pharmacy Society of 
Wisconsin has championed the cause of helping pharmacists deliver the 
best care for their patients. Today, with more than 4,000 members 
statewide, PSW is the professional organization pharmacists, pharmacy 
technicians, and student pharmacists join to further their careers, 
advance the standing of pharmacists and improve the care of patients in 
Wisconsin.

At the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin, we collaborate with healthcare 
teams to improve medication use and the health of Wisconsinites and 
transform pharmacy practice. We provide a unified voice, resources, and 
leadership to advance the pharmacy profession and improve the quality 
of medication use in Wisconsin.

Great Concern about Pharmacy Benefit Manager Tactics

We are extremely concerned about pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) tactics 
that significantly negatively affect patients, communities, taxpayers, 
employers, and pharmacies. PBMs are hired by insurance plans and others 
to negotiate lower drug prices. Unfortunately, they manipulate the 
system and keep billions in profits while:

     Forcing patients and others to pay more for their medicines;
     Limiting patients' ability to choose their pharmacist;
     Restricting access to medicines that doctors and other 
prescribers determine to be right for the patient; and
     Jeopardizing pharmacies' viability--which obviously harms the 
pharmacy and also the patients and communities that rely on them.

The dominance of PBMs is significant. Three PBMs control 80 percent of 
the prescription drug market. These are the practical effects of PBM 
tactics:

     Over-payments: The University of Southern California Leonard D. 
Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics found that Medicare 
Part D standalone plans paid $2.6 billion more in one year for 184 
common generic medications compared with prices for the same drugs 
available to cash-paying customers of one retailer.

     Restricting medications: Drug Channels analysis found that from 
2014 to 2022, 1,357 medications were excluded from at least one PBM 
formulary for at least one year. The exclusions of drugs from these 
lists have escalated since starting in 2012.

     Putting the squeeze on pharmacies: The Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services found that direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) 
fees charged by PBMs and payers to pharmacies have exploded by 107,400% 
over the last decade.

Countless Wisconsin pharmacists reach out to us weekly to share the 
squeeze unfair PBM practices are putting on their ability to serve 
their patients. We are seeing pharmacies close across the state, often 
in rural or medically underserved areas, because they are no longer 
financially viable, leaving patients without access to timely and 
necessary medications.

We want to take this opportunity to define ``PBM reform.'' This is 
important to maximize the effectiveness of Congress' work in this area 
for patients and roll back the current jeopardy posed by PBMs to 
pharmacies. For this purpose, we call to your attention the Principles 
of PBM Reform advocated by the National Association of Chain Drug 
Stores:

     Stop explosive retroactive fees. Stop PBMs and payers from using 
``DIR fees'' and other tactics to grab back the payments made and owed 
to pharmacies--often many months after the fact and often resulting in 
below-cost pharmacy reimbursement.
     Stop below-cost reimbursement. Adopt a reimbursement rate floor 
that prevents PBMs and payers from reimbursing pharmacies below the 
true cost of acquiring and dispensing prescription drugs.
     Stop gaming of performance measures. Standardize performance 
measures to help improve patient outcomes and reduce costs--rather than 
allowing PBMs and payers to play ``gotcha'' with pharmacies using 
arbitrary measures and exorbitant fees.
     Stop ``specialty definitions'' from steering patients from their 
pharmacy. Prevent PBMs and payers from defining ``specialty drugs'' in 
ways that steer patients with rare or complex diseases away from the 
preferred pharmacy of their choice and toward another pharmacy--
including those owned by the PBMs and payers.
     Stop mandatory mail-order. Prohibit PBMs and payers from forcing 
patients to use mail-order pharmacies--including those owned by the 
PBMs and payers--and prohibit them from imposing penalties on patients 
for choosing a convenient and trusted pharmacy in their neighborhood.
     Stop limited networks. Require PBMs and payers to include in 
their networks all pharmacies willing to accept terms and conditions 
established by the PBM.
     Stop overwhelming audits. Bring efficiency, transparency, and 
standardization to the processes by which PBMs audit pharmacies without 
sacrificing continuity of care.
     Stop the undercutting of PBM reform laws. Prioritize the 
implementation, enforcement, and oversight of PBM reform laws--to 
maximize results for patients and fairness for pharmacies and other 
stakeholders and to ensure laws are not undermined by the inaction of 
PBMs or of government.

Conclusion

In closing, we want to put to rest one of the myths perpetuated by 
PBMs. Shockingly, they have staved off reform efforts by alleging that 
premiums will increase. This is nothing short of a scare tactic and one 
that cannot be allowed to be used so flippantly and without 
substantiation. PBM reform will reduce prescription drug costs by 
cracking down on middlemen's manipulation. It does not follow logically 
that reductions in prescription drug costs will increase premiums. It 
is time to address the manipulative business practices of PBMs and end 
the harmful effects of their tactics.

The Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin thanks the Committee for the 
opportunity to provide our perspective on PBM reform. For questions or 
further discussion, please contact Danielle Womack, Vice President of 
Public Affairs, at dwomack@pswi.org or 608-827-9200.

     Statement of James Lilly, Vice President of Government Affairs

Introduction

SpartanNash Company greatly appreciates the opportunity to submit a 
statement for the record for the United States Senate Committee on 
Finance regarding ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug 
Supply Chain: Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.''

SpartanNash is a food solutions company that delivers the ingredients 
for a better life through customer-focused innovation. We operate two 
complementary business segments--food wholesale and grocery retail. Our 
global supply chain network serves wholesale customers that include 
independent and chain grocers, national retail brands, e-commerce 
platforms, and U.S. military commissaries and exchanges in the United 
States and abroad. We distribute products for every aisle in the 
grocery store, from fresh produce to household goods to our OwnBrands, 
which include the Our Family portfolio of products. On the retail 
side, we operate 146 brick-and-mortar grocery stores, in addition to 
dozens of pharmacies and fuel centers.

Our vast distribution network plays an essential role in the nation's 
food supply chain, ensuring that communities of all sizes--from densely 
populated cities to remote rural areas--have access to food, 
medications, and the household supplies they need. As it relates to 
patient access, our organization operates 84 corporately owned 
pharmacies and supports 145 affiliate pharmacies that are independently 
owned and operated. Combined, our corporate and affiliated pharmacies 
fill tens of thousands of prescriptions each week.

Sounding the Alarm on Pharmacy Benefit Manager Practices

Like many other organizations that provide care to patients in a 
pharmacy setting, we are deeply concerned about pharmacy benefit 
manager (PBM) practices that have significant negative effects on 
patients, communities, taxpayers, employers, and pharmacies. While PBMs 
may have originally been created with good intentions to reduce costs 
by negotiating lower drug prices, that is not the way they operate 
anymore. PBMs are a significant factor in ever increasing drug pricing. 
They do little more than manipulate the system and keep billions in 
profits while:

     Making patients pay more for their medicines;
     Restricting patients' ability to choose their Pharmacy;
     Limiting access to medicines that doctors and other prescribers 
determine to be right for the patient; and
     Jeopardizing pharmacies' ability to remain in business--which 
obviously harms the pharmacy and also the patients and communities that 
rely on them.

Policymakers should be concerned that three PBMs control 80 percent of 
the prescription drug market, and their impact is extraordinary. These 
are three practical effects of PBM tactics:

     Over-payments: The University of Southern California Leonard D. 
Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics found that Medicare 
Part D standalone plans paid $2.6 billion more in one year for 184 
common generic medications compared with prices for the same drugs 
available to cash-paying customers of one retailer.\1\

also known as DIR fees, charged by PBMs and payers to pharmacies have

Along with filling prescriptions, our pharmacists provide medication 
counseling for thousands of patients each day. We strive to provide the 
best medical outcome possible for each patient's condition. Our 
pharmacists are available nights and weekends to provide these 
services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our pharmacies expanded 
prescription home delivery to assist our patients who needed to avoid 
contact with others. Our pharmacists also administered thousands of 
COVID immunizations while working on the front lines during this 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
pandemic.

We need to consider what a future pandemic could look like without this 
level of pharmacy access because today, many pharmacies are at risk of 
closing as a result of the anti-competitive behavior of PBMs. PBMs have 
reached a size and scale that gives them tremendous, unparalleled 
influence in determining the price and access to prescription drugs for 
patients.

Allow me to paint a more detailed picture. As you know, DIR Fees are 
relatively new in our industry. In 2016, the DIR Fees SpartanNash was 
charged were significant--over $7,048 per pharmacy, and over $578,000 
in total. Keep in mind that these were brand new fees that started 
being assessed only a few years earlier. Fast forward to 2021, and we 
were charged over $127,000 per pharmacy or $10.7 million in total. That 
is a dramatic increase in just six years. It would be unthinkable if 
the price of a hamburger went up from $10 to $180 using the same ratio, 
in a matter of just five years.

The rate of increase with these astronomical fees undoubtedly 
contributed to SpartanNash closing its pharmacy operations in West 
Branch, Coldwater and Grand Rapids, Michigan, as well as in Somerset, 
Wisconsin. Other independent pharmacy owners in our buying group have 
closed 17 pharmacies in Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Ohio. 
Unfortunately, many of these pharmacies are located in more rural areas 
where patients do not have as many options for pharmaceutical care. 
This is unfortunate because in many cases, the pharmacist is the 
closest clinician and the one the patient interacts with most 
frequently for health maintenance. SpartanNash and many of the 
independent pharmacies in our buying group have voiced concerns about 
their viability if DIR fees and the unfair and anticompetitive 
practices continue unchecked.

Recently, we were forced to reduce hours in our stores because of cost 
pressure driven largely by the increase in DIR fees. Most pharmacy 
locations now close at 7 p.m., and we no longer operate 24-hour 
pharmacy locations. At our company, we know access to a pharmacist 
improves medical outcomes for patients, so we do not make these 
decisions lightly. But, in the absence of congressional intervention 
and relief, we and others in the industry may be forced to make further 
reductions in schedules or locations.

So, what can be done? Congress can be especially effective in 
correcting this market failure. The National Association of Chain Drug 
Stores has identified the following actions that can be undertaken by 
Congress:

     Stop explosive retroactive fees. Stop PBMs and payers from using 
``DIR fees'' and other tactics to grab back the payments made and owed 
to pharmacies--often many months after the fact and often resulting in 
below-cost pharmacy reimbursement.
     Stop below-cost reimbursement. Adopt a reimbursement rate floor 
that prevents PBMs and payers from reimbursing pharmacies below the 
true cost of acquiring and dispensing prescription drugs.
     Stop gaming of performance measures. Standardize performance 
measures to help improve patient outcomes and reduce costs--rather than 
allowing PBMs and payers to play ``gotcha'' with pharmacies using 
exorbitant fees and arbitrary measures that continuously change like a 
moving target.
     Stop ``specialty definitions'' from steering patients from their 
pharmacy. Prevent PBMs and payers from defining ``specialty drugs'' in 
ways that steer patients with rare or complex diseases away from their 
preferred pharmacy and toward another pharmacy--including those owned 
by the PBMs and payers.
     Stop mandatory mail-order. Prohibit PBMs and payers from forcing 
patients to use mail-order pharmacies--including those owned by the 
PBMs and payers--and prohibit them from imposing penalties on patients 
for choosing a convenient and trusted pharmacy in their neighborhood.
     Stop limited networks. Require PBMs and payers to include in 
their networks all pharmacies willing to accept terms and conditions 
established by the PBM.
     Stop overwhelming audits. Bring efficiency, transparency, and 
standardization to the processes by which PBMs audit pharmacies without 
sacrificing continuity of care.
     Stop the undercutting of PBM reform laws. Prioritize the 
implementation, enforcement, and oversight of PBM reform laws--to 
maximize results for patients and fairness for pharmacies and other 
stakeholders, and to ensure laws are not undermined by inaction of PBMs 
or of government.

Conclusion

PBMs have been able to fight off reform for many years, but their time 
of manipulating this market can come to an end if Congress acts on the 
reforms proposed by NACDS and other like-minded associations. 
Conversely, if nothing is done, more pharmacies will be forced to close 
their doors or reduce hours, and fewer patients will be able to access 
the healthcare they need in their communities.

On behalf of SpartanNash, we thank the Committee for the opportunity to 
provide our perspective on PBM reform. For questions or further

Committee on Finance
219 Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.
Washington, DC 20510-6200

Dear Committee on Finance,

Specialty Care Rx is a specialty pharmacy that takes great pride in 
servicing our patients with integrity and passion. It is getting more 
difficult to service our patients because of closed networks, low 
reimbursement rates, steerage of patients to Pharmacy Benefit Manger 
(PBM) and Insurance Company owned Specialty Pharmacies and increasing 
costs due to hidden Direct and Indirect Remuneration (DIR) fees.

As time goes on smaller insurance companies are being absorbed by 
larger players in the medical insurance industry such as United 
Healthcare and Aetna. These insurance companies own PBM, Specialty 
Pharmacy, and manufacture rebate companies. To serve our communities, 
we must join their networks and most of the time the networks are 
closed because they have their own Specialty Pharmacy and do not allow 
choice for their membership. When we are accepted into the network we 
are forced to accept low reimbursement rates which can be anywhere 
between AWP-30%-50% and we are unable to accept the patient because of 
the low rates or we are told that the patient must use PBM or Insurance 
Company owned Specialty Pharmacies, such as Optum Rx, CVS Specialty and 
Accredo. So, even though we are contracted we are still not able to 
service the patient. We can onboard our patient quicker and provide 
premier service, but we are prevented from doing so at the plan level 
to keep profit under the insurance company's umbrella.

DIR fees are based on arbitrary performance standards having a lasting 
negative impact on the overall profitability of the pharmacy. With very 
low reimbursement rates oftentimes the DIR fees absorb the profit, and 
the drug cost is not covered leaving the pharmacy to cover the cost. 
DIR fees are not disclosed upfront and can take months to process 
causing ``claw backs'' taken as a percentage of total cost of 
prescriptions. The percentage can be anywhere from 4%-20%. We are 
unable to predict the performance standards and the PBM will not 
explain how the performance based DIR fee is calculated. As a result, 
during the Intake process it appears the account is profitable when in 
fact it is not, and we are having to triage patients out months 
sometimes a year later. This is not only causing hardship on the 
pharmacy, but it also causes a burden on the patient, because they must 
start the intake process over with the Insurance company or the PBM's 
owned Specialty Pharmacy.

The drugs we are delivering to our community are for people with true 
illness. They should have the option of choice and should be able to 
select the best provider for their care and the care of their loved 
ones. Our pharmacy delivers more than just a drug on the doorstep. We 
have access to nursing, dieticians, financial counselors, and customer 
care individuals that not only walk the patient through their treatment 
plan but get them back to doing the things they enjoy in life. Thank 
you for taking the time to review the issues at hand in hopes to stop 
the PBM abuse not only to their membership but to independent 
pharmacies across our country.

Sincerely,

Denise Stechman

Introduction

Wegmans Food markets, Inc. appreciates the opportunity to submit a 
statement for the record for the United States Senate Committee on 
Finance on ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply 
Chain: Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.''

Headquartered in Rochester, NY, we are a regional chain that operates 
97 pharmacies in six states that provides Patient care by providing 
prescription fulfillment, immunization services, counseling, and other 
critical patient services.

Finance on ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Prescription Drug Supply 
Chain: Impact on Patients and Taxpayers.''

The Wyoming Pharmacy Association (WPhA), founded in 1915, is the only 
statewide professional organization representing the interests of 
licensed pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy students across 
all practice settings. Our mission to: Advocating, educating, and 
connecting to improve the health of Wyoming citizens through the 
advancement of pharmacy. Our vision is: Pharmacists and technicians in 
Wyoming will be recognized as caring and competent providers, as part 
of the greater health care team, who improve the use of medications, 
assure the safety of drug therapy, and enhance health-related quality 
of life.

Great Concern about Pharmacy Benefit Manager Tactics

We are extremely concerned about pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) tactics 
that have significant negative effects on patients, communities, 
taxpayers, employers, and pharmacies. PBMs are hired by insurance plans 
and others to negotiate lower drug prices. Unfortunately, they 
manipulate the system and keep billions in profits while:

     Forcing patients and others to pay more for their medicines;
     Limiting patients' ability to choose their pharmacist;
     Restricting access to medicines that doctors and other 
prescribers determine to be right for the patient; and
     Jeopardizing pharmacies' viability--which obviously harms the 
pharmacy and also the patients and communities that rely on them.

The dominance of PBMs is significant. Three PBMs control 80 percent of 
the prescription drug market. These are the practical effects of PBM 
tactics:

     Over-payments: The University of Southern California Leonard D. 
Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics found that Medicare Part 
D standalone plans paid $2.6 billion more in one year for 184 common 
generic medications compared with prices for the same drugs available 
to cash-paying customers of one retailer.
     Restricting medications: Drug Channels analysis found that from 
2014 to 2022, 1,357 medications were excluded from at least one PBM 
formulary for at least one year. The exclusions of drugs from these 
lists have escalated since starting in 2012.
     Putting the squeeze on pharmacies: The Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services found that direct and indirect remuneration (DIR) 
fees charged by PBMs and payers to pharmacies have exploded by 107,400% 
over the last decade.

    We want to take this opportunity to define ``PBM reform.'' This is 
important to maximize the effectiveness of Congress' work in this area 
for patients, and to roll-back the current jeopardy posed by PBMs to 
pharmacies. For this purpose, we call to your attention the Principles 
of PBM Reform advocated by the National Association of Chain Drug 
Stores:

     Stop explosive retroactive fees. Stop PBMs and payers from using 
``DIR fees'' and other tactics to grab back the payments made and owed 
to pharmacies--often many months after the fact and often resulting in 
below-cost pharmacy reimbursement.
     Stop below-cost reimbursement. Adopt a reimbursement rate floor 
that prevents PBMs and payers from reimbursing pharmacies below the 
true cost of acquiring and dispensing prescription drugs.
     Stop gaming of performance measures. Standardize performance 
measures to help improve patient outcomes and reduce costs--rather than 
allowing PBMs and payers to play ``gotcha'' with pharmacies using 
arbitrary measures and exorbitant fees.
     Stop ``specialty definitions'' from steering patients from their 
pharmacy. Prevent PBMs and payers from defining ``specialty drugs'' in 
ways that steer patients with rare or complex diseases away from their 
preferred pharmacy of their choice and toward another pharmacy--
including those owned by the PBMs and payers.
     Stop mandatory mail-order. Prohibit PBMs and payers from forcing 
patients to use mail-order pharmacies--including those owned by the 
PBMs and payers--and prohibit them from imposing penalties on patients 
for choosing a convenient and trusted pharmacy in their neighborhood.
     Stop limited networks. Require PBMs and payers to include in 
their networks all pharmacies willing to accept terms and conditions 
established by the PBM.
     Stop overwhelming audits. Bring efficiency, transparency, and 
standardization to the processes by which PBMs audit pharmacies without 
sacrificing continuity of care.
     Stop the undercutting of PBM reform laws. Prioritize the 
implementation, enforcement, and oversight of PBM reform laws--to 
maximize results for patients and fairness for pharmacies and other 
stakeholders, and to ensure laws are not undermined by inaction of PBMs 
or of government.

Conclusion

In closing, we want to put to rest one of the myths perpetuated by 
PBMs. It is shocking that they have been able to stave off reform 
efforts by alleging that premiums will increase. This is nothing short 
of a scare tactic, and one that cannot be allowed to be used so 
flippantly and without substantiation. PBM reform will reduce 
prescription drug costs by cracking down on middlemen's manipulation. 
It does not follow logically that reductions in prescription drug costs 
will result in increased premiums. It is time to address the 
manipulative business practices of PBMs, as well as to end the negative 
effects of their tactics.

Wyoming Pharmacy Association thanks the Committee for the opportunity 
to provide our perspective on PBM reform. For questions or further 
discussion, please contact Matt Meyer, WPhA President, at 
info@wypha.org or (307) 257-5197.
