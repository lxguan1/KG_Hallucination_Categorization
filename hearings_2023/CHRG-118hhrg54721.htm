                    DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH TAIWAN

                              ----------                              

                          House of Representatives,
                               Committee on Armed Services,
                       Washington, DC, Tuesday, September 19, 2023.
    The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:36 a.m., in room 
2118, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Mike Rogers (chairman 
of the committee) presiding.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE ROGERS, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
         ALABAMA, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES

    The Chairman. The committee will come to order.
    Today we'll continue our examination of the threats posed 
by the Chinese Communist Party. Specifically, we will review 
China's growing hostility toward Taiwan, why that should 
concern the U.S., and how we should respond.
    I want to thank our witnesses for being here and for their 
service to our Nation. Over the last year, President Xi has 
sought to intimidate and coerce Taiwan. He has ordered his navy 
to surround the island with warships.
    He has repeatedly launched fighters and bombers across the 
centerline and he's personally overseen amphibious assault 
exercises. I'm very concerned these escalatory military 
exercises are a pretense for an invasion.
    A couple of years ago, Admiral Davidson testified before 
our committee that Xi would order an invasion of Taiwan before 
2027. Since then, our committee has spoken with several other 
Pentagon and State Department leaders who have reinforced that 
timeline.
    The ranking member and I recently traveled to Taiwan to 
assess the situation firsthand. We met with President Tsai. We 
discussed the threats they face and the actions her government 
is taking to improve the defenses.
    I was impressed with the progress they're making, and I was 
pleased to hear they are working on new asymmetric capabilities 
that are key to deterring China.
    Much of Taiwan's progress is the result of military 
training and weapons they receive from the United States. Last 
year's NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act] further 
strengthened our defense partnership.
    It authorized $1 billion annually in Presidential drawdown 
authority for Taiwan, $2 billion annually in Foreign Military 
Financing loans, and $100 million to begin stockpiling U.S. 
equipment on the island.
    But more needs to be done. To date, the administration has 
only announced $345 million in drawdown authority. They have 
not budgeted, and Congress has not appropriated, the funding 
necessary to fully carry out the authorities provided in last 
year's NDAA.
    And Foreign Military Sales, the program we have primarily 
relied on to provide military aid to Taiwan, is clearly broken. 
Taiwan is waiting on the delivery of over $18 billion in FMS 
aid. Some of it dates back to 2016 and that's unacceptable.
    I'm interested in hearing from our witnesses on ways to 
reform FMS program. For 40 years our relationship with Taiwan 
and--China and Taiwan has been defined by the policy of 
strategic ambiguity. To date, the policy has been successful in 
putting off an invasion.
    But with a rapidly modernizing Chinese military and an 
increasingly despotic leader, I understand the arguments that 
we may need to revisit that policy. It doesn't help that 
President Biden is having trouble articulating a consistent 
policy toward Taiwan or what would happen if Xi were to invade.
    But whatever the policy is today, the use of military force 
has been and will remain our most effective deterrent against 
invasion. But for that deterrent to be credible our military 
must be fully prepared for this conflict. I'm very concerned 
that we're not there yet.
    It was clear from our recent trip that we need to invest 
much more in long-range fires, distributed logistics, and 
missile defense. We need to grow our Navy and improve our 
capabilities in space and cyberspace.
    We also need to reinforce capabilities of our allies in the 
region. If a Chinese invasion cannot be deterred it will be 
catastrophic for Taiwan and the United States.
    A successful invasion will cut off vital trade routes and 
disrupt the supply of critical semiconductors and other 
technologies. It will sink our economy, endanger our allies, 
and severely undermine our national security.
    Finally, everyone should remember that Taiwan is free and 
democratic. The people of Taiwan have a right to self-
determination. They shouldn't have to live under the constant 
threat of an invasion by a communist autocracy.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on ways we can 
work together to strengthen Taiwan's defenses and improve our 
own capabilities in the Indo-Pacific.
    And with that, I yield to my friend, the ranking member, 
for any comments he may have.

STATEMENT OF HON. ADAM SMITH, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM WASHINGTON, 
          RANKING MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES

    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for 
having this hearing and also for leading the trip to Asia we 
did a couple of months ago. It was incredibly informative about 
this challenge and other challenges in the region.
    And the policy for the U.S. has always been clear and 
remains clear. We want to deter an armed conflict in Asia. 
There are a number of different flashpoints that are 
challenging in that regard but none bigger than Taiwan, which 
is why we have adopted the policy that we have had in place for 
a number of decades.
    And I will disagree with the Chair. I think that policy 
remains very clear. It is a ``One China'' policy but crucially 
China will not be reunified by force and the main challenge 
that we have with this policy right now is that China has been 
intimating that they will do it by force.
    So we have a clear policy to deter that, and it is worth 
noting that we have certainly done a lot more in the last 2 
years to deter China in terms of building up Taiwan's defense 
forces and, crucially, building partnerships throughout the 
region to deter China than was done in the previous 4 years 
without any question.
    You look at the partnerships that have been built, the 
number of countries that have spoken up against China 
reunifying Taiwan by force. We are building a coalition to put 
that policy in place.
    Now, the one aspect of the policy--it's interesting to call 
a policy of strategic ambiguity unclear. That's kind of the 
point. You know, we don't wish to explicitly say that, you 
know, we're going to go to war with China over Taiwan. That 
sort of violates the ``One China'' policy.
    What we carved out in that policy and what we maintain is 
the right to make Taiwan strong enough to deter forcibly being 
reunified. That is the purpose of strategic ambiguity and I 
think it is really important.
    I think it's also important to recognize that one of the 
biggest motivators that would push China to act by force is any 
sort of movement towards clear, unambiguous Taiwanese 
independence.
    I think everybody--right, left, center, all over the 
spectrum--recognizes that is the red line of all red lines for 
China. So we have to move forward with the policy we have, 
arming Taiwan, building partnerships to deter, while not taking 
that overly aggressive stance and, frankly, removing that 
ambiguity.
    That is what is incredibly dangerous, going forward. So we 
need to maintain that policy. I believe the administration has 
clearly articulated that and, more importantly, articulation 
notwithstanding, they've built the partnerships and alliances 
specifically in Taiwan and the efforts to work with the 
Taiwanese government to make sure that they are strong enough 
to deter that invasion, that they have support from their 
allies and partners throughout the region.
    Now, there are a number of questions--I think the chairman 
raised some of them--that are really important. Number one is 
the capability question--and I'll close here--and we have 
certainly seen that in Ukraine.
    We have done an amazing job of pulling together a 
partnership and arming Ukraine and putting them in a position 
to be as successful as they've been when combined with their 
unbelievable courage and willingness to fight.
    But we need to maintain those supplies. We need to maintain 
those supplies of weapons, and I think that's what most of us 
worry the most about.
    Are we going to be able to have those capabilities, whether 
it's flaws in the Foreign Military Sales or Foreign Military 
Financing programs or whether it's the simple production 
capacity, that we're most curious how we meet that.
    You know, just closing this point on a positive note, but 
the partnerships that we have built, you know, it's not just 
going to be the United States of America that provides these 
munitions. We have built partnerships across Europe, across 
Asia, across the world. Fifty-three nations are contributing to 
the defense of Ukraine. A similar number of nations, or 
somewhere in the neighborhood at least, are working with us on 
the Taiwan issue.
    So the strength in numbers is really coming to bear. But I 
do look forward to hearing more about how we can meet those 
production challenges to be in a position to deter China in 
Asia.
    And I guess--sorry, one final point. It's not just Taiwan. 
China claims the sovereign territory of at least a half dozen 
other countries. If they are able to by force retake Taiwan, 
they have their eyes on a number of other places.
    There is territory in Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, 
Indonesia, India--I think someone told me even Russia--that 
China claims that should be part of theirs.
    If they can bully their way into Taiwan it is not the last 
place that they're going to try to bully their way into, which 
is why it is so important that we have an adequate deterrence.
    With that, I look forward to the testimony and I yield 
back.
    The Chairman. I thank the ranking member for those very 
thoughtful points.
    I'd now like to introduce our witnesses: Dr. Ely Ratner, 
the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security 
Affairs; Ms. Mira Resnick is the Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
State for Regional Security; and Major General Joseph McGee is 
the Vice Director of Strategy, Plans, and Policy for the Joint 
Staff.
    I welcome all of our witnesses. Thank you for taking the 
time to be here and for your time and preparation for this 
hearing. It's very important to us.
    We will start with Dr. Ratner. The floor is yours.

 STATEMENT OF HON. ELY RATNER, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 
    FOR INDO-PACIFIC SECURITY AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

    Dr. Ratner. Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Smith, and 
distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to be here today to discuss how the Department of 
Defense is strengthening deterrence across the Taiwan Strait.
    At the outset of today's hearing let me be absolutely 
clear. The Department remains committed to the well-established 
``One China'' policy of the United States guided by the Taiwan 
Relations Act, the Three Communiques, and the Six Assurances.
    It is this longstanding policy that has helped to preserve 
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait for more than four 
decades and it is why this administration opposes any 
unilateral changes to the status quo.
    At the same time, we are clear-eyed that the PRC [People's 
Republic of China] is waging a campaign of military, 
diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan. China's 
leaders have yet to renounce the use of military force.
    Will they increasingly turned to the PLA [People's 
Liberation Army] as an instrument of coercion in support of 
their revisionist aims, conducting more dangerous activities in 
and around the Taiwan Strait?
    It is in part for these reasons that the Department's 2022 
National Defense Strategy identified the PRC as our top pacing 
challenge and it is also why we are laser focused on meeting 
our commitments consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, 
providing Taiwan with self-defense capabilities as well as 
maintaining our own capacity to resist any use of force that 
jeopardizes the security of the people on Taiwan.
    Mr. Chairman, as Secretary Austin has previously warned and 
as you did just now, and I'm quoting directly here, ``conflict 
in the Taiwan Strait would be devastating.''
    Taiwan is a thriving democracy that plays a vital role in 
the world economy with high-technology exports like 
semiconductors. The strait itself is an international waterway 
where high-seas freedoms of navigation and overflight are 
guaranteed under international law and absolutely essential for 
global commerce and prosperity.
    Military aggression across the strait, whether in the form 
of an outright invasion, a blockade, or other means, would risk 
human life and global prosperity unimaginable in this century.
    As I told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2021, 
Taiwan is located at a critical node within the first island 
chain in the Indo-Pacific and its security is critical to the 
region's security.
    This is why we have seen a growing number of states in the 
Indo-Pacific and throughout the international community raise 
their voices about why peace and stability in and around the 
Taiwan Strait matters so much to them. Maintaining peace, 
stability, and deterrence across the Taiwan Strait is not just 
a U.S. interest or an interest of the people on Taiwan.
    It is clearly a matter of international concern. By 
attempting to change the status quo the PRC would put at risk 
the peace that has brought historic prosperity to the Indo-
Pacific and the world for decades.
    Importantly, we do not believe that conflict is imminent or 
inevitable, because deterrence across the strait today is real 
and strong and we are doing more than ever to keep it that way.
    Our budget request shows that the Department is focused on 
delivering cutting-edge capabilities for our military right now 
while investing in the capabilities we need to maintain 
deterrence well into the future.
    We are also making historic advances in our alliances and 
partnerships, further reinforcing one of America's greatest 
strategic advantages and the facts speak for themselves.
    Over the past year we have announced transformative 
achievements with Japan, Australia, and the Philippines, among 
others, that will make our force posture across the Indo-
Pacific increasingly distributed, mobile, resilient, and 
lethal.
    Meanwhile, we are drawing upon all available tools to meet 
our commitments to provide for Taiwan's self-defense. 
Partnering with the State Department, we're accelerating FMS 
cases and cutting red tape.
    We have also put to good use the authorities Congress has 
provided us including by employing both Presidential drawdown 
authority and Foreign Military Financing for Taiwan for the 
first time ever this year.
    Looking ahead, we know that funding to support these 
authorities would advance our bipartisan whole-of-government 
commitment to strengthening Taiwan's self-defense.
    Mr. Chairman, we are confident that our approach is 
yielding results. I'll conclude here by underscoring that the 
continued maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan 
Strait will require heightened urgency, attention, and 
resources in the critical year ahead--years ahead.
    The Department is seeking the partnership of this committee 
and the entire Congress to keep delivering. The American 
people, the people on Taiwan, and people across the rest of the 
Indo-Pacific region and around the world deserve nothing less 
than the peace, stability, and deterrence we seek to 
strengthen.
    Thank you for your time and attention and I look forward to 
your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Ratner can be found in the 
Appendix on page 53.]
    The Chairman. Thank you, Dr. Ratner.
    Ms. Resnick, you're recognized.

STATEMENT OF MIRA RESNICK, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE 
           FOR REGIONAL SECURITY, DEPARTMENT OF STATE

    Ms. Resnick. Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Smith, 
distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify on U.S. security cooperation with Taiwan 
and for your strong bipartisan efforts to maintain peace and 
security in the Taiwan Strait.
    I'm grateful for the opportunity to appear here alongside 
Dr. Ratner and Major General McGee. Before discussing the 
various ways we have built up security cooperation with Taiwan 
let me start by addressing why Taiwan matters.
    Geographically Taiwan's shipping lanes are the arteries of 
global commerce with half of the world's trade going through 
the Taiwan Strait every year.
    Mr. Chairman, as you mentioned, any disruption would be 
acutely felt around the world----
    The Chairman. Ms. Resnick, would you pull the microphone a 
little bit closer, please?
    Ms. Resnick. Sure. Let me know if that works.
    The Chairman. There you go.
    Ms. Resnick. Any disruption would be acutely felt around 
the world, threatening more than 180,000 American jobs and 
snarling critical supply chains from Alabama to Washington and 
beyond.
    Economically, Taiwan's cutting-edge semiconductors are the 
beating heart of the world's economy, and they are used in 
everything from vehicles to iPhones to computers to pacemakers. 
These advanced chips are also necessary for American defense--
our next-generation fighter jets, satellite, radars, and 
missile defenses.
    Moreover, Taiwan is a leading democracy. Taiwan's movement 
from autocracy to a vibrant democratic society is an 
inspiration for us all.
    One of the keys to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait 
is credible deterrence. Consistent with our longstanding policy 
we are laser focused on strengthening our cooperation to 
bolster Taiwan's defense and deterrence capabilities in the 
months and years ahead. And while our policy toward the PRC has 
not changed, PRC pressure against Taiwan has increased and, 
therefore, Taiwan's capabilities must also increase to match 
the threat.
    Our commitment to Taiwan is rock solid and contributes to 
peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the 
broader region.
    As Dr. Ratner mentioned, the National Defense Strategy 
identifies the PRC as our pacing challenge and our cooperation 
with Taiwan to support its asymmetric defense strategy is front 
and center for deterring PRC aggression.
    Thanks to the steadfast and bipartisan support of Congress 
we have made significant progress strengthening our security 
cooperation with Taiwan. We are expediting arms sales to Taiwan 
to the greatest extent possible in line with our longstanding 
policy of maintaining peace and stability across the Strait.
    We are prioritizing Taiwan's defense capabilities with 
unprecedented speed and urgency. Last year, we authorized the 
highest single year number of Foreign Military Sales 
notifications to Taiwan in at least 30 years.
    In this administration we have authorized almost $6 billion 
in Taiwan arm sales. With thanks to Congress for the new 
Presidential drawdown authority for Taiwan, the Secretary of 
State recently directed the transfer of defense articles from 
DOD [Department of Defense] stocks to Taiwan.
    We also recently notified Congress of our first-ever 
provision of Foreign Military Financing to Taiwan. This funding 
will prioritize capabilities that Taiwan needs now while 
supplementing Taiwan's own defense budget, which has nearly 
doubled in the past 7 years.
    In addition, for the first time we have identified and 
notified Congress that Taiwan is eligible to receive excess 
defense articles as grant assistance not only for purchase. 
This provides another mechanism to support Taiwan's self-
defense capabilities.
    And the administration is taking a hard look at the global 
Foreign Military Sales system to make it as lean and efficient 
as possible, learning the lessons from Ukraine about the 
changes that we have made in order to speed transfers to Taiwan 
and to other global partners.
    While we have taken several steps forward, we have more 
work to do. We need to expand America's industrial capacity, 
invest in our partnership through additional security 
assistance and authorities, and make it clear to the world that 
we will stand on the side of democracy and a free, open, 
resilient, and secure international order.
    Thank you and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Resnick can be found in the 
Appendix on page 61.]
    The Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Resnick.
    General McGee, you are recognized.

    STATEMENT OF MG JOSEPH P. McGEE, USA, VICE DIRECTOR FOR 
 STRATEGY, PLANS, AND POLICY, J-5, JOINT STAFF, DEPARTMENT OF 
                            DEFENSE

    General McGee. Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Smith, 
committee members, good morning. I appreciate this opportunity 
to update you on how our joint force supports the Department of 
Defense efforts to strengthen deterrence across the Taiwan 
Strait by delivering a forward leaning cutting-edge military 
integrating with regional allies and partners and supporting 
our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act.
    Our National Defense Strategy identifies the People's 
Republic of China as our pacing challenge, the only competitor 
capable of integrating all the elements of its national power 
to meet a sustained challenge to the rule-based international 
order.
    Over the last 2 years, we have seen a significant increase 
in the PLA's maritime and air activity as the PRC continues its 
pressure campaign against Taiwan and strives to increase its 
regional influence.
    Cross-strait peace and stability remains a fundamental U.S. 
national security interest in the Indo-Pacific. So the PRC's 
actions are destabilizing and increase the likelihood of 
miscalculation.
    However, conflict is neither imminent nor inevitable. U.S. 
deterrence backed by the most capable and credible fighting 
force in the world is real and strong today. Our forward-based 
joint forces demonstrate resolve, support allies and partners, 
and provide senior leaders with options during a contingency.
    However, fielding combat-ready forces throughout the Indo-
Pacific requires access, basing, and overflight arrangements. 
The Department is supporting U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's 
pursuit of permanent and rotational operating locations 
throughout the region to increase survivability in a contested 
environment, reduce risk, and sustain the joint force with 
distributed logistics.
    The funding provided by Congress in 2023 and the 
President's fiscal year 2024 budget request will enable the 
joint force to continue necessary planning and implementation 
of these efforts.
    Next, our network of allies and partners is the joint 
force's greatest asymmetric advantage. These alliances, 
multilateral arrangements, partnerships, and friendships are 
essential elements of this network and critical for providing 
regional security.
    Accordingly, the joint force fully supports the 
Department's efforts to grow the coalition of partners 
dedicated to preserving peace and stability throughout the 
Indo-Pacific region.
    We will continue to strengthen security cooperation, 
training, and campaigning with partners by building capacity, 
increasing interoperability, and enhancing shared security 
based on mutual values, trust, and respect.
    Lastly, the joint force supports the Department as it 
continues to uphold commitments consistent with the Taiwan 
Relations Act [TRA] including providing Taiwan with self-
defense capabilities commensurate with the PRC threat.
    The TRA has enabled peace, stability, and deterrence across 
the strait for over four decades. It also provides the 
foundation of bipartisan support for providing Taiwan with 
self-defense capabilities and maintaining the joint force's 
capacity to confront anything that jeopardizes Taiwan's 
security.
    The capabilities we provide are tailored to counter the 
military threat Taiwan faces and we believe they provide the 
best return on investment and deterrent value.
    Thank you for what this committee and this Congress have 
done and continue to do to provide oversight and resources to 
counter the PRC's increasingly coercive and aggressive 
behavior.
    I look forward to your questions and today's discussion.
    [The prepared statement of General McGee can be found in 
the Appendix on page 71.]
    The Chairman. Thank all of our witnesses. I recognize 
myself now for questions.
    Dr. Ratner, you heard Ms. Resnick describe why Taiwan is 
important generally. Why would you say Taiwan is important 
specifically to the U.S. national security?
    Dr. Ratner. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thought 
your opening statement did a terrific job of articulating that 
as well--as well as DAS [Deputy Assistant Secretary] Resnick 
and it's an important message.
    I would start that the national security of the United 
States matters in terms of Taiwan's role in the global economy.
    It is critical in terms of its own integration with the 
United States and with the global economy, and what we have 
heard is that conflict or crises or even disruptions of 
economic activity in and around Taiwan would be devastating 
from a broader--for the United States, for the people on 
Taiwan, but also for people around the world and I think that's 
a really important message that we need to be really clear 
about.
    In terms of broader U.S. national security interests, the 
National Security Strategy has described the PRC as the only 
country with the will and capability to refashion the world 
according to its authoritarian preferences.
    That's why the Department has described the PRC as the 
Department's top pacing challenge, and a hostile invasion of 
Taiwan, not only the devastation it would reap but what it 
would mean for the region, would be a big step forward in terms 
of the Beijing's efforts to try to advance that vision. That 
would have real implications for our own military, our 
alliances, and the future of international politics.
    The Chairman. Ms. Resnick, is there anything--well, 
specifically what should Congress do, if anything, that would 
deal with this FMS backlog that we have talked a lot about?
    Ms. Resnick. Thanks for your question, Congressman, and 
also the opportunity to clarify about what a backlog actually 
means.
    The $19 billion that you referenced is actually cases that 
have been approved by Congress, approved by the State 
Department, and have either gone through contracting, which can 
take a long time, or are waiting for industrial production.
    I would refer you to a chart that I included in my written 
testimony on page 7 which goes through all of the stakeholders 
that are involved in how a capability requirement becomes a 
weapon delivered.
    And there are complicated processes, no joke. However, what 
we have done at the State Department is look at the various 
efficiencies, the lessons learned from how we were able to 
speed transfers to Ukraine.
    What are those lessons learned? How can we apply them 
globally, including to Taiwan? We call it FMS 2023 and there 
are a number of recommendations--10 recommendations that we 
have put forward. I'll go over a couple of them today.
    The first one is focusing on exportability as part of the 
design phase. So it is of no use to our partners if the U.S. 
military is using equipment that our partners need but that 
that is not exportable to our partners.
    We need to be able to build exportability into the design 
phase so that we're not going back and reengineering at cost 
for our partners. If we are truly to be elevating our alliances 
and our partnerships we need to be able to do that with respect 
to our partners' procurement.
    I would also highlight this committee's important support 
for multiyear procurement to allow our industry some 
predictability when it comes to orders and then, lastly, an 
expanded commitment and expanded flexibility for Foreign 
Military Financing. Our FMF budget is 90 percent earmarked, 
which means we have almost no flexibility to respond in a 
contingency scenario.
    We need more flexibility within the FMF budget to be able 
to provide important investments for Taiwan and for other 
partners that need it.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. Okay. Thank you.
    The Chair recognizes the ranking member.
    Mr. Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Ratner, you mentioned this in your opening statement 
but can you speak a little bit more about the importance of 
strategic ambiguity and the fine line between making sure that 
we protect Taiwan while not pushing towards independence 
because of the impacts that that would have on President Xi and 
China's reaction?
    Dr. Ratner. Yes, absolutely, Ranking Member Smith. Thank 
you for that question.
    As I said, the administration is committed to our 
longstanding policy. Strategic ambiguity is part of that and 
has been part of our ability to maintain deterrence across the 
Taiwan Strait for decades.
    We believe that sustaining that policy is critically 
important. It allows us under the Taiwan Relations Act to 
fulfill the commitment we have to support Taiwan's self-defense 
while also maintaining our policy of not supporting Taiwan 
independence and not supporting unilateral changes to the 
status quo from either side.
    So we think that's a really important element and that 
changing that policy could drive Beijing to initiate military 
action even when it was not ready to do so.
    Mr. Smith. Because there's some very realistic 
nationalistic pressures in China. Granted, President Xi is 
driving this, but it would be a mistake to think that it's just 
him.
    Is that fair? The Chinese people--if it were to be 
perceived that we were pushing Taiwan towards independence or 
some sort of formal defense agreement, there would be enormous 
pressure in China, not--it wouldn't just come from President 
Xi. Am I right about that?
    Dr. Ratner. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Smith. Okay. And that's why it's important to maintain 
that this policy. It's what gives us the best shot at peace and 
that's what we're trying to achieve here is to not have a war 
in Asia and we can do that by maintaining a very sensible 
policy, which is reunification, sure; we're going to leave the 
specifics behind.
    And actually Taiwan and China have been working very 
closely together--had been working very closely together, you 
know, from about 2000 until about 2015 and it was working just 
fine.
    There's no reason for China to feel the need to forcibly 
reunify Taiwan. We need to make sure they're reminded of that.
    Ms. Resnick, on partnerships. Really important that it's 
not just the U.S. and Taiwan, that it is a global response, in 
part because it impacts President Xi's calculation for what 
costs there would be if he tried to do a military reunification 
with Taiwan.
    So talk to us a little bit more about what partnerships 
we're building, how the rest of the world is responding, and 
specifically the efforts the U.S. is making to strengthen those 
partnerships to protect Taiwan.
    Ms. Resnick. Thank you, Mr. Smith, for that question.
    What we have found is that Taiwan is able to offer to 
partners around the globe significant and sustainable benefits 
to the citizens of those countries.
    We work to grow those partnerships. We work to make sure 
that Taiwan is included in a number of--in a number of 
engagements.
    In the context of the global cooperation and training 
framework we work with Taiwan and many other partners to offer 
workshops when it comes to cybersecurity, when it comes to HADR 
[humanitarian assistance and disaster relief], to be able to 
show how Taiwan can be value added to those relationships.
    I'm happy to discuss in another environment some of the 
specific partnerships that we--that we work on. But suffice it 
to say that one of our lessons learned from Ukraine is the 
importance of allies and partnerships and building those allies 
and partnerships for reliance when it comes to scenarios--when 
it comes to, like, a worst-case scenario.
    Mr. Smith. Understood.
    The world has a very powerful interest in making sure that 
China does not invade Taiwan. The global economic disruptions 
would be enormous. So I think it's really smart of the 
administration to be using that and working on building 
partnerships.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this very 
important hearing. It's [inaudible] bipartisan support 
Republicans and Democrats for the people of Taiwan. With that 
in mind, my--and I appreciate the witnesses here, too--but my 
appreciation and gratitude for the independence of Taiwan is 
personal.
    My father served in the Flying Tigers, the 14th Air Force, 
in India and China during World War II. He served in Kunming, 
Chengdu, Xi'an, and he raised me to have a great affection for 
the people of China.
    Twenty years ago, I had the opportunity to visit in Beijing 
with President Jiang Zemin at the presidential compound. When I 
was introduced as a Member of Congress--it didn't really hurt 
my feelings, but he yawned. And then somebody said, hey, Joe's 
the son of a Flying Tiger, and so he put his arms up in the air 
and announced, ``The American military is revered in China.''
    At that time, there was such reverence for what America had 
done to liberate the country during World War II. But sadly, in 
the last 20 years the Chinese Communist Party [CCP] has 
murderously oppressed the people of China and increasingly the 
Chinese Communist Party threatens its neighbors with a map that 
was released by the government in Beijing in the last 2 weeks 
which indicates that they have territorial claims threatening 
India, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan, Philippines, and amazingly, 
Russia.
    And so the aggression that could occur we need to make 
every effort, I believe, to stop. And with that in mind, Ms. 
Resnick, for all of the arms sales to Taiwan approved by the 
Department of State during the Biden administration, it seems 
that everything continues to be delayed. We must expedite the 
security of Taiwan to prevent the CCP aggression against the 
people of Taiwan.
    We must learn from the lessons of war criminal Putin's 
murderous invasion of Ukraine and ensure that Taiwan is 
prepared against CCP aggression. Taiwan should be, I believe, a 
prickly pear to achieve peace through strength.
    With that in mind, what are the greatest challenges and 
delays associated with delivering arms to Taiwan and what are 
you doing to address these delays? What is the average length 
of time until systems to Taiwan are under contract?
    Ms. Resnick. Thanks so much, Congressman, for your 
question.
    To the greatest extent possible, we expedite arms sales to 
Taiwan through the State Department. Ninety-five percent of--
globally of arms sales go through the State Department in 48 
hours and that includes--that includes our foreign policy 
review. So that is 48 hours.
    For that 5 percent where there might be stickier issues we 
have embarked on this FMS 2023, which is our 10-point plan--our 
10 recommendations on how we can find efficiencies within our 
system.
    But I will say that the cases that you are referencing have 
already gone through the State Department. They've already gone 
through congressional review. These are cases that are waiting 
on industry for production and, by and large, the long pole in 
the tent is industrial production.
    That means that we need to work with industry to find 
efficiencies in their processes, work with industry to make 
sure that they are opening production lines here and abroad on 
co-production to make sure that we're able to deliver on time.
    The delays that we have seen in contracting are of concern. 
I would defer to Pentagon colleagues on how their tiger team 
has addressed contracting delays. But certainly, we will need 
to improve contracting times to be able to address any delays 
in the process.
    Mr. Wilson. Well, hey, that's extraordinary--a pleasant 
surprise to me, 48-hour approval. Hey, that's--hey, that's in 
the interest of the American people. And so I hope you reach 
the other 5 percent, too. Okay, so let's--whatever can be done.
    And then, Mr. Ratner, indeed, there were Harpoon anti-
cruise missiles to be delivered to Taiwan to protect the people 
of Taiwan. What's the status of the delivery?
    Ms. Resnick. With the authority of the Secretary of State 
under the Arms Export Control Act, I can certainly take that 
question.
    The Harpoons are expected to be delivered in the coming 
years. We have worked with industry to be able to expedite 
that. They are next in the production line. It is very 
difficult to change the production queues because of the 
bespoke----
    Mr. Wilson. Hey, my time is up. But, hey, any way it can be 
extradited, any----
    Ms. Resnick. We're with you on that.
    Mr. Wilson. Hey, any that we have in inventory should be 
delivered. Thank you. I yield back.
    The Chairman. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut, Mr. Courtney.
    Mr. Courtney. Thank you, Chairman Rogers, for holding this 
hearing, which, again, I think has put some real clarity to an 
issue where, again, there's a lot of concern but also a little 
confusion. And thank you to all the witnesses for your hard 
work.
    General, President Xi Jinping has made it pretty clear 
publicly that he's been calling on his military to be capable 
and ready for an invasion by 2027. I just wonder if you could 
just sort of talk a little bit about--I mean, obviously, 
there's a lot of people who sort of look at China as 10 feet 
tall and a military that is, you know, totally capable of 
overwhelming force and doing whatever it wants.
    But there is a logistical challenge in terms of the Straits 
of Taiwan, in terms of the 120-mile width and also just the 
complexity of an amphibious joint invasion.
    And what--if you could just talk about that a little bit in 
terms of what your assessment is, particularly with a sort of 
2027 sort of date that certainly is out there?
    General McGee. Sir, thank you for the question. I think it 
is important to highlight the difficulties from a military end, 
how difficult this invasion would be if the Chinese made the 
decision to take such a course of action.
    Obviously, we believe and hope that deterrence is going to 
continue to stop them. But if they were first out they'd have 
to cross the Taiwan Straits, which is between 90 and 120 miles.
    By way of comparison to the D-Day invasion that was about 
25 miles. They would have to mass tens of thousands, maybe 
hundreds of thousands of troops, on the eastern coast and that 
would be a clear signal this was beginning.
    They would have to do a combined amphibious and airborne 
air assault operation, we believe, which is an incredibly 
complicated joint operation to be able to do, especially when 
you're talking about those distances.
    That would leave them in the middle of that gap, you know, 
90-100 miles, susceptible to all the fires that could be 
brought upon an invading force that was already telegraphing 
their intentions.
    They would be charging into a country which has a credible 
and strong military force about the size of Taiwan. They'd be 
hitting cities like Taipei with about 7 million people. That's 
twice the size of Los Angeles.
    They would also encounter an island that has very few 
beaches where you could land craft on, mountainous terrain, and 
a population that we believe that would be willing to fight.
    So there is absolutely nothing easy about a PLA invasion of 
Taiwan.
    Mr. Courtney. Great. Thank you. I think that's helpful for 
a lot of folks who maybe haven't pulled out their geog--their 
maps. But I think everything you said is what we saw on Mr. 
Rogers' CODEL [congressional delegation] back in June.
    Mr. Ratner, while we were there there was also a lot of 
discussion with the Taiwan leadership about the fact that China 
had, again, just come out of their COVID lockdown. All the 
predictions in Wall Street that, you know, they were going to 
come roaring back in terms of their economy clearly--now it's 
pretty clear that China has a lot of structural problems with 
its economy in terms of, you know, massive debt, a property and 
real estate market that is overextended and collapsing, 20 
percent unemployment for young Chinese.
    How do you sort of look at that, which is a relatively 
recent phenomenon, in terms of whether or not that adds risk in 
terms of a decision to invade or for domestic political 
pressures or whether or not, you know, a rational response 
would be to tamp down, you know, enterprises like an invasion 
because they've got work to do at home?
    Dr. Ratner. Representative Courtney, that's a really 
important question. In part, the answer to that is unknowable 
and because of that what I will say is we are watching the PRC 
economy very closely. We are seeing some of the trends you are 
describing.
    We are also watching some of the issues the PLA is having 
in terms of how it's managing a different resource condition 
than maybe they had expected when they were growing at higher 
rates and seeing them making tradeoffs that maybe they weren't 
expecting to have to make, as well as some of the institutional 
challenges that they have as it relates to corruption and 
otherwise.
    And, of course, there's a broader range of internal 
domestic issues associated with demographics, the real estate 
market, political instability, any number of issues that you've 
just raised that China's leaders have to contend with.
    For our part, we have identified the PRC as the 
Department's top pacing challenge and we're going to continue 
investing in our own strength and capability such that, to the 
earlier part of your question, when Xi Jinping wakes up every 
day and looks out the window and considers whether or not it's 
within his cost benefit analysis to initiate an invasion 
against Taiwan that he says today is not the day.
    I think we think--we're pretty confident that's true today 
and we're doing everything we can to keep it that way.
    Mr. Courtney. Thank you. I yield back.
    The Chairman. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia, Mr. Wittman, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Wittman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to thank our 
panelists for joining us.
    Ms. Resnick, I wanted to focus on the Department of State's 
FMS 2023 initiative, and essentially you're saying you're going 
to prioritize and help in planning assistance in the future.
    That's great in the future but we know the future is now 
for Taiwan. Taiwan is pretty focused on getting things done. I 
had an opportunity to meet with President Tsai with the CODEL 
that I led there and she is adamant about making sure that 
these Foreign Military Sales backlogs are filled.
    As you heard the chairman, it's substantial, not only F-16s 
but F-16 parts. As you know, having to scramble those jets 
every time the Chinese fly into that air defense identification 
zone wears those jets out. They need those parts for 141 
aircraft. They need the 66 new aircraft.
    Prioritization in the future doesn't address today's 
constraints. The U.S. has plans to provide 66 aircraft and 
that's great, but those plans had been started in 2019.
    Here we are today and the Department says that, don't 
worry--final delivery date is going to be 2026. That's 7 
years--7 years--knowing that China has ramped up their efforts 
in threatening not just Taiwan but threatening the region.
    And we talk about partnerships. We talk about, oh, we're 
going to have all these friends in the region that are going to 
help us out. Doesn't appear that we're being very friendly with 
the policies that we have and not helping and prioritizing 
these Foreign Military Sales.
    Congress has authorized the President a billion dollars of 
drawdown authority. Okay. That's now but it hasn't been used in 
the past.
    Can you tell me why hasn't this been a priority up until 
now when all of a sudden the lights are shining on this? 
Everybody's looking at this and go, my gosh, we need to do 
this. Why haven't we gotten further along with this?
    I agree with President Tsai. They are in dire need of parts 
and aircraft if they have any hope of deterring the Chinese. 
Deterrence of the Chinese is a joint effort. It cannot just be 
the United States, and Taiwan rightfully looks at us and goes, 
you know what, you made a lot of promises, folks, but you 
haven't delivered on the promises.
    Assure me that we're going to deliver on those promises in 
a timely manner and it's not going to take another 7 years to 
deliver what they first asked for in 2019.
    Ms. Resnick. Congressman, thank you for the--for the 
question and, of course, again, the opportunity to clarify. 
When the State Department approves and when Congress approves 
of a weapon sale, that is the beginning of the process for 
contracting.
    It then goes through DOD's contracting. It then goes to----
    Mr. Wittman. I understand about process. Tell me about 
outcomes. Tell me about outcomes. I don't care--I don't care 
about the process. Tell me about outcomes.
    Ms. Resnick. After contracting it then goes to industry. So 
we are waiting on industry. Industry--we have been working with 
industry to step up their production. This has been a 
particular effort at the Pentagon for Deputy Secretary `Kath 
Hicks, who has worked tirelessly to be able to shorten those 
production--those production timelines.
    But you are absolutely right that we need to use other 
tools. Let me talk about two of them.
    The first is Foreign Military Financing, because knowing 
that if we need to get something on contract in order for 
production to start we have been using Foreign Military 
Financing for the first time in this administration.
    If a--if Taiwan is unable because of their fiscal year to 
get something on contract then we can supplement Taiwan's 
defense budget, which, as I said in my opening, has doubled in 
the last 7 years.
    So they have skin in the game here. But we are able to 
supplement Taiwan's defense budget by getting something on 
contract immediately and also so that they don't miss the 
military acquisition window.
    There's a second, which is, as you mentioned, the 
Presidential drawdown authority. For the first time we use this 
authority because for the first time Congress authorized that 
authority. We thank you for that.
    We think that this is a very effective tool. This is a 
permanent authority so we will continue to use this. We do not 
expect that we will need to have to come back to you over and 
over again for a new authority here. So thank you for that 
authority and we will continue to use it.
    Mr. Wittman. As my time is running out, what pressures have 
you put on industry with the urgency that is behind needing 
these aircraft to help Taiwan protect itself? What have you 
done to make sure that industry delivers?
    Ms. Resnick. So we understand that what industry is looking 
for is predictability, to make sure that they--if they are 
going to open new production lines or if they are going to run 
the production lines on overtime.
    So we have worked very closely with Lockheed. I understand 
that the Air Force and Lockheed are working together on this in 
order to address some of the issues with the F-16. So we do 
work with industry and we continue to do that.
    Mr. Wittman. Thank you. Working needs to equal delivery. I 
hope to see delivery of those aircraft here in the months to 
come. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. 
Norcross, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Norcross. Thank you, Chairman, for calling this hearing 
today--defense cooperation--and it's an incredibly important 
hearing, and hearing from my colleague and Mr. Wittman, he 
brings up great points about the deterrence, you know, three 
primary ones being military, there's political, and then 
there's certainly economic.
    And when we talk about predictability, I think that is so 
important because as China looks to the world and making that 
calculation that you speak about each day, waking up, is today 
the day to go after Taiwan, they look at the U.S. and what are 
we thinking--what are we doing.
    And when we look at--the focus of this committee has been 
so much and so intent making sure the military and that we're 
getting them the right equipment at the right time, but it's 
also what we're doing.
    So my question is when we look at what's going on in 
Ukraine and now they're seeing a potential--call it a pause, a 
pivot--the lack of predictability on what we're going to do in 
helping Ukraine in funding, whether we're going to extend and 
increase the amount of funding go there, it's not going to take 
a genius for China to look at it and say, wow, are they in on 
Ukraine?
    What will they do when it comes to Taiwan? You know, that's 
a very big issue that they're going on. So are we going to be 
there? We're potentially getting ready to see what happens if 
we shut down government. What does that do to our readiness for 
our ability to deliver the F-16s?
    So from a political standpoint--and I'd like to get some 
focus on this--Dr. Ratner, where is the assessment when we talk 
about lack of funding going on for Ukraine or a potential 
shutdown? How does this fit into that calculus of what China 
looks at when they look at the resolve of the U.S.?
    Dr. Ratner. Well, thank you, Congressman. I think the 
question that I would ask is what can the administration do in 
partnership with Congress to strengthen deterrence across the 
Taiwan Strait to address exactly the issues that you described, 
and I think there are three particular actions building upon 
what DAS Resnick said that should be top priorities to build 
confidence in the region in--and assurance in Xi Jinping's mind 
of U.S. deterrence.
    First is we do need to see a full-year on-time 
appropriation. The National Defense Strategy is singularly 
focused on the PRC and the budget reflects that strategy and we 
need that budget passed in full to be able to implement the 
strategy and, of course, a continuing resolution or a shutdown 
would inhibit our ability to do that.
    Second, as DAS Resnick has emphasized, we really do need to 
work together to strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base so 
that we are better positioned as the United States to 
strengthen our own readiness and to support key allies and 
partners and we can do that through expanding and leveraging 
multiyear procurement among other tools.
    And then, finally, Congress can provide appropriations 
against the new authorities that this committee has provided to 
the administration and that Congress has provided so that we 
can leverage Presidential drawdown authority and Foreign 
Military Financing to their full effect because to date we have 
those authorities, but they have not been appropriated against.
    I think doing all of those three things would send a really 
powerful message to Beijing.
    Mr. Norcross. Thank you.
    I want to just switch over--when we start looking at 
tipping points or tripwires and from the military's standpoint, 
you know, the modernization that we are hearing about.
    Is there a tripwire when we--that you can see, General, 
that there's certain equipment or cooperation that takes place 
that might push China to making a hasty decision?
    General McGee. Sir, our focus in terms of support to Taiwan 
has been to increase their defenses. So the weapons that we're 
providing them are simply for the defense of their country.
    I can't tell you if there is a single asset or a type of 
weapon that would set them over in terms of a tipping point. 
But I think it's important to emphasize that the aid that is 
provided to Taiwan is purely of a defensive means.
    Mr. Norcross. Good point.
    So let me switch over to the last one and that is the 
political. Where might that tripwire be, whether it's by Taiwan 
or the U.S., that would put us in a collision course? Is there 
an election? Is there a statement that we believe that tripwire 
is going to be?
    Ms. Resnick. One way that we see that we can deter the PRC 
is by demonstrating resolve for our support to Ukraine, and 
don't trust me--senior Taiwan officials have said that 
Ukraine's success against Russia will help deter aggression 
from China.
    Mr. Norcross. I'm sorry. My time is expired. I yield back. 
My apologies.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. 
Bacon, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Bacon. Thanks to all three of you. I appreciate the 
level of preparation and the seriousness you're taking this. 
I'm grateful to you.
    First, I just want to say that, you know, Taiwan has 23 
million people. They've embraced democracy, human rights, free 
markets, our freedom of speech, religion, and the press, and we 
have a moral and a strategic obligation to help Taiwan deter an 
invasion and if deterrence fails, to help Taiwan defeat an 
invasion by Communist China.
    So this deterrence of Taiwan should be one of our highest 
priorities and I can tell that you share that view.
    My first question is for either Dr. Ratner or Ms. Resnick. 
Our focus in our country in recent months or over the last year 
or so has been on Ukraine. If Congress fails to help Ukraine 
and Russia prevails what is the message that China will take 
from this or even what will be the message that Taiwan takes 
from this?
    I'll ask Dr. Ratner first.
    Dr. Ratner. I may allow--I'll say a word on that but Ms. 
Resnick was maybe in the middle of a response to that question 
with the last member.
    So maybe if you want to finish your answer.
    Ms. Resnick. Sure. We see that our support for Ukraine 
bolsters Ukraine's deterrence but also bolsters Taiwan's 
deterrence; that where we can, we should be making sure that 
the PRC gets the right message from us, which is that we 
support our partners, we support our allies, and that we are a 
reliable partner.
    Sending that message of reliability is exactly what we need 
to be doing right now. Decreasing our support for Ukraine would 
send exactly the wrong message to the PRC.
    Mr. Bacon. It sends the message if we don't do this that we 
don't stand up to the values we believe in and that we won't 
stand up against a bully, and I think we need to.
    General McGee, one of the options I don't hear much about 
is a blockade. We talk about an invasion. I think a blockade is 
another serious option the Chinese could be looking at.
    How are the Taiwanese preparing for this, how are we 
helping and, you know, they're not--they don't have a depth of 
food or energy so this could be a serious issue.
    General McGee. Taiwan takes their responsibility to keep 
their nation provisioned with enough food to be able to survive 
a blockade of a fairly significant amount of time. Maybe not 
appropriate to discuss exact numbers here but I know that 
Taiwan takes that seriously.
    I know they take the threat of a blockade as a possibility. 
I think it is an option but probably not a highly likely 
option. When you start looking at the military options much 
easier to talk about a blockade than actually do a blockade, I 
think, when you're actually conducting military operations. I 
know Dr. Ratner has looked at this quite a bit as well.
    Dr. Ratner. Yeah, thank you. I mean, I would only just add 
that a blockade would be devastating to the international 
economy and would likely induce the kind of broad-based wide 
deep response from the international community against China's 
actions that Beijing would likely be trying to avoid in this 
circumstance to coerce Taiwan.
    So it would likely build an international coalition against 
Taiwan. In addition, we believe based on our analysis that 
Taiwan would have options on its own and with the international 
community to ensure the delivery of industrial resources, raw 
materials, energy, and other critical items in the event of a 
PLA blockade.
    So it would likely not succeed and it would be a huge risk 
of escalation for the PRC where it would likely have to 
consider whether or not it was willing to ultimately start 
attacking commercial maritime vessels.
    So for all that reason we think this would be a monster 
risk for the PRC and a huge miscalculation.
    Mr. Bacon. Thank you.
    A follow-up, Dr. Ratner, on strategic ambiguity. When does 
ambiguity become a weakness to deterrence versus having more 
clarity and clear commitment to Taiwan?
    Dr. Ratner. Well, Representative, what I would say is that 
we see the PRC anticipating a U.S. response to a invasion of 
Taiwan.
    They train against it, they assume it's going to happen, 
and, therefore, we don't think there would be additional 
deterrence value in changing our position away from strategic 
ambiguity and in fact doing that would upset our commitment to 
the status quo and to opposing unilateral changes to the status 
quo.
    So we think there is political costs that would be borne by 
the people on Taiwan for that kind of political action and very 
little benefit in terms of deterrence. We believe today 
deterrence is strong and deterrence is real.
    Mr. Bacon. One real quick--one last real quick question. 
You said earlier we weren't funding to 100 percent. What is it 
that we need to be funding to for Taiwan compared to where 
we're at?
    Ms. Resnick. The Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act that was 
passed as part of last year's NDAA includes a $2 billion 
authorization. Just to give you a sense of scale, the global 
FMF budget is between $6 [billion] and $7 billion. It's 90 
percent earmarked.
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts, 
Mr. Keating.
    Mr. Keating. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to thank our witnesses for shedding so much light on 
the military side of our deterrence in terms of China and 
Taiwan. But there's two other great historic events that have 
taken place here during this time period that reflect on, I 
think, major, major areas of deterrence that I'd like to just 
discuss a little bit more--have you discuss more.
    One is the--looking at the COVID pandemic and the effect on 
the economy. The second is the war in Ukraine. With the first I 
think Ms. Resnick brought clear the economic effects that 
Taiwan's--an invasion of Taiwan would have in terms of half of 
the world's trade going through the straits there, in terms of 
their chips production.
    But I'd also like to see a comment on the effects of an 
aggressive action by China on Taiwan, specifically on how it 
would affect their economy and how that is a deterrent factor 
in their calculations.
    And number two, we did a lot of talking about the 
administration in terms of Ukraine. But what about Congress? 
You know, we are a capitalist country. We have a military asset 
base that's built in the private sector--in cooperation with 
our own government, but in the private sector.
    When that private sector sees CR [continuing resolution] 
after CR after CR and not dealing with the budget how does that 
directly affect their ability to produce the assets that we 
need, their predictability, their ability to get capital in a 
long-range sense?
    And, secondly, in Ukraine, when Congress is talking about 
cutting aid to Ukraine, abandoning commitments we had to 
Ukraine, and we're talking about one of the greatest things we 
have seen in terms of deterrence, in terms of helping Taiwan, 
with the partnerships we have built in the region--the new 
partnerships--if they see that kind of discussion here in 
Congress about cutting aid, leaving our partners in the lurch, 
what effect will that have?
    So I gave you a lot to answer to in a little over 2 minutes 
but I'll give you flexibility in answering them and be quiet.
    Dr. Ratner. Congressman, maybe I'll just reiterate what I 
said in response to Mr. Norcross, which is Congress does have 
an incredibly important role to play here and we want to work 
with this committee and the full Congress on resourcing issues 
precisely for the reasons you described.
    And, again, just to repeat myself, we are looking for a 
full year on-time appropriation. That's required for us to 
implement the strategy that we have written that is focused on 
integrated deterrence against the PRC.
    We need support in strengthening our U.S. defense 
industrial base so we can be better positioned to provide for 
our own readiness and for our partners, and we do need 
appropriations against the new authorities that Congress has 
provided for support for Taiwan that we haven't seen yet.
    So I think that's really an important role for Congress. 
What I would say on your first question, very quickly, that the 
economic effects for the PRC would be devastating and that's 
why the PLA is focused on trying to execute a rapid low-cost 
invasion that Xi Jinping would view as at acceptable cost.
    And when we think about combat-credible deterrence we want 
to ensure that that remains too costly for Xi and we think we 
are absolutely there today, and when we talk about the PRC as a 
pacing challenge what we are talking about is staying ahead of 
that cost calculation in the years and decades ahead.
    Ms. Resnick. Mr. Keating, thank you for that question.
    We believe that demonstrating our resolve with respect to 
Ukraine is the best way to deter the PRC. Abandoning our 
partners encourages the PRC to conclude that we will fail to 
provide for Taiwan's sufficient self-defense. That is exactly 
the wrong message to be sending.
    Let me also just say a moment in this last minute about 
what the lack of an on-time appropriation would do with respect 
to our defense industry.
    In the context of a shutdown, which we would all like to 
avoid, the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs in the past--
and I can't speak to what would happen in the future, we 
haven't issued guidance yet--but in the past the Bureau of 
Political-Military Affairs has been unable to process new 
licenses for any partner including Taiwan--has been unable to 
process new Foreign Military Sales for any partner including 
Taiwan, except in the context of an emergency.
    This is something we would like to avoid.
    Mr. Keating. And I'm running out of time. I'll just 
emphasize you said without revealing who they are. The 
Taiwanese people are looking at what's happening in Taiwan. 
They are having discussions about what's happening here in 
Congress. So I yield back.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. 
Gallagher, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Gallagher. Thank Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Ratner, the President in Vietnam said, and I quote, 
``Look, I think China has a difficult economic problem right 
now for the whole range of reasons that relate to the 
international growth and lack thereof and the policies that 
China has followed.
    ``And so I--I don't think it's going to cause China to 
invade Taiwan. And matter of fact, the opposite--it probably 
doesn't have the same capacity that it had before.''
    Do you agree with the assessment that China's economic 
difficulties will make them less aggressive militarily and, if 
so, what empirical support would you offer in support of that 
hypothesis?
    Dr. Ratner. Congressman, I would say in response at the 
Defense Department we're focused on strengthening combat-
credible deterrence.
    Mr. Gallagher. You don't have the view--I mean, you're the 
China expert in the building. Do you have a view on whether 
China's economic difficulties make them more or less aggressive 
militarily, which I would argue is directly relevant to the 
question of how do we defend against such an invasion?
    Dr. Ratner. Congressman, I'd be happy to provide a more 
detailed answer to that in a classified session.
    Mr. Gallagher. So you don't want to answer that in public 
session.
    Dr. Ratner. Let me give you an assessment based upon the 
information that we have. I would prefer to do that in a 
classified session.
    Mr. Gallagher. Just an assessment based on your deep 
expertise for which I have enormous respect and which I've 
repeatedly praised publicly.
    Dr. Ratner. Congressman, I appreciate that. Again, I'd 
rather take that question into a classified.
    Mr. Gallagher. Okay. The President in that same press 
conference said that our goal is not to contain China. Do you 
agree with that and if you do what is our--what is our end 
state with respect to China if it's not containment?
    Dr. Ratner. We articulate our goal as it relates to the PRC 
as integrated deterrence and we articulate our role in the 
Indo-Pacific as building a free and open Indo-Pacific with--
alongside our allies and partners.
    Mr. Gallagher. Okay. The President in that same press 
conference said--I don't want to get this wrong: ``the only 
existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a 
nuclear war is global warming going above 1.5 degrees in the 
next 20--10 years.''
    Do you agree with that assessment that the threat of global 
warming is greater than the threat of thermonuclear war with 
China?
    Dr. Ratner. What I would say, Congressman, the 2022 
National Defense Strategy identifies the PRC as the 
Department's top pacing challenge and that's what we're focused 
on as our priority at the Department.
    Mr. Gallagher. So is the President suggesting something 
different than the prioritization in the NDS [National Defense 
Strategy]?
    Dr. Ratner. I'm not going to speak for the President, sir. 
I'm just going to say as it relates to the 2022 NDS, I believe 
we are focused on the pacing challenge of the PRC I believe 
with the consistency and focus and urgency that you're 
suggesting is required.
    Mr. Gallagher. I'm not trying to be difficult. I actually 
think the question of prioritization matters greatly because as 
you know there's a--there are some who suggest that, indeed, we 
need to cooperate with China when it comes to climate change.
    I would argue this is naive at best and China has no 
interest in sort of abiding by commitments that are made at COP 
27 [2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference] or any other 
international fora, as their record demonstrates, and in a 
practical level our attempts to engage with China on that issue 
undermine the urgency that we need to take key defensive action 
particularly when it comes to our military competition.
    Along those lines, when it comes to this renewal of 
engagement as a foundation of our foreign policy with respect 
to China we have had four Cabinet-level officials or three plus 
Secretary--former Secretary Kerry.
    How has that improved the security situation in the Indo-
Pacific?
    Dr. Ratner. Do you want to take this, from the State 
Department?
    Ms. Resnick. Secretary Blinken has been very clear that we 
will cooperate where our interests align but that we're not 
afraid of competing and we're not afraid of contesting where we 
must.
    So we believe that we need to manage this relationship 
responsibly. Our--the American people expect us to manage the 
relationship responsibly. Our allies and partners expect us to 
manage the relationship responsibly and so we'll continue to do 
that. That involves continuing to have open lines of 
communication.
    Mr. Gallagher. Have--is it not true that our attempts to 
establish a crisis communication channel--military-to-military 
communication--have been rebuffed by the Chinese Communist 
Party?
    Dr. Ratner. Absolutely. We have--Secretary Austin has said 
repeatedly that we are interested in maintaining open lines of 
communication and by and large--with some exceptions but by and 
large the PLA has not been responsive to that.
    Mr. Gallagher. And then, finally, in the 36 seconds I have 
left, putting on my Select Committee on China hat, taking off 
my HASC [House Armed Services Committee] hat, we just did a war 
game in New York that focused on the economic and financial 
aspects of this conflict.
    I guess I just sort of assumed that there were people at 
Treasury and Commerce wargaming and doing sort of financial and 
economic escalation in the way we do rigorously when it comes 
to conventional and nuclear escalation.
    Have you, Dr. Ratner, ever participated in such an exercise 
with Treasury and Commerce officials?
    Dr. Ratner. Yes, I have. I have participated in 
interagency--multiple interagency tabletop exercises with 
representatives from Treasury and Commerce in which they are 
considering the employment of economic tools as part of crisis 
and conflict.
    Mr. Gallagher. My time has expired. I look forward to 
following up offline.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. 
Carbajal, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the 
witnesses for being here today.
    The National Defense Strategy states conflict with the 
People's Republic of China is neither inevitable or desirable. 
I firmly believe this and I think and hope that most if not all 
members here in this room agree.
    It is crucial the United States remain committed to 
Taiwan's national security and continue providing the tools 
necessary to detour any aggression from the PRC.
    Dr. Ratner, can you speak to how well received U.S. 
assistance is by Taiwan and can you characterize how some of 
the assistance we provided complements Taiwan's own efforts?
    Dr. Ratner. Yes, absolutely. Under the Taiwan Relations Act 
we are committed to supporting Taiwan in its self-defense.
    That is an important part of their effort to be able to 
defend their democracy and we are focused with them on 
identifying the right capabilities and getting to them at the 
right time.
    So, again, be happy to answer these questions in much 
greater detail in a classified setting. But absolutely.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. We have heard there are issues 
with the Foreign Military Sales process with an estimated $19 
billion backlog. The State Department has a 10-point plan to 
retool FMS and the Department of Defense has the FMS Tiger Team 
to highlight and implement recommendations to improve FMS.
    Ms. Resnick and Dr. Ratner, can you speak to where these 
plans are and how you see them improving FMS, and can you both 
discuss coordination between the State Department and the 
Department of Defense on improving FMS?
    Ms. Resnick. Congressman, thanks for your question and the 
opportunity to go a little bit deeper into FMS 2023.
    Just to clarify, the $19 billion that you reference were 
cases that have been approved by the State Department already, 
that have been approved by Congress already, and so these are 
cases that are awaiting production.
    So we rely on our defense industry to produce for our 
partners and for ourselves for our own readiness, and so these 
are cases that are in the queue for production.
    We see that, and the data confirms that, cases go through 
the State Department--95 percent of cases go through the State 
Department within 48 hours. So we are working on those 5 
percent, those stickier foreign policy issues and how we can 
unstick them.
    We are working on making sure that we remain competitive in 
this age of heightened strategic competition globally and so 
our recommendations include better training for our security 
cooperation officers so that they better understand the 
authorities under which they're operating.
    We have worked on prioritizing FMS cases according to the 
National Defense Strategy, worked on anticipatory policies so 
that we don't have to wait for a partner to ask us for a 
decision but we may have a decision already done and gone 
through all of the recommendations--all of the approval process 
before a partner even asks.
    So we have a number of recommendations and we're working to 
implement them now.
    Mr. Carbajal. Anything to add, Dr. Ratner?
    Dr. Ratner. Yeah. I would just say thank you for DAS 
Resnick, for handling a number of the FMS questions today. It 
turns out the Defense Department also ran a tiger team, co-led 
by senior officials from OSD [Office of the Secretary of 
Defense] Policy as well as Acquisitions and Sustainment, to 
look at a number of similar issues in concert with the State 
Department through the entire life cycle of the FMS process and 
found the same conclusions, which is the predominance of the 
delays that we're now seeing are tied to industrial base 
production challenges and that many of industry's challenges 
could be solved by investing more in production lines to 
increase speed and capacity.
    So, again, I would come back to what I said a few minutes 
ago. We are looking for partnership with Congress to try to 
strengthen the U.S. defense industrial base together in a 
bipartisan fashion and that's how we're going to get after 
ensuring that we have not only the capabilities for our own 
readiness but also for our vital allies and partners.
    Mr. Carbajal. I have limited time so I'm going to get the 
question out. You might have to give me the answer later.
    Dr. Ratner and Ms. Resnick, in recent years the PRC has 
increased gray zone pressures including increased frequency and 
complex military exercises and aircraft, manned and unmanned, 
flying closer to Taiwan than in years past.
    Do you think there are steps Taiwan could take to detour 
gray zone pressure?
    [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix 
on page 81.]
    The Chairman. The gentleman's time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. 
Banks.
    Mr. Banks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Congress authorized President Biden to send $1 billion in 
defense aid to Taiwan during fiscal year 2023 through 
Presidential drawdown authority.
    The fiscal year ends in 11 days but the President has only 
sent about one-third of that military aid to Taiwan. Ms. 
Resnick, why has President Biden withheld $655 million in 
Presidential drawdown authority from Taiwan?
    Ms. Resnick. Thanks for the question. This is a very 
important authority and we thank Congress for that. This 
authority is now in permanent law so we expect to be able to 
use this authority in the future.
    The PDA is--the Presidential drawdown authority is one of 
many authorities that we use----
    Mr. Banks. Does that money expire in 11 days--$655 million 
that he didn't spend in fiscal year 2023?
    Ms. Resnick. It resets the clock. Even if there is a 
shutdown, even if there is a CR, it resets the clock to $1 
billion in authority and then it is up to the Defense 
Department to see what they have in stock.
    Dr. Ratner. Yeah, I guess--Congressman Banks, what I would 
clarify is there is no money. There was an authorization for a 
billion dollars against which Congress did not appropriate 
replenishment funds different from how it has done with 
Ukraine.
    So the Presidential drawdown authority that the Department 
has used it has taken out of hide, and as Secretary Austin has 
said the Department is looking to Congress to appropriate 
against those authorities so they can be best leveraged by the 
Department in----
    Mr. Banks. Is there a distinction between FMF and the 
Presidential drawdown authority? Or is there no differ--you're 
saying there is no difference?
    Ms. Resnick. With Foreign Military Financing there is no 
particular earmark for Taiwan. We have found out of hide $80 
million for--in the supplemental.
    Mr. Banks. You're saying there is not $655 million that has 
been appropriated----
    Dr. Ratner. Correct.
    Mr. Banks [continuing]. To provide a Presidential drawdown 
authority to Taiwan that is going to expire in 11 days?
    Dr. Ratner. That's correct. It was--a billion dollars was 
authorized. Zero dollars were appropriated. Three hundred and 
forty-five million dollars were taken out of hide.
    Mr. Banks. Okay. So the Taiwanese often complain about the 
Biden administration offering them loans rather than outright 
support. Can you talk about the difference and why the Biden 
administration has only offered them loans?
    Ms. Resnick. We have not. We have also offered them grant 
assistance which we are working to implement now. This was just 
notified in the last couple of weeks.
    Congress authorized loans, and we understand that they may 
not be interested in those loans but we are offering grant 
assistance. We have offered grant assistance and we believe 
that it is in our interest to do so.
    Mr. Banks. Why are they not interested in the loans?
    Ms. Resnick. I think that the rate may not be very 
competitive and that is, again, something that we are working 
on with FMS 2023.
    Mr. Banks. What can we do about that?
    Ms. Resnick. Well, we have--we have asked for authorities 
in the supplemental to be able to provide a better rate to 
partners and so we look forward to working with Congress about 
that.
    Mr. Banks. Can you compare those rates with what they might 
find from elsewhere?
    Ms. Resnick. Correct. We need to have a competitive rate.
    Mr. Banks. Can you tell us, the committee, on what those 
rates--why our rates aren't competitive versus rates they might 
find elsewhere?
    Ms. Resnick. I'm happy to take that for the record. I don't 
have the numbers in front of me.
    Mr. Banks. Thank you. I yield back.
    [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix 
on page 81.]
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts, 
Mr. Moulton, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Moulton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    In this discussion of funding and appropriations and all of 
that, how would a government shutdown affect our ability to arm 
Taiwan and deter aggression in the Pacific?
    Ms. Resnick. I can start based on a State Department 
perspective. And, again, I wasn't at the State Department, I 
was here on the Hill when we had the last shutdown.
    But based on past precedent, the State Department would be 
unable to process new licenses for Taiwan or for any other 
partner absent an emergency. We would be unable to process new 
Foreign Military Sales. We would also be unable to process new 
Foreign Military Financing which would not be--which would not 
be included under a shutdown.
    And just to clarify, when Congress moves forward on defense 
spending that isn't--that does not include the State Department 
and so, therefore, the Foreign Military Financing budget is not 
included in defense spending. And so even if Congress moves 
forward with defense spending, the State Department and our 
partners would suffer.
    Mr. Moulton. So the House leadership sent us home last week 
without even voting on defense appropriations, which should be 
the easiest of 12 appropriations bills to pass.
    If we by some miracle avoid a shutdown and just have a 
continuing resolution--a CR--is that okay? Or how does that 
affect our ability to arm Taiwan and deter aggression?
    Dr. Ratner. Congressman, from a broader regional 
perspective, we are looking for a full appropriation against 
our budget request. A continuing resolution prevents us from 
making new investments in our own capabilities.
    It also prevents us from initiating new major military 
construction projects in the region associated with our forward 
posture. So, yes, this affects our ability to support key 
partners like Taiwan, but it also affects our ability to build 
the kind of deterrent in the U.S. military that we're seeking 
to build.
    Mr. Moulton. Dr. Ratner, when we talk about supporting our 
partner in Taiwan one of the questions that I hear from 
constituents, the people back home, is, you know, are the 
people of Taiwan going to stand up and fight. And I have 
understood that there is a perception among some in Taiwan for 
some time that a peaceful resolution to this crisis would be 
ideal and perhaps that they would just follow the Hong Kong 
model.
    Is the Hong Kong model popular in Taiwan right now and what 
do you think about their willingness to actually fight off 
aggression from the--from the PRC?
    Dr. Ratner. Congressman, what we have seen in recent years 
is a Taiwan people and Taiwan government that has clearly 
signaled a willingness to invest in its own defense and invest 
in its own resilience and take difficult political decisions 
and political reforms to do just that.
    We have seen significant increases in their defense budget, 
and I should just say we see them resisting PRC coercion every 
day in terms of the economic and military and political 
coercion and influence that they are experiencing and they have 
stood up for themselves and stood up for their democracy.
    Mr. Moulton. I think that's a good point that a lot of 
people don't understand is in the same way that the Ukrainians 
were really at war for the last 8 years, Taiwan is feeling the 
effects of PRC aggression literally every single day.
    General McGee, when I was last in Taiwan in October looking 
at this as a Marine infantry officer I saw a territory that was 
very defensible, kind of ideally defensible. I saw some very 
enthusiastic work by the people of Taiwan and their army to 
exercise, to get out there, dig trench lines and whatnot.
    But I also saw a lot of room for improvement where some 
advice from us would be helpful in developing the real tactics 
on the ground to be most effective in the event of an invasion.
    What are we doing to help--to help improve their 
capabilities in the same way that we helped improve the 
capabilities of the Ukrainians before Russia started that 
illegal war?
    General McGee. Sir, I'll just say when you look at a 
nation's ability to fight or any military's I think it comes 
down to a couple of key factors. They need to have a 
capability. They need to have a capacity so they need to have 
those assets at--in the numbers.
    They need to have competence in terms of their ability to 
execute any form of military operations, confidence in their 
leadership at every--at every single level, and then most 
importantly they've got to have that will to fight.
    I think when we do any work with the people of Taiwan, 
specifically with their military, most especially just recently 
in Camp Grayling up in Michigan hosted an exercise where they 
brought an infantry battalion to Michigan to conduct their 
operations.
    I think everyone who was part of that exercise was 
impressed with what we saw from Taiwan's army, their 
willingness on all those factors.
    Mr. Moulton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. I thank the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. 
Strong, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Strong. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank each of the 
witnesses for being here today.
    U.S. policy and strategic ambiguity when it comes to the 
Taiwans has been steadfast and consistent for decades. However, 
the policy is undermined when leaders of major defense 
companies come to the aid of the Chinese Communist Party, 
making public statements such as, and I quote, ``Taiwan is an 
integral part of China,'' close quote.
    What messages do you think these types of statements send 
to the CCP?
    Ms. Resnick. Thanks for your question.
    There's been no change in our government policy. What has 
changed is the scale and sophistication of the PLA's intense 
pressure on Taiwan. We work with the defense industry quite a 
bit. Obviously, there are some commercial interests there. But 
we work with the defense industry to make sure that we can help 
Taiwan rise to meet that threat that the PRC is posing to 
Taiwan.
    Mr. Strong. Thank you.
    Last week China announced sanctions against Lockheed Martin 
and Northrop Grumman for providing weapons to Taiwan. Now, I 
don't know about you all but that sounds like a badge of honor 
to me. If you're a U.S. defense company and CCP friendly maybe 
you should be reevaluating your business model.
    Back in June the Department of Defense approved a tasking 
memo to help accelerate institutional processes for Foreign 
Military Sales.
    In your opinion, what are some of the red tape barriers in 
place that keep your departments from fully unleashing the 
defense industrial base and improving FMS relationships with 
allies and partners?
    Ms. Resnick. Thank you so much for the question.
    We have--we have 10 recommendations that we have included 
in our FMS 2023 including using anticipatory policy so that we 
don't have to wait for the partner to come to us, so that we 
understand what a partner may need and be able to anticipate 
that approval.
    We have--we have begun to work with security cooperation 
officers at embassies around the world to be able to make sure 
that we're managing partners' expectations appropriately.
    We are working on competitive financing. It is not a secret 
that U.S. defense industry provides the best technology in the 
world but it is also expensive. So we need to be able to 
compete with our strategic competitors and even our friendly 
competitors.
    Mr. Strong. How can Congress help advance FMS acquisition 
prioritization and award timelines?
    Ms. Resnick. Thanks for that question.
    I think that the most important role that Congress can play 
is through your discussions with the defense industry of making 
sure that you are able to underscore the urgency of the 
situation with our partners around the world, the need for us 
to be able to meet the demand that we're seeing globally so 
that we can remain a reliable partner.
    Mr. Strong. China continues its aggressive island building 
and military exercises in the South China Sea. Just this 
weekend the CCP launched over 100 warplanes, which included 
fighter jets, toward Taiwan. It's bullying, plain and simple.
    This year's NDAA includes a provision that requires the DOD 
and the State Department to establish a comprehensive training, 
advising, and institutional capacity building program with 
Taiwan's military.
    What are some of the things you believe should be kept in 
mind while developing this program?
    General McGee. I think with--as we take a look at what the 
Taiwan military, you know, and their mission that they have I 
think one of the critical factors because what they need to be 
able to counter is an airborne and amphibious operation is the 
idea of a joint concept and I think if you know the history of 
our own military that's a very sophisticated and complicated 
process to get there.
    And I think any work that we could do to assist them in 
improving joint capabilities, that integration of air, sea, and 
land, space and cyber, to be able to strengthen their defense I 
think would be time well spent.
    Mr. Strong. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mrs. Kiggans [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Strong.
    The Chair now recognizes the Congresswoman from California, 
Ms. Jacobs.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for--all of 
our witnesses for testifying.
    We have heard a lot about this backlog and I kind of want 
to drill down on it a little bit more. I think we're all very 
concerned about the backlog, making sure we get Taiwan what it 
needs.
    But I think it's important to be clear exactly where this 
backlog is coming from. You know, DAS Resnick, as you said, 
these sales pass through the State Department within a matter 
of days, and, Dr. Ratner, as you said, one of the primary 
issues is that the industry is moving too slow.
    You know, one of the things that's really frustrating to me 
is that when we talk to industry about this we hear time and 
again that what they need is a demand signal. But I think it's 
very clear that they have this demand signal and they have had 
for years for a lot of these weapons that Taiwan is in line to 
get.
    And, you know, I think it'd be helpful, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary Resnick, if you could expand on what both you and Dr. 
Ratner have hinted about and really what is needed from the 
industry to address this backlog and how Congress can help make 
this happen.
    Ms. Resnick. Thank you so much for that--for that question 
and for really drilling down on what is needed from industry. 
It is true that industry needs a demand signal. They have a 
fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. We live in a 
capitalist society. That is--that is truly important.
    We believe that we have sent that demand signal and working 
with industry to be able to open new production lines, to be 
able to find ways to have either more hours for workers to be 
producing what we need.
    We have seen that with respect to F-16s, we have seen that 
with respect to Javelins, that industry is putting some of 
their own money. This needs to be widespread and this is a 
point that our very senior leadership has made to industry 
about what is needed from them now.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you. And, Dr. Ratner, could you talk 
about how your department is working with industry to address 
this backlog?
    Dr. Ratner. Yeah, absolutely, and we are likewise engaging 
with industry to try to understand how we can accelerate some 
of these timelines.
    We have had, as I mentioned, an FMS Tiger Team within the 
Department to look at this same set of issues, recommended 
embracing within the Department a more data-driven approach 
which would inform our engagement with industry again and more 
senior level attention to this matter as well among other 
issues.
    But I think the consistent demand signal and the health of 
the defense industrial base, at the end of the day, is where 
we're going to see improvements here. The process issues are 
really important and we're focused on those.
    But ultimately the strength and health of the U.S. defense 
industrial base is going to be the key variable.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you.
    And I just want to emphasize that. We need the defense 
industrial base to step up themselves. They are part of our 
national security and they benefit from our national security, 
and I think especially when it comes to these specific weapons 
we're talking about for Taiwan the demand signal has been there 
for many, many years and the fact that they haven't made the 
investments to me is, frankly, neglectful.
    Really quickly, I just want to go to other assistance we 
could be giving Taiwan. We have talked a lot about the lethal 
assistance.
    But, Dr. Ratner, in your testimony, you also talked about 
supporting the integration of Taiwan's military and civilian 
agencies on a range of issues like food, medical supplies, 
energy, infrastructure.
    Can you elaborate more on what this sort of nonlethal 
assistance looks like and how your department and the State 
Department work together to make sure that this is all 
integrated?
    Dr. Ratner. Absolutely, and would be happy to provide much 
more detail in a classified setting. What I would say is one of 
the elements that is widely recognized as important for Taiwan 
is to have defense in depth, and as General McGee described 
earlier, the difficulties of actually invading the island--the 
defense of the island itself is incredibly important and 
therein the integration between Taiwan's civilian agencies and 
its military is a really important piece of that as well as 
some of the institutional reforms that I described earlier as 
it relates to reserve reform and others.
    So there's absolutely a broad-based set of engagements 
around these issues and I'd be happy to discuss them in more 
detail in another setting.
    Ms. Resnick. I can--I can speak to a little bit although 
it's a little bit outside of my purview. We're working closely 
with Taiwan's interagency to respond effectively in a crisis 
and build societal resilience. That includes ensuring 
sufficient water, energy, food, other critical resources to 
build preparedness.
    We're also working to support Taiwan's energy security, 
encouraging Taiwan's regulatory bodies to require a larger 
emergency energy stockpile, to modernize its grid. Taiwan 
currently imports 98 percent of its energy resources and so 
we're looking to help Taiwan to accelerate their deployment of 
renewable energy.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Thank you, Ms. Jacobs.
    The Chair now recognizes the Congressman from Guam, Mr. 
Moylan.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the 
witnesses.
    As Guam's sole Member of Congress, this hearing is uniquely 
important to me. Many of the analysts who predict that China 
will invade Taiwan in the coming years also predict that China 
will launch preemptive strikes on Guam.
    To protect my home I must advocate for stabilizing policies 
in the region and for an effective deterrence against CCP 
aggression.
    So my first question, Major General McGee and Assistant 
Secretary Ratner, I've been an advocate for Guam missile 
defense because the safety of my constituents is my focus. In 
line with unfunded priority requests from the U.S. Indo-Pacific 
Command, I was able to increase funding levels for Guam missile 
defense in the House-passed NDAA.
    As I continue these efforts I would like to ask what role a 
robust missile defense of Guam plays in deterring Chinese 
aggression against Taiwan?
    Dr. Ratner. Well, Congressman, let me start off just by 
saying that as administration documents like the Missile 
Defense Review have made clear, Guam is part of the United 
States and any missile attack on Guam or any other U.S. 
territory would be met with an appropriate response.
    That is in part why the Department is requesting $1.8 
billion in the fiscal year 2024 budget for the defense of Guam. 
This investment builds off of the $892 million appropriated by 
Congress in fiscal year 2023 so nearly a 100 percent increase, 
and the Department's efforts include active missile defenses, 
enhanced regional deterrence and defense posture, ally and 
partner assurance measures and increased readiness for all the 
reasons that you describe.
    General McGee. And, sir, from the joint force perspective, 
certainly we have taken the lessons learned from Ukraine and 
are applying it to the way that we provide a comprehensive air 
defense against all threats and, of course, we have now seen it 
coming from multiples.
    It's not just--you know, it comes at every altitude from 
drones all the way up to missiles. And so we are learning 
tremendous amounts by watching that conflict and I think we are 
continuing to get better at that.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you.
    Ms. Resnick, I believe the strong relationship with our 
regional partners is a path towards stability in East Asia. 
Given the proximity to Taiwan and deep cultural ties to the 
United States, one extremely important partnership is the 
Philippines.
    In 2020 the Quad Plus dialogues included attendees such as 
Israel, Brazil, Vietnam, and New Zealand alongside with the 
usual Quad members. We have the Philippines.
    Why have the Philippines not been included in the Quad Plus 
dialogues and when will the State Department begin to include 
such an important regional ally in our multilateral 
discussions?
    Ms. Resnick. The Philippines remains a very important 
partner to the United States. I will let Dr. Ratner discuss a 
little bit about our EDCA [Enhanced Defense Cooperation 
Agreement] announcements.
    But let me just say that in recent years we have included 
the Philippines in a number of regional engagements. We have 
also boosted our investment in security in the Philippines 
through Foreign Military Financing and we have launched a 
Philippine security sector assistance roadmap with the 
Philippines this year to be able to understand the threats that 
the Philippines faces, how those interact with our--so 
understanding the mutual threats and so that we can work 
together to build a more effective security assistance 
framework for both countries.
    Dr. Ratner. I would just say strengthening and revitalizing 
our alliance with the Philippines has been one of the most 
important advances and achievements of this administration.
    We have over the last year announced new EDCA sites, the 
agreement that we have with the Philippines for U.S. access to 
Philippine facilities.
    As you know, we don't have permanent forces or bases there 
but we do have access to their sites under a decade-old 
agreement and we have increased the breadth of those sites over 
the past years to more strategic locations.
    We have also renewed bilateral maritime activity in the 
waters around the Philippines, which was an incredibly 
important development in terms of strengthening deterrence in 
the region, and we are integrating them with our closest allies 
and partners.
    I would just note that at the Shangri-La Dialogue this past 
year for the first time ever we held a defense ministerial 
between the defense ministers from the United States, 
Australia, Japan, and the Philippines, and this kind of 
networking among our allies and partners we believe is really 
important to the progress we're making toward our common vision 
for a free and open Indo-Pacific.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Mrs. Chairwoman. Madam Chair, thank 
you very much.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Thank you, Mr. Moylan.
    The Chair now recognizes Ms. Tokuda.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    You know, over the past few years we have seen a 
significant increase in bills and resolutions introduced here 
in Congress that would in some form or another politically and 
diplomatically elevate Taiwan's status.
    Unsurprisingly, the PRC has strongly protested these 
symbolic gestures as deeply destabilizing and threatening to 
the basic framework that the ``One China'' policy provides.
    There's also been some public commentary from experts about 
the risk posed by these types of symbolic gestures to Taiwan's 
security.
    For example, a recent Council on Foreign Relations task 
force recommended that the U.S. should avoid symbolic political 
and diplomatic gestures that provoke a Chinese response but do 
not meaningfully improve Taiwan's defense capabilities, 
resilience, or economic competitiveness.
    Ms. Resnick, how does the PRC interpret or perceive 
congressional initiatives that are symbolic in nature that 
suggest an elevation of the U.S.-Taiwan relationship into 
formal relations and how do these symbolic gestures affect 
diplomatic efforts between the administration and the PRC as 
well?
    Ms. Resnick. What we are focused on is improving Taiwan's 
self-defense capabilities. Symbols of sovereignty are one way 
that we can do that but we don't think that that is the most 
effective way for us to be able to do that.
    So we would focus more on those areas that provide Taiwan 
with real security and not symbolic security.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you.
    Major General McGee, how has the PRC used such symbolic 
gestures to escalate tensions, further alter the status quo in 
cross-strait relations? How would you assess the impact of 
these symbolic gestures on deterring PRC aggression overall?
    General McGee. I'd like to defer to my Policy friend who 
may have a better insight on that piece, frankly.
    Dr. Ratner. Look, maybe what I'll say here is part of the 
reason why this matters is because as we have spoken about at 
the hearing today, what we see is a trend of growing 
international attention among the international community to 
this issue, and the more countries around the world are 
committed to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait the less 
likely it is for Beijing to initiate military action because 
they understand what the repercussions would be on the 
international stage.
    As part of that, it is really important that the region see 
who the aggressor is here and who the one is here that is 
precipitating conflict and coercion. And therefore what we see 
is day-to-day PRC military, economic, political pressure 
against Taiwan and it's important that Taiwan itself but also 
the United States is not taking political actions that the 
Indo-Pacific region and the world see as leading to heightening 
tensions.
    So I thought the prompt of your question was really well 
put and support everything you said there.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you.
    Maybe to take it to a slightly different direction, looking 
at our forward posture in the Western Pacific, I believe both 
Dr. Ratner and Major General McGee's written testimony 
emphasizes the importance of a forward leaning U.S. force in 
the Western Pacific and a rigorous campaigning as part of our 
efforts to deter aggression against Taiwan and our allies and 
partners in the region.
    Dr. Ratner, perhaps this question is for you. As you know, 
we have addressed significant challenges with military 
infrastructure needs in Hawaii, where I am from, and that left 
unaddressed could complicate our ability to support and sustain 
increased efforts in our forward posture and campaigning in the 
Western Pacific.
    In your assessment, how important is it to your work and 
reassuring our allies and partners in the region that we invest 
in sustaining and upgrading our military infrastructure?
    Dr. Ratner. Our forward posture and presence in the region, 
including in Hawaii, is fundamentally important to our defense 
position in the region. It's fundamentally important to 
deterrence and it's an area where this administration has been 
incredibly focused and, frankly, made really historic advances 
over the past year.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. And, you know, as you know, Dr. 
Ratner, we are close to finalizing renegotiations of the 
Compacts of Free Association [COFA] with Palau, the Marshall 
Islands, and Micronesia.
    How critical is it that Congress expeditiously approve 
these agreements in terms of our forward posture in the Western 
Pacific? And as we approach the end of the fiscal year why is 
it so important that Congress provide funding for these 
countries under a continuing resolution?
    You know, if we fail to act do we actually provide the PRC 
with a window of opportunity, even a temporary one, to fill the 
void and complicate a very strategic relationship?
    Dr. Ratner. I would just say the compact states in the COFA 
agreement is incredibly important for our position in the 
region, as you described, and we look forward to working with 
Congress to find a solution to sustain those agreements.
    Ms. Tokuda. And, clearly, funding and support for this now 
and going forward is absolutely critical to maintain the 
relationship and not provide the PRC with any opportunity to 
come and fill the gap.
    Dr. Ratner. Absolutely.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Thank you, Ms. Tokuda.
    The Chair now recognizes the Congressman from Texas, Mr. 
Fallon.
    Mr. Fallon. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Xi Jinping has repeatedly and publicly stated that he's 
willing to use force to unify China and bring Taiwan, as he 
says, back under control in one nation.
    I find that comment interesting because the Communist 
Chinese have never ruled in Taiwan and I just think that's a 
historical note to mention.
    He's called it a natural requirement and for them to be 
reunited and stating that the use of force is their policy, 
preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan by force if 
perceived as necessary by Beijing.
    And then former INDOPACOM [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command] 
commander Admiral Philip Davidson stated in 2021 when talking 
about China's potential for invading Taiwan said, and I quote, 
``I think the threat is manifest during this decade, in fact, 
in the next 6 years,'' and that means, of course, by 2027.
    While nobody wants war what is the best way to prevent it? 
And, you know, you have to take great care when you talk 
about--when you use comparisons to the Nazis or Hitler and 
things like that because it's, you know, overused.
    But I think it is instructive to listen to what dictators 
say. In January of 1939, Hitler gave a speech and he outlined 
two goals. He wanted war and he wanted to annihilate the Jewish 
race in Europe. And then, of course, in September of that year 
he went ahead and tried to accomplish both objectives.
    And then in 2021 in July, Vladimir Putin released an essay 
and it was on the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians, 
and he went on to say essentially that they're not like 
brothers; they share the same soul. Which, of course, is rather 
chilling.
    And then 7 months later he claimed he was going to liberate 
and de-Nazify Ukraine. So I want to offer these examples not 
to, of course, stoke fears but to illustrate that we need to 
listen to what dictators are saying, and we can all hope for 
the best but we need to prepare for the worst and I'm a little 
afraid that we're not necessarily maybe preparing for the 
worst.
    Dr. Ratner, if you could, and I'm being not facetious here 
but serious, I don't know what the Biden administration policy 
is vis-a-vis Taiwan and a potential Chinese attack. Will we 
defend Taiwan if attacked? Is that the policy?
    Dr. Ratner. The policy, Congressman, is one of strategic 
ambiguity----
    Mr. Fallon. Okay.
    Dr. Ratner [continuing]. And has been for decades and we 
believe that remains most important to maintain that status quo 
in our policy. We are clear-eyed about the PRC threat.
    Mr. Fallon. And I apologize. I don't mean to interrupt you 
but we just have a very limited time and I wanted to get to 
your point and your answer about strategic ambiguity.
    I think that was an okay policy when China didn't have the 
capability to invade Taiwan successfully, which, clearly, years 
ago they had not the capability to do so.
    They have it now. So I would argue that--well, let me ask 
you this question. Is--do you think Xi Jinping is more likely 
than not to invade Taiwan if there were two circumstances: if 
the United States President, whoever it was, said we will 
defend Taiwan--that's scenario A--if attacked by the Chinese 
Communists, or we maintain strategic ambiguity. Which--if you 
are sitting in a think tank or you're in the war room at the 
White House what do you think is more likely?
    Dr. Ratner. I think the effects of changing our policy to 
one of strategic clarity away from strategic ambiguity would 
not strengthen deterrence by the United States. I think it 
would increase political tensions and make conflict more likely 
and I think it would cause us to lose the support of our allies 
and partners as we described earlier.
    Mr. Fallon. I mean, I respectfully disagree. I think you 
have to do it in the right way. We're not saying--we're not 
really changing the political policy at all. We're not saying 
that we support Chinese--or Taiwanese independence, because I 
do think what you just said that would exacerbate the issue.
    All we're saying is if China uses force then we'll defend 
Taiwan. I would argue that it's going to increase deterrence 
because deterrence works. We know what dictators and 
authoritarians do. They avoid strength and they attack 
weakness.
    If they--if he thinks he can grab it--let me ask you this. 
If Xi thought he could grab Taiwan, have 6 months maybe of 
economic sanctions, and then the world--much like Crimea 
happened with Putin, do you think he'd do it?
    Dr. Ratner. When we think about deterrence what we think 
about is ensuring that he does not believe he could exact 
aggression against Taiwan at acceptable cost.
    Mr. Fallon. So do you--but do you think then if he did what 
Putin did--Putin successfully grabbed Crimea. I think we'd all 
agree with that. Do you think if Xi could follow that model he 
would do it?
    Dr. Ratner. I guess it depends what you mean by the Putin 
model. If Xi Jinping believed by invading----
    Mr. Fallon. The world, largely, forgot about what happened. 
I mean, we normalized in 6-12 months and everybody went back to 
the way they were living. That's what I mean.
    Dr. Ratner. Look, I don't want to get into hypotheticals. 
What I would say is I understand the questions that you're 
asking and it is at the heart of how we think about deterrence 
and ensuring that Xi Jinping does not believe he can do that at 
acceptable cost. And we think today that is the case and that's 
why we say deterrence is real and strong and that's why we say 
we do not think an invasion is imminent or inevitable and we 
are doing more than ever to keep it that way.
    Mr. Fallon. I'm afraid that----
    Mrs. Kiggans. The Congressman's time has expired.
    Mr. Fallon. Yeah. I'm afraid that he may think in very 
short order that it is acceptable.
    Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Mrs. Kiggans. The Chair now--the Chair now recognizes the 
Congresswoman from Virginia, Congresswoman McClellan.
    Ms. McClellan. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the 
witnesses for being here today.
    A key support mechanism for our military alliances in the 
Pacific is a robust diplomatic presence. Yet, we face the very 
real prospect of severe cuts to the State and foreign 
operations budget that funds the State Department, USAID [U.S. 
Agency for International Development], and other diplomatic 
programs.
    How would significant cuts to the international affairs 
budget complicate efforts to maintain alliances and ensure we 
are able to present a united front against political aggression 
by the Chinese government against Taiwan?
    Ms. Resnick. Congresswoman, thank you for the question.
    We have used the diplomatic budget effectively throughout 
the Indo-Pacific to be able to shore up alliances and 
partnerships where it comes to reimagining our alliances and 
partnerships with Japan, with Vietnam, with Korea, with Taiwan 
of course, with the Philippines.
    If the--if there are cuts to the State foreign ops 
[operations] budget--and I can speak from the perspective of 
the IMET [International Military Education and Training] 
account, our peacekeeping operations account, and our Foreign 
Military Financing--because these budgets are so heavily 
earmarked we have very little flexibility. If there were cuts 
what we would have to do is look at anything that isn't 
earmarked and put it on the cutting room floor.
    And there is no earmark for Taiwan. There are--there are 
very few earmarks in the Indo-Pacific. And so we would be 
looking at keeping status quo, which is that 70 percent of the 
FMF budget is in the Middle East. We are--we cannot afford to 
do that.
    Ms. McClellan. Thank you. Secretary Ratner or Secretary 
Resnick, the United States, Japan, and South Korea recently 
concluded a summit that made progress on a number of fronts to 
expand trilateral collaboration.
    Can you elaborate on how we are expanding collaboration 
with our trilateral allies, particularly the joint military 
industrial base capacity expansion and specialization, and what 
areas we are looking to further expand coordination in the 
future?
    Dr. Ratner. Sure. I'm happy to start, to say that the 
leader-level meeting that President Biden hosted at Camp David 
truly was historic in terms of bringing together two of our 
closest allies around the world, Japan and South Korea, and I 
think there's no question that all three of those countries are 
more secure when we are all working more closely together.
    During that summit there were two particular announcements 
that were made as it relates to military cooperation. One was 
to advance a program on data sharing for early missile warning 
data between the three countries, particularly related to the 
North Korea threat.
    We're making progress on that and hope to have that in 
place by the end of this calendar year. And, secondarily, in 
addition, to be developing a more regularized program of 
trilateral military exercises and cooperation.
    That's also under development and we think this is a really 
positive trend and it's one that is not just happening in 
Northeast Asia. I should say that we are working increasingly 
in combination with our allies and partners. Japan, Australia, 
and the United States also as a trilateral configuration are 
engaging in new and unprecedented forms of military cooperation 
and we think this is really important for deterrence and for 
regional security.
    Ms. McClellan. Thank you.
    One of the alarming but not unexpected dynamics of Russia's 
war with Ukraine has been the tendency of African nations to 
remain uninvolved or continue to engage with Russia despite its 
gruesome war crimes, which I would characterize as colonial 
war--a colonial war of aggression.
    Would we expect a similar dynamic to play out in a Chinese 
invasion of Taiwan and how are we working to increase 
engagement with our African partners that would make them less 
likely to side with China or continue to treat China normally 
should it move aggressively toward Taiwan?
    Ms. Resnick. Thanks for that question, and this is 
something that we work on every day globally but including in 
Africa to make the case for the rules-based international order 
and how Africa especially can benefit from it.
    We have a lot of work to do here, and especially in the 
context of Wagner operations in Africa we have a lot of work to 
do in order to remain competitive.
    That is something that we have started in a number of 
countries and we're happy to come back and brief you in a 
different environment. We understand that there are some 
lessons learned from these kind of conversations that could 
apply in a Taiwan scenario and we'll continue to work those 
relationships.
    Ms. McClellan. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes the 
Congressman from Georgia, Dr. McCormick.
    Dr. McCormick. Thank you, Ms. Chair.
    Thank you to the witnesses for coming here today and 
testifying.
    I think everybody in this room agrees that Taiwan is 
extremely important to us strategically. It's the linchpin of 
the first island of the chain and as for now we obviously have 
a lot of critical things going on in the area.
    I'm worried about the technologies that it contains as far 
as we really maintain the leader in AI [artificial 
intelligence] and industry but where the AI chips are produced 
is an island that entirely produces 100 percent of our AI 
chips.
    My concern is if China does what it says it's going to do--
and I'll take them for the face of their word--by 2027 and we 
don't have a plan up here to take over that, what 
capabilities--and I'll direct this to, you Major General 
McGee--what capabilities or what kind of agreement do we have 
with the Taiwanese in denying Chinese access to that AI 
production in the case of an invasion or our access to that 
same production, because without AI, of course, being the 
leading technology of our day--matter of fact, of any day--that 
will affect our economy and our--and our ability to produce the 
next leading edge of technology?
    How do we keep them from accessing or obtaining that and 
keeping us from denying that access?
    General McGee. Sir, I appreciate that question.
    I think export control, though, might be more of a 
Department of State question.
    Dr. McCormick. I'm actually talking in the case of an 
invasion. So actually a war. If they do what they say, by force 
try to take Taiwan--and you can defer this question but it goes 
back to a conflict where Taiwan and China are in a conflict, 
how do we maintain our access to a hard-value asset which we 
cannot produce ourselves and we're 2 years away from it even if 
we do groundbreaking now, and how do we deny the Chinese from 
obtaining that same hard asset in a time of war?
    Dr. Ratner. I'd be happy to discuss that in another setting 
but would say, of course, the broader question of how do we 
maintain our advantages in peacetime and then how do we 
maintain resilience or build resilience into crisis and 
conflict is something we absolutely are looking at in terms of 
trying to increase our supply chain resiliency of our defense 
industrial base and support programs with domestic and 
alternative materials as well as innovative manufacturing.
    So you're identifying an important challenge and we're 
laser focused on it and would be happy to follow up in a 
different setting.
    Dr. McCormick. Okay. So we'll put the war stuff on the--on 
the table because I get that. I'm a military guy. So let's talk 
peacetime.
    One of the things I think is great maybe in a sort of 
strange way is the Arunachal Pradesh region of India, which is 
disputed by China, which has about 300,000 troops on the border 
there disputing that. That's just per side.
    So you have 600,000 troops right there in that region, 
which I think they have to rotate every 3 months or so because 
the altitude is so high, which is a great deterrence when you 
talk about what China has to face in that region, which I think 
is great to have great strategic allies in the area.
    When we talk about deterrence, obviously, we did a horrible 
job of deterring Russia from invading Ukraine. We knew--he had 
talked about it. Nobody took it at face value. Then he did it. 
We didn't do a good job. We weren't strong enough to deter them 
from doing that.
    What are we doing deterrence wise other than saying we're 
investing in the military, we have great training, we have 
great assets. But what are we doing to truly make it--make 
China think second thoughts other than supporting Ukraine, 
which I think is a great deterrent, saying, you know, we are 
committed to our friends.
    But what other things are we bringing to the table that 
make China go, I really don't want any part of that, rather 
than what we just discussed where we can't really give a good 
answer as far as what do we do when they actually invade?
    Dr. Ratner. Maybe I'll start and ask General McGee to build 
upon the question.
    I mean, look, we have a National Defense Strategy that has 
informed a budget, that is focused on the capabilities that we 
need to deter and prevail, if necessary, against the PRC, for 
the first time a strategy focused on the PRC as the primary 
challenge and our budget request reflects that.
    So we are investing in the capabilities we need. Joint 
Staff has been working very concertedly on the joint 
warfighting concept and operational concepts that would--that 
are designed to overcome operational problems that the PRC is 
trying to present.
    So it's capabilities and concepts. We are building out our 
forward defense perimeter in the Indo-Pacific and have made 
really important gains over the last year in Japan, in the 
Philippines, in Australia, in Papua New Guinea such that we are 
forward in the region and we are strengthening our alliances 
and partnerships including in ways that are relevant to 
potential China-related contingencies----
    Dr. McCormick. And I know I'm out of time so I'll just 
reinforce how important the Quad is, how important our 
alliances and strategic alliance there and also our investment 
in the area not just in what we do because we don't like 
nuclear powers to go against each other but investment in other 
strategically important allies in the region. That's why we do 
what we do.
    Thank you. With that I yield.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Thank you.
    The Chair now recognizes the Congresswoman from New Jersey, 
Ms. Sherrill.
    Ms. Sherrill. Thank you.
    First, I want to thank all of you for your hard work during 
these really troubling times as we face a variety of complex 
pressures around the world.
    As a member of the Select Committee on Strategic 
Competition with the Chinese Communist Party we know that 
sufficient basing, supply chains, logistics efforts in the 
INDOPACOM are critically important but also the role of 
ensuring that economic factors at play are another critical and 
sometimes as important role as we, the CCP, and our global 
partners react to the Taiwanese contingency.
    So I secured in this year's NDAA an amendment to have DOD 
analyze where they can better partner with the Commerce 
Department so we can ensure that economic and business factors 
are thought of as we game plan our Indo-Pacific efforts and 
assess consequences of our actions.
    To each of you can, you give a quick overview of your 
current efforts with Commerce and where you might see further 
partnerships?
    Ms. Resnick. I can say that from a State Department 
perspective one of the things that we work on--and again, this 
is a little bit outside of my area in the Bureau of Political-
Military Affairs--but we work on responding to economic 
coercion and we work with the interagency on doing that.
    That is both in the--in the Russia context and in the PRC 
context, conducting tabletop exercises with respect to economic 
coercion and making sure that we're able to shore up our allies 
and partners if they are victims of that kind of economic 
coercion.
    Dr. Ratner. And the Department of Defense works closely 
with Commerce as well as Treasury and other economic agencies 
at the intersection of military and economic affairs.
    We have worked closely with them on export controls that 
are related to technology competition with the PRC relevant to 
PLA modernization. We worked with the Commerce Department and, 
of course, the Treasury Department on the new policy on 
outbound investment screening and the Executive order on that 
new process, and we continue to work with the Commerce 
Department as well as interagency partners on potential 
response options for both crisis and conflict.
    So we see them as an integral partner in these scenarios 
and are continuing to work with them closely.
    General McGee. Ma'am, as you know, this is a complicated 
and challenging problem and it needs a whole-of-government 
approach.
    As a member--you know, as the Joint Staff we are fully 
engaged in the interagency process and we know that Commerce 
always has a really important role and a voice in all of those 
discussions and follow-on actions.
    Ms. Sherrill. Well, I'm heartened to hear your responses 
because, as you know, we work a lot on the Armed Services 
Committee to make sure that we are implementing all the 
deterrent military capabilities we can but, of course, the 
economic piece is a critical part of that deterrence as well.
    And as we go forward how can we as a nation with our 
critical partner in Taiwan continue to improve interoperability 
with the Taiwanese? What additional resources can Congress 
provide to ensure we effectively strengthen our relationship 
to, again, bolster deterrence?
    General McGee. I think Congress has taken great steps to 
help increase the military assistance with the Presidential 
authorization.
    I think, as we mentioned here, an appropriation would be--
would be tremendously helpful with that as well as opposed to 
just an authorization.And I think--as I mentioned earlier, I 
think where assistance can be provided to help with Taiwan is 
their concept of a joint defense in order to defend that island 
nation from an air threat, a sea threat, cyber and space and 
that's complicated and difficult within military operations and 
I think that's an area of potential great assistance.
    Ms. Resnick. From a State Department perspective we agree 
that fully funding the Taiwan Enhanced Resiliency Act for 
Foreign Military Financing would be really useful. That would 
allow things to get on contract more quickly but in the 
meantime to provide an interim solution as we wait for industry 
to provide Taiwan with what it needs.
    Having backfill--just to reiterate Dr. Ratner's point, 
having backfill--appropriating backfill for Presidential 
drawdown authority to allow the Defense Department to take from 
its own stocks, that provides the interim solution until 
industry is able to provide something to Taiwan.
    Ms. Sherrill. Well, thank you all again, and can I say 
thank you as well to the State Department for coming to this 
hearing. We don't always have you here and hearing from sort of 
the whole of government is very, very helpful.
    So thank you again. I appreciate it.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes the 
Congressman from Florida, Mr. Mills.
    Mr. Mills. Thank you so much, Ms. Chair.
    I want to start out by going to a question that was posed 
moments ago, Ms. Resnick, with regards to the approval process. 
As you know, the DDTC [Directorate of Defense Trade Controls] 
has an actual DDTC response that you can track from your 
submittals on a DSP-83 to a DSP-5 and I can tell you that your 
comment that it's 48 hours an approval couldn't be further from 
the truth.
    I've watched where multiple times the DSP-5 was held up 
within the DDTC and in some cases they are returned without 
approval or returned without any type of response--negative or 
positive--without any actual understanding of why, even when 
the National Security Council and others have approved it.
    I also noted that you said about wanting to put the blame 
on industry. But the reality is--is that when there's no 
confidence in industry that the approval is going to come out, 
knowing the prolonged timeline in which we submit a proposal 
which is supposed to get to the LCTA [lowest cost technically 
acceptable] BAF--you know, BAFO [best and final offer], this 
timeline could be a year, 2 years, which is why I've been very 
much advocating on procurement reform to ensure that we could 
also expedite these processes.
    But again, the idea that it would take industry long to 
purge lines to ensure that the previous contract didn't 
actually have any overlapping materials to ensure that it was a 
legitimate new cost doesn't take industry that long and I've 
seen where they've done it.
    They like to try and add that it costs more than it really 
does--and I know how they fluff the things on this--and they 
claim that they use GAAP, our generally accepted accounting 
principles, but we know how that's been abused.
    But I want to go back to outcome, not process. The OEM 
[original equipment manufacturer] for F-16 parts--and we know 
we just had, roughly, 103 Chinese aircraft that had basically 
incurred a little bit of that on the line, kind of preemptive 
response that allowed the Taiwanese having to spin up--every 
time they cycle that aircraft for the F-16 that leads to a 
closer point in which they're actually going to say, okay, 
well, last time that we did this exercise we saw a 10 percent 
increase in how many people responded than now.
    That must mean that they don't have the necessary part. So 
it gives the Chinese also an intelligence capability to gather 
whether or not we're responding in a timely manner and whether 
or not that their ability to ramp up to be able to deter this 
so, again, providing very strategic military information.
    What can we do to increase the approvals? Not the amount of 
funding, not whether it's an FMS, FMF, or a DCS [direct 
commercial sales] contract, which is even better for the United 
States economy, but to speed up the actual process?
    Because I can tell you, ma'am, it is not 48-hour approvals.
    Ms. Resnick. First of all, Mr. Mills, thank you for your 
leadership on this and for bringing up these very important 
issues.
    Highly advanced defense articles, as you know, must go 
through an interagency clearance process that the Directorate 
of Defense Trade Controls manages. So that goes through several 
different stakeholders in the Bureau of Political-Military 
Affairs.
    It also goes through other stakeholders within this--within 
the State Department and within DOD, within the Pentagon. We 
are expediting arms sales to Taiwan as quickly as possible. We 
approve--as I said, we approve most FMS cases to Taiwan within 
48 hours. Those are the items that are under congressional 
threshold.
    Industrial production capacity and not State's review 
process is what is holding us back at this point. With respect 
to DDTC timelines, I understand that they may be different than 
FMS timelines and you probably know best.
    But understanding from an outcome perspective what we are 
trying to do here is improve those timelines regardless of 
where the choke points are.
    Mr. Mills. Well, I can tell you that I'm committed to try 
and work with you, your team, the DDTC to ensure that we 
actually do get the necessary reforms to support industry and 
support upcoming response.
    You know, having run in multiple, you know, defense 
companies in my past I can tell you my experience, whether it 
was with a DSP-5, DSP-83, dealing with ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] Form 249s, you name it. We 
know the over-regulations.
    But I do want to ensure that we're able to respond and I 
want to comment on something that some of my colleagues have 
talked about. They keep talking about the--how we handle 
Ukraine determines the outcome of Taiwan and I slightly 
disagree with this. And I disagree with this because what we 
don't recognize is the non-kinetic economic and resource supply 
chain capabilities that China has really tried to bolster in an 
effort to try and prevent America from having. You know, the 
Belt and Road Initiative is a good point where they try to look 
at Eurasian expansion.
    They look at the domination of Africa and Oceania to cut 
off Western Hemisphere's supply chain while simultaneously 
utilizing OPEC [Organization of the Petroleum Exporting 
Countries], WHO [World Health Organization], WF, and others as 
a way to attack the U.S. dollar as a global currency and we 
have seen this. So we're not focusing in enough, in my opinion, 
on the non-kinetic elements of influence, messaging, as well as 
for the economic warfare of things.
    So it's troubling when Joe Biden at the G-20 summit talks 
about how much he wants China's economy to grow while not 
giving a whole lot of confidence to our abilities to support 
developing nations.
    And my final thing--and I know I'm out of time, Madam 
Chair--but my final thing is that we kept saying that we don't 
want to send the message that we're being unreliable. We lost 
that fight 2 years ago when we walked out of Afghanistan.
    With that, I yield back.
    Mrs. Kiggans. The gentleman's time has expired.
    The Chair now recognizes the Congressman from Texas, Mr. 
Veasey.
    Mr. Veasey. Madam Chair, thank you very much, and I want to 
thank the panel for being here today.
    I wanted to ask about--given Xi's statements about 
reunification with Taiwan, how should we interpret the CCP's 
commitment to peaceful reunification while also not renouncing 
the use of force, and I was hoping that you all had an 
assessment on those statements that he made.
    Dr. Ratner. I would just say I think what he has stated is 
fairly clear. I think there would be a--there's a preference 
for peaceful unification but the PRC has not renounced its 
willingness to use force to achieve that aim if it deems 
necessary and if it believes it can do so at acceptable cost.
    Mr. Veasey. And also, how does the Department of Defense 
assess the progress of the People's Liberation Army 
modernization program as outlined in the China military power 
report and its implications for Taiwan?
    General.
    General McGee. I think we have seen an expansion of their 
capabilities, really sort of a broad base. We think many of 
those capabilities would enhance their ability to launch a 
cross-strait invasion.
    But that does not mean that would be an easy operational 
challenge. I still want to highlight the significant 
operational difficulties for China to be able to conduct that 
operation.
    Mr. Veasey. I know that CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] 
Director Burns mentioned that Xi instructed the PLA to be ready 
for a successful invasion by 2027 and I wanted to sort of 
couple that with something that happened back in the 1990s 
under President Clinton's administration, the third Taiwan 
Strait crisis.
    I know that that particular incident that took place back 
in the 1990s--that that was a really big influence, you know, 
on the Chinese as far as the way that they see themselves 
projected in the region as far as ocean power was concerned.
    Could you sort of talk a little bit about the significance 
of that and how maybe that plays a role in how the Chinese 
think today?
    Dr. Ratner. Look, I think what I would say without getting 
into their own psychology--what I would say is that we are 
clear-eyed about the PRC challenge. The National Defense 
Strategy identifies the PRC as the Department's top pacing 
challenge and the National Security Strategy describes the PRC 
as the only country with the will and increasingly the 
capability to refashion the international community or the 
international order in line with its authoritarian ambitions.
    So we are aware of what their preferences are, what they're 
trying to achieve. However, what we are trying to do is ensure 
that they cannot achieve those aims at acceptable cost.
    Mr. Veasey. I also wanted to ask you, we know that the 
Chinese have been, you know, vehemently opposed to any sort of 
upgrades on F-16s or new F-16s there to Taiwan. If there were 
an invasion how helpful would F-16s actually be for Taiwan?
    Would they--would they play a significant role? I mean, 
obviously, the--you know, the Chinese military operation is 
much more larger and much more expanse than that of the 
Taiwanese.
    Would those planes be a help to the--to Taiwan, 
particularly when there's a new generation of plane out?
    Ms. Resnick. We have notified a number of cases during this 
administration to support Taiwan's F-16 program, which we 
understand is very useful in defending Taiwan's airspace, 
particularly with some of the gray zone activities.
    I can say that this is something that we will continue to 
support and we understand that Taiwan finds their F-16s 
valuable.
    Mr. Veasey. Okay. Well, thank you very much.
    Madam Chair, I yield back.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Thank you very much, and I just wanted to 
thank our witnesses for taking time. I know--I know you've been 
here for a good portion of your day. So we're going to wrap up 
this committee meeting. I just have a few last questions for 
you guys.
    So I had the privilege of traveling with Congressman 
Wittman last month to Southeast Asia. We went to Japan, the 
Philippines, and to Taiwan and could see kind of up close just 
what is going on in that part of the world.
    One of the places we went was to Kadena Air Base and the 
complaints we heard were about infrastructure and their 
inability to continue to do their very tip of the spear mission 
without some infrastructure improvements and some quality of 
life upgrades. Also talking to the Marines in Okinawa just 
about housing.
    I know that we're challenged in even the health care 
department. We're having our military members and their 
families being seen off base.
    So we also learned, though, that our allied countries they 
are very invested in our partnership so we know that Japan is 
putting in 2 percent of their GDP [gross domestic product], the 
highest ever, into their defense budget. We know that Taiwan's 
is about 2.7 percent, I think, of their GDP. So we're seeing 
them put their money where their mouths are.
    So I guess my ask and my request is are we also asking them 
to invest in some infrastructure for us in our base. We're 
happy to be there and happy to partner and be allies with our 
friends but we need some assistance here. Our defense budget is 
already challenged.
    Those are parts of the world that don't have 
representatives that can fight for some of their base needs and 
infrastructure needs. So is that--is that in the works? Are our 
allies willing partners in helping in our military investment?
    Dr. Ratner. Well, thank you for all of those comments. I 
was actually just yesterday engaging with General Rupp, 
commander of U.S. Forces Japan, and General Sklenka, the deputy 
commander out at INDOPACOM, on quality-of-life issues 
associated with our forces in Japan.
    It's incredibly important for the Department and the 
Secretary and we will continue to do whatever we can to address 
some of those issues that you described.
    I have also been encouraged, as you have, by the approach 
that our allies and partners have taken. You mentioned Taiwan 
increasing its defense budget. We're very encouraged by that.
    We have seen Japan set on course to double its defense 
budget over the next 5 years. The Philippines is also investing 
in new ways and the Australians absolutely investing in their 
own military, and we think that's important for their own 
contributions to regional security.
    It increases their ability to contribute to our alliance in 
new ways as we think about integrating them in roles and 
missions, and in a number of instances they are also 
contributing to infrastructure and supporting our forward 
presence.
    So we think that's really important and I think the role of 
our allies and partners is key to our success here.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Good. I just ask that we continue to 
prioritize that as well in addition to warfighting.
    And then another question posed to us in Japan was the 
issue of ship repair, and I represent a district that has a 
large ship repair industry in Virginia and that often complains 
they don't have enough business and they--you know, it's a lot 
of factors.
    We have not enough ships. I wish we had more. But the 
Japanese want to be more involved. I want to make sure we're 
repairing ships, you know, as quickly as possible. You know, 
God forbid, there's a conflict we're going to need to repair 
ships closer to where the action is.
    So how can we ensure that we're being protective of our 
ship repair industry while prioritizing the speed and just 
capabilities we have in Southeast Asia and being inclusive of 
Japan?
    Dr. Ratner. I'm happy to take that question for the record.
    [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix 
on page 81.]
    Dr. Ratner. I understand there's a lot of factors here 
including some of the domestic factors and getting that balance 
right about our own domestic industrial capability here 
associated with ship repair while also thinking about what 
contributions our allies and partners can make and what the 
operational requirements might be is a really important 
question.
    I understand there are conversations underway now between 
the administration and Congress about some of these issues and 
look forward to engaging on them, going forward.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Okay. Good. Thank you. And then they also 
brought up the issue of cognitive warfare and we were there 
during Fukushima when they were--there was some environmental 
groups and there was some interference from China.
    They had a lot of bad press. They utilize cyber technology, 
the media, to be influential to the Japanese people, which 
right now are overwhelmingly supportive of our alliance and our 
relationship--the relationship we have with Japan.
    But just thinking forward, you know, are we cooperating and 
being supportive of them on that cognitive warfare front as 
well? I think it's an important thing that we sometimes 
overlook, but just wanted to hear how we're prioritizing that, 
too.
    Dr. Ratner. Congresswoman, we are throughout the region 
including in Japan and we do--I think what you've described is 
a really good example of what we see throughout the Indo-
Pacific in terms of PRC propaganda and information operations 
and disinformation.
    We have seen it around the Fukushima issue. We have seen it 
throughout Taiwan in a number of ways, in the Philippines as 
well, in Australia and elsewhere, as the PRC is trying to 
undermine our alliances and undermine the support for political 
leaders who want to work with the United States.
    We're working with these partners in terms of their own 
cyber capabilities, their own cyber hygiene, as well as our own 
demands, that we do as much as we can to be transparent about 
the information we have about what the PRC is doing and we'll 
continue to be focused on that.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Good. Thank you very much. My time has 
expired.
    So I thank our witnesses for being here and our members for 
their participation, and the committee now stands adjourned. 
Thank you.
    [Whereupon, at 12:55 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

             RESPONSE TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MR. CARBAJAL

    Dr. Ratner. The Department is increasingly concerned about the 
People's Republic of China's continued ``gray zone'' military activity 
against Taiwan. These activities are destabilizing, increase the risk 
of miscalculation, and undermine regional peace.
    We continue to believe in the importance of investing in well-
integrated, asymmetric, whole-of-society defense that maintains and 
improves Taiwan's readiness and capacity to respond to ``gray zone'' 
activities.   [See page 25.]

              RESPONSE TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MR. BANKS
    Ms. Resnick. As of May 2023, Taiwan had access to interest rates 
hovering around 1-2 percent domestically. Under the current FMF direct 
loan authority, the Department is prohibited from offering an interest 
rate on FMF loans that is lower than the prevailing interest rate on 
marketable Treasury securities of similar maturity. Our rates would 
only be competitive if the Department were authorized to offer an 
interest rate below what Taiwan can access domestically. We have asked 
for the authority to offer lower interest rates.   [See page 26.]

             RESPONSE TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MRS. KIGGANS
    Dr. Ratner. The Department is focused on addressing challenges 
facing our domestic ship repair industry through workforce development, 
increased use of data analytics, and improvements in the supply chain 
supporting public shipyards. Our activities with allies and partners in 
the Indo-Pacific region do not adversely affect these efforts.   [See

              QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MEMBERS POST HEARING

                           September 19, 2023

=======================================================================

      

                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. WITTMAN

    Mr. Wittman. Which weapons systems would be best suited for the EDA 
program and Taiwan's defense purposes?
    Ms. Resnick. The only weapons that can be transferred under the 
Excess Defense Articles program are those that have been determined by 
the relevant military service to be excess to its needs. Those 
determinations are made within the Department of Defense, and the State 
Department is not involved in those decisions. Once weapons have been 
declared excess, the State Department coordinates with relevant DOD 
entities to gauge global demand, identify the recipient, and facilitate 
the transfer, which may involve a Congressional Notification.
    The interagency has, in close coordination with Taiwan 
counterparts, identified a list of capabilities that Taiwan should 
prioritize through defense trade or other means, including EDA. That 
list includes cost-efficient, distributed, mobile, lethal, and 
resilient capabilities that best support an asymmetric defense 
strategy. This list, as required by Section 5502(e)(1) of the NDAA, was 
provided to Congress on in May 2023. Some priority categories include, 
but are not limited to, anti-ship missiles, command and control and 
redundant communication systems, early warning radars, integrated air 
and missile defense, and mobile artillery systems.
    Mr. Wittman. How long does it take the US to provide weapons 
systems to a recipient nation under the EDA program?
    Ms. Resnick. The transfer time depends on numerous factors, 
including the condition of the system, whether the system requires any 
refurbishments or exportability modifications, the partner's ability to 
absorb the equipment, and whether Congressional notification is 
required. The timeline could be as short as several months or, in some 
cases, span multiple years.
    Mr. Wittman. Would the United States be able to complete an LCS EDA 
request before President Tsai leaves office next Spring?
    Ms. Resnick. Consistent with 10 USC 8677, a ship that is in excess 
of 3,000 tons or less than 20 years old cannot be transferred without a 
legislative enactment. As such, absent a change in the statutory 
requirement, the process of approving and transferring such a ship to 
Taiwan can only begin after the legislation is enacted. If such 
legislation were enacted, a significant amount of time would still be 
required to support the LCS' refurbishment needs and train the Taiwan 
Navy on the new capability.
    Mr. Wittman. Ms. Resnick, in recent years the PRC has increased 
gray zone pressures including increased frequency and complex military 
exercises in aircraft, manned and unmanned, flying closer to Taiwan 
than in years past. Do you think there are steps Taiwan could take to 
deter gray zone pressure?
    Ms. Resnick. The PRC's continued provocative actions in the Taiwan 
Strait are indicative of its unilateral attempts to change the status 
quo, which has preserved global peace and stability for decades. The 
PRC's activities include malicious cyber activity, disinformation 
campaigns, economic coercion, and military exercises. Taiwan and the 
United States must take all reasonable measures to strengthen Taiwan's 
self-defense capabilities and bolster cross-Strait deterrence. To that 
end, Taiwan's defense budget has significantly increased, and it is 
acquiring advanced capabilities to better track and respond to PRC 
military activity in the gray zone. In parallel, maritime security and 
domain awareness have been prioritized within our bilateral security 
cooperation efforts, and countering disinformation is a major focus of 
our discussions. It is essential that Taiwan is prepared to respond to 
a range of potential contingencies.
    Mr. Wittman. General McGee, to what extent has the Department 
worked with Taiwan to ensure resilient communications amongst the 
Taiwanese people in the event of a catastrophic event? How is the 
Department prioritizing telecommunications network security for Taiwan, 
especially in light of the infrastructure concerns that came to light 
on Guam?
    General McGee. The Department continues to take steps to accelerate 
and bolster Taiwan's self-defense capabilities, network, and 
communications resilience. We are working with industry partners to 
determine how best to partner with them in delivering capabilities to 
Taiwan, to include areas for investment to increase production 
capacity, bolster supply chains, and innovate procurement. We are also 
reviewing resources and/or policy changes to speed up timelines.

                    QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. BANKS
    Mr. Banks. If the problem with arming Taiwan is that Congress 
didn't appropriate funds for FMF grants last year, why did the Biden 
administration refuse to call for any FMF grant funding for Taiwan in 
its FY2024 budget request? Or draw down stocks via Presidential 
Drawdown Authority?
    Ms. Resnick. The FY 2024 Request includes $113 million in global 
FMF to support emerging priorities, which could include Taiwan. In 
addition, our pending supplemental request currently before Congress 
requests $1 billion in FMF, a significant portion of which we intend to 
provide to Taiwan. In FY 2023, the Secretary of State, under delegated 
authority from the President, directed the drawdown of $345 million in 
defense articles and services from DOD stocks via the Presidential 
Drawdown Authority for Taiwan, and we will consider further use of this 
authority in FY 2024, as authorized by Congress. We are exploring all 
available options for resourcing this important policy priority.
    Mr. Banks. Will the administration commit to requesting FMF grants 
for Taiwan in its FY2025 budget request?
    Ms. Resnick. The Administration is committed to supporting Taiwan 
in enhancing its self-defense capabilities including through utilizing 
FMF grant assistance. However, I cannot comment at this time on the FY 
2025 Request since internal deliberations are ongoing.
    Mr. Banks. Will the administration commit to requesting 
appropriations to backfill stocks used for Presidential Drawdown 
Authority for Taiwan in its FY2025 request?
    Ms. Resnick. The Department of State would defer to the Department 
of Defense (DOD) for information on questions relating to backfill of 
DOD stock provided under a drawdown.
    Mr. Banks. Can you tell us, the committee, on what those rates--why 
our rates aren't competitive versus rates they might find elsewhere? 
Ms. Resnick. I'm happy to take that for the record. I don't have the 
numbers in front of me.
    Ms. Resnick. As of May 2023, Taiwan had access to interest rates 
hovering around 1-2 percent domestically. Under the current FMF direct 
loan authority, the Department is prohibited from offering an interest 
rate on FMF loans that is lower than the prevailing interest rate on 
marketable Treasury securities of similar maturity. Our rates would 
only be competitive if the Department were authorized to offer an 
interest rate below what Taiwan can access domestically. We have asked 
for the authority to offer lower interest rates.

                    QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. WALTZ
    Mr. Waltz. I understand that the Taiwanese government has asked for 
any of the MQ-9Bs in any condition to be delivered before the end of 
the year. However, the Air Force says that delivery can only begin by 
early 2027.
    What is DOD doing to accelerate the delivery of these MQ-9Bs?
    I understand that General Atomics has told DOD it can make the 
timeline and have them in the air next year if they take two machines 
earmarked for the UK and send them to Taiwan instead.
    Is that something DOD has considered?
    Will you commit to doing so, and finding creative solutions to 
accelerate that process like allowing flight certification to be done 
in Taiwan, as it grants to the UK?
    Dr. Ratner. The Department of the Air Force (DAF) is actively 
working a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case with Taiwan for the sale of 
MQ-9B. This case is progressing on time and there have been no 
indications from Taiwan that this delivery schedule is untenable. The 
Department continues to evaluate all options available to speed 
deliveries and increase efficiencies in providing capabilities to 
Taiwan.
    Mr. Waltz. The sale of the Harpoon Coastal Defense System was 
notified to Congress on October 2020. The RFP (request for proposal) 
from the Navy to Boeing came about a year later, on November 18, 2021. 
However, the contract award for the missiles didn't come then until 
March 2023, a year and a half after the RFP.
    Why do you believe it took the administration almost two-and-a-half 
years to go from congressional notification to contract award? Why did 
the Navy take so long to get this contract awarded?
    Dr. Ratner. The Department continues to prioritize security 
cooperation processes for Taiwan. The Harpoon Coastal Defense System 
sale went through several adaptations to ensure the program was 
responsive to Taiwan's requirements. The Navy remains focused on the 
execution of these efforts.

progressing on a timeline and there have been no indications from 
Taiwan that this delivery schedule is untenable. The Department

years to go from congressional notification to contract award? Why did 
the Navy take so long to get this contract awarded?
    General McGee. The Department continues to prioritize security 
cooperation processes for Taiwan. The Harpoon Coastal Defense System 
sale went through several adaptations to ensure the program was 
responsive to Taiwan's requirements.
    Taiwan signed the HCDS Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) in May 
2021 for a limited quantity of HCDS Launch Systems and Missiles. The 
Navy awarded a contract to Boeing in September 2021 to start the Non-
Recurring Engineering (NRE) activities, as these activities are the 
critical path to Launch System and Missile deliveries. Taiwan then 
signed an LOA Amendment for the full quantities in October 2021, after 
the Navy was already on contract. The Launch System production contract 
was awarded to Boeing in March 2022, and the Missile production 
contract was awarded in April 2023.
    The critical path to deliveries remains the ongoing development 
efforts that began before Taiwan signed its LOAs, as well as the NRE 
efforts for Taiwan that were awarded in Sept 2021. The Navy remains 
focused on the execution of these efforts.

                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MS. SEWELL
    Ms. Sewell. How can the United States maximize its options for 
deterring aggression in the Taiwan Strait? What economic and diplomatic 
measures are we taking, and how do trade relations fit into our 
strategy? Is President Biden's U.S. Taiwan 21st Century Trade 
Initiative a step in the right direction?
    Dr. Ratner. Yes, President Biden's U.S. Taiwan 21st Century Trade 
Initiative is a step in the right direction.
    The Department is working closely with the Departments of Treasury, 
Commerce, and State to ensure the U.S. Government is effectively 
leveraging our diplomatic, financial, and economic tools to protect our 
national security interests.
    To strengthen deterrence in the Taiwan Strait consistent with 
longstanding U.S. policy, we are working with the Department of State 
and other interagency partners, aided by the support of Congress, to 
ensure that Taiwan has the relevant defense articles, training, and 
services that it needs to maintain a sufficient self-defense 
capability.
    Ms. Sewell. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2023 gave the president the authority for ``drawdown of defense 
articles'' for Taiwan valued at $1 billion. In July, the Biden 
Administration announced it is sending up to $345 million in defense 
articles to Taiwan under this authority. Can you talk at greater length 
about the authorities Congress granted to the president in the FY23 
NDAA to transfer arms to Taiwan. How could these authorities help 
Taiwan defend itself?
    Ms. Resnick. We are committed to helping Taiwan bolster its self-
defense capabilities and deterrence, and appreciate the new authorities 
provided last fiscal year. The FY 2023 NDAA included the Taiwan 
Enhanced Resilience Act (TERA), which included several new authorities 
for Taiwan, including a Taiwan-specific drawdown authority for defense 
articles and services and combined with the FY 2023 State 
appropriations act, the authority to provide up to $2 billion in FMF 
loans and $2 billion in FMF loan guarantees.
    We used these authorities to make significant progress in the past 
year--the first notification of FMF for Taiwan, the most FMS 
congressional notifications in a single calendar year in 2022 for 
Taiwan in at least 30 years, and the first use of Presidential Drawdown 
Authority for Taiwan.
    On loans, though Taiwan has not shown interest in an FMF loan from 
the U.S. government, this authority provides a helpful option to 
explore in the future. We remain supportive of Taiwan taking every 
measure possible to strengthen its self-defense capabilities.

                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. ALFORD
    Mr. Alford. The Taiwan Harpoon Coastal Defense System is urgent 
from a national security perspective, however, it took the Navy from 
2021 to April 2023 to get the system on contract. How can processes 
like these be expedited going forward?
    Dr. Ratner. The Department continues to prioritize security 
cooperation processes for Taiwan. The Harpoon Coastal Defense System 
sale went through several adaptations to ensure the program was 
responsive to Taiwan's requirements. The Navy remains focused on the 
execution of these efforts.
    Mr. Alford. I understand that the Taiwanese have also expressed an 
interest in an additional 100 Harpoon coastal defense cruise missiles. 
How can you ensure the Navy pursues the fastest possible path to get 
these missiles approved for FMS, on contract, and delivered to Taiwan? 
Is the fastest path is a new FMS case or an amendment to the 2020 FMS 
case?
    Dr. Ratner. The Department remains committed to ensuring the 
fastest path to additional Harpoon capability for Taiwan. Decisions on 
the scope and details of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs lie 
first and foremost with the FMS partner.
    Mr. Alford. The Taiwan Harpoon Coastal Defense System is urgent 
from a national security perspective; however, it took the Navy from 
2021 to April 2023 to get the system on contract. How can processes 
like these be expedited going forward?
    Ms. Resnick. Expediting defense articles to Taiwan is a priority 
for the U.S. government. However, industry does not start manufacturing 
until receiving a signed contract and initial deposit, which often 
takes place months or even years after the Congressional notification. 
This is often due to negotiation delays by the partner. State defers to 
the Department of Defense on possible ways to reduce contracting time.
    Mr. Alford. I understand that the Taiwanese have also expressed an 
interest in an additional 100 Harpoon coastal defense cruise missiles. 
How can you ensure the Navy pursues the fastest possible path to get 
these missiles approved for FMS, on contract, and delivered to Taiwan? 
Is the fastest path is a new FMS case or an amendment to the 2020 FMS 
case?
    Ms. Resnick. The Department of State will expedite any future 
Harpoon cases to the maximum extent possible. State defers to the 
Department of Defense on contracting specifics.
    Mr. Alford. The Taiwan Harpoon Coastal Defense System is urgent 
from a national security perspective; however, it took the Navy from 
2021 to April 2023 to get the system on contract. How can processes 
like these be expedited going forward?
    General McGee. The Department continues to prioritize security 
cooperation processes for Taiwan. The Harpoon Coastal Defense System 
sale went through several adaptations to ensure the program was 
responsive to Taiwan's requirements.
    Phased contracting to accelerate the award of Non-Recurring 
Engineering (NRE) efforts ahead of production contracts is a proven 
practice to initiate the pre-production work as early as possible. In 
combination with the use of Undefinitized Contract Actions, or other 
accelerated contracting initiatives, this allows for the most expedited 
contracting activities to occur with the focus on the schedule-critical 
elements.
    For HCDS, the critical path to deliveries remains the ongoing 
development efforts that began before Taiwan signed its LOA Amendment 
for the full quantities. The use of the above phased contracting 
approach has allowed for the Navy to contract the full scope of the 
HCDS effort within the LOA cost and schedule requirements.
    The Navy remains focused on the execution of these efforts.
    Mr. Alford. I understand that the Taiwanese have also expressed an 
interest in an additional 100 Harpoon coastal defense cruise missiles.

these missiles approved for FMS, on contract, and delivered to Taiwan? 
Is the fastest path is a new FMS case or an amendment to the 2020 FMS 
case?
    General McGee. The Navy remains committed to ensuring the fastest 
path to additional Harpoon capability in Taiwan. Decisions on the scope 
and details of FMS programs contracts lie first and foremost with the 
FMS partner. However, I recommend amending the 2020 FMS case to 
minimize administrative lead times.
