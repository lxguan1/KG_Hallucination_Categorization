                         TUESDAY, MAY 23, 2023

                  House of Representatives,
               Committee on Small Business,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 9:48 a.m., in Room 
2360, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Roger Williams 
[chairman of the Committee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Williams, Luetkemeyer, Stauber, 
Crane, Bean, LaLota, Velazquez, Golden, Mfume, Davids, and 
Pappas.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Good morning, everyone. And before we 
get started we are going to say the Pledge of Allegiance and a 
short prayer. And we will let Congressman Bean from Florida do 
that for us, please.
    Mr. BEAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And good 
morning to you, and good morning, Small Business.
    Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
    Heavenly Father, we are so grateful for so many blessings 
you have bestowed on us for faith, for fellowship, for family 
and freedom. We ask a blessing upon this Congress and that may 
we do the Lord's work. And we pray for a debt deal. How about 
that? We pray for negotiations to bring us in for a landing. As 
Memorial Day approaches, we want to be mindful for everybody 
that has lost somebody, family and friends that have lost 
people that have defended that freedom. Let us always remember 
their sacrifice so that we may have this day. Keep Guam safe 
from this typhoon. We ask that that storm go somewhere else 
other than hit Guam. Lord, we are grateful. Thank you. And all 
this we ask in your name, and everybody said together Amen.
    Please join me in the Pledge of Allegiance to the greatest 
nation on the planet.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. Before we get started I want to 
let everybody know we are having some technical issues. I 
reminded my staff we put a man on the moon in 1969. We put a 
man on the moon and here we are later. So the 5-minute clock 
that we have is not working in front of you but we have a 
temporary clock up over where the other clock is, so that is 
what we will follow. So remind everybody to keep your remarks 
under 5 minutes and we will be controlling that time from here. 
Okay?
    The Committee will now come to order and a quorum is 
present. And without objection, the Chair is authorized to 
declare a recess of the Committee at any time. Pursuant to 
Committee Rule 13 and House Rule 11, all votes will be rolled 
to the end of the meeting.
    I now recognize myself for opening remarks.
    Welcome to today's markup to discuss six bipartisan bills 
that address the various needs of Main Street America. Frankly 
put, our nation's small businesses, entrepreneurs, and 
innovators have faced some of the strongest economic headwinds 
in recent memory of the past 2 years. Here on this Committee, 
it is our job to be the strongest advocate for small businesses 
as they are the heart of each of our communities and employers 
of nearly 62 million Americans. That is why our work here is so 
important and why we must get our economy back on track and our 
workforce motivated.
    Before us today are bills that support our veterans, 
entrepreneurs, make common sense oversight changes to the 7(a) 
Loan Program, alleviate the labor shortage crisis, and enhance 
workforce development in our company. All four of these topics 
have been discussed widely by our Members and I am proud that 
our hearings are resulting in legislative action. Five of the 
six bills we are considering today passed the House last 
Congress with resounding support, and I am proud that we are 
starting this process today so we can get them across the 
finish line and hopefully signed into law.
    I want to thank our Members for bringing these bills 
forward as they represent the work and devotion of our 
Committee as a whole, as well as the Ranking Member and her 
staff for helping us to come together with this bipartisan 
package of bills.
    With that I yield to the Ranking Member Velazquez for her 
opening statement.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for 
holding this markup to discuss six bipartisan bills that will 
go a long way to help our nation's 33 million small businesses 
and exercise our oversight of the SBA.
    All but one of these bills unanimously passed through our 
Committee in the previous year and on suspension with 
overwhelming bipartisan support. Two of the bills under 
consideration today strengthen the oversight of 7(a) loan 
agents to help address some of our workforce challenges that 
are especially acute for small businesses and to provide 
service members and veterans the dedicated focus on 
entrepreneurial development and contracting assistance.
    Today's legislation showcases this Committee's bipartisan 
tradition to enact legislation that fosters a nurturing 
environment for small businesses, as well as conduct rigorous 
oversight on SBA's programs.
    To that end, I am pleased to lend my support to these bills 
and I hope that this is a sign of more bipartisan work to come. 
Small businesses depend on it. They play a critical role in the 
growth of our economy by creating jobs and supporting our local 
communities. They are innovative and resilient but face 
challenges that we must be committed to solving together.
    That is why it is important that we are able to come 
together today and take steps to help small businesses address 
some of these challenges and celebrate all the good they do for 
this nation, particularly our transitioning service members and 
veterans.
    I look forward to our discussion and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you, Ranking Member Velazquez.
    Does any other Member seek recognition for the purpose of 
making an opening statement?
    Seeing none, we will now move to consideration of the first 
bill.
    H.R. 1644
    The first bill we will mark up today is H.R. 1644, the 7(a) 
Loan Agent Oversight Act introduced by Mr. Meuser and Mr. 
Phillips.
    I now recognize the bill's sponsor, Mr. Meuser, for an 
opening statement on H.R. 1644.
    Mr. MEUSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    As this Committee has discussed extensively already in this 
Congress, it is imperative that the SBA has the oversight 
capabilities in place to manage its access to capital programs. 
Without accurate information, we cannot perform the oversight 
that is needed to safeguard and protect American taxpayer 
dollars. This bill, H.R. 1644, the 7(a) Loan Agent Oversight 
Act will ensure Congress receives the data it needs to conduct 
proper oversight of loan agents that participate in the SBA's 
flagship 7(a) lending program. The SBA's Inspector General has 
reported that nearly 15 percent of all 7(a) loans include a 
loan agent. Unfortunately, the OIG has already reported that 
over the last decade there has been more than $335 million in 
documented loan agent fraud. H.R. 1644 will provide information 
on how many loans have been processed with the assistance of 
loan agents and the default rate of loans that are associated 
with a loan agent.
    Additionally, the legislation requires the SBA to perform a 
risk analysis on agents who operate within the program. At the 
end of the day, these are the government programs that were 
developed to assist American small businesses to obtain access 
to capital. Given this important mission, Congress and the SBA 
must conduct the appropriate level of oversight. The 
information that will be provided to Congress under H.R. 1644 
will be paramount as we measure the effectiveness of these 
programs and whether the SBA has the correct oversight 
requirements in place to administer such a significant program. 
As more small businesses utilize the SBA's program, it is 
increasingly important for Congress to understand how different 
groups assist small businesses and lenders through the lending 
process.
    Mr. Chairman, I thank you for bringing these bills forward. 
I appreciate my colleague, Congressman Phillips, for his 
partnership on this. I look forward to working with all 
colleagues to ensure the SBA's access to capital programs like 
7(a) are serving our small businesses well and we remain good 
stewards of taxpayer dollars. And I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.
    And I would now like to recognize the cosponsor of the 
bill, Mr. Phillips, for an opening statement.
    Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to 
voice my support for the measure before us, legislation 
introduced by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Meuser.
    As a cosponsor of the 7(a) Loan Agent Oversight Act, I 
thank Mr. Meuser for his leadership and partnership on the 
important issue at hand, which is oversight of loan agent 
participation in the 7(a) program.
    We have heard it for years from the SBA's Office of Credit 
Risk Management and the Office of Inspector General that we 
can, and must, do more to supervise and track 7(a) loans 
generated by third-party loan agents. Although loan agent 
activity can make up as much as 11 percent of the entire 7(a) 
portfolio, there do remain gaps in SBA's oversight of these 
individuals. As Mr. Meuser noted, the legislation would require 
OCRM to submit a report to Congress every year detailing the 
performance and risk factors with regards to the 7(a) loans 
generated through the services of a loan agent. By better 
understanding loan agent participation in the program, we can 
continue to ensure the integrity of SBA's flagship program, the 
protection of taxpayer dollars, and most importantly, the 
success of small businesses across the nation.
    As those of us on the Committee continue to work in a 
thoughtful and bipartisan manner to increase access to capital 
for small businesses, it is essential that we provide effective 
oversight over the SBA and give it the tools it needs to manage 
risk within its loan portfolios.
    I look forward to voting in favor of the legislation and 
urge the Committee and my colleagues to adopt the measure and 
report it favorably to the house. With that I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.
    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a 
statement on H.R. 1644?
    Seeing none, I would like----
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Yes. I would like to be recognized.
    Let me begin by thanking Mr. Meuser, the Chair of Economic 
Growth, Tax, and Capital Access Subcommittee and the 
Committee's party Ranking Member, Mr. Phillips, for working 
together to make sure SBA has the proper oversight in place to 
address the increased risk introduced by loan agents in the 
7(a) program. Over the years, the Office of Inspector General 
has identified increased risk associated with loans originating 
through agent activity as a top agency challenge and is a 
concern that I shared.
    In February 2020, we held a hearing to examine the 
management of the Office of Credit Risk Management, which is 
responsible for the oversight of SBA lenders and the 7(a) 
program. The two bills we are considering today are a direct 
result of our Committee's oversight work on this issue and will 
enable SBA to monitor loan agent involvement in the 7(a) 
program and better manage the risk. In the interim, the IG 
reports the SBA has made great progress in addressing this 
longstanding challenge. I am pleased with the SBA's progress 
and the bipartisan effort we are seeing today to find a common 
sense solution. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1644.
    And Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Okay. Any other Members who wish to be 
recognized for a statement on H.R. 1644?
    Okay. Seeing non, we will move on. And I want to thank you 
for that, Ranking Member. And I now recognize myself to speak 
in support of this legislation.
    H.R. 1644, the 7(a) Loan Agent Oversight Act is a critical 
piece of legislation that would require the Small Business 
Administration's Office of Credit Risk Management to submit an 
annual report containing specific information related to 7(a) 
loan agents. Plain and simple, this bill is about providing 
common sense accountability and protections for the American 
taxpayer and Main Street America.
    I want to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, 
for introducing this bill, as well as the gentleman from 
Minnesota, Mr. Phillips, for cosponsoring this important piece 
of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1644.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 1644.
    The clerk will report the bill.
    The CLERK. H.R. 1644, to amend the Small Business Act----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 1644 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    Okay. Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 
1644 and ordering it favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor, say aye.
    All those opposed, say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and H.R. 1644 
is agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Yes?
    Mr. MEUSER. I do request a recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. All right. A recorded vote has been 
requested. And pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and House Rule 11, 
further proceedings on the bill are postponed.
    H.R. 1651
    The next bill we will mark up today is H.R. 1651, the Small 
Business 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency Act, also introduced by 
Mr. Phillips and Mr. Meuser.
    I now recognize the bill's sponsor, Mr. Phillips, for an 
opening statement on H.R. 1651.
    Mr. PHILLIPS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to 
speak in support of my bill, the Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent 
Transparency Act.
    Over the past few weeks, this Committee has engaged in some 
spirited debate about the future of SBA's Capital Access 
programs. Regardless of where we all stand on SBA's proposed 
changes to the 7(a) and 504 Loan Programs, I know that we all 
understand the importance of SBA continuing to provide access 
to capital for small businesses. The 7(a) program is the SBA's 
flagship capital access program, providing over $25 billion in 
working capital to small businesses in the last year alone. The 
7(a) program is a staple of the small business lending 
ecosystem reaching those who may not otherwise be able to 
obtain a loan for their businesses. Notably, the program aims 
to carry out its critical mission at no cost to the taxpayer. 
Let me say that again. At no cost to the taxpayer.
    And that brings me to the legislation before us. As I 
mentioned earlier, up to 11 percent of the entire 7(a) 
portfolio can be generated through loan agents who are third-
party intermediaries that connect borrowers with SBA lenders 
and provide them with loan application services, usually for a 
fee. Despite their significant presence in the 7(a) program, 
OCRM lacks the capability to uniquely identify and 
systematically monitor loan agent activity. Instead, OCRM is 
left to rely on self-reporting lender reviews to track the 
participation of 7(a) agents who are responsible for processing 
billions in taxpayer dollars.
    We know this dynamic adds potential uncertainty to the 7(a) 
program. As OIG has identified, increased risk introduced by 
loan agents is one of the agency's biggest challenges. Although 
SBA has made progress in its oversight efforts, there is more 
that can and should be done to limit exposure in the 7(a) 
portfolio and maintain its integrity and reliability for small 
businesses in need of capital.
    The Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency Act takes 
three simple steps to improve SBA's oversight of loan agent 
participation in the 7(a) program.
    First, it requires that OCRM create a mandatory 
registration system to uniquely identify loan agents who 
participate in the 7(a) program.
    Second, it requires OCRM to establish an accompanying 
database to track the services offered by 7(a) loan agents and 
their performance within the 7(a) portfolio.
    And lastly, it authorizes OCRM and the SBA Lender Oversight 
Commission to take enforcement action against 7(a) loan agents. 
This legislation is straightforward, it is bipartisan, and most 
of all, common sense, and adopting it will help us take a 
crucial step towards strengthening the 7(a) program.
    I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their 
collaboration in drafting the legislation, and to my friend, 
Mr. Meuser, for his participation on this issue.
    I once again urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the 
legislation, and I hope to see it reported favorably to the 
House.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair. And with that I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you. And I would now like to 
recognize the cosponsor of the bill, Mr. Meuser, for an opening 
statement.
    Mr. MEUSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And as we examine 
access to capital for small businesses, it is imperative that 
we also look at the SBA's existing 7(a) loan program. As we 
are, I do want to very much thank my friend and colleague from 
Minnesota, Mr. Phillips, for working on the role of loan agents 
within this program. Mr. Phillips introduced H.R. 1651, the 
Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency Act which addresses 
concerns presented to us by the SBA's Inspector General. Mr. 
Phillips's bill, H.R. 1651, takes the steps to ensure the SBA 
contract the role of loan agents within the SBA's largest 
traditional lending program.
    I do look forward to working in a bipartisan manner to 
ensure the SBA has the correct level of oversight in place for 
the growing population of agents within its flagship 7(a) loan 
program.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.
    And are there any other Members who wish to be recognized 
for a statement on H.R. 1651?
    Seeing none, I would like to recognize the Ranking Member 
to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I commend Mr. Phillips and Mr. Meuser for their bipartisan 
work on H.R. 1651, the Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent 
Transparency Act. The 7(a) program is SBA's largest traditional 
lending program. It provides access to capital for small 
businesses that cannot find it elsewhere.
    In Fiscal Year 2022, SBA approved more than 47,000 SBA 
loans totaling more than $25 billion. Loan agents are an 
integral part of the 7(a) program, oftentimes facilitating 
access to capital by connecting borrowers with SBA lenders or 
by offering other products.
    As reliance on loan agents increases, it is essential that 
the agency manage their involvement to minimize fraud. 
Competent loan agents can screen borrowers, help prepare forms, 
and better reach underserved communities, but dishonest agents 
can cast a stain on the 7(a) program, hurting borrowers and 
lenders alike. That is why I am pleased to support the bill 
before us today, which requires SBA to establish a registration 
system that collects data on 7(a) loan agents to better track 
and evaluate the performance of loans generated through loan 
agent activity.
    I urge the Committee to adopt this measure and I yield 
back, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you for that.
    And I now recognize myself to speak in support of this 
legislation.
    H.R. 1651, the Small Business 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency 
Act continues this Committee's efforts to ensure proper 
safeguards are in place at the SBA to protect taxpayers and to 
small businesses that rely on the longevity of the program. 
This bill would enact new oversight of the 7(a) loan program by 
establishing a registration system for 7(a) agents and this 
change will allow for greater transparency to root out bad 
actors in the system.
    Once again, I want to thank my distinguished colleague from 
Minnesota, Mr. Phillips, for introducing this bill, as well as 
my good friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, for cosponsoring 
it.
    I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1651.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 1651.
    The clerk will read the report.
    The CLERK. H.R. 1651, to amend the Small Business Act----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 1651 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    Seeing none, the question now is adoption of H.R. 1651 and 
ordering it in favor of the report of the House.
    All those in favor, say aye.
    All those opposed, say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it. H.R. 1651 is 
agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Yes, sir, Mr. Meuser.
    Mr. MEUSER. I request a recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested 
pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and House Rule 11. Further 
proceedings on the bill are postponed.
    H.R. 1541
    The next bill we will mark up today is H.R. 1541, the Small 
Business Workforce Pipeline Act of 2023. This bipartisan 
legislature was introduced by Mr. Crow and cosponsored by Mr. 
Molinaro, Mr. Thanedar, and Ms. Salazar.
    I now recognize one of the bill's cosponsors, Mr. Molinaro, 
for an opening statement on H.R. 1541.
    Mr. MOLINARO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I am proud to have introduced the Small Business Workforce 
Pipeline Act alongside my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, including Mr. Thanedar and Ms. Salazar. This bipartisan 
legislation seeks to address an issue that affects communities 
all across America and certainly throughout Upstate New York, 
the part of New York State I represent.
    This will address workforce shortages for local small 
businesses by directing small business development centers to 
establish and facilitate the implementation of apprenticeship 
and training programs for small businesses. We know that we 
need to improve workforce development for our nation's small 
businesses, and this bill will help address the issues that 
continue to hold main street back. Certainly, as we all travel 
around our districts as I do mine, we continue to hear from 
small business owners on how they cannot find enough people to 
work. We had the opportunity of one of my constituents, Mr. 
Bruno Schickel to present just a month ago before a hearing of 
this Committee. As the owner of Schickel Construction in 
Ithaca, New York, he told us as many contractors and 
construction companies have explained, it is becoming 
increasingly more difficult to recruit skilled employees.
    I look forward, Mr. Chairman to the swift passage of this 
bill. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and 
thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your work on this important issue 
and this piece of legislation.
    And with that I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.
    I would now like to recognize the cosponsor of the bill, 
Mr. Thanedar, for an opening statement.
    Mr. THANEDAR. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I also thank 
Representative Crow and Representative Molinaro, and 
Representative Salazar for working on this great bill. I am 
here to support H.R. 1541.
    Small businesses face great challenges, including hiring, 
recruiting, and retaining qualified workers. In my district and 
across our nation, small businesses are struggling to find the 
skilled workforce they need to thrive. However, H.R. 1541 can 
make a significant difference in addressing this issue. H.R. 
1541 is a forward-thinking bill that aims to create 
opportunities through apprenticeship networks. These networks 
will be established in collaboration with leading universities, 
colleges, development agencies, the private sector, and other 
key shareholders. By bringing together these diverse entities, 
we can leverage their expertise, resources, and connections to 
build a robust workforce development infrastructure. One of the 
greatest advantages of this bill is its focus on providing 
alternative pathways to success and a dignified career.
    As the cost of college education continues to rise, 
apprenticeships offer an attractive and viable option for 
individuals seeking meaningful employment. By combining on-the-
job training with classroom instruction, apprenticeships equip 
workers with the skills and experience needed to excel in their 
chosen fields. Moreover, this bill has the potential to uplift 
underserved communities and help individuals escape poverty. By 
providing apprenticeships with good wages and opportunities for 
career growth, we can empower individuals to improve their 
lives and contribute to the economic prosperity of their 
communities.
    Supporting H.R. 1541 is not just an endorsement of small 
businesses but a commitment to fostering economic growth, 
reducing unemployment, and strengthening our communities. This 
bill will create a workforce pipeline that connects small 
businesses with the talented individuals they need to succeed. 
By investing in workforce development through apprenticeships, 
we are investing in the future prosperity of our nation. I am 
proud to cosponsor H.R. 1541.
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Are there any other Members who wish to 
be recognized for a statement on H.R. 1541?
    Seeing none, I would like to recognize, oh, Mr. Crane, I am 
sorry.
    Mr. CRANE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I understand the shortage of qualified workers that we have 
out there right now as a former entrepreneur. I have many 
friends that are entrepreneurs, and this is one of the number 
one issues they deal with.
    That being said, when I talk to them about the causation 
and the reason they are having a tough time finding qualified 
workers never once have I heard any of them say that it is 
because the SBA does not have an apprenticeship program. I want 
to point out that it is my opinion that this town, the 
bureaucracies up here do not do anything well, and so it does 
concern me when we start tasking the SBA to do jobs like this 
because there is really no accountability up here. Even if we 
do have oversight studies and whatnot, when we find out that 
these groups are not doing what we tasked them to do, nobody 
ever gets fired. And so it is concerning to me. I understand 
the intent of this. I think it is great that it is bipartisan, 
but I just have concern that this is just going to be one more 
of these programs where nothing actually gets done, small 
businesses do not get help. If we want to help small 
businesses, we need to really improve the economy. We need to 
quit pumping you know tens of billions of dollars into the 
economy that we do not have causing record inflation. Those are 
the types of things that actually will help small businesses.
    I yield back. Thank you.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you, Mr. Crane.
    Are there any other Members who wish to be recognized for a 
statement on H.R. 1541?
    Okay. Seeing none, I would like to recognize the Ranking 
Member to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And I would like to correct for the record that SBA is not 
given responsibility in creating an apprenticeship program. 
This is for the network of Small Business Development Centers 
across the nation, and they are stakeholders that work in 
partnership with the SBA.
    I am pleased to support H.R. 1541, the Small Business 
Workforce Pipeline Act, which was introduced by Representatives 
Crow, Molinaro, Thanedar, and Salazar. This bill allows SBDCs, 
Small Business Development Centers, to assist small firms in 
establishing job training and apprenticeship programs. ``Earn 
while you learn'' programs are proven ways for small businesses 
to attract and retain qualified workers. By empowering our 
nation's SBDCs to share job training and apprenticeship 
information from federal agencies with small employers, we can 
address one of the most pressing programs facing many 
businesses today.
    Small firms have been hit particularly hard by tightening 
labor markets. As the recovery continues, unemployment drops 
and job openings grow. I constantly hear from the smaller 
employers in my district that it is getting harder than ever to 
recruit and retain qualified workers. The legislation will take 
an important step to help American workers gain new skills and 
assist small businesses in finding qualified workers.
    I want to thank Mr. Crow, Mr. Molinaro, Mr. Thanedar, and 
Ms. Salazar for their bipartisan work on this bill. I urge 
Members to support this bill and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you for that.
    And I now recognize myself to speak in support of this 
legislation. H.R. 1541, the Small Business Workforce Pipeline 
Act of 2023 expands the services of Small Business Development 
Centers to include the information on how small businesses can 
establish and improve work-based learning and apprenticeship 
programs.
    Just this past month, Mr. Molinaro led an Innovation 
Entrepreneurship and Workforce Development Subcommittee hearing 
highlighting the serious labor shortage issues facing far too 
many small businesses across this country.
    I want to thank Mr. Crow for introducing this bill, as well 
as my distinguished Committee colleagues, Representatives 
Molinaro, Thanedar, Salazar for cosponsoring this bill.
    To close, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1541.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 1541.
    The clerk will report the bill.
    The CLERK. H.R. 1541, to amend the Small Business Act to 
include requirements----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 1541 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    There is no amendment at the desk so we will briefly pause 
while staff--no, I am sorry.
    Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 1541 
and ordering it be favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor, say aye.
    All those opposed, say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and H.R. 1541 
is agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Mr. CROW. Mr. Chairman, I would like to request a recorded 
vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A recorded vote has been requested, and 
pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and House Rule 11, further 
proceedings on the bill are postponed.
    H.R. 1730
    The next bill we will mark up today is H.R. 1730, 
Supporting Small Business and Career and Technical Education 
Act of 2023.
    I introduced this bipartisan legislation along with Ms. 
Gluesenkamp Perez, Mr. Allen, Mr. Fitzpatrick, and Mr. 
Magaziner.
    I now recognize myself for an opening statement on H.R. 
1730.
    H.R. 1730, Supporting Small Business and Career and 
Technical Education Act of 2023 ensures federal resources are 
being used to support entrepreneurs and connect businesses with 
qualified employees. This legislation directs the Small 
Business Development Centers and Women's Business Centers to 
assist small businesses in hiring graduates from career and 
technical education programs. Additionally, this legislation 
supports career and technical education graduates by directing 
the SBDCs and WBCs to assist them in starting a small business.
    There are too many young people who feel like they have no 
choice but to attend a 4-year college and incur tens of 
thousands of dollars in debt even though their skills and 
interests do not fit the typical 4-year college education. 
College is not for everyone and this bill helps those people 
that choose an alternative educational path to get employed or 
start their own small business. I believe this legislation will 
help engage with the career and technical education community 
to support small business growth.
    And I want to thank my distinguished committee colleagues, 
Ms. Gluesenkamp Perez for cosponsoring this legislation.
    And to close, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
    And I would now like to co-sponsor of the bill, Ms. 
Gluesenkamp Perez for an opening statement.
    Ms. GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank 
you for including this bill in today's markup.
    Like the Chairman, I came from the automotive industry. He 
comes from the dealership side; I come from the independent 
side. And before coming here I owned an auto repair and a 
machine shop.
    My district is home to a number of auto technician and 
technology training programs, including the programs at Lower 
Columbia College and Clark College. These are family wage jobs 
that you do not need a 4-year degree to get into. You see a guy 
driving down the road with a big truck, nice truck, he has got 
a snowmobile, does not have roommates. That is a guy that is 
working in the trades.
    One of the best parts of my job is getting to go to these 
programs and visiting and encouraging these young people in the 
path that they have chosen. And the reality is we are desperate 
for technicians. By 2024, we are going to be about 600,000 
technicians short in America. So there is a desperate need.
    The program is that after graduating it can be hard for 
these students to find the right fit. It is true that if you 
are a big player, you have got a lot of employees, you can 
probably staff a job fair and go down there and recruit. But if 
you are a Mom and Pop shop struggling with all of the 
bureaucracy and all the things that it takes to run a small 
business, you cannot just take a day off to do recruitment.
    And what is really important about this bill is that it 
encourages the Small Business Development Centers and the 
Women's Business Centers to provide resources to help the 
smaller guys, the growing guys, to get in there and find the 
right fit. Find the right employees.
    And one of the things I love about this bill is that it 
also works to direct these centers to help CTE graduates start 
their own businesses. So many of these people are brilliant 
entrepreneurs. They are hungry to grow our economy and succeed 
in their dreams of owning their own shop. But the financial 
hurdles it takes to open a small business are almost impossible 
to clear.
    My husband spent 10 years laying in the street, jacking up 
cars, fixing them up, building up his own business, his own 
clientele. A lot of people give up in that time. This bill 
helps ensure that the resources come to small businesses, to 
the trades, and start their own businesses and be successful in 
that.
    So for all the talk that we do about the American dream, I 
think it is really encouraging that this Committee is putting 
the resources and the elbow grease behind actually supporting 
career and technical programs succeed and find the right fit in 
their hiring and start their own businesses.
    So thank you, sincerely, Mr. Chairman, for your leadership 
in this. And I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.
    And are there any other Members who wish to be recognized 
for a statement on H.R. 1730?
    All right. Seeing none, I would like to recognize the 
Ranking Member to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Williams.
    I really commend you and Ms. Gluesenkamp in your efforts to 
allow SBA resource partners to connect small employers with 
graduates of career and technical education programs and also 
give graduates the tools to launch their own enterprises. While 
a college education is a sure and fast way to secure a 
successful career in today's global economy, it may not be the 
most prudent part for every high school graduate.
    CTE programs offer viable alternatives by training students 
with a wide variety of skills oftentimes tailoring the 
curriculum to the workforce needs of the local community.
    I want to thank Mr. Williams and Ms. Gluesenkamp Perez for 
their meaningful work on this bill.
    And I urge Members to support this bipartisan piece of 
legislation. And I yield back my time.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you for that.
    And I once again reiterate my support for this legislation.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 1730.
    The clerk will report the bill.
    The CLERK. H.R. 1730, to amend the Small Business Act to--
--
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 1730 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 1730 
and ordering it favorably be reported to the House.
    All those in favor, say aye.
    All those opposed, say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.
    H.R. 1730 is agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Chairman, I request a recorded vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. A roll call vote is ordered.
    Pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and House Rule 11, further 
proceedings on the bill are postponed.
    Before we consider H.R. 1606, I would like to ask unanimous 
consent to waive the sponsor of the bill, Mr. Schneider on the 
Committee for the purpose of speaking on their legislation.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. No. Yes.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, so ordered.
    H.R. 1606
    Now we mark up H.R. 1606, the Veteran Entrepreneurship 
Training Act of 2023.
    This bipartisan bill was introduced by Mr. Schneider and 
cosponsored by myself, Mr. McGarvey, and Mr. Ellzey.
    I now recognize myself for an opening statement.
    H.R. 1606, the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act of 
2023 that authorized the Boots to Business program which helps 
transitioning service members start and grow their own 
businesses. After dedicating their lives to protecting the 
freedom of all Americans, it is critical we give our veterans 
the tools and resources to be successful when transitioning to 
civilian life. Veterans are natural leaders and the dedication 
necessary to thrive in the private sector with the right 
training. I was fortunate enough to see firsthand the work this 
program does when I visited Fort Hood with Administrator Guzman 
this past March. I am proud to have had the opportunity to work 
with my colleagues on this bipartisan legislation to improve 
the Boots to Business program and I want to thank my 
distinguished Committee colleagues, Representatives McGarvey 
and Ellzey for cosponsoring this legislation.
    And to close, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 
1606.
    I would now like to recognize the Democratic sponsor of the 
bill, Mr. McGarvey, for an opening statement.
    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman, for your leadership, for your support of H.R. 1606, 
and for including it in today's markup. I am proud to join you 
and Representative Ellzey as the sponsor of this bill, which is 
led by our colleague, Representative Brad Schneider.
    In addition to this Committee, I serve on the Veterans 
Committee, and we talk all the time about the importance of 
having strong systems to ensure smooth transition from service 
to civilian life. SBA's successful Boots to Business program 
plays a crucial role in that warm handoff, supporting our brave 
men and women as they return home.
    Members of our military and their spouses have the 
entrepreneurial spirit and skills necessary to become 
successful business owners and this program provides critical 
help in unlocking their potential. I look forward to its 
success for years to come with this authorization.
    I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill and 
yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. I would now like to recognize the other 
leading Republican, Mr. Ellzey, for an opening statement.
    Mr. ELLZEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to say 
thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Schneider, and Mr. McGarvey, for 
leading on this bill.
    The bipartisan Boots to Business program is an important 
step toward helping military veterans start and grow 
businesses. Helping the veteran will obviously help the entire 
family of the veteran. Going from active duty to veteran status 
is difficult because the service member is leaving the support 
system of their military family. But the Boots to Business 
program will help show a path forward toward success.
    As I have said many times, the military does a great job 
training our service members to do their military job. They are 
trained to be the most lethal force on the planet and how to 
best defend and protect the people of the United States. But 
the military does not do a good job at all of training them to 
be civilians. The Boots to Business program will help to fill 
that gap. Helping veterans be successful in civilian lie is 
critical for their well-being and the well-being of their 
entire family and the communities where they live.
    I look forward to this bill passing the House, the Senate, 
and being signed into law by the president. I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. I would now like to recognize the 
Democratic sponsor of the bill, Mr. Schneider, for an opening 
statement.
    Mr. SCHNEIDER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me again 
thank you for allowing me to join you today. Having served 3 
terms on this Committee, it is always a joy to be back in this 
room and with this group.
    I also want to thank the Committee for its consideration 
today of this legislation, the Veteran Entrepreneurship 
Training Act of 2023, which I am very proud to introduce with 
Chairman Williams, Mr. McGarvey, and Mr. Ellzey. And I look 
forward to, as was just noted, seeing it pass the House, the 
Senate, and be signed by the president.
    As was noted, our military are the best and the brightest 
we have to offer. They reflect who we are as a nation. They 
serve in places far away, laying their lives on the line to 
protect us and protect our freedoms. Success in their endeavors 
depends to a great extent on their natural leadership 
abilities, their innovation, their entrepreneurship, taking 
uncertain circumstances and finding ways to get things done.
    This is the exact same success that we are looking for in 
today's business leaders and why this program is so important. 
The skills our veterans learn and develop in the military have 
true application to what we are looking for in the private 
sector. And the Boots to Business program helps translate those 
skills. It helps our veterans translate those skills as they 
begin civilian life.
    Our bill builds on proven outcomes by codifying the already 
successful program. In fact, more than 100,000 veterans and 
their spouses have already benefitted from this program since 
2013.
    According to the Department of Labor, in April, the April 
Jobs Report, the unemployment rate among veterans is a mere 2.2 
percent compared to 3.4 for the rest of the U.S. population. 
Historic lows. This is in no small part due to the transition 
programs like Boots to Business that are helping our veterans 
move into their lives. Through the Boots to Business program, 
service members and their spouses enroll in a multiweek in-
depth course. This course teaches participants everything from 
the process of market research to the art of securing funding 
for a new business. By codifying the Boots to Business program 
into law, we can ensure future service members are able to take 
advantage of the program so many have already benefitted from.
    I appreciate Chairman Williams co-leading this bill and 
working with me to get it through the finish line. Over the 
years, I have heard from many service people turn small 
business owners who have directly benefitted from training 
provided by the Boots to Business program. With so many 
communities seeming to replace the businesses that did not 
survive the pandemic, this program is even more important.
    I am pleased that this bill has also enjoyed bipartisan 
support and I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to show their support by voting in favor of it today.
    Once again, I want to thank the Committee staff who have 
drafted this legislation, and my colleague, Roger Williams. I 
look forward to seeing this legislation go one step closer to 
being finally signed into law.
    And with that I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.
    And are there any other Members who wish to be recognized 
for a statement on the bill?
    Seeing none, I would like to recognize the Ranking Member 
to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    In light of the upcoming Memorial Day holiday, it is an 
honor to support the Veteran Entrepreneurship Training Act that 
greatly benefits our nation's veterans.
    Representative Schneider has been a long-time champion of 
this bill which codifies the SBA's Boots to Business program to 
help transitioning service members launch and grow their own 
small businesses. And I applaud Chairman Williams for his 
leadership as well as the other two co-sponsors, 
Representatives McGarvey and Ellzey.
    As Members of this Committee know, starting a business is 
not for the faint of heart. It takes courage, perseverance, 
resourcefulness, and leadership to launch a successful 
enterprise. Many of these qualities are inherent in those that 
serve our country. Despite their skills and expertise, many 
service members have difficulty transitioning to civilian life.
    A recent survey conducted by the Syracuse University 
Institute for Veterans and Military Families found 44 percent 
expressed difficulty with transitioning from military life and 
53 percent said they did not know what they wanted to do as 
civilians. Entrepreneurship is one path service members can 
pursue to make the transition a success.
    In Fiscal Year 2022, nearly 24,000 veterans, transitioning 
service members, and military spouses received Boots to 
Business entrepreneurship program. The program has been a 
shining example of how the SBA and its resource partners can 
make sure the American dream is accessible to the valued men 
and women of our military as well as veterans and military 
spouses.
    That is why I urge all the Members today to support this 
bill.
    Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you for that. And I once again 
voice my support for this bill.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 1606.
    The clerk will report the bill.
    The CLERK. H.R. 1606, to amend the Small Business Act----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 1606 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    All right. Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of 
H.R. 1606 and ordering it favorably be reported to the House.
    All those in favor, say aye.
    Opposed, say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it and H.R. 1606 
is----
    Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Chairman? Request to record a vote.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. All right.
    And a roll vote is ordered.
    And so pursuant to Committee Rule 13 and House 11, further 
proceedings on the bill are postponed.
    H.R. 3511
    The final bill we will mark up today is H.R. 3511, Service 
Disabled Veteran Opportunities and Small Business Act 
introduced by Mr. LaLota and Mr. McGarvey.
    I now recognize sponsor of legislation, Mr. LaLota, for an 
opening statement.
    Mr. LALOTA. Thank you, Chairman Williams, for recognizing 
this important piece of legislation to help the veteran 
community specifically service disabled veterans. Those who 
have served our nation in uniform, putting our great country 
before themselves, deserve our utmost thanks, support, and 
respect. We owe an even greater debt of gratitude to our 
service-disabled veterans.
    As service-disabled veterans transition to civilian life 
and look to enter the government contracting space, this 
Committee should identify and implement ways to make that 
transition earlier. Proudly, Mr. Chairman, this bill does just 
that.
    The Service-Disabled Veteran Opportunities and Small 
Business Act provides greater opportunities to our nation's 
disabled veterans by allowing for additional contracts to be 
awarded to them through the small business administration and 
Office of Veterans Business Development. Currently, agencies 
must set a goal to procure at least 3 percent of their 
contracting dollars with service-disabled, veteran-owned small 
businesses. Unfortunately, many agencies are failing to meet 
this statutory requirement. In fact, the entire federal 
government failed to meet this 3 percent goal to subcontract to 
service disabled veterans.
    This legislation helps to solve that problem by requiring 
the Small Business Administration and the Office of the 
Veterans Business Development to provide training to federal 
agency officials who fall below that 3 percent goal on how to 
increase the number of contracts awarded to service-disabled 
veterans who own or control a small business. Together, the SBA 
and the Office of Veterans Business Development will issue 
guidance on the best practices on how to increase the number of 
contracts to our nation's heroes.
    I urge my colleagues to support the Service-Disabled 
Veteran Opportunities in Small Business Act and I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you, Mr. LaLota.
    And I would now like to recognize the other sponsor of the 
bill, Mr. McGarvey, for an opening statement.
    Mr. MCGARVEY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Again, I 
appreciate you helping bring this bill forward. Thank you to 
Representative LaLota. Thank you, Representative LaLota, for 
your service, for your leadership on this, for always working 
to help our veterans.
    This weekend we are going to observe Memorial Day and 
remember those who gave as President Lincoln said, ``The last 
full measure of devotion for our country.'' We will take Monday 
to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice, but this 
Congress should work every single day to serve those who served 
us, especially those who return home with the wounds of their 
service, both visible and invisible.
    So I am proud to join Representative LaLota as a sponsor of 
the Service Disabled Veteran Opportunities in Small Business 
Act, and I am grateful it was included in today's markup.
    This bill would require the SBA to issue guidance for 
agencies to better meet contracting goals for service-disabled, 
veteran-owned small businesses and provide training for each 
agency that fails to achieve the goals. The bill also requires 
a report to Congress detailing the agencies that do not meet 
their goals so this Committee can better understand what works 
and what does not and continue to improve business 
opportunities for service-disabled business owners.
    I urge my colleagues to support the bill. I look forward to 
its passage today.
    I yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Are there any other Members who wish to 
be recognized for a statement on H.R. 3511?
    All right. Seeing none, I would like to recognize the 
Ranking Member to speak on the bill.
    Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I am pleased to lend my support to the Service-Disabled 
Veteran Opportunities in Small Business Act, which is being led 
by Mr. LaLota, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Contracting and 
Infrastructure, and Mr. McGarvey, Ranking Member of the 
Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Workforce Development 
Subcommittee.
    In an effort to increase the number of contracts to 
service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, the bill 
requires SBA to issue guidance for each agency to better meet 
the current SDVOSB goal and provide training for agencies that 
come up short. Building our small business base within the 
federal procurement space is a vital component of providing the 
government with the best products and services, while also 
investing in the economic growth of America. Holding agencies 
accountable for meeting government set-aside goals and 
adequately training and funding our contracting personnel can 
deliver tangible results to the small contractors fighting for 
limited opportunities.
    Thank you to both Mr. LaLota and Mr. McGarvey for your 
commitment to our nation's veterans and your bipartisan work to 
find a practical approach to increase the awards to service-
disabled, veteran-owned small business owners.
    I urge a yes vote and yield back.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Thank you.
    I now recognize myself to speak in support of this 
legislation, H.R. 3511, the Service-Disabled, Veteran-
Opportunities in Small Business Act would amend the Small 
Business Act to require training to increase the number of 
contracts awarded to small businesses that are owned and 
operated by service-disabled veterans.
    Our veterans have fought bravely and served our country 
with honor, and they deserve our support as they transition 
from military to civilian life, especially as they are looking 
to break into the government contracting space.
    I want to thank my distinguished colleagues for introducing 
this bill and urge all my colleagues to support.
    If there is no further discussion, the Committee now moves 
to consideration of H.R. 3511.
    The clerk will read and report the bill.
    The CLERK. H.R. 3511, to amend the Small Business Act----
    Chairman WILLIAMS. Without objection, H.R. 3511 is 
considered as read and open for amendment.
    Does anyone wish to offer an amendment?
    Seeing none, the question is now on adoption of H.R. 3511, 
is agreed to and ordered favorably reported to the House.
    All those in favor, say aye.
    All those opposed, say no.
    In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it.
    H.R. 3511 is agreed to and ordered favorably to the House.
    Mr. LALOTA. Mr. Chairman, I request a recorded vote, 
please.
    Chairman WILLIAMS. All right. A recorded vote has been 
requested. So a roll call vote is ordered pursuant to Committee 
Rule 13 and House Rule 11. Further proceedings on the bill are 
postponed. The Committee stands in recess. Subject to the call 
of the Chair, we will resume later today, 2:30 p.m., to vote on
