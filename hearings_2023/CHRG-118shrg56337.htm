                     Wednesday, September 27, 2023

                                        U.S. Senate
          Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in room 
328A, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Debbie Stabenow, 
Chairwoman of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Stabenow [presiding], Brown, Klobuchar, 
Bennet, Gillibrand, Booker, Warnock, Welch, Fetterman, Boozman, 
Hoeven, Ernst, Hyde-Smith, Marshall, Tuberville, Braun, 
Grassley, Thune, and Fischer.

STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE STABENOW, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
    OF MICHIGAN, CHAIRWOMAN, U.S. COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
                    NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY

    Chairwoman Stabenow. I call the Committee to order of the 
Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. We first want 
to welcome the witnesses we will be hearing from. Deputy Under 
Secretary Montano Greene, Mr. Pittman, and Dr. Ortega, we thank 
you all for being here today, and we of course, in a few 
minutes, will hear from our colleagues who have been playing 
leadership roles on this issue who are not on the Committee. 
Then as we move through today, we will of course hear from 
colleagues on the Committee who have important legislation as 
well.
    Agriculture is crucial to our American way of life. That is 
what we know. I always say that we do not have an economy 
unless somebody makes something and somebody grows something. 
That is how we have an economy in the United States. Our food 
industry and agriculture support more than 21 million jobs, 
contributing roughly $1.2 trillion to the American economy, and 
providing a safe and affordable food supply.
    Also, we know food security is national security. That is 
the message I shared in 2013, when I held a hearing in this 
Committee to review the purchase of Smithfield Foods by a 
Chinese company. It was the largest purchase of a U.S. company, 
and the first purchase of a major U.S. food and agriculture 
company by a Chinese firm. After that hearing, I worked with 
Senator Grassley to introduce the Food Security Is National 
Security Act, to help ensure that acquisitions of U.S. food and 
agriculture companies receive proper scrutiny. It gives USDA 
and FDA officials permanent representation on the Committee on 
Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and we will 
certainly hear more about CFIUS today. It adds new criteria 
that consider impacts to the U.S. food systems.
    Since that time, other major U.S. food and agriculture 
companies have been bought by foreign companies. American 
farmers and families have raised many questions, from the 
economic impacts of foreign purchases in our food supply chain, 
to how we can protect agriculture innovation and research 
spurred by U.S. investment, and more. The American people 
deserve careful consideration of how foreign investment will 
affect the future of our farms, ranches, and agriculture 
economy.
    Today, we are having a conversation and a fact-finding 
session about foreign investment in U.S. agricultural land. 
This discussion is not new. Then-Congressman Grassley--and I 
see he is not here yet, so please let him know I gave him 
several shout-outs today with Senator Ernst. Congressman 
Grassley helped author the Agriculture Foreign Investment 
Disclosure Act of 1978, in an attempt to understand the full 
picture of foreign ownership of U.S. farmland. That was nearly 
five decades ago. Thanks to the data base established under 
that law, we know that foreign investors today hold an interest 
in nearly 40 million acres of American farm and forest land, 
which represents just over three percent of all privately held 
agricultural land in the U.S.
    While this is a small fraction of overall agricultural 
land, foreign ownership has increased 66 percent since 2010, 
nearly two million acres per year. The largest foreign 
stakeholders in American farmland remain countries like Canada, 
the United Kingdom, and those in Europe, while Chinese 
ownership is less than 1 percent of all foreign-held farmland 
up to this point. We have heard some real concerns about 
foreign ownership and that it may be undercounted, and that the 
American government lacks the proper oversight tools to see the 
whole picture.
    It is also important to consider what impacts foreign 
investment can have on U.S. farmers and consumers. I was 
pleased to partner with Senator Ernst to introduce a bipartisan 
bill earlier this year, the FARMLAND Act, which is aimed at 
improving the reporting process and providing new resources for 
USDA, and a number of other members as well have introduced 
important bills on this topic.
    In July, the Senate adopted an amendment on this issue, 
authored by Senators Tester and Rounds, to the National Defense 
Authorization Act. I am glad that the idea of adding USDA to 
CFIUS, that Senator Grassley and I first proposed, was included 
in this amendment.
    The leadership of Senators Tester and Rounds on these 
issues has been critical. We are glad to hear from them today, 
and also glad to hear from two other leaders not on our 
Committee, Senators Baldwin and Lankford, who will be sharing 
information as well.
    Our national security depends on a food system that is 
safe, secure, affordable, abundant, and resilient. As foreign 
entities continue their acquisitions of U.S. food and 
agricultural assets, American farmers and families deserve to 
know that these transactions receive proper scrutiny. We must 
also be cautious of our history of barring immigrants from 
owning land in our country, and ensure efforts to protect our 
national and economic security interests do not encourage 
discrimination.
    To that end, I would like to submit for the record a letter 
from Congresswoman Judy Chu, the Chair of the Congressional 
Asian Pacific American Caucus, that offers recommendations on 
how the Committee can examine this issue without casting 
suspicion or discrimination toward Asian Americans. Without 
objection, I will submit that for the record.

    [The letter can be found on page 72 in the Appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Deputy Under Secretary Montano Greene, 
Director Pittman, Associate Professor Ortega, we look forward 
to hearing your insight on these matters, and now I turn to my 
partner on the Committee, Ranking Member Boozman for any 
opening remarks that he would like to make.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            ARKANSAS

    Senator Boozman. Well thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you 
for convening this hearing. We have traveled the country, we 
have held hearings in Washington, listening to farmers and 
ranchers discuss their priorities for the upcoming farm bill, 
and this topic has been brought to the Committee's attention on 
numerous occasions. I have been asked many times for my 
thoughts on this matter, and my answer has always been that we 
need to better understand the problem before we can provide a 
solution.
    Today's hearing is a good first step in bringing more 
information to the discussion. My hope is that at the end of 
today's hearing, we will have a clearer picture of the scope 
and the scale of the issues foreign ownership of U.S. farmland 
poses to our country. Thank you, Madam Chair, very much for 
working with us to get this hearing scheduled. Many of our 
Senate colleagues on and off the Committee have given 
considerable thought to the issues of foreign land ownership. 
We will have the opportunity to hear from many of them this 
morning, and I look forward to hearing about what their States 
are experiencing and how they believe we should address their 
concerns.
    As we move this discussion forward and consider various 
proposals, there are several considerations and questions that 
I would urge my colleagues to keep in mind. First, whatever we 
do must respect and protect the private property rights of U.S. 
citizens. Second, land use issues have historically been 
decided at the State and local levels. Are State laws 
sufficient to address the issues posed by foreign ownership? 
Does the Federal Government need to play a larger role? If the 
Federal Government does get more deeply involved, what are the 
impacts of increased regulation on asset values and liquidity 
that may hinder investment in agriculture in rural America?
    Finally, let's not forget that there are other parties 
aside from foreign operators that have made significant 
investments to acquire Americans' farmland, pastureland, and 
forest that are not the subject of this hearing, yet these 
purchases also impact farmers' and ranchers' ability to compete 
for land access, and they impact the Nation's food and energy 
security. There is more work to be done, and I look forward to 
future efforts by this Committee to explore the overall 
ownership of U.S. agricultural land and how it affects rural 
communities and economies across the country.
    In conclusion, I would like to join Senator Stabenow in 
welcoming four guests to the Agriculture Committee. Like 
several members on this Committee, our esteemed colleagues 
Senators Tester, Rounds, Baldwin, and Lankford have each 
introduced thoughtful legislative proposals, and I am grateful 
for their engagement. I look forward to working with each of 
you as we move forward, and thanks again, Madam Chair, for 
again working so that we could make this possible. I look 
forward to the discussion.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you so much, and thanks 
for working closely on this hearing together.
    Senator Baldwin, we have four people, four Senators we 
invited; I guess you are speaking for all of them. We have the 
most powerful person here. Senator Baldwin, from Wisconsin, as 
we know, our great colleague who is very involved in leadership 
in this, and we really appreciate your sharing your thoughts 
today.

STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                           WISCONSIN

    Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Chair Stabenow and Ranking 
Member Boozman. Good morning to all the Committee members, and 
thank you for convening this hearing on a very important issue 
of foreign ownership of U.S. farmland.
    In Wisconsin, the agriculture industry is a major economic 
driver, contributing more than 104 billion annually to our 
State's economy. The industry supports hundreds of thousands of 
jobs, especially in our rural communities, giving us the 
acclaimed name, America's Dairyland. Our robust agriculture 
industry also helps keep our country safe, as food security is 
national security.
    Our foreign competitors realize this also. When foreign 
investors own American farmland and agricultural processing 
capacity, it can put our country and domestic food supply and 
local communities at risk, and right now, we do not know the 
full extent of the risk at hand. Outdated reporting systems and 
a lack of auditing, at both a State and Federal level, leave us 
with incomplete information and many questions. That is why I 
appreciate the opportunity to highlight for the Committee the 
alarming gap in comprehensive data on foreign ownership of 
agricultural land across the country.
    Senator Grassley has long led on this issue, and I was 
proud to work with him to introduce and pass our Farmland 
Security Act last Congress, this legislation that we were able 
to include in the omnibus last year. The Farmland Security Act 
of 2022 requires the Department of Agriculture to transition 
away from their outdated filing system to an online form, and 
create a disaggregated, public-facing data base of filings for 
supporting national security and food security research. Under 
our 2022 law, the USDA must also report to Congress on the 
impacts of foreign ownership of agricultural land on family 
farms, rural communities, and our domestic food supply.
    While passing our legislation was a step in the right 
direction, Congress can and must do more, and that is why I 
have partnered once again with Senator Grassley to introduce 
the Farmland Security Act of 2023. Our new legislation would go 
even further in addressing foreign activity in our domestic 
agriculture marketplace. As this Committee works to write the 
next farm bill, I urge you to include this bipartisan bill in 
the final version.
    The Farmland Security Act of 2023 would give USDA 
additional tools to address and penalize shell corporations who 
fail to comply with our Nation's foreign ownership laws. It 
requires annual auditing of foreign ownership filings to ensure 
that we have the whole picture of our food security or national 
security risks. This legislation also goes beyond looking just 
at ownership trends by scrutinizing the impacts of long-term 
leasing of agricultural land. Importantly, the Farmland 
Security Act of 2023 requires USDA to take a closer look into 
foreign ownership of our agricultural production capacity.
    Many of the products that our farmers make here are only as 
good as the processors that help them get it to market, and we 
need to get a look under the hood of the entire supply chain in 
order to ensure that it is resilient and capable of preventing 
any malign foreign influence. We saw the increase in exports 
from U.S.-based, foreign-owned meat processors during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, while those very same processors jacked up 
the prices of meat at the grocery store for American families. 
That market disruption illuminated the larger trend that we are 
not in total control of in our domestic agricultural supply 
chain.
    By understanding the full extent of foreign ownership in 
American's agriculture market, we can take the necessary steps 
to protect American consumers and safeguard both our food 
security and rural farming economies for generations to come. 
As lawmakers, we must ensure that we have access to information 
about foreign ownership of our food system, and this Committee 
has the opportunity to do so in the next farm bill. I thank you 
again for having me here to testify.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well thank you, Senator Baldwin, for 
your long-time leadership on this. This is so important, and we 
appreciate your efforts and look forward to continuing to work 
with you.
    Senator Lankford, welcome. We are so happy to have you.

 STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES LANKFORD, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
                          OF OKLAHOMA

    Senator Lankford. Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to 
slip into the prestigious Ag Committee, and to be able to have 
this kind of conversation and be able to walk through it. I 
would love to be able to tell you a story of how I got involved 
in this at all. Obviously I come from Oklahoma, which is a 
State with four million people. Literally, two million of them 
live in urban areas, and two million of them live in rural 
areas. Like many of you as well, we have this great 
distribution in our State, so I have been interested in this in 
an ancillary way in many ways, until 2018.
    In 2018, my State passed a Medical Marijuana Law. Now it 
was the most liberal medical marijuana bill in the Nation at 
that time, and what we saw was a rush to be able to buy up 
farmland in our State. It was a shift that surprised a lot of 
people in the State, based on how quickly it happened and based 
on who actually did it. Oklahoma is now No. 8 in the Nation for 
having land owned by foreign entities in our State, since 2018, 
when we passed that. In fact, the year after we passed a 
Medical Marijuana Law in our State, the next year, Oklahoma had 
more land sales to foreign entities than any other State in the 
Nation. We saw a rush that came into our State. We have great 
land prices. We have great prices for electricity, and ready 
access to water. All those features all came together to have a 
huge amount of land that actually shifted into foreign 
ownership in the days literally leading after the passage of 
the Medical Marijuana Law.
    Just in the past decade, to give you a percentage on this, 
we have had a 500 percent increase in our State of foreign 
ownership of land--just in the past decade. We have 7,000 
licensed marijuana grows in our State now. That is since 2018; 
in 2017, we had zero. Now we have 7,000. Thousands of those are 
actually illegal operations that have not gone through the full 
licensing capability. Of those, our Oklahoma Bureau of 
Narcotics States that about 75 percent of those are actually 
Chinese-owned facilities. What we have found is, Chinese 
criminal organizations are partnering with Mexican cartels to 
be able to facilitate the distribution of marijuana nationwide, 
and they are using Oklahoma as the source for that, and this 
has all kicked in just since the 2018 vote.
    The problem in Oklahoma has gained a lot of national 
attention; many of you have probably heard about it as well. 
Politico did a large feature article on it called ``The Growing 
Chinese Investment in Illegal American Weed,'' was their big 
article, and they did multiple different stories on it, but 
Oklahoma has been the epicenter on that. We have also seen 
things like in 2022, execution-style murders on a rural farm in 
Kingfisher, Oklahoma, where multiple people were left dead in 
an execution and a shooter on the run, all of them Chinese 
nationals--in rural Oklahoma.
    We have multiple entities that are in Oklahoma that are law 
enforcement, sheriff's department and otherwise, that are 
having a difficult time because if they pull someone over, they 
do not speak English, they speak Mandarin, and it has become 
its own unique challenge. It has also led to a tremendous 
amount of human trafficking and sex trafficking to be able to 
work in these different farms across our State.
    We have seen over and over again individuals that have come 
across our southern border illegally that are Chinese nationals 
that end up in the marijuana farms, and they are working off 
their debt, literally being moved from farm to farm to farm. 
They literally do not even know what town that they are in, or 
often what State that they are in when they are actually 
arrested and the operation is taken down.
    That brought my attention to what was happening and got me 
to ask a simple question--if that is happening in Oklahoma, 
what is happening in the rest of the Nation, and what are we 
seeing? What I have seen is a tremendous rise in foreign 
ownership of land around our country. All of us that are in ag 
States all know the saying, there is lots of things you can get 
more of; there is not more land. It is incredibly precious to 
us as Americans to be able to make sure we are making right 
decisions on this.
    We have worked for several years to be able to find a way 
to be able to deal with this foreign ownership of land issue, 
and we have something called the SOIL Act. The SOIL Act we have 
brought up for several years and continue to be able to refine 
it, add additional ideas to it. My partners on this are 
Senators Bennet, Risch, and Tillis. We have worked together 
specifically on the ag issues here, and let me walk through the 
details of it. It requires review of agricultural real estate 
purchased by certain foreign entities through the CFIUS 
process, which we think is a reasonable place to be able to put 
that. It restricts Federal assistance for foreign-held real 
estate holdings, and it broadens disclosure requirements for 
land purchases made by foreign entities through the AFIDA 
process.
    For us, we are focused in on, what are we doing to actually 
make this a better process? It does not do a blanket 
prohibition of foreign ownership of land, but it puts an 
additional hoop in the process so that illegal operations are 
not going to go through that hoop. If they have got to go 
through the CFIUS hoop and they can actually show that there is 
a reason they should have that land holding, they should be 
able to actually earn the right to be able to do that. We have 
foreign ownership across our Nation, from multiple entities. 
That has never been an issue for us as Americans, but we should 
actually ask the basic question, why, before we are making 
agricultural land available to them.
    We attempt to be forward-looking in this as well by not 
citing one particular country or group of countries, but using 
the established list from the Department of Commerce and the 
Director of National Intelligence, just saying as that list 
shifts from the Department of Commerce and the Director of 
National Intelligence, it would also shift in ours as well. We 
are narrowing in specifically on this Committee's jurisdiction. 
The SOIL Act closes current reporting loopholes currently in 
the AFIDA process by requiring reports of leases longer than 
five years, and the disclosure regardless of acreages.
    The reason is that we have a lease loophole that is 
currently in the AFIDA process that if you do not own it but 
you lease it, you do not have to go through that reporting 
process. We are trying to be able to close that loophole. Then 
currently, that process also allows just 10 acres or more. For 
many of these, for instance, marijuana farms, they are at nine 
acres or less, and so they are not going through that process 
because they are building greenhouses to be able to take that 
on. This would close up those two loopholes that are currently 
in the AFIDA process, that are under this Committee's 
jurisdiction.
    We have tried to be able to work through the process, tried 
to be able to get this right, in a way that we think actually 
helps us as a nation to be able to protect our ag, and quite 
frankly, also to be able to deal with criminal organizations 
that are trying to take advantage of our very open nation. 
Thank you for hearing us out and for doing the work to be able 
to address this.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well thank you very much, Senator 
Lankford, and it certainly brings a different perspective. My 
mother grew up on their family farm in Oklahoma picking cotton, 
and so this is a very different picture that you are portraying 
as of what is happening, so appreciate your legislation and 
your focus on this very much.
    Senator Rounds has joined us, part of the duo of Senator 
Tester and Senator Rounds. I know there is another important 
committee meeting going on in Banking and that you are both 
coming back and forth, but we wanted to give you an opportunity 
since you both worked so hard in the NDAA to be able to have 
your amendment passed, and we wanted to give you a few moments 
to share what that does.

 STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE ROUNDS, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                          SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Rounds. Well, thank you, Madam Chair, and I suspect 
that Senator Tester will be here shortly; we were both at the 
Banking hearing together. First let me just say good morning, 
and I do believe that it is truly a privilege to be here today 
with the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry. I want to thank you, Madam Chair, along with Ranking 
Member Boozman, for taking a special interest in this issue and 
inviting me to provide some remarks at the hearing today, along 
with Senator Tester, who is just arriving now. Do not worry; I 
am just holding things up long enough for you to get here.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. I think Senator Tester always knows 
how to make an entrance.
    Senator Tester. Thank you. Keep filibustering, buddy.
    Senator Rounds. Well, as you all know, China and Russia are 
our near-peer adversaries, and North Korea and Iran are no 
friends of the United States. These four adversaries view 
America as their top competitor and only wish to gain advantage 
and opportunities to surveil our Nation's capabilities and 
resources.
    Over the course of the last several years, it has become 
very apparent that an increasing number of foreign purchases of 
American agricultural land is posing a threat to national 
security. After listening to the concerns of American 
producers, Senator Tester and I introduced the Promoting 
Agriculture Safeguards and Security, or PASS Act, to ban China, 
Russia, North Korea, and Iran from purchasing American farmland 
or ag businesses. Key portions of this legislation were 
included in Amendment Number 813 to the Senate-passed National 
Defense Authorization Act; it is now referred to as Section 
1086.
    Section 1086 would strengthen our national security while 
still providing access and opportunity for our foreign 
partners. Foreign investment into U.S. real estate and farmland 
presents many economic opportunities, but in some cases can 
present significant consequences to our national security, 
trade, and food security. While Chinese entities currently hold 
slightly less than one percent of all foreign-held acreage in 
the United States, the volume of their holdings have surged 
exponentially over the last 13 years, from roughly 13,000 acres 
to over 352,000 acres, and foreign ownership and investment in 
the United States agricultural land nearly doubled.
    In recent years, our country has seen firsthand attempts by 
our near-peer competitors to acquire land adjacent to our 
military bases. In 2020, a Chinese-linked company planned to 
build a wind energy farm project near Del Rio, Texas, only 
miles away from Laughlin Air Force Base where U.S. pilots are 
trained.
    In 2022, a Chinese-linked company attempted to build a corn 
milling plant on farmland near a sensitive Air Force base 
outside Grand Forks, North Dakota. Treasury later determined 
that they did not have the proper jurisdiction to act in this 
case, which demonstrates the need for this Section to become 
law. The legislation, as included in the Senate-passed version 
of the NDAA, would require the
    Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or 
CFIUS, to prohibit China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran from 
purchasing agricultural land and agricultural businesses in the 
United States, and make reforms to the CFIUS process to improve 
our country's ability to protect our national security.
    However, this legislation would also allow the President of 
the United States to waive the requirement prohibiting a 
purchase by one of these four countries. This decision would be 
made on a case-by-case basis, if it is deemed that doing so is 
in the national security interest of the United States, and 
would require a report to Congress by the President. It also 
adds the Secretary of Ag as an ex officio member of CFIUS, 
giving them the ability to consult on all cases if they so 
choose. Additionally, this legislation does not alter current 
exemptions for our trusted allies--the United Kingdom, Canada, 
Australia, and New Zealand--to make purchases without being 
subject to CFIUS review.
    I want to thank my friend from Montana, Senator Tester, for 
his hard work to get our amendment into the Senate-passed 
Fiscal Year 2024 NDAA, and on our original bill, the PASS Act. 
This is a common-sense provision that will make our homeland 
more secure. However, it is just the first step in addressing 
this issue on a broader scale. Specifically, I commend the work 
done by Chairman Stabenow, Senator Ernst, Senator Braun, and 
others on several pieces of legislation to enhance the 
Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act (AFIDA), a 
critical piece to addressing this issue. As the Committee gets 
closer to completing its work on the farm bill, I request that 
you build on what we started with Section 1086 with additional 
legislation, because there is more work to be done.
    I again want to thank the Chairwoman and Ranking Member for 
holding this hearing, and allowing non-Committee members to 
provide their perspective. I look forward to working with the 
members of the Senate Ag Committee on this critical issue. 
Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well thank you so much, Senator 
Rounds, and we so appreciate your leadership, Senator Tester's 
leadership on what is now Section 1086.
    Senator Tester, welcome. Thank you so much for all of your 
leadership on this issue. It is very important, and we are glad 
to have you before the Committee.

 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            MONTANA

    Senator Tester. I will do my best to be very brief. I want 
to thank you, Chairman Stabenow, Ranking Member Boozman, for 
having this hearing. I think it is a very important hearing. I 
want to thank you for the courtesy of allowing four Senators 
that do not sit on this Committee to be able to speak to this 
issue, because I think it is a very important issue.
    Look, many of you know--in fact, I think all of you know--I 
have a real life outside the Senate; I am a farmer. I can tell 
you that everybody in this room also knows that food security 
is national security. When we are talking about somebody like 
the Chinese Communist Party, which is what Senator Rounds 
referred to, putting up a corn milling plant within miles of a 
sensitive Air Force base, and our agencies cannot do anything 
about it, we need to give them the authority. We need to make 
sure that this does not happen. Because quite honestly--and 
some of you know this, probably all of you know this--China, 
Russia, Iran, North Korea, they are not friends of ours. They 
want to do things to make us less than what we are today, so we 
should not allow these bad actors to be on our soil, honestly. 
The fact is is that if they are there to have impacts on our 
food supply, that is bad business. If they are there to spy on 
us, they should not be allowed to spy on us anywhere in the 
world, and certainly not on our own soil.
    Senator Rounds spoke a lot about what I was going to talk 
about in my remarks; there is no need repeating it. We have had 
some successes in this Congress, but none of them have got to 
the President's desk yet. I appreciate the fact that you guys 
are doing this and showing the kind of leadership in a 
committee that is all things agriculture, because this is 
important. It is important for this Nation's food security, our 
national security; it is important for our citizenry. Thank you 
for doing this hearing.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you so much. We deeply 
appreciate it. We hope the NDAA is passed by the Senate and 
gets to the President's desk so he can sign it, and we 
appreciate all of you and your leadership in bringing together 
all the various pieces that we need to be focused on on this 
issue. Thank you so much.
    We will now ask our three witnesses, our panel, to join us.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. You are welcome to join us at the 
table. Thank you so much.
    Senator Booker. I just want to say for the record that Mr. 
Ortega has too much hair.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Booker. I feel----
    Chairwoman Stabenow.--for the record, we will indicate that 
Senator Booker is deeply concerned.
    Senator Booker. I take it as a personal attack. I want it 
noted.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. All right. Well good morning, and let 
me introduce our three witnesses and then ask each of you to 
make some comments.
    Gloria Montano Greene is the Deputy Under Secretary for 
Farm Production and Conservation, FPAC. In her position, 
Montano Greene leads agencies that deliver farm programs and 
services to farmers, ranchers, and other producers. She is also 
a former State executive director for the Farm Service Agency 
in Arizona, so we so appreciate your being with us.
    Our next witness, that Senator Booker has attacked so far, 
Mr. Boozman, I will turn to you to introduce, because he is 
from your State, and I think you may be offended by what 
Senator Booker said. I am not sure.
    Senator Boozman. Well, we are pleased to have Mr. Harrison 
Pittman, a proud Arkansan, with us on the panel today. Harrison 
is the Director of the National Agricultural Law Center, a 
University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. He 
received his Juris Doctor and LLM from the University of 
Arkansas Law School, in Little Rock and Fayetteville, 
respectively, and has worked at the center since 2001.
    Harrison is an active member of the American Agriculture 
Law Association, and is a frequent presenter on a range of 
topics, including the farm bill, water law, and environmental 
law. He has authored articles on numerous subjects, including 
the National Organic Program, the constitutionality of 
corporate farming laws, pesticide litigation, the Packers and 
Stockyards Act, and the list goes on and on.
    Many food, environment, and agriculture stakeholders depend 
on Harrison and his team to work to provide accessible, 
dependable, and objective legal analysis, so we are all proud 
of the work that they do. Thank you, Harrison, for taking the 
time to be with us, and a special thanks to the rest of the 
panel for your willingness to be with us today.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much. Senator Booker, I 
misheard you. You were actually attacking my witness, from 
Michigan State University. I just want to--although I see two 
people----
    Senator Boozman [continuing]. Harrison has got plenty of 
hair, too.
    Chairwoman Stabenow.--that have wonderful heads of hair.
    [Laughter.]
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Yes, yes. I am so pleased that Dr. 
David Ortega, a food and agricultural economist and professor 
at Michigan State University, is with us today. Welcome. His 
research focuses on understanding consumer, producer, and 
agribusiness decisionmaking to better inform food policy. Dr. 
Ortega has vast experience studying food systems in various 
developing and emerging countries, and we are so pleased, Dr. 
Ortega, that you are with us this morning.
    Let me turn first to Deputy Under Secretary Montano Greene. 
We would ask for five minutes, and then anything further you 
would like to submit for the record. Good morning.

  STATEMENT OF GLORIA MONTANO GREENE, DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY, 
     FARM PRODUCTION AND CONSERVATION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
                  AGRICULTURE, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Montano Greene. Good morning. Chairwoman Stabenow, 
Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the Committee, thank you 
for the opportunity to come before you today to discuss the 
Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978. It is 
an honor to serve as Deputy Under Secretary for Farm Production 
and Conservation, which we regularly call FPAC. It is rewarding 
work. It is the one mission area at USDA that houses all the 
producer-facing agencies. Every day, I get to work with four 
agencies across the country--the Farm Service Agency, the Risk 
Management Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and 
the FPAC Business Center--to provide farmers, ranchers, and 
forest landowners support, be it through farm loans, disaster 
programs, safety net, risk management, conservation programs, 
and other items that they might be facing. It is an honor, a 
privilege, and a great responsibility to work alongside more 
than 20,000 public servants across more than 2,900 offices that 
support our producers.
    FPAC is also the mission area that houses the filing of 
AFIDA. I want to take a moment to be able to recognize this 
mighty AFIDA team, FPAC's Economic and Policy Analysis staff, 
who work on AFIDA and are working hard to improve outreach and 
filing information to ensure they are getting the best 
information possible.
    Any foreign person who buys, sells, or holds a direct or 
indirect interest in U.S. agriculture land must report their 
holdings and transactions to USDA through the AFIDA report, 
also known as FSA Form 153. Lease holds of 10 years or more on 
agricultural land, often involving wind turbine and solar panel 
interests, must also submit a report to USDA. AFIDA is self-
reporting. Currently, the AFIDA reporting system uses a paper-
based approach to data collection. We currently have no way to 
identify the geographic location of AFIDA filings more 
specifically than the country level.
    The process to report and track foreign-owned agricultural 
land is complex. There is not currently a system at the 
national, State, or local level that tracks deeds or leases, 
and there is no automated reporting mechanism to aggregate 
information and contribute to the disclosure report. Any system 
for tracking land purchases and owners would be complicated, 
expensive, and create a potential risk to producer privacy, the 
price of agricultural land, and individual American seller 
interests.
    There are more than 3,000 county clerks in recorders' 
offices, or their equivalent, more than 50 State systems, and 
more than 500 sovereign tribal nations processing and tracking 
of land ownership and land transfer. This is a patchwork to 
track and report foreign-owned agricultural land is 
challenging. As Congress considers the issues around the 
ownership of agricultural land, it will be essential for them 
to consider a system that balances these issues and is 
workable--for USDA, for producers, for landowners, and for 
local government.
    In addition to the complicated patchwork system, USDA is 
under-resourced, and the staff have limited authorities that 
are less expansive in scope than those outside of USDA may 
recognize. We are doing our best. We are working to stretch our 
resources, and making improvements. We have added additional 
staff. We are working to update the FSA-153 form. We anticipate 
that the revised form will ask questions that will help us 
address the impact of foreign ownership on U.S. agriculture 
land.
    I want to recognize that in Section 773 of the Consolidated 
Appropriation Act of 2023, Congress did direct USDA to 
modernize the AFIDA reporting system within three years, via an 
online electronic filing portal linked to a queryable. USDA was 
not provided funding to implement these requirements. To move 
forward with the Section 773 language in the absence of 
funding, the Department has taken several low-cost steps. In 
early June 2023, USDA posted Excel spreadsheets for each year 
from 2011 to 2021, with the detailed data underlying the annual 
report to Congress. This is what could be done with the funding 
we receive.
    While there are challenges to the current reporting system, 
we understand the task. We agree that there are incredibly 
important issues and look forward to working with Congress to 
address them. Thank you for the invitation and the time today.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Montano Greene can be found 
on page 44 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. We really 
appreciate your being here today.
    Mr. Pittman, welcome.

     STATEMENT OF HARRISON PITTMAN, DIRECTOR, THE NATIONAL 
AGRICULTURAL LAW CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS SYSTEM DIVISION 
                OF AGRICULTURE, FAYETTEVILLE, AR

    Mr. Pittman. Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member Boozman, 
and members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
be here with you today and testify as part of this hearing on 
foreign ownership of U.S. agriculture. As you all know, this is 
an issue of great national significance, and it is one that has 
garnered significant attention throughout the country. In our 
experience, that has been with stakeholder groups all 
throughout the ag industry, and then those that are not 
traditionally involved in ag issues.
    My opening remarks will focus on the National Agricultural 
Law Center, our role with this, and kind of an overview of what 
is happening at the State and Federal level. Very quickly, 
about the National Agricultural Law Center, in 1987, Congress 
established the Center to be an objective, neutral, nonpartisan 
source of agricultural and food law research and information 
for the Nation's agricultural community. We operate in 
partnership with the USDA Agricultural Research Service, 
National Agricultural Library, and as the Ranking Member 
mentioned, we are a standalone unit of the University of 
Arkansas System Division of Agriculture.
    On a routine basis, we provide research and outreach on a 
wide range of issues to producers of all sizes and commodities 
throughout the United States, State departments of agriculture, 
State and Federal policymakers, farm organizations, attorneys, 
students, and many, many more. We do not engage in legal or 
policy advocacy of any kind.
    The center has been very involved on the issue of foreign 
ownership of agriculture, and specifically on the issue of 
foreign ownership of agricultural land, and particularly so in 
the last two to three years. As I am here today, one of my 
colleagues, Micah Brown, is actually testifying before the 
Mississippi legislature on foreign ownership, was in Nebraska 
last week, and I will be in Indiana next week, and that is just 
a snapshot in time of what we have going on in this area.
    In terms of State-level activity, in 2021 and 2022, at the 
State level we saw a very significant increase in activity, in 
the number of proposals, and it was a historical shift that was 
noteworthy. Most of those proposals focused on foreign 
ownership at large. Transferring over into 2023, that level of 
intensity and activity basically increased threefold across the 
country. In fact, there are really not very many States left 
that have not had at least one or more proposals at the State 
level, and those shifted more away from a focus on foreign 
ownership at large but more toward what we often refer to as 
the Big Four--China, North Korea, Russia, and Iran.
    Likewise, at the Federal level, there has been a very 
significant increase. There are nearly two dozen proposals 
between the House and the Senate, but most of these fall into 
three basic categories. They are amendments to A-fida or A-
feeda, depending on how you want to say that; amendments to the 
Defense Production Act of 1950; and then restrictions on 
Federal funding, particularly those dealing with Federal farm 
programs through USDA. That does not capture everything, of 
course, and in the written testimony I have an outline with 
links to all the proposals. Of course on our website, we have 
myriad resources that would be useful to you.
    Finally, I think AFIDA is such an important focus, some 
quick observations here. First, it is a simple statement, but 
it bears noting that agriculture in the United States and in 
the world around it has changed considerably, just in the last 
few years but certainly in the last three or four decades. When 
we think of AFIDA--and we have heard mentions of leases 
already--in 1978, when Congress enacted AFIDA, the concept of a 
lease was a lot more basic than it is today. Today, we are 
thinking about solar leases, wind energy, and even carbon on 
rural lands across the country. There was really no way that 
Congress or USDA could have accounted for that back at that 
time.
    Land transactions have become typically more complicated. 
They have become bigger. I do not know if you guys saw the news 
yesterday. We had the record ag land sale, 35,000-ish dollars 
per acre, in the State of Missouri. The world of ag innovation 
and ag research has changed in ways that are just beyond our 
imagination back in the late 70's.
    Finally, along that thread, I would say that our national 
economy has become far more interdependent on trading partners 
like Mexico and China and Canada, and obviously many other 
countries.
    I would also add that when it comes to AFIDA--and I see my 
yellow light, so I want to bring it in for a landing here--one 
of the things I would highlight to you, and this might be more 
for a lot of the staffers that are here?--when we say AFIDA, 
you are really saying four things. You are saying the statute, 
you are saying the regulations, the Farm Service Agency 
Handbook, and then FSA-153, and a change to one of those is 
likely to require a change to any one of the other. Missing 
that point could very well lend itself to having trouble with 
implementation later on down the line.
    There is more to say, lots to say about AFIDA. I will 
conclude on the last part here. When you look at how it is 
implemented today, in 2023--and again, if you really want to 
nerd out on it, which I encourage--the most formative time 
period to where we are today is between December 1978 and 
August 1979. That is when, you know, Congress passed AFIDA and 
provided agency authority to USDA. Most of the implementation 
has occurred through rulemaking, and that is when most of the 
activity occurred that really leads to the implementation that 
is today. Going back to that original thought about how much 
things have changed, you know, put yourself in the shoes of 
somebody in 1978 and 1979, and then having hindsight today to 
look back on that.
    Then if you think AFIDA is easy, you probably have not 
spent enough time with it. If you think it is hard, it is 
probably harder than you think. The devil is in the details, 
and I will conclude there. I am more than happy to answer 
questions today and in the future, for this and other issues 
that come up. Thank you for your time.

    [The prepared statement of Mr. Pittman can be found on page 
47 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you so much. It is 
complicated, and we appreciate you being involved and giving us 
input as we work through it.
    Dr. Ortega, welcome. We are so glad you are here.

   STATEMENT OF DAVID L. ORTEGA, Ph.D., ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, 
  AGRICULTURAL, FOOD, AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS, MICHIGAN STATE 
                  UNIVERSITY, EAST LANSING, MI

    Dr. Ortega. Thank you, Chairwoman. Chairwoman Stabenow, 
Ranking Member Boozman, and members of the Committee, thank you 
for the invitation to be here today.
    The U.S. has nearly 1.3 billion acres of privately held 
agricultural land, of which around 40 million were foreign-
owned in 2021, a 50 percent rise from 2011. Currently, 3.1 
percent of American agricultural land is foreign-owned. 
Contrary to popular belief, foreign governments do not 
typically own this land. Most is owned by Canadian interests, 
with significant holdings from entities in Europe. Holdings 
from China are under 1 percent of foreign-held agricultural 
land.
    These entities buy land for food production, energy, or as 
an investment due to its stable growth and returns. Most States 
have minimal foreign holdings, often concentrated regionally. 
In my home State of Michigan, most foreign-held agricultural 
land can be found in the Upper Peninsula. Foreign investments 
in these lands can be a source of economic growth, employment, 
and job creation in local communities.
    One concern over foreign ownership of agricultural land 
stems in part from Lansing land prices, and the potential for 
foreign demand to price farmers out of the market. However, 
there is no clear evidence that foreign ownership is causing 
U.S. farmland prices to rise.
    Under current U.S. Federal law, there is no limitation to 
foreign entities acquiring agricultural land. However, several 
States have some type of restriction on foreign ownership. Some 
proposals, as we have heard today, have suggested even broader 
restrictions. Given the potential for some of these proposals 
to have unintended consequences, careful consideration is 
needed to understand their impact on the broader U.S. agri-food 
system.
    Analysis of land values in States with varying restrictions 
and those without does not show a clear pattern. In fact, some 
results even contradict expectations that these bans would 
dampen land value increases. AFIDA mandates foreign entities to 
report transactions of foreign lands to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. Enforcement of reporting requirements have been 
inconsistent, and at times lax. This has been attributed to low 
staffing levels in the agency.
    Considering the rise in foreign holdings over the past 
decade, this is very problematic. How many foreign agricultural 
land acquisitions have gone unreported, and by whom? Failure to 
address these questions limits our ability to draw meaningful 
conclusions from any economic analysis on the impacts of these 
purchases, among other concerns.
    Chinese ownership of U.S. agricultural land has garnered 
attention due to high-profile acquisitions and rising Sino-
American tensions. Last year, the Fufeng Group's land 
acquisition near the Air Force base in North Dakota became 
controversial. A subsequent corn mill project, which promised 
significant economic benefits to the region, was canceled due 
to national security concerns.
    The Chinese government does not directly own any U.S. 
agricultural land. Chinese entities own less than one percent 
of the three percent of foreign-held agricultural land. This 
represents 0.03 percent of all U.S. agricultural land, and less 
than many other countries, including Portugal and Luxembourg. 
Over 80 percent of the Chinese-owned land belongs to Smithfield 
Foods and a billionaire investor.
    China's foreign investment strategy has shifted from the 
early 2000's, to now include the acquisition of agribusinesses 
like Smithfield Foods. Issues over consolidation for their 
business acquisitions, and concerns surrounding intellectual 
property in the agri-food sector need to be carefully monitored 
and evaluated.
    Food security concerns naturally arise when discussing 
foreign ownership of American farmland. The U.S is not only 
self-sufficient in basic food production, but we also provide 
food for many across the globe. We are the breadbasket of the 
world. Food insecurity arises in our country not because of 
production deficits, but because of issues of affordability and 
accessibility.
    I will conclude by noting that American farmland is a 
critically valuable and finite resource. While in my view the 
foreign acquisition of U.S. agricultural land by foreign 
entities does not threaten our ability to produce food, it does 
raise specific and sometimes local concerns. It is vital that 
any legislative and regulatory response be evidence-based, 
consider the broader agri-food landscape, and aim to strike a 
balance between safeguarding our national interests and 
security, and promoting economic growth and opportunity.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look 
forward to your questions.

    [The prepared statement of Dr. Ortega can be found on page 
65 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you so much. We very much 
appreciate your being here today, and we will start with 
questions. Deputy Under Secretary Montano Greene, your 
testimony highlights really the complexity--I think all of 
yours did--the complexity and challenges in monitoring land 
ownership with limited resources. The FARMLAND Act I introduced 
with Senator Ernst would expand the scope of CFIUS, to include 
reviews of farmland purchases over a certain size, 320 acres or 
$5 million, and from certain countries.
    We know it is important that we have proper oversight, but 
we also know we have, as you have indicated, limited resources 
right now. What changes might be needed to the Agriculture 
Foreign Investment Disclosure Act process to focus our 
resources on the real potential threats to U.S. food security?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Thank you, Chairwoman, for that 
question. As you laid out, this is a very complex process, and 
that was laid out by the individuals with me. First, maybe I 
will approach the conversation about CFIUS. I want to start by 
saying it is not in my purview at FPAC; it is at USDA, under 
the Office of Homeland Security. As you recognized, USDA is not 
a committee member, nor are we an ex officio member, and there 
have been conversations of the role USDA has. USDA most 
definitely, when we are called upon information, FPAC will 
provide that information moving forward.
    The complexity is the funding for some of the items--how do 
we make it from a paper-based process to a little bit more 
robust, as was shared. I think some of that funding for the, 
the investments is one within USDA, very explicitly for AFIDA. 
The staffing to make sure that we are able to do that. We are 
monitoring appropriations debates, and having a cut to the FPAC 
Business Center has impacts for how we stretch those dollars.
    I think the other part is outside of USDA, the system that 
allows us to be able to have the data base or the information, 
that we are able to have that automation. We shared that the 
multiple thousands of county recorders where deeds are recorded 
locally has an impact for us to be able to have an 
understanding. There is not that robust data system for us to 
be able to have an automated reporting system.
    So even if we move fully off of paper based, it still 
requires very manual labor to be able to address and to be able 
to dig down into those items. Within USDA, there is some 
support and work, but that system collectively, to be able to 
support investments, the understanding needs to be there.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Dr. Ortega, as 
someone who has studied China's food systems more closely over 
the years, is farmland investment something that countries like 
China are pursuing around the world? Where do you see trends in 
foreign investment in food, and agriculture supply chains more 
broadly?
    Dr. Ortega. Thanks, Chairwoman, for the question. When it 
comes to China's foreign investment strategy in agriculture, it 
is important to understand that it is really driven by their 
desire to be self-sufficient. They have 20 percent of the 
world's population, but less than 10 percent of their land is 
arable. It is a big country, but a lot of it is mountainous 
terrain, and therefore they are buying farmland across the 
world. We are seeing investments in farmland in places in sub-
Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, as well as 
Russia.
    By and large, China's foreign investments in farmland have 
bypassed North America. They are really looking at acquiring 
agribusinesses, like Smithfield. We saw ChemChina's takeover of 
Syngenta, and this is to exert more control over their import 
food supply chain. I do foresee there being additional 
investments in this regard, but when it comes to actual 
American farmland, it is not something that I would consider as 
part of their current foreign investment strategy in 
agriculture.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. We are talking about 
farmland today, but as I mentioned in my opening statement, I 
think that our agribusinesses should be as much of a concern--
and Senator Grassley, your ears must be burning, because I was 
speaking about you and our work together early on about 
Smithfield, when they first were purchased by that Chinese 
business, and of course Chinese government a part of that, and 
our ongoing efforts to get USDA part of CFIUS, because we know 
that food security is national security.
    To follow a little bit more, Dr. Ortega, though, you had 
talked about potential unintended consequences when we are 
looking at placing restrictions on U.S. agricultural land 
ownership on citizens from certain countries. What should we be 
aware of as we are looking at this?
    Dr. Ortega. Yes, thanks for the question, Chairwoman. This 
could really take many forms. You know, there could be 
retaliation from other countries. It is important to note that 
the U.S. is one of the top investors in foreign agricultural 
land across the world. From 2000 to 2016, U.S. entities were 
involved in many agricultural land deals, amounting to more 
than eight million acres worldwide, in places like South 
America, Brazil, Argentina, also in Eastern Europe, and so 
there could be some retaliation that would affect American 
interests abroad.
    There are also trade implications. For example, China is 
the largest export market for U.S. agricultural and food 
products. We export a lot of our grain, our soybeans, our corn 
to China, as well as more consumer-oriented products like beef 
and pork. In my view, it would be far easier for China to find 
new sources of these products than it would be for American 
farmers to find new export markets, so I think it is important 
to also be aware of potential trade impacts from some of these 
measures that could happen.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Boozman?
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Pittman, based 
on your legal analysis, do you find AFIDA is currently written 
sufficiently such that it captures pertinent foreign 
investments in U.S. agricultural land? You mentioned the 
problem with it being written in the 1970's; here we are now. 
Does it still work in that regard, concerning that narrow area?
    Mr. Pittman. That is actually a difficult question, believe 
it or not. I would put that into two parts. The first is more 
value judgment. You know, people in this room and people around 
the country would have a different viewpoint, potentially, on 
whether AFIDA is strong enough, whether it goes too far, 
whether it is on the mark, or somewhere in the proximity of any 
of those on the spectrum, where I think that before you get to 
that point, the part you go through--and this is how I break it 
down--AFIDA I would put as definitional and then situational, 
meaning more specifically, you know, as it was articulated a 
moment ago, you know, foreign persons, as a specific definition 
under the statute and the regulations.
    When you deal with foreign governments or foreign 
individuals, I think that is fairly easy. I mean that is easy. 
When you get to the business entity aspect, it gets more 
difficult, and I think when you get to U.S. business entities, 
that becomes more difficult on the definitional side, meaning 
when is it that a U.S. entity is required to report under 
AFIDA? That turns into what is--again, goes back to 
definitional--significant interest or substantial control, 
which is a lynchpin of the entire reporting system. It is in 
the statute, not defined in the statute but it is defined in 
the regulations. Again, I encourage people to go back to 1978 
to 1979. It has changed since then, but that is where the 
foundation is laid.
    Then within significant interest or substantial control, 
you have some bright-line tests, such as acting in concert or 
not acting in concert, and you know to my knowledge, there is 
not a definition of those.
    Going back to that part about the foreign persons in that 
U.S. entity example, it is not--what I would say is that the 
way that the rules are set up, when you kind of stretch them 
out on the table, a U.S. entity will report up to three tiers 
of ownership. Then it turns back into situational, meaning once 
that occurs, then the Secretary is given the authority, 
discretion to then go ask for more information about foreign 
persons that are below that third tier. When that information 
comes in, it goes back to situational again, where they can ask 
for some more information.
    Depending on, come full circle, on what your value judgment 
is on that, and we heard a lot about, you know, resources being 
limited, I do not have any firsthand knowledge of it, but my 
guess is that USDA is not able to routinely go back and 
exercise on that situational side of going back and, you know, 
potentially what I would just call the Garden of Eden, known 
ownership in an entity.
    That is how I would analyze it. That is how I would 
encourage people to look at it, and then, you know, inform on 
that and, you know, of course they would have their own 
viewpoint on what that would be. There are probably other 
examples, but that is what came out when I was thinking it 
through here.
    Senator Boozman. Madam Under Secretary, in regard to that, 
do you think USDA has the current authorities--now it sounds 
like you do not have the infrastructure to do the disclosure 
process and all that. Then, you know, you talked about that all 
of this is being done by hand and, you know, the difficulties 
there as we try and move forward. Discounting that, do you feel 
like you have the authority to move, if Congress wanted you to 
move in the direction of greater disclosure?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Thank you for that, Senator. For your 
question, to be able to look at the levels of detail, some of 
the items that were mentioned by Mr. Pittman are not within the 
authority. We are currently reviewing the FSA form to be able 
to see if we can add items, not as a requirement but as 
optional to report, to be able to better engage. There are some 
expectations that we have received in various congressional 
inquiries and technical assistance where we have provided 
feedback on what additional authorities we might need if we 
wanted to be able to have some requirements and some reporting 
there. I think as Congress decides what level of additional 
information we want in that disclosure form, or additional 
engagement that USDA needs to move forward, we might need to 
consider that.
    Senator Boozman. Very quickly, can you talk a little bit 
very quickly about what you do to verify the accuracy and 
completeness of information that you receive regarding this, 
foreign disclosure?
    Ms. Montano Greene. When the team receives a form, they 
review it. They go back and ask various levels of detail. 
Sometimes they go and have conversations and engagement with 
the counties where that is being recorded, where the local FSA 
office is able to provide resources. Some of that information 
is based on local knowledge, not necessarily local FSA 
knowledge but local county reporters, on the level of 
information and filings that they also have to be able to 
reflect that.
    Some of that conversation is having engagements with their 
respective lawyers to be able to ask questions whenever the 
form has not been completed, or if the form seems to have some 
gaps of information. The team is doing what they can with the 
resources we have, and is looking into the various layers in 
the third tier of ownership to be able to have those items and 
moving together as current information as they can.
    Senator Boozman. Okay. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Booker?
    Senator Booker. Chairwoman and Ranking Member, thank you 
both for another really important hearing. I cannot tell you 
how grateful I am to have this opportunity to question three 
extraordinary witnesses, despite their haircuts.
    Look, who controls our farmland is really important, and 
honestly my concern is also with who controls many other parts 
of our food system, including our seeds, meat processing, and 
grocery stores. This is all part of our national security. 
Indeed, as one of our witnesses already said, food security is 
national security.
    In the last several decades, our entire economy, but 
especially the agricultural sector, has concentrated power and 
profits into the hands of a small group of corporations, and 
several of those big corporations are indeed foreign-owned, as 
has been mentioned by our witnesses. I support legislation that 
would prevent foreign corporations, such as Smithfield, from 
continuing to purchase U.S. farmland.
    I have visited Duplin County, North Carolina, and seen 
firsthand what a bad corporate citizen Smithfield is, with 
their large factory farms poisoning the air and water, and 
ruining the quality of life for local rural communities, all so 
that Smithfield can ship cheap pork back to China. However, an 
equally concerning issue to me, and an issue that I hope this 
Committee will focus on and perhaps hold a hearing on, is the 
rate at which domestic corporations, such as pension funds and 
hedge funds, are buying up U.S. farmland as an investment 
strategy.
    According to a recent report, institutional investors spent 
over $12 billion to acquire U.S. farmland in 2021 alone, and 
these corporate investors now own approximately 35 million 
acres of U.S. farmland. I believe that our national food 
security depends on the farmers who are working the land having 
an opportunity to own the land, and I do not believe that our 
Federal farm safety net programs, like crop insurance, should 
be used as a risk management strategy by Wall Street investment 
funds.
    That is why I recently introduced the Farmland for Farmers 
Act, which would prohibit these investment corporations from 
acquiring any additional U.S. farmland. The bill would also 
make the hedge funds and pension funds who currently own 
farmland ineligible for USDA safety net programs moving 
forward. Chairwoman, I request consent to enter into the record 
this letter of support for this bill, which is led by the 
National Family Farm Coalition, and signed by over 70 farm 
groups.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. So ordered without objection.

    [The letters can be found on page 78 in the Appendix.]

    Senator Booker. I would like to direct my question to Mr. 
Pittman. Can you talk about how the issues of foreign 
investment in U.S. farmland, and the purchase of our farmland 
by corporate investors such as Wall Street pension funds and 
hedge funds, are really intertwined issues, and the 
interconnected way in which some States actually have dealt 
with those two issues?
    Mr. Pittman. Going in reverse chronological order, the way 
the States have handled that would be on the one hand, 
corporate farming laws. They are sometimes referred to as anti-
corporate farming laws. They have been historically predominant 
in the Midwestern States but in other places, too, and they 
have a history that traces back to pre-what we know as the 
Great Depression era, but for agriculture the Depression 
oftentimes we think started in the 1920's instead of the 
1930's. That is one aspect. The other is on these foreign 
ownership laws, which we have detailed enough; I do not think I 
need to go back through any of those.
    Historically, in the public record--you know, I mentioned 
in my opening remarks how the ag industry has changed a lot, so 
obviously the transactions, the nature or the scope has evolved 
considerably. On the corporate farming law side, you know a lot 
of these laws, they go back, as I mentioned, out of North 
Dakota, 1920's on forward, and they were challenged under the 
different theories of the Constitution, or the 
constitutionality was challenged a handful of times. Made their 
way to the U.S. Supreme Court and the constitutionality was 
always upheld, and then more recently, in the last two decades, 
we have had some decisions under the Dormant Commerce Clause 
that called that into question. Along the way, the proponents 
of those laws, to get them enacted and then as they were argued 
in the court system, it was investors, and institutional 
investors, and from a proponent's viewpoint.
    When you look at the public record on foreign ownership, 
both in what has been enacted at the State levels over the 
decades, but even if you go into the legislative history and 
the regulatory history of AFIDA, there you see similar 
concerns, a thread there from those. In fact, you know 
initially when AFIDA was enacted, that was what USDA was 
directed to report back on, impact on family farms and 
availability of land.
    Then in my own firsthand experience, I do hear those 
concerns raised. Of course, that is not to say I do not hear 
competing viewpoints, but about that there is this broader 
question of ownership, whether it be institutional and/or 
foreign, that it basically, you know, as we all know and 
someone said earlier, we are not making any more land, that it 
becomes more difficult to compete to purchase land.
    Then the final thing, which I would reflect on this a 
little bit more, but you know by my notion, there is ten States 
that have their corporate farming law and their foreign 
ownership law in the same statute. At some level, they have 
been welded together over the years in that way.
    Senator Booker. Yes, thank you, sir, for that answer. I 
will maybe ask you to think about it in a question for the 
record, as well as otherwise. I do appreciate the whole panel 
here. It has been extraordinary, as well as my colleagues 
beforehand. I am hoping we can look more about corporate 
ownership. I have had some conversations with great colleagues 
across the aisle about it as well. Then finally, I just want to 
note for the record also that Mr. Pittman has an accent that is 
almost as awesome as a Jersey accent. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you, Senator Booker, and 
thank you for raising really important issues. We need to 
broaden the scope as we are looking at all of this. This is 
very important.
    Senator Grassley, we are going to turn to you next, and 
Senator Marshall technically was next but is deferring to you. 
I will say again, we have invoked your name and leadership 
multiple times today. It has been a pleasure to work with you 
on this issue ever since we raised great concerns about the 
original Smithfield purchase, and thank you for working with so 
many of us on both sides of the aisle on this issue. Senator 
Grassley?
    Senator Grassley. Well thank you, Chairman and Ranking 
Member for this very important hearing. I do not know whether 
the figure of 100 million acres of farmland is going to be sold 
over the next 10 years, so this is a very timely hearing for 
you to have that. You said you mentioned my name many times. I 
do not know whether you knew that I had an interest in this way 
back when I was a member of the House of Representatives and 
authored a piece of legislation, now law, in 1978 called the 
Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act. At that 
particular time, we did not have any national records of 
foreign ownership of land, and this required that the USDA keep 
track of this.
    Just last December, Senator Baldwin and I made improvements 
in that act with the Farmland Security Act, which was included 
in the Omnibus Appropriation Bill. The bill requires a report 
to Congress on these investments, and to publish a prior-year 
disclosure on an interactive and public USA data system. That 
brings me to Mrs. Greene, if you have taken steps to implement 
the changes included in the Farmland Security Act, and what 
have those steps been?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Thank you, Senator, and thank you for 
your leadership on this issue. Section 773 of the Consolidated 
Appropriation Act did designate that USDA needed to modernize 
the AFIDA reporting system within three years and make it an 
online system, accessible and queryable. We did not receive any 
funding to be able to implement that, so we looked at creating 
a cost-efficient one to move forward. This summer, around June, 
we uploaded an Excel file for 2011 to 2021, so those could be 
searchable and queryable, on our website.
    Senator Grassley. Okay, thank you for that answer, and I 
hope that Congress realizes that we were reluctant, or did not 
put money into it, but maybe getting it authorized is a 
necessary first step.
    Most recently, Senator Baldwin and I have introduced a bill 
to bring additional transparency and oversight to the foreign 
investment in farmland. The Farmland Security Act of 2023 
imposes a new financial penalty on foreign owners or shell 
companies who fail to report, or misreport their acreage. Ms. 
Greene, how does the USDA currently track shell companies, and 
do you have any data on how many foreign shell companies may 
own farmland?
    Ms. Montano Greene. The report information that we receive 
is based on the self-disclosure, and so the level of reporting 
that we provide annually is the information and the data that 
we do have available.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. Do you think that the Department of 
Agriculture should have a permanent seat on the Committee on 
Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS as we call it?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Thank you for that question, sir. I 
want to be able to state that it is not within my purview at 
FPAC regarding the decision for the Department to serve on 
CFIUS. That would be in the purview of the Office of Homeland 
Security. What I can say is to be able to repeat things that my 
boss has definitely shared, and most recently was at Monday's 
White House press briefing, that the Secretary was asked a very 
similar question on Monday, and he stated that he does support 
USDA having a more robust role on CFIUS.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. Then Mr. Pittman, a lot of credit 
goes to my State of Iowa for having some of the best laws on 
the books when it comes to foreign land ownership. Because of 
these restrictions, Iowa does not have the issues that other 
States have had. In your research, have you encountered any 
State laws that could serve as an example for Federal 
legislation that could be enacted?
    Mr. Pittman. The short answer is no, because it is not just 
a patchwork of legislation; it is a historical patchwork of 
legislation, and so it is difficult to find one that would be a 
model. There are unique differences in Iowa to Missouri, to 
Pennsylvania, to South Carolina, and on and on. Some of these 
laws were put into place--I think of Pennsylvania in 
particular--1791 and 1818. They have been unamended ever since. 
It would be hard to use that as a model law. We do not really 
have a lot of uniformity yet that would allow for something 
like that. It would be hard to do.
    In that historical perspective, the reason so many of these 
laws are in the Midwest is that at one point, that was the 
Western boundaries of the United States, and so it just has a 
historical underpinning to it. They were enacted at a very 
different time. Many have been amended in some way; some have 
not been amended very much. It would be hard to do.
    Senator Grassley. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Madam 
Chairman.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Bennet?
    Senator Bennet. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you and the 
Ranking Member for holding this important discussion today. I 
really appreciate it. Colorado agriculture contributes $47 
billion to the State's economy, with nearly 39,000 farms and 
ranches spread over 32 million acres. My State ranks third in 
the Nation in foreign-owned farm and ranchland, behind only 
Texas and Maine, which raises economic and national security 
challenges for us.
    This upward trend is incredibly concerning, not just for 
the sake of our vital land resources but also for our precious 
water resources, which as you know in the West are tied to the 
land. Water has the same legal property rights as land; 
sometimes it is often more important than land. As we grapple 
with how to handle land resources, we should do the same for 
water.
    On the economic front, when foreign buyers purchase land 
and the corresponding water rights, it drives their prices up, 
and Colorado family farmers and ranchers, you know, cannot 
afford it. Outside of the Agricultural Foreign Investment 
Disclosure Act, USDA has minimal authority when it comes to 
foreign investments, including monitoring or weighing in on any 
of these transactions to determine their effect on national 
security. Ms. Montano Greene, while respecting private-market 
transactions, what role do you believe the agency could play to 
mitigate economic and national security concerns related to 
heightened foreign investments in our land and water resources?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Thank you, Senator. As a Westerner, I 
definitely appreciate the impact of water as a natural 
resource, and so thank you for being a champion on those items 
and issues. USDA understands that this is important for 
national security, and that land resources and all resources 
are very important. Our authority does not allow us to stop the 
selling of foreign land. We do not have authority to have a 
decision in foreign or domestic land purchases and leases. We 
are doing our job to be able to have the Foreign Land 
Disclosure Act.
    Questions have been asked about our role within CFIUS, and 
my understanding, although it is not in my purview, is that 
infrastructure that we have been talking about, that 
complication of having that way to better understand who is 
purchasing and who is moving, is sometimes outside of the USDA 
role. We will continue to do our work to implement the Foreign 
Land Disclosure work, and to be able to continue to work with 
Congress on working on solutions.
    Senator Bennet. Well, I really appreciate the clarity of 
your answer, Ms. Montano Greene, and you are right, both about 
the lack of jurisdiction and then also CFIUS, so you have 
anticipated my next question.
    So earlier this year--and this is for the whole panel--
earlier this year, Senator Lankford, my colleague on the Intel 
Committee and I introduced the Security and Oversight of 
International Land Holdings Act, or the SOIL Act, as a means to 
address foreign investment oversight. Our bill would not limit 
private agricultural land real estate transactions, a topic I 
understand worries some producers.
    The bill would require CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign 
Investment in the United States, an important national security 
committee, to review agricultural land acquisition deals from 
countries with non-market economies, including China, Russia, 
Iran, North Korea, that pose a national security threat risk to 
the United States. It would also require the Committee to 
consult the Secretary of Agriculture on such deals.
    Would each of the witnesses today share how they believe 
Congress should reform the Committee's authorities to help 
address the increase in foreign-owned U.S. farmland? Why do we 
not start here in the middle and go around? Thank you.
    Mr. Pittman. Thank you for that. In terms of an opinion 
about what Congress should do, I am going to bail out on that 
one. You know, from the National Ag Law Center perspective, we 
do not engage in advocacy or policy, advocacy legal-or policy-
wise. What I could add to that, I think, you know there is 
obviously a number of proposals to add the Secretary of 
Agricultural to CFIUS. You know, I think everybody here knows 
that in the House, it passed 42 to nothing a few days ago on 
that very measure. Under the Defense Production Act of 1950, in 
addition to the efforts legislatively, there is in the statute 
authority for the President to place other people on CFIUS. It 
is the last paragraph; I think it is Paragraph J of that 
section. As far as an opinion on what Congress should do with 
it, I do not have an opinion on that.
    Dr. Ortega. Senator, thanks for the question. I will just 
add, you know, I think it is important that future land deals 
and acquisitions receive proper scrutiny. I cannot really speak 
to what policy should be implemented to do that necessarily, 
but I would just reiterate what I mentioned during my 
testimony, that whatever action and regulatory response be 
evidence-based, and sort of look to strike a balance between 
our national security and also fostering economic growth and 
opportunity.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much, and thank you for 
your leadership. Senator Lankford was here earlier and 
acknowledged that the two of you were working on this. It is 
very important.
    All right, we are now going to turn to Senator Marshall. 
Good morning.
    Senator Marshall. All right, Madam Chair, good to see you 
and Ranking Member, good morning, and welcome to our witnesses.
    BGI is a China-based biotech company tied at the hips to 
the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese military, that has been 
leading China's efforts to create the world's largest genomic 
repository.
    Our USDA has provided grant dollars over the past decade to 
BGI for genomic gathering and data storage. Of great immediate 
concern, though, is its relationships with USDA and the 
American scientific community. BGI has access to genetic 
information of American citizens. BGI is listed as a concern by 
the NCSC, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Department of 
Commerce.
    I want to stop and emphasize the greater national security 
threat we face in agriculture and our Nation's ability to feed 
itself lies in this backdrop of China's goal to steal our 
intellectual property, and then create and manipulate the 
world's largest genomic repository. Here is my concern. To 
borrow from the Wall Street Journal article, World War III will 
be fought with biological and computer viruses simultaneously.
    Next I want to talk about the Earth BioGenome Project, EBP, 
which is an international cooperative initiative to sequence 
the DNA of more than 1.5 million species. BGI provides data 
collection and data storage for EBP. Please realize this 
again--the USDA continues to maintain a relationship with the 
Earth BioGenome Project today.
    Now here is the important point. Here is the theme. In 
China's relationship with our Nation and others, their goal is 
to obtain access to intellectual property, while we pay for the 
research and development. The intellectual property is what is 
so very important in this relationship. Again, we pay for it, 
we do the research, they get the intellectual property. By 
maintaining relationships with the CCP-related entities, 
directly or indirectly, we place American citizens and our food 
supply at risk. There is no guardrail. There is no contract, no 
ethics of scientific research, nothing the CCP respects, as we 
witnessed by their takedown of valuable DNA sequencing data 
during the Chinese-created COVID pandemic.
    Again, my national security issue is this. While I 
acknowledge all the good that can be done from genomic 
collection, it does not take much imagination to realize the 
potential catastrophic biotech attacks rogue nations or 
terrorists could wage on Americans.
    My first question for Madam Under Secretary is this, and I 
know this is not your exact purview with USDA, but do you agree 
that EBP and BGI pose a national security threat to our Nation, 
and should we continue to have this relationship with either of 
those entities?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Senator, USDA is definitely concerned 
about agriculture and its role as it is connected to national 
security. We feed this country, and so we know agriculture is 
very key to that. With regard to this question, this is fully 
outside of my purview. FPAC gets to be the program-facing 
entity of it. If it would be okay with you, I would like to 
take that back to my colleagues over in the research/education 
division to be able to help me better respond to that.
    Senator Marshall. Great, I appreciate that. We did send a 
letter previously, and we will be awaiting the answers here.
    The plot thickens, though. We described an ever-widening 
web here. The Earth BioGenome Project and BGI are also part of 
something even bigger called the Global Virome Project, GVP, 
which was also formed and created with American dollars. More 
accurately described, the Global Virome Project became part of 
the EBP, so GVP is able to expand its global reach even more 
while it has been able to hide behind this larger umbrella of 
the EBP, which has made tracking of the Global Virome Project's 
activities even more difficult. A tangled web, indeed.
    Today, GVP supports The Trinity Challenge. What is The 
Trinity Challenge, you might ask. The Trinity Challenge has a 
goal to collect the DNA of every human, animal, and plant 
across the world. We as a nation are once again financing the 
research and giving the Chinese Communist Party access to a 
goldmine of intellectual property that can and will be used 
against us.
    Again for Madam Secretary, two questions. Is it ever safe 
to do research with China? Next, what are the potential bio-
weapons that could result from this research that could impact 
American food security?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Senator, thank you for that concern. 
USDA is very much concerned with national security issues and 
how agriculture is part of that. I would like to take that 
question back to my colleagues to better provide you an answer 
and to give you commentary on it.
    Senator Marshall. Okay. If I could, Dr. Ortega, you have 
been involved with China on and off. Do you feel it is ever 
safe to do research with China?
    Dr. Ortega. Senator, thanks for your question. You know, 
this is a very complex issue, and I will say we have very 
talented Chinese-Americans and Chinese scientists working at 
land-grant institutions here in the United States. I think it 
is in our national interest to collaborate with China on 
research, but we have to make sure that it is done in a very 
fair way, and that is all that I am able to comment.
    Senator Marshall. I would love to see how you vet these 
people, but that is probably a question for another day. Thank 
you so much for your answers, and thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Welch, 
welcome.
    Senator Welch. It is good to be here. Thank you, Madam 
Chair. You know, I share the concern about foreign ownership, 
Chinese ownership in particular. A lot of that has been covered 
by my colleagues. I also share the concern about the incredible 
challenges for young aspiring farmers to get access to land, 
and a lot of that has to do with the high price, and of course 
corporate consolidation.
    As I understand it, between 2011 and 2021, foreign 
ownership increased from 2 percent to 3.1 percent. Most of that 
foreign ownership is non-Chinese. Chinese ownership is less 
than one percent of all foreign-held acres, and I think a lot 
of that is around installations that do need security. There is 
obviously a link between their ownership and trying to be close 
to military installations.
    But 81 percent of America's farmed cropland is controlled 
by 15 percent of farms, so this is an incredible amount of 
consolidation. Small family farms, those that earn less than 
$350,000 in gross cash income, accounted for 89 percent of all 
farms. We have a lot of those small farms in Vermont. Large-
scale farms, one million or more, accounted for about three 
percent of farms, but 47 percent of the value.
    I am going to ask Dr. Ortega, in your testimony you 
mentioned that the foreign acquisition of U.S. agricultural 
land by foreign entities does not threaten our ability to 
produce food, with the caveat that it does raise specific and 
sometimes local concerns. However, the consolidation of 
farmland by large corporate entities also poses significant 
challenges for our farmers. Can you speak on the extent of 
corporate consolidation in the agricultural sector, and what 
challenges that consolidation poses for our economy and our 
farmers?
    Dr. Ortega. Yes, thank you, Senator, for that question, and 
thanks for highlighting this very important issue. It has also 
been brought up earlier with Senator Booker's comments.
    Senator Welch. Right. That is right.
    Dr. Ortega. The issue of corporate ownership of farmland 
and farm consolidation is very, very important, especially as 
it affects new and young beginner farmers as we look at an 
aging farmer population. One constraint to being able to answer 
your question fully is data availability. We do not have high-
frequency data on this issue. There is a survey that was 
recently done by the National Young Farmers Coalition last 
year, done over many thousand farmers under the age of 40, and 
a lot of these farmers noted that access to farmland was 
critically important, but it was also challenging given the 
rising land prices. It is an issue that I think needs to be 
better informed by having more access to data on farm ownership 
consolidation, given how fast these trends are changing in the 
industry.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much, and I will perhaps ask 
Under Secretary Montano Greene, any suggestions of what we can 
do about this? I mean the big operators have the cash and they 
can outbid the small farmers, and we need those small farmers, 
so I wonder what concrete suggestions that you might suggest to 
us.
    Ms. Montano Greene. Senator, if I could take that in two 
approaches with what USDA is doing, and how we could maybe 
continue to collaborate with the Senators and Congress. First, 
for land access, capital, and market, thank you for the 
Inflation Reduction Act. We had $300 million to be able to 
implement a program to be able to study this and to be able to 
think about providing grant programs. We just announced those 
projects earlier this summer. Looking forward to seeing the 
results and the returns so we can better be informed on how we 
can provide better tools for young beginning farmers, and for 
communities that are smaller, low-income farmers looking to be 
able to have access to those. Just thank you for that; the 
Inflation Reduction Act was able to provide that.
    With regard to consolidation and monopolies, while it is 
not explicitly in my purview at FPAC, the Department has been 
doing quite a bit of work on that to move forward with the 
American Rescue Plan, the Food System Transformation, to be 
able to think about local and regional foods in those aspects. 
FPAC has participated with our colleagues over in the Marketing 
Regional Program.
    The other is, this summer USDA launched a partnership with 
State attorneys general to go after corporate bad actors who 
are against antitrust laws. We have been working to be able to 
address the Packers and Stockyards Act, and then just be able 
to robustly think about how we are addressing those smaller 
farmer needs as we move forward.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. I yield back.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Ernst?
    Senator Ernst. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to our 
witnesses for being here today as well. Chairwoman Stabenow, I 
appreciate you calling this hearing today on this important 
issue. I think so many of us are really concerned about this 
issue, and we have worked very closely together on it to 
modernize the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act.
    As our Iowa farmers know well, food security is national 
security. In that same vein, I would be remiss not to express 
my frustration that we do not have at this time meaningful 
progress on the farm bill. On Monday morning, I drove up to the 
airport, and my route goes through southwest Iowa. That entire 
way to the airport, we have farmers that are fully engaged in 
harvest right now, and it is such a great sight for me. I get 
very nostalgic. Some of the best memories I have from childhood 
are riding in the tractors and the combines with my grandpa, my 
dad and my uncle. Yet these Iowa farmers, while they are out 
there, they are working hard, they are bringing in the harvest 
right now, they are feeding their livestock, and yet Congress 
and this Committee, we are set to let the 2018 Farm Bill expire 
in three days, and I really think this is a shame.
    I consistently hear from our farmers and ag leaders about 
the need for more farm in the farm bill, and there are serious 
concerns with the increasing foreign investment in American 
farmland today. China, our No. 1 pacing threat, continues to 
grow their influence on the world stage under the weak 
leadership of the Biden administration.
    In 2021, we had a China-based company purchase 300 acres of 
valuable farmland only 20 minutes from the Grand Forks Air 
Force Base in North Dakota. Mind you, this base is home to some 
of the Nation's most sensitive military drone technology. As if 
that was not enough, earlier this year the world watched as a 
Chinese spy balloon crossed over our sovereign border, 
gathering intelligence for the Chinese Communist Party over 
much of the Midwest and our Nation's prized land. President 
Biden had the audacity to call this silly.
    Folks, this is concerning on many levels, and a grave 
threat to our national security. According to USDA's 2021 AFIDA 
report, foreign persons hold an interest in approximately 40 
million acres of U.S. ag land. That is more than the entire 
State of Iowa--more than Iowa. Foreign ownership and investment 
in our ag land has nearly doubled over the latest decade. It is 
time we get tough on China and our adversaries by drawing a 
line in the sand when it comes to our ag industry and the food 
security of our very own nation.
    Thankfully, in Iowa we have provisions to protect our 
farmland, but we need to see strong protections across our 
Nation. It is time we overhaul the system. We must modernize 
the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act, which 
became law in 1978, and that is why I am proud to have 
bipartisan action with Chairwoman Stabenow on our legislation, 
the Foreign Agricultural Restrictions to Maintain Local 
Agricultural and National Defense, or FARMLAND Act, to increase 
reporting, strengthen oversight, and send a strong, clear 
message to our adversaries that American farms are not their 
playground.
    Deputy Under Secretary Greene, do you know and can you 
report to this Committee how many foreign persons are 
participating in taxpayer-funded Farm Service Agency programs?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Senator, thank you for your concern. I 
want to acknowledge that USDA also believes that agriculture is 
an important part of national security and the work that we 
have been doing. The AFIDA requires us to disclose foreign 
land. USDA does not have the authority to stop the sale to a 
foreign land. We do not have the authority to have any decision 
in the process of foreign or domestic lands, domestic entities 
purchasing land.
    With regard to the question of individuals within the 
program, we will have to get back to you for that. We implement 
the program based on statute, and each program has its own 
respective statute governing the eligibility for the respective 
programs.
    Senator Ernst. Okay. It is concerning, and I think part of 
the problem in tracking this as well, foreign people 
participating in these programs, is that USDA has a very 
outdated process and so we do not know this information, and 
that we have a voluntary filing system, and it is still paper-
based. I think we have a lot of work to do within USDA to make 
sure that we are tracking this information, because if our 
taxpayer dollars are going to foreign individuals, we need to 
know that. Again, I think the FARMLAND Act would address a lot 
of those concerns and make it much easier for us to track.
    I see my time has expired, Madam Chair. Thank you very much 
for allowing me the time. I yield back.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much. Let me just say for 
the members, that as we are diligently working on the farm 
bill--I have been involved in six of them--none of them, 
unfortunately, have ever hit the exact deadline. In 1918, we 
went through until December, and I am hoping with all of the 
Committee leaning in and working together that we will be able 
to meet that timeline again, because it is so important that we 
do this for everyone who is impacted by all the issues in the 
farm bill. Thank you so much for raising that, and we will 
continue to work with you and all the members of the Committee 
to make sure that happens.
    Let me turn to Senator Fetterman. Welcome.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Let me say, 
I hope many of our colleagues agree, the Chinese government and 
other U.S. adversaries should own zero, zero agricultural land 
in our country. I believe that. I mean they are taking back our 
pandas, you know; we should take back all of their farmland. 
You know, this is really a national security issue, and it is a 
food security issue.
    Pennsylvania is a leader on this issue, and a law requiring 
foreign disclosure on agricultural land, and I hear it is a 
good one. Mr. Pittman, you shared some State laws, but can you 
elaborate on how State laws and the few Federal laws may work 
together?
    Mr. Pittman. Sure. Probably the best way to answer that is 
to take a snapshot in time back at the end of 1970's, with the 
enactment of AFIDA in 1978. At that time, the position that was 
struck was that matters of prohibition, or even banning, 
although there is no State that has an absolute ban on foreign 
ownership, that that would be a matter left to the States and 
that the Federal Government would operate in the space of 
requiring reporting. From that backdrop, that is basically the 
paradigm in which this has moved forward since that time. So 
there are things that the Federal Government can do, things 
like CFIUS, that the States simply cannot, but that is 
basically the paradigm there.
    Anything to dig deeper in that, you would look at each 
specific State law and how it compares, and States like 
Pennsylvania are very unique; you did mention that, unique with 
the reporting requirement. It also has a requirement that the 
Department of Agriculture has a role in monitoring the AFIDA 
data. A lot of its provisions go back to the Revolutionary War 
period and up into the early 1800's, so you have got to take 
those things into account as well.
    Senator Fetterman. Can you speculate on why exactly would 
the Chinese want to own vast amounts of our farmland?
    Mr. Pittman. I am not the most qualified for that, but I 
think, as Dr. Ortega laid out, a lot of the ownership that 
currently is evidenced in the AFIDA data traces back to the 
Smithfield transaction that occurred roughly a decade ago, and 
I will leave it at that. I do not think I am qualified beyond 
that.
    Senator Fetterman. Yes. Yes. Secretary Montano Greene, like 
my colleagues, I am concerned with foreign countries' and 
foreign corporations' ownership in our agricultural supply 
chain, in small farmers in PA. There is over 56,000 of them 
here in Pennsylvania face enough hardships, and they do not 
need to compete with foreign governments buying our land. 
Secretary, how could Congress give USDA more resources, 
including and updating the Agricultural Foreign Investment 
Disclosure Act, to counter adversaries buying our farmland?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Thank you, Senator, for the question. 
We agree with you. USDA believes that agriculture is an 
important part of national security. Two approaches to that 
question. The first is, thinking about your small producers and 
your family farms in Pennsylvania, and the work we are doing to 
be able to invest and have better investments there. While not 
specifically within FPAC, USDA has been investing in the Food 
System Transformation, which has a lot of local and regional 
investments. We have been working to address consolidation 
efforts and have a collaboration with attorneys general 
throughout the country to be able to address that.
    With regard to AFIDA, AFIDA itself is a disclosure act, and 
that is the authority that we have. USDA does not have the 
authority to approve or decline purchases of land, domestic or 
foreign, so that is just one thing to be very clear of what 
USDA has within authorities.
    Within the support of the investments, we appreciate 
Congress' work in which they have given us some language within 
the Omnibus Appropriations Bill last year to be able to 
modernize and look forward to some support on that financially 
as well.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Hyde-
Smith?
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Chairwoman Stabenow and the 
Ranking Member Boozman, for this important hearing, and thank 
you to our witnesses. Senator Boozman, thank you for bringing 
Harrison along. We have worked together for many years, and it 
is certainly good to see you at the end of the table, Harrison.
    It truly is important for us to examine foreign investments 
in U.S. agriculture, American food security is obviously the 
national security issue that we all know that it is. We need to 
make sure that our foreign adversaries do not have the 
influence over those agricultural systems, and that is really 
important in Mississippi, where agriculture is our No. 1 
industry.
    I am pleased that the State of Mississippi has convened a 
Study Committee on Foreign Purchases of Farmland there. We are 
simply missing some information when it comes to this topic. I 
am glad my home State is investigating this issue, and I am 
glad that we are examining it today here at a Federal level, 
too.
    Madam Under Secretary Montano, as you know, several 
legislative proposals this Congress seek to include the 
Secretary of Agriculture as part of the Committee on Foreign 
Investments in the United States. Should this proposal become 
law, how do you envision USDA's participation on this 
Committee?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Thank you, Senator. I just want to 
acknowledge that the role of CFIUS would not actually land 
within my mission area; it would land within the Office of 
Homeland Security within USDA. Having said that, I will just 
repeat something that the Secretary had said earlier this week 
when he was asked this at the White House during a press 
briefing, in that he does acknowledge that it would be an 
important role for USDA to have a more robust role on CFIUS.
    With that implementation of it, it is not just the role of 
CFIUS but it is also understanding the system to be able to 
report and to be able to gather the information. Not the AFIDA 
disclosure system, but understanding where deeds are 
registered, about leases, and how we are able to collaborate 
that information and that information feeds in to better 
understand it. Some of the USDA role, and then some of the 
systems roles within counties and States, and I do want to 
recognize your State of Mississippi for the work that they are 
taking on to better study this.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. While I understand the Secretary is not 
a current member of the Committee of Foreign Investments, and 
you are saying it has fallen under someone else, the Committee 
does flag certain cases to be reviewed by USDA, which falls 
under the responsibility of the USDA's Office of Homeland 
Security, obviously. However, the caseload is high while annual 
budgetary resources are rather limited, less than 1.4 million 
for the USDA Office of Homeland Security in the Fiscal Year of 
2023 that we are in. What type of budgetary resources would 
USDA's Office of Homeland Security need to appropriately 
analyze all the cases in a timely manner?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Senator, thank you for the appreciation 
and the support for the staff that implement a lot of these 
programs, and any of the resources that we need to move 
forward. The Office of Homeland Security is not under my 
purview, but if I can just make a general statement about 
impact of budget. We are all concerned about the appropriations 
and the cuts we have to have, and what that means for 
stretching further resources. If it is okay with you, I would 
like to take that back for the Office of Homeland Security, 
too, to better provide a response on what the need would be for 
Fiscal Year 2024.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay, I have a little time left. Dr. 
Ortega, in your testimony, you mentioned China's investment in 
agribusinesses in other countries, and could you talk to us 
about China's investments in agricultural research and 
development, and how the United States' investment compares to 
that?
    Dr. Ortega. Senator, thank you for your question. This is, 
what I would consider China's investments in agriculture 
research and technology, one of the biggest threats to our food 
security. China, since 2011, became the largest funder of 
agricultural research and development, far surpassing the U.S. 
and the European Union. They are currently spending five times 
more on research and development today than they were----
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Wow.
    Dr. Ortega [continuing]. two decades ago. In comparison, 
here in the U.S., our spending and investment has fallen, and 
has fallen by about a third over the last two decades, and it 
is close to about half of what China is spending. Their 
trajectory is upward; we are falling behind. As you point this 
out, you know, it is what I would consider to be one of the 
most serious threats to our food security is their level of 
investment.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you for your answer, and my time 
is out. Harrison, you are off the hook.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much. Senator Fischer?
    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Madam Chairman and Ranking 
Member Boozman for holding a hearing on this important topic, 
and thank you to our witnesses for being here today. In 
addition to serving on the Agriculture Committee, I also serve 
as a senior member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and 
I am the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Strategic 
Forces, which is responsible for our nuclear deterrent, space 
systems, and our missile defense.
    It is no secret that many critical weapons systems are 
located in rural America near agricultural land. For example, 
in western Nebraska, that is home to the Minuteman III ICBMs, 
and it will soon be replaced by the Sentinel ICBMs. These 
weapons systems and the airmen operating them keep Americans 
safe every day. We cannot let military installations hosting 
sensitive missions, like these in Nebraska, become vulnerable 
by allowing adversaries to purchase land nearby, which they can 
then conduct espionage or other nefarious activities. The 
Chinese Communist Party will actively seek and exploit any 
opportunity they see to do so, and so I believe we have to have 
a process in place to prevent them from doing that.
    Ms. Greene, while foreign investments in ag land should be 
reported, we also need to ensure that the information is 
communicated to all relevant stakeholders. Does the USDA 
currently have any process in place for reporting to DoD if 
there is foreign investment in proximity to national security 
assets?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Thank you, Senator, for your service on 
both committees. We agree with you at USDA that agriculture is 
part of national security and very important to that role, and 
we do not have the authority to be able to approve or to 
decline purchases by foreign or domestic lands.
    With regards to--I am sorry.
    Senator Fischer. Oh, to reporting to DoD.
    Ms. Montano Greene. Yes, with regards to the reporting, 
yes----
    Senator Fischer. Do you currently have the tools needed to 
do that, or----
    Ms. Montano Greene.--so with regards to----
    Senator Fischer [continuing]. does this Committee need to 
look at something?
    Ms. Montano Greene. With regard to reporting, I know there 
has been a lot of conversation about the role within CFIUS. It 
is not within the purview of FPAC. It has been raised to the 
Secretary; the Secretary has shared his intention that it would 
be a good idea for us to serve there.
    With regards to report, even though we are not members of 
CFIUS, we serve in an ad hoc role, so when they call upon 
information to share and we are able to share that information, 
we do provide that with them. Throughout the year, they look at 
our reports that we provide annually, and so we do know that 
that report is available publicly and individuals have been 
leveraging it, and if there are needs, they will seek 
additional information.
    Senator Fischer. Also, you had mentioned that USDA is 
updating the FSA-153 form currently being used for AFIDA data 
base. Can you expand on what questions will be added to the 
form? For example, currently is there any way to know how much 
foreign-owned land U.S. farmers can be renting?
    Ms. Montano Greene. The questions that are going to be 
updated in the 153 form, we have been gathering a group to be 
able to better understand the statute, where information can be 
added that we are not seeking, has been shared by my 
colleagues. Right? This is 45 years ago that it was passed, 44 
years ago that it was written in regulation, and so 
agricultural land has been very different.
    Some of the information is not a requirement that we can 
have. If we want to be able to ask for their FSA farm records, 
that cannot be required to be put in there; we are going to be 
putting it as an optional to help us better track information. 
That is something that we do not have authority to be able to 
provide. Most of the requests and everything that we do is 
going to have to have an authority to better reflect leases and 
better reflect some of the land ownership in agricultural 
communities.
    Senator Fischer. As you know, people in agriculture are 
pretty individualistic, and they do not like a lot of reports. 
How--I will ask any of you--do you have suggestions on how we 
can make sure to get the information we need? I think we are 
all looking at foreign-owned land, foreign renters of land, and 
I specifically am looking in certain vulnerable areas across 
this country. Do you have any ideas how we can differentiate on 
the reporting requirements so we are not putting undue burdens 
on citizens in this country? Anyone have an aha moment here?
    Ms. Montano Greene. You know, Senator, I think the issue is 
very complex here. It is self-reporting. It is on the books. It 
should also be known we have been doing a lot of robust 
education with the realtor associations, various individuals 
that are within knowledge of deeds, making sure that our county 
offices or State offices would be more than willing to work 
with senators to be able to provide a toolkit if you want to be 
able to provide it to your respective communications, to be 
able to report.
    I do not know if there is like a system that is not self-
reporting. The complication is the multiple county recorders, 
the clerks, the multiple State systems that do not actually 
have an automated flag that then reports it up, for us to be 
able to then scoop into this. As we are moving forward, to be 
able to, you know, adlib what the Secretary said, there is not 
necessarily a foolproof way to be able to go. We can do the 
work that we need to do at USDA in one part of the system, but 
the other systems throughout the country and the infrastructure 
for us to be able to pull a report. We can rely on colleagues 
such as Mr. Pittman and Dr. Ortega and other entities, but we 
do have multiple structures and a complex system that needs to 
be created to be able to----
    Senator Fischer. Right. Since we do not--I just do not 
think the government needs to interfere in people's private 
businesses by requiring more reporting. In Nebraska, we have 97 
percent private ownership of land. I understand the challenges 
that we are facing here as we do try to figure out how we can 
get a better handle on, have more information on the foreign 
ownership, which I think is a concern for all of us. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Braun?
    Senator Braun. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thanks to the 
witnesses for your participation and comments. I have got a 
statement I am going to make, and then a question for Madam 
Chair and Ranking Member.
    Senator Tester and I did a bill, Protecting America's 
Agricultural Land from Foreign Harm Act, also sponsored by 
Senator Tuberville and Rubio. It would prohibit persons owned 
by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction of China, 
Iran, North Korea, and Russia from owning or leasing American 
agricultural land. It would also stop these individuals from 
participating in any of the USDA programs. I vetted this bill 
carefully with the USDA, the intelligence community, and a 
handful of committees here in Congress.
    I would like to submit letters of support for this 
legislation into the record, from the Agribusiness Council of 
Indiana, America First Policy Institute, Inherited Action.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. So ordered without objection.

    [The letters can be found on page 82 in the Appendix.]

    Senator Braun. Thank you. Several bills are addressing this 
issue. I have got Kip Tom, a farmer from Indiana and a former 
Ambassador to the United Nations for Food and Agriculture, and 
he capsulizes in a letter, which I would like to submit into 
the record as well.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. So ordered without objection.

    [The letter can be found on pages 85 in the Appendix.]

    Senator Braun. He points out that China has invested 
heavily in Belt and Road Initiatives throughout Africa, 
somewhat in South America. We have seen them steal intellectual 
property, manipulate currencies, just do about anything out 
there that would not be in the category of a handshake business 
partner. We have watched them leverage corrupt influence over 
the WHO, perpetuating a years-long lie about how the COVID-19 
pandemic started. Now China is running the same playbook on 
agriculture, using direct investments and regulatory capture at 
trusted international organizations to build power.
    Something has to give, and I am concerned about what time 
we have left here this year. If these bills do not make it into 
the farm bill, or in a way through this Committee, would Madam 
Chair and Ranking Member be okay with trying to maybe get them 
into the NDAA?
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well, thank you very much, Senator 
Braun. Senator Boozman and I were just talking about there is 
such interest, there are a multitude of bills, all of which in 
some way come together--we also know this is very complicated, 
as we were just hearing, about private ownership and how do we 
make sure this is focused and targeted in the right way on 
national security. I think we need to work together on all of 
this. Certainly NDAA is the vehicle that is moving and 
probably, you know, will have the opportunity to be signed into 
law first; we do not know. We certainly want to work with you, 
with other members of the Committee and those off the Committee 
to put together what makes sense. Some of this is jurisdiction 
of the Banking Committee with CFIUS, which I think is a very 
important piece of this.
    Senator Braun. We have already worked with them to clear 
it, to make sure it dovetailed with them.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Absolutely. I think we have got to 
work together. I pledge to work with you and with Senator 
Boozman and other members that are interested to see how we can 
move forward, in the way that protects our national security 
interests but addresses the other concerns that have been 
raised today as well.
    Senator Braun. Senator Boozman, are you okay with that?
    Senator Boozman. No, I agree totally. Again, as the 
Chairwoman said, we were kind of going back and forth about a 
path forward. You know, there is not many things in Congress 
where there is a lot of consensus, and I think that there is 
real consensus, both in the House and the Senate, Democrats and 
Republicans, that we simply need to get this worked out so that 
we protect, you know, the farmland, protect our entities, our 
industry, but also, you know as Senator Fischer was talking 
about, you know, not making this thing too onerous.
    Senator Braun. In that rare moment here in the U.S. Senate, 
we certainly out to take advantage of it. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Senator Thune, welcome.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair and Senator Boozman, 
for having today's hearing on foreign ownership of U.S. 
agriculture. I also want to thank our witnesses for appearing 
before the Committee and for your input on this important 
issue. It has already been stated, but food security is a 
critical component of national security, and we need to make 
sure that foreign countries do not hold an undue influence over 
our food supply. I am pleased that this year's Senate National 
Defense Authorization Act includes Senator Rounds' amendment to 
prohibit China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea from purchasing 
U.S. agricultural land and businesses, and I will continue to 
advocate for this provision's inclusion in the final NDAA.
    We also need to take a close look at the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's role in overseeing foreign ownership of U.S. 
agriculture, particularly as we keep working on the next farm 
bill. We must safeguard U.S. farmland, and food security is a 
critical component of national security, and I look forward to 
working with members of this Committee on this issue in the 
next farm bill.
    Dr. Ortega, what are the food security implications of 
increased foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land and 
businesses? Based on your research, what can we do to 
strengthen food security to support national security?
    Dr. Ortega. Great. Thanks, Senator, for the question. You 
know, as I mentioned in my testimony, one area that I think is 
important to look at are the effects of foreign demand for 
agricultural land on land prices and rental rates. The research 
that is out there, and this has been done as part of the latest 
AFIDA reporting, shows that there is no effect of increased 
demand on land values and rental rates.
    I will say, you know, in terms of what needs to be done, 
and we have discussed a little bit of this today, we need to 
have better access to data. The AFIDA data that is out there 
and that is reported has a lot of missing records, missing 
values that make it very difficult to really understand what is 
happening.
    Another important point on this is when we look at trends 
in the AFIDA data, there has been a lot of reconciliation of 
past transactions due to a lot of these errors, so it is really 
difficult to track what is happening over time because of the 
data quality, and I will leave it at that.
    Senator Thune. Okay. Mr. Pittman, you mentioned that USDA 
program eligibility for U.S. ag producers versus foreign 
persons is an area that can lack clarity. It is important that 
USDA programs are targeted to U.S. farmers and ranchers and not 
foreign persons. Could you explain that issue a little bit 
further, and how do we make sure that USDA programs are 
targeted specifically to help American ag producers?
    Mr. Pittman. The short version of that is, in general, when 
it comes to USDA programs, particularly disaster assistance-
type programs, the word that is used is prorate. You prorate 
out the level of foreign ownership, or the percentage of 
foreign ownership from the payment that is at issue. That is 
how it is generally done now. An area that I can only speak to 
that I have noticed it, that seems to be a shift, with the 
Emergency Relief Program and then the recently announced Milk 
Loss Program, it appears that the standard for those is any 
level of foreign ownership would create ineligibility.
    Those are the two tracks that I am aware of, and again that 
kind of gets you down in from--we talked earlier about AFIDA, 
but parallel to that, when you have the statute, the regs, when 
you deal with Farm Service Agency, or NRCS for that matter, you 
are going to have handbooks as well that go out to the States, 
and that is what is used at the county level to implement all 
these programs, and it is in the handbook where those new 
standards have been found, particularly for the ERP.
    You know outside of that, it is more proactive or looking 
forward. You know, you have several proposals, I will not 
relate them all here, but several that try to have some level 
of restriction on the receipt of Federal funds. Some go as far 
as receipt of any Federal funds, you know, if a State does not 
have a law that prohibits foreign ownership to some degree, and 
others are more specific at the Federal level to USDA programs. 
It is a matter of changing those laws to the extent that that 
is done through the Committee and through Congress.
    Senator Thune. Thank you. Ms. Greene, given your role in 
overseeing USDA's implementation of the Agriculture Foreign 
Investment Disclosure Act, what is your response to the 
discrepancies that Dr. Ortega has raised, and could you provide 
a status update on USDA's implementation of the improvements to 
the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act that were 
enacted last year?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Thank you, sir, for that question. We 
are doing our best based on the information--it is a self-
reporting document. We appreciate that Congress has put 
language in the appropriations language last year to update and 
to modernize AFIDA. It also came with zero funding. We have 
done the recommendation which was in the Consolidation Act to 
be able to provide that in a queryable format. This summer, we 
uploaded Excel documents for the last 10 years of that data to 
be able to move forward. We have been hearing on some of those 
documents, to be able to move forward. We are currently looking 
at budgets that are being discussed within the House and the 
Senate. We know that the FPAC Business Center, which houses the 
AFIDA, has a drastic reduction in their budget, so that will 
have impacts as well moving forward. We continue to find ways 
that we can move forward to be able to continue working with--
--
    Senator Thune. The discrepancies that he pointed out? You 
know, I mean I understand updating it is part of it, but do you 
have any way of explaining that?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Yes, so there are some items, which we 
will call Excel records--so there is times that have compiled 
ways for where it has been recorded that it was sold, or to 
foreign entities holding it, but that entity might have then 
sold it back to domestic, for example, so like a U.S. citizen 
might have it. Those kinds of information that are needed to be 
able to have that more updated format.
    The complicated system outside of USDA, to be able to have 
an understanding of how the deeds are recorded when they are 
recorded at the county office level, the State level, or even 
the sovereign tribal communities, and how that reports up to 
us, there is not like an automated query that we can then put 
it into the AFIDA way, so we have to rely on the self-
reporting. That includes the education and the outreach that we 
are doing with various entities, realtors, land trusts, local 
communities, posting it within our county offices so folks know 
to update their form and to make sure once it sells back from 
foreign to domestic or domestic to foreign, to be reporting to 
FSA or to USDA.
    Senator Thune. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. Time has 
expired.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. Senator Hoeven?
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Madam Chair. To Secretary 
Montano Greene, as has been brought up a number of times, a 
Chinese company recently wanted to purchase, or did purchase 
320 acres and wanted to build a wet corn milling plant very 
close to the Grand Forks Air Force Base in our State. That 
raised serious national security concerns, defense concerns, 
because that base is a leading base when it comes to ISR, 
satellite, and actually now working with hypersonic 
development. We worked with CFIUS to try to address that 
situation, but because CFIUS really was not up to date in some 
respects, in regard to agriculture, for example, and some other 
respects, the CFIUS process was not effective for that 
situation. We ended up working directly with Air Force and the 
city of Grand Forks and ultimately did resolve it, so that 
project did not go forward.
    As a result, we have taken a number of steps, and one of 
those is legislation. I am a cosponsor of the PASS Act with 
Senator Tester, Senator Rounds--and much of that legislation 
has now been included in the NDAA, in the Senate version of the 
NDAA, and we hope it becomes law--restricting China, Russia, 
Iran, and North Korea from purchasing land, but also requiring 
the Ag Secretary to report on foreign takeover of U.S. 
businesses. In this case, it was not just the purchase of 
farmland; it was an ag business that created the opportunity 
for spying, which was a big concern.
    In terms of this legislation that we are now advancing to 
prevent this type of risk, not only foreign purchase of 
farmland but spying on our military installations, that kind of 
thing, are we doing enough here? Is there something else that 
we should be doing in addition to what I have just described?
    Ms. Montano Greene. Senator, thank you for that, and thank 
you for your various support in the agencies at FPAC. USDA does 
believe that agriculture is part of national security, and 
while FPAC and the four agencies that I get to work with in the 
mission area do not have direct purview over CFIUS--that would 
be with the Office of Homeland Security--it has been a 
discussion that I have been aware of, of various items.
    I think one is the consideration, right, that there are 
some ag land purchases that are not covered within CFIUS, so I 
think that is what you addressed within North Dakota 
specifically. It is also the placement and the ability for the 
Secretary to serve on CFIUS, which he mentioned this week at a 
White House briefing that he is supportive of having USDA have 
a more robust role. It needs to be that, plus more.
    The complex system to be able to have an understanding of 
the data that is occurring at the local level in 3,000 counties 
across this country, at the 50 States and 500 sovereign 
nations, to be able to report that up, it does not exist. In 
addition to the work that we do to be able to have the 
disclosure act filed, having that complex system to be able to 
support, and how we think about the Federal interacting with 
local governments is really important to move forward.
    The other item I would just like to raise is, as was 
discussed about the improvements for AFIDA, or any items that 
we need to move forward, the resources to be able to complement 
that. While I still owe one of your colleagues a conversation, 
a followup with the Office of Homeland Security about their 
respective budget needs, the implementation for us to be able 
to have the capacity to be able to implement this if this moves 
forward is going to be very important.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay, exactly. That is the other thing I 
was going to mention. I am on the Ag Appropriations Committee. 
We included language last year, again trying to address this 
issue, directing you to update the access system for AFIDA so 
that people can truly see what is going on with any of these 
foreign purchases of ag businesses. Again, where I am going 
here, it is not just the purchase of ag farmland--and you are 
right; our State of North Dakota, we address that by 
prohibiting foreign purchase of farmland in our State. There is 
a State role to play, too, but in terms of the Federal level, I 
am really asking you about are we getting a grip on these 
companies, these ag companies that are being purchased, as well 
as the farmland itself. You are right; we did include that 
language in Ag Approps on AFIDA. We want you to update that. We 
have got a deadline for you of 2026. I understand you are 
saying you need more resources; I need to know about that, 
because if so, then we are going to address that as well.
    Again, hone in on the companies as well as the farmland, 
and getting that system updated so we are tracking what is 
going on with these ag companies. Like I say, we will continue 
to address that in Ag Approps as we did last year, but I need 
an update from you. What do you need? How are we doing, and 
what do you need? I know you are going to say dollars, but.
    Ms. Montano Greene. Is there time to--
    Senator Hoeven. Well, you went two minutes over for Thune, 
so----
    Chairwoman Stabenow. You are certainly----
    Senator Hoeven [continuing]. your 32 seconds----
    Chairwoman Stabenow. You are certainly welcome to--you are 
being asked what you need. I think you should tell him, because 
it is our job----
    [Laughter.]
    Chairwoman Stabenow.--it is our job to make sure you get 
what you need. It is really not fair to say do all this and 
then stop----
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow.--cancel the funding.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Yes.
    Ms. Montano Greene. Well, sir----
    Chairwoman Stabenow. You have the----
    Senator Hoeven. I want to commend the leadership of this 
Committee.
    Chairwoman Stabenow.--right here.
    Ms. Montano Greene. Sir, thank you. I will take the last 
question, or the last part of your question first. Regarding 
the appropriation, thank you very much for including that in 
Fiscal Year 2023 for the deadline and the push to be able to 
modernize. We have received zero funding to be able to 
implement that, so we did release this summer a very low-cost 
way to be able to have that queryable process available. We did 
Excel files for the last 10 years of data, which was loaded on 
our website, to be able to process that.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay, you need to tell us what funding--we 
have provided substantial funding. Whether you used it on that 
system or not, I get it, but that is a decision you have in 
your discretion. We need to know what you need to get it done.
    Madam Chair, thanks for your indulgence. Thank you for 
being here.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. You have the 
invitation, so we look forward to the information.
    As we close, I just want to thank all of our witnesses. 
This is a very important topic. We are going to proceed--we 
understand it is also very complicated and appreciate all the 
issues that have been raised today, but clearly great interest, 
and look forward to working with Senator Boozman and the 
Committee to address these issues. Thank you so much. The 
meeting is adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 12:21 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
