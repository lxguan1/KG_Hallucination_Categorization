    Chairman Good. The hearing on the Subcommittee on Health, 
Employment Labor and Pensions will come to order. I note that a 
quorum is present. Without objection, the Chair is authorized 
to call a recess at any time. Fifty years ago President Ford 
signed into law the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, 
or better known as ERISA.
    For half a century ERISA has stood as the cornerstone of 
our Nation's commitment to safeguarding the benefits of hard-
working Americans. Congress has a responsibility to not merely 
create laws, but to conduct genuine oversight, and better 
understand how the laws we pass impact the lives of our 
constituents.
    Today's hearing is a response to feedback from nearly 100 
stakeholders on ERISA's implementation. As we prepare to 
discuss ways to improve the law, we should first recognize the 
vital rule ERISA plays in ensuring access to employer sponsored 
benefits, especially as it relates to health care.
    ERISA's strength lies in its preemption provisions, which 
provide employers to offer consistent and comprehensive 
benefits across State lines. Without ERISA, multi-State 
employers would be left to navigate a patchwork of State 
mandates and onerous regulations.
    Efforts to undermine ERISA preemption threaten the 
stability of employer-sponsored health insurance. Without it, 
costs could rise for employers and employees alike. 
Unfortunately, a single payer health care system is the actual 
goal of many democrats on the other side of the aisle.
    Because ERISA reduces regulatory burdens, it allows 
employers to innovate to meet the needs of their employees and 
adapt the evolving health care landscape. For example, when 
telehealth exploded overnight because of COVID, employers were 
able to respond quickly by creating new telehealth coverage 
options.
    Business owners drive American ingenuity, and almost 
anything the government does, the private sector can do better, 
and this especially applies to health care. ERISA allows 
employers to purchase new avenues for improving health care 
delivery and outcomes. ERISA fosters an environment where free 
markets can work and expand access to new cutting edge 
treatments and benefits.
    However, the health care system of 2024 is vastly different 
than that of 1974, and it is clear from responsive stakeholders 
that there are ways to strengthen and improve current law. 
Clarifying fiduciary responsibilities for employers, promoting 
competition by preventing self-dealing, and facilitating 
greater data sharing are just a few of the steps we can take to 
empower job creators with the tools they need to lower health 
care costs and improve the quality of coverage for their 
employees.
    For too long, Congress has allowed the Medicare for all 
mentality to dominate our health care conversations, ignoring 
the fact that majority of Americans do not have, and do not 
want, government health care. In fact, 153 million Americans 
have employer sponsored health benefits. The private health 
care system is not perfect, but a 2021 survey by Employee 
Benefits Research Institute and Greenwald Research showed that 
63 percent of employees are satisfied with their coverage.
    I believe that more employer driven flexibility, innovation 
and competition will do far more to decrease health care costs 
than government-controlled price setting ever will. That is 
because competition, the free market, drives down costs while 
government subsidized health care places a greater burden on 
American taxpayers.
    I look forward to today's discussion, and I yield to the 
Ranking Member for his opening statement.
    [The Statement of Chairman Good follows:] 
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]    
    
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
holding today's hearing on how we can improve upon the 
protection afforded to American workers and their families 
through the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. 
I want to thank all the witnesses for being here as well.
    When ERISA was enacted in 1974, Congress stated clearly 
that the fundamental purpose of the law was to ``Protect the 
interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their 
beneficiaries.'' Accordingly, the law establishes consumer 
protection standards and provides remedies and access to the 
courts for workers whose plans are mismanaged.
    Critically, it ensures that those who serve as fiduciaries 
must administer plans for the exclusive purpose of providing 
benefits and may pay only reasonable expenses when they do so. 
While I expect that we will hear a lot today about the issues 
employers face, it is important that we not forget the 
fundamental purpose of the law.
    Any conversation about ERISA that does not put workers and 
their families at its very center misses the mark. Today's 
hearing is crucial. ERISA's impact on health care in the United 
States is substantial. The vast majority of people under the 
age of 65 rely on job-based plans for access to essential 
medical services.
    With over 164 million workers and their families benefiting 
from these arrangements, the significance of ERISA in 
regulating many of these plans cannot be overstated. However, 
our workforce and health care landscape has transformed 
considerably since ERISA was first passed in 1974.
    The law originally included huge, substantive standards 
relating to health benefits when it was enacted. Over the past 
50 years policymakers have found that, as a result, ERISA has 
failed to live up to its promise. There are still significant 
gaps in health care coverage for millions of Americans.
    Secrecy and excessive fees paid to third party 
administrators, and pharmacy benefit managers, and exorbitant 
prices charged for medical care and prescription medication all 
of which who squeeze workers through higher premiums and out-
of-pocket costs. While many challenges remain, it is important 
to note the progress we have made, in improving the 
affordability of health care for workers and their families in 
recent years.
    For example, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, workers 
enjoy preventive health care services free of charge. 
Dependents can stay on their parents' health policy until age 
26. Additionally, in 2021, congressional Democrats passed the 
American Rescue Plan Act, which enhanced the ACA tax credits to 
lower monthly costs for low-income individuals and eliminated 
the subsidy cliff so that more low-and moderate-income 
individuals could get coverage.
    These reforms strengthened access to benefits for millions 
of Americans, but there is still room for further improvement. 
I hope we can work together in a bipartisan way on these 
issues. For example, there is much work to be done to ensure 
that job-based benefits, including long-term disability 
insurance are available to people who need behavioral health 
care.
    Access to disability insurance is critical to ensuring 
workers have the financial security they need once they 
experience a physical disability or illness that makes it 
impossible for them to work. Unfortunately, a recent report by 
the ERISA Advisory Council found that long-term disability 
benefit plans often place discriminatory limitations on 
coverage based on mental health and substance abuse disorders.
    The report contains several thoughtful recommendations on 
how to address these issues, including by applying parity for 
behavioral health to long-term disability benefits. I hope we 
can discuss this issue and others that will help ensure that 
ERISA lives up to its promise for workers and families. I look 
forward to a productive discussion, and yield back, Mr. 
Chairman.

     STATEMENT OF MR. RUSSELL DUBOSE, VICE PRESIDENT OF 
     HUMAN RESOURCES, PHIFER, INC., TUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA 

    Mr. DuBose. Chairman Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and 
members of the Subcommittee. My name is Russell DuBose, and I 
have the privilege of serving as the Vice President of Human 
Resources for Phifer, Incorporated, a mid-sized manufacturing 
corporation headquartered in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.
    I am also the Chair of the Alabama Health Consortium, a 
coalition of employers in my home State. Today I am testifying 
on behalf of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser 
Coalitions, its more than 40 regional employer purchaser 
coalition members, who representative public and private 
sector, nonprofit, union organizations and more than 45 million 
Americans that spend more than 400 billion annually on health 
care.
    I am here to advocate for the critical role that ERISA 
plays in enabling employers like us to provide high-quality, 
uniform health coverages to our employees across State lines. 
To do that, I would like to tell you the story about how Phifer 
has leveraged the flexibility of ERISA to relentlessly push for 
health care value for our roughly 2,700 employees and 
dependents spread across Alabama, California and Pennsylvania.
    Throughout the 1990's and 2000's maintaining competitive 
wages and benefits remained relatively stable, however, post-
2010 we saw a notable increase in benefit costs, particularly 
health care. By 2015, it became evident that our current path 
was unsustainable, threatening both the affordability of our 
plan, and the well-being of our members.
    Recognizing the urgent need for change we enacted a 
transformative approach guided by our corporate motto, which is 
the golden rule. Inspired by the work of Dave Chase, the 
founder of Health Rosetta, an organization dedicated to 
transforming health care, and using the principles of Lean Six 
Sigma, we undertook dedicated efforts to reimagine how to 
deliver value for our families.
    Our flagship initiative is the PhiferCares Clinic, an 
onsite advanced primary care health center designed to provide 
comprehensive and zero cost share health care services by 
integrating elements such as enhanced access, and contracting 
with high-quality providers, the clinic became a trusted health 
care partner for our plan members.
    Not only have we achieved significant cost savings, but we 
have also seen improvements in health outcomes, which reduce 
hospital admissions, and better chronic disease management. 
Over the years, Phifer is continuing to expand our initiatives 
to include optimizing our pharmacy benefits by selecting a 
transparent mid-size PBM, direct contracting with high-quality 
providers, onsite nurses, patient care navigators, and the 
development of specialty programs like weight loss management.
    In 2023, amidst health care inflation, we pivoted our 
approach to focus on health care advocacy and wellness 
enhancement. This shift led to the launch of our zero-cost 
share by Phifer's pharmacy, further enhancing accessibility and 
adherence to medication.
    Our commitment to innovation has allowed us to maintain a 
relatively flat net health care spend for the last 4 years. 
Year over year, we invested the savings from our health care 
back into our workforce and community through an annual health 
care dividend. These dividends have created a virtual cycle of 
positive impact by repurposing previously squandered dollars to 
support meaningful initiatives.
    To date, more than 100 dependents have received 
transformative college scholarships to local Universities, 
including University of Alabama, Roll Tide. Hundreds more have 
benefited from our summer enrichment program. In 2022, our 
dividend was used to end copays for our onsite pharmacy, 
sparing 1,700 families from cost-sharing for prescription 
drugs.
    Our success at Phifer is not an isolated case. Employees 
across the country are reshaping the health care landscape, 
driving toward better value and outcome for their employees. 
However, the foundation of our efforts, ERISA, is under threat. 
If ERISA preemption were weakened, employers would face a 
patchwork of State regulations, jeopardizing our ability to 
offer uniform, affordable coverage across State lines.
    This would undermine the progress we have made and force 
many employers to revert to fully insured plans, limiting 
innovation and driving up costs. Much of that threat comes from 
State legislation designed to regulate PBM's, which is itself 
driven by the lack of meaningful Federal regulation to reign in 
anti-competitive practices.
    We strongly urge Congress to pass the Lower Cost More 
Transparent Act this year and go further by enacting 
legislation coming out of the Senate that would ban spread 
pricing, and mandate full rebate pass routes to plan sponsors. 
My written testimony includes additional recommendations to 
help self-insured plan sponsors meet their fiduciary 
obligations under ERISA.
    ERISA has served as a cornerstone of employer sponsored 
health coverage for five decades, enabling employers like 
Phifer to provide quality cares to our employees and their 
families. Thank you for this opportunity to share our 
perspective, and I welcome your questions.

    THE STATEMENT OF MS. MAIRIN MANCINO, SENIOR ADVISOR, 
      POLICY,  PETERSON CENTER ON HEALTHCARE,  NEW YORK, 
      NEW YORK

    Ms. Mancino. Chairman Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and 
distinguished members of the Committee. My name is Mairin 
Mancino. I am the Senior Advisor for Policy at the Peterson 
Center on Healthcare, a division of the nonpartisan Peter G. 
Peterson Foundation.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, as you 
examine ways to buildupon and strengthen ERISA and employer 
sponsored health care. Founded in 2014, the Center is a 
nonprofit organization dedicated to making higher quality, more 
affordable health care a reality for all Americans.
    We seek to transform health care in the United States into 
a more efficient and cost-effective system by finding 
innovative solutions that improve quality and lower costs and 
accelerate their adoption at scale.
    My written testimony today contains a number of detailed 
recommendations we have identified through our work, including 
through a recent convening of employers and purchasing groups 
regarding data access and market challenges. Today I will 
highlight a few of the key recommendations from my written 
testimony.
    First, Congress should strengthen an employer's ability to 
access their own data. As this Committee knows well, Congress 
has prohibited gag clauses in ERISA, yet third party 
administrators continue to hinder access to claims data. 
Congress should act to fix this problem or direct the 
Department of Labor to issue guidance that expressly prohibits 
TPAs from restricting employer plan access to their members 
claims data.
    Second, Congress should increase the utility of data 
available to employers. Even in its limited form to date, we 
have seen price transparency efforts motivate employers to use 
data in ways to promote competition, yet more work is needed. 
Congressional actions to codify payer and provider transparency 
rules into law will send a clear message.
    Price transparency is vital to competitive purchasing. 
Employers also need utilization information to increase their 
understanding of cost and quality drivers within their own 
plans, and how that compares to others when they design their 
health care benefits.
    To achieve this, Congress could create incentives to 
encourage employers and health plans to contribute to multi-
payer claims data bases. The information available through 
these data bases can support employer negotiations, and 
decisionmaking about health benefit design.
    Third, data needs to be made available to patients, so they 
can make informed decisions about their care. The bipartisan No 
Surprises Act contained a provision called the advanced 
explanation of benefits, which makes personalized cost 
estimates available to patients before they receive scheduled 
care. This provision was scheduled to go into effect at the 
start of 2022.
    However, the administration has delayed implementation. 
Congress should work to ensure the administration remains 
focused on implementing these requirements, so that consumers 
have access to this actionable information.
    Fourth, lawmakers should promote greater competition within 
the employer health care market by addressing anti-competitive 
practices. We understand through our work that dominant 
hospitals and payers are exerting their market power via 
contracting terms that inhibit competition.
    For example, all or nothing clauses require insurers to 
include all of a health system's network--excuse me, a health 
system's providers and facilities in their network, regardless 
of cost or quality differences. Most favored nation clauses 
also limit competition by guaranteeing that an insurer received 
terms from a provider that are at least as favorable as those 
provided to any other insurer, which prevents them from 
contracting with others at lower rates.
    These clauses give dominant organizations an unfair 
advantage over competitors and prevents new benefit designs and 
innovative contracting. Finally, Congress should expand the 
role of the ERISA Advisory Council or create a new advisory 
council to provide annual recommendations to Congress. Congress 
should ensure that this council is representative, balanced, 
adequately funded and empowered to contribute ideas and topics 
for review.
    Specific topics for the council could include employer 
market costs, prices and utilization trends. Transparency, 
including price transparency, billing or location transparency, 
health care ownership transparency, data sharing compliance, 
issues around network adequacy, as well as benefit design 
trends.
    In closing, policy reforms that seek to improve employers 
purchasing leverage and access to better data will bolster 
competition, equipping employers with the tools necessary to 
negotiate confidently in the health care market, and meet 
fiduciary responsibilities.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I look 
forward to your questions.

    Chairman Good. Thank you very much. Ms. Handorf, you are 
recognized for 5 minutes.

       STATEMENT OF MS. KAREN L. HANDORF, SENIOR COUNSEL, 
               BERGER MONTAGUE, WASHINGTON, D.C.

    Ms. Handorf. Chairperson Good, Ranking Members of the 
Committee, and Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and the other members 
of the Committee. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to 
testify. I have represented participants and beneficiaries and 
employee benefit plans for the last 40 years, both in the 
government and in private sector.
    Congress passed ERISA to protect the interests of 
participants and beneficiaries by imposing standards of conduct 
on plan fiduciaries, and for providing for appropriate 
remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts. 
Plans were to be administered for the exclusive purpose of 
providing benefits and defraying reasonable costs and expenses 
of administering the plan.
    Those purposes are not being served. Those hired to 
administer plans operate under a veil of secrecy and charge 
undisclosed fees that have inflated the cost of care, defeating 
congressional intent that plan money be used primarily to pay 
for benefits.
    Plan participants seeking access to the courts to protect 
their benefits are increasingly faced with barriers and limited 
remedies. 65 percent of American workers are now in self-funded 
health plans that contract with large insurance companies for 
access to their provider networks, and for claims 
administration. These large insurers are not directly regulated 
by ERISA and operate under a veil of secrecy.
    They will not give plan fiduciaries access to their claims 
data, necessary to determine how claims are priced, and whether 
their compensation is reasonable. They assert that they are not 
subject to the requirements in 408(b)(2) to disclose their 
fees, thus leaving plans making it virtually impossible for 
plans to monitor the fees of their largest service providers.
    The CAA's enforcement mechanisms, terminating contracts, is 
not practical where there are no alternative service providers 
in the geographic region, or the alternative providers engage 
in the same practices. When plans can obtain data, they find 
multiple mistakes that are revealed.
    They find that the prices paid by the plans does not line 
up with the provider's posted negotiated rates, and they find 
that there are fees that have not been disclosed to them. A 
recent New York Times article reported how TPAs reprice out-of-
network claims and charge a percentage of the difference 
between the build and repriced amount of it as a fee.
    The participants are harmed because they are providers who 
have not agreed to the priced amount, directly bill the patient 
for the remaining amount, in one case $100,000.00. The plan is 
harmed because it pays a significant and undisclosed 
percentage-based fee for the savings. In one case $50,000.00 
for processing a single hospital bill.
    All of this increases the cost to workers who contribute to 
the cost through wage concessions, premium payments, copayments 
and deductibles. These costs make it difficult for workers and 
their families to get the care they need. A 2019 survey found 
that 33 percent of people with employer-sponsored insurance put 
off or postponed needed care due to cost.
    18 percent did not fill prescriptions, rationed doses, or 
skipped doses of medicine. Significant numbers of workers carry 
substantial medical debt. It will not help if cost savings are 
achieved, but there are no consequences if plan fiduciaries do 
not follow the rules designed to protect workers and their 
families.
    In a recent case, doctors for a 27-year-old patient were 
unable to obtain prior authorization for an immediate heart 
transplant that would have saved the patient's life. They 
sought a 72-hour expedited external review, which they were 
entitled to under the law, but it was treated as a 45-day 
standard review.
    The patient died 5 days after the decision that eventually 
reversed the client's denial should have been rendered. The 
patient's estate sued for disgorgement of the amount the 
defendant saved by mismanaging the claim, but the court said 
they were not entitled to that remedy.
    Workers attempting to protect their rights are faced with 
constant barriers. Their lawyers cannot get attorney's fees for 
handling their internal appeals. Workers are denied claims 
files, plan venue provisions prevent them from suing where it 
is convenient. Arbitration agreements, and class action waivers 
significantly hurt their opportunity to protect their benefits. 
Congress should consider this.

     STATEMENT OF MR. SCOTT BEHRENS, SENIOR VICE PRESI-
       DENT, DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS,  LOCKTON 
       COMPANIES, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI

    Mr. Behrens. Chairman Good, Ranking Member DeSaulnier, and 
members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to 
testify today. More importantly, thank you for taking the time 
to celebrate my friend, ERISA, leading to its 50th anniversary.
    My perspective comes from 16 years as an attorney 
specializing in ERISA law. I began my career at a national law 
firm and have spent the last 10 years at Lockton, the world's 
largest privately held independent insurance brokerage firm. 
Lockton works with nearly 5,000 employer and union health plan 
sponsors across all industries, geographies and sizes.
    Our role as a broker gives us a unique vantage point to 
objectively observe the health care landscape. We help our 
clients design and operate their health plans in a way that is 
consistent with their workforce well-being goals, and of 
course, compliance with ERISA.
    This includes evaluating and providing accountability for 
insurers, TTAs, PBMs, and others. Enough about me, and enough 
about Lockton. The real hero today is employer sponsored health 
care, and the plan sponsors who work diligently to ensure high-
quality and affordable benefits for their workers and families.
    Like Hans Solo has Chewy, and Barbie has Ken, our hero is 
supported by an indispensable sidekick, ERISA. Employer 
sponsored insurance is the bedrock of the American health 
insurance system, providing health coverage to over half of all 
Americans.
    As described in my written testimony, polling data shows 
ESI is well liked, and it provides significant benefits to 
workers and their families, employers and unions, and the 
Federal Government.
    ESI would not be nearly as popular and effective without 
ERISA. Still, health plan sponsors face a three headed monster, 
ever rising health care costs, burdensome administrative 
requirements, and increasingly complex compliance obligations 
and litigation risks.
    Today, you have the opportunity to support the dynamic duo 
of ESI and ERISA, but it is crucial that you keep two guiding 
principles before you at all times. First, do not harm. Second, 
make it easier to provide high-quality and affordable benefits. 
First, do no harm.
    According to ERISA's drafters, the crowning achievement of 
ERISA is its preemption provision. ERISA preemption allows plan 
sponsors to offer uniform and equitable benefits, innovate and 
respond to the unique health care needs of their workers and 
families. Sadly, we have seen states pass laws subverting ERISA 
preemption, and even the Departments of Labor and Justice have 
pushed a harmful theory undermining ERISA.
    The Committee should stand firm against any attempts to 
weaken ERISA preemption, including calling into account wayward 
administrative agencies. Second, making it easier to provide 
high-quality and affordable benefits. This will benefit both 
workers and employers.
    We praise the Committee for its work to increase quality 
and reduce costs, most recently with passage of the lower cost 
More Transparency Act. We support that legislation, but we 
think additional modifications will prove even more beneficial. 
First, strengthen the prohibition on gag clauses to affirmative 
require data sharing with both the plan sponsor and business 
associates supporting the plan sponsor.
    Allow data to be used in any manner and for any purpose 
permitting by HIPAA. Second, ensure timely and ongoing 
disclosures of transparency data in a consistent format. Third, 
require TPAs, PBMs, pharmacy purchasing coalitions and other 
service providers to disclose their direct and indirect 
compensation.
    Fourth, hold TPAs, PBMs and others accountable for 
compliance and reporting obligations related to their services. 
Fifth, allow for disclosures electronically, and take other 
steps to streamline reporting and disclosure obligations. 
Sixth, work with the Department of Labor to help plan sponsors 
better understand and comply with their fiduciary obligations, 
especially their duty to monitor.
    Seventh, prohibit anti-competitive contract terms and 
downstream agreements with hospitals and providers. Eighth, 
consider ways to reduce pharmacy costs. Again, I thank you for 
the time, and I thank you for the opportunity to work with you 
as we join forces to support ERISA and ESI.
    [The Statement of Mr. Behrens follows:] 
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] 
    
    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Behrens. Under Committee Rule 
9, we will now question witnesses under the 5-minute rule. I 
will wait to ask my questions, and therefore I recognize Mr. 
Walberg from Michigan for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the panel 
for being here, and happy anniversary, Mr. Behrens. I am about 
ready to celebrate my 50th wedding anniversary and it has been 
wonderful, as long as we did the things that were necessary, 
even reforms of me, during those 50 years to make it continue 
working.
    ERISA, as you have said, is a very popular tool for 
employer sponsored insurance, and I guess the question I would 
ask subsequent to what you, I think, very clearly stated, how 
we as Congress protect it, and continue the opportunity;
    What parts of the law do you believe are most crucial to 
maintaining the success and popularity?
    Mr. Behrens. I think the most important one starts with 
ERISA preemption. The preemption provision, as we see in the 
legislative history, is considered its crowning achievement. 
One of the key reasons why ERISA was developed in the first 
place was the disparate rules and patchwork of State 
regulation, and allowing ERISA preemption to stand will 
encourage employers to be able to be responsive to their 
workforce needs in the areas that the--as we talked about, the 
data show.
    I also think the ability to access and utilize data as 
outlined in HIPAA is incredibly important. In addition, I think 
the fiduciary obligations are incredibly important, that as 
employers work to administer their health plans, they are doing 
so in the best interest of their participants and 
beneficiaries.
    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Thank you. Mr. DuBose, this Committee 
has championed legislation to increase transparency, lower 
costs, and encourage innovation in the health care market. Last 
year the Committee passed my legislation, the Telehealth 
Benefit Expansion for Workers Act, which allows employers to 
offer a standalone accepted telehealth benefit to all 
employees, which they were able to do during the COVID-19 
pandemic successfully.
    What current barriers do employers face in offering 
telehealth services, and how would a separate telehealth 
benefit help your company and your employees?
    Mr. DuBose. Thank you, Representative Walberg. The barriers 
employers face with telehealth is--I believe the issues we face 
is with our providers. We have employees that live in multi-
states. Our salespeople travel from State to State when they 
visit with clients, and when we are using our telehealth 
resources, our providers may not be licensed in the states in 
which our members either are living or traveling in.
    We take the approach that to solve that barrier perhaps we 
should flip the script, and the provider--the State licensure 
should be based on where that provider is located. For example, 
if we change the licensure in Alabama, where our provider is 
located, and then that licensure would actually cover those 
plan members regardless of their domicile, or their traveling 
status. That would alleviate the gaps that are created by the 
provider not having proper State licensure in other states.
    To support our facilities in California, for example, we 
had to license our providers in Alabama in the other states 
just to access our own employees, as an example, sir.
    Mr. Walberg. Okay. A number of responses to the Committee's 
request for information cited burdensome State regulations of 
telehealth. What can be done under ERISA to lessen that burden 
in a greater way?
    Mr. DuBose. We believe that ERISA provides the proper 
framework to allow us to be flexible. I would say threats to 
ERISA at the State level, our ability to have ERISA preemption 
is paramount to having that success and to be able to improve 
on the offerings that we already have. Thank you.
    Mr. Walberg. Okay. Ms. Mancino, in your research you have 
convened panels of employers who are struggling to offer good 
health benefits to their employees in this market. Undoubtedly, 
you have heard many complaints and concerns from them. What is 
the top concern you heard from employers and how would Congress 
address it?
    Ms. Mancino. Thank you for your question, Representative, I 
appreciate the opportunity to give this answer. I think through 
our research the top concern has to do with access to data and 
information in order to make the choices that they need in 
designing a health benefit plan. As we heard from other 
witnesses, TPAs are placing restrictions on access to 
employer's data, which prohibits and inhibits, employer's 
ability to understand cost and quality drivers within their own 
populations.
    Then they then struggle to compare that to other like-
sized, like-situated employers. Without Congress stepping in to 
provide access to that data, I think that there is--employers 
will remain challenged in designing benefits that will meet the 
needs of their populations.
    Mr. Walberg. Thank you. I have gone way over, and I 
apologize Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Walberg, because I do not 
have to say remember to stay within your time for everybody. 
Thank you, Mr. Walberg, and now I yield to Mr. Courtney from 
California for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Courtney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually, coming 
from a district which is home to the Yukon Huskies, I would 
just note that I am not from California. I represent Storrs, 
Connecticut where the men's--that is right. Yes. Anyway, thank 
you to the witnesses for being here, and I am again also 
pleased that we are--taking a moment to reflect on the 50 years 
that ERISA has been on the books, and ways that we can build on 
it and improve it.
    During my time here, I think the most striking reform was 
in 2010 when we passed the Affordable Care Act, which via the 
Public Health Service Act amended ERISA to put in really some 
of the most powerful patient protections, eliminating 
preexisting condition exclusions, ending the practice of 
lifetime limits, allowing the children of covered employees to 
stay on their parents' health plan until age 26. All of that 
was because Congress had the boldness to resist all the 
negative pressure to get those measures through.
    Today, I mean, I think they are just sort of viewed as a 
given in terms of the way plans operate. I also would just note 
that a few weeks ago the Republican Study Committee released 
their 2025, sort of budget alternative, and included in it was 
a proposal to cap the tax exclusion for--employer-sponsored 
health plans.
    Again, we are not the Ways and Means Committee. We are 
talking about other issues here today, but you know, we went 
through the Cadillac tax fight, which was a bad part of the 
ACA. We managed to keep pushing it off before it actually took 
effect, and in 2019 a bill, which I was the lead sponsor on, 
passed the House 419 to 6, to strip the Cadillac tax from the 
tax code.
    To this day, it still remains a tax-excluded benefit. 
Again, for some of you who are in the business, can you sort of 
comment in terms of what the impact of capping the tax 
exclusion would have in terms of creating really unfair and 
inequitable and, you know, outcomes by region where costs are 
different, health care costs are different.
    I see you nodding your head, Mr. Behrens, maybe you can 
comment.
    Mr. Behrens. Yes. First of all, thank you very much for 
your leadership on helping eliminate the Cadillac tax. It was 
rather problematic, and it is simply the other side of the coin 
of limiting the exclusion. We believe that when you look at the 
health care landscape, one of the things you alluded to is that 
a lot of the cost differentials, a lot of the high costs are 
driven by geography.
    A lot of the high costs are driven by certain care 
conditions. Yes. In the data it shows that costs for women tend 
to be higher than costs for men. If your plan population is 
such that you have certain characteristics in it, your costs 
are going to be more. That is not necessarily because you are 
providing excess benefits, or anything extemporaneous that does 
not need to be in there, it is just a matter of fact.
    Changes to the exclusion could have a very negative impact, 
similar to what we expected to see if the Cadillac tax would 
have gone.
    Mr. Courtney. Right. Thank you. Again, when that proposal 
was released a couple weeks ago, the Alliance to Fight for 
Healthcare, which was a really interesting coalition of 
employers, as well as other fiduciaries and beneficiaries, 
whether it is Taft-Hartley plans, others all have actually 
stayed together since the Cadillac tax repealed, immediately 
issued a statement saying we do not want to go down this 
pathway. Mr. Chairman, I would ask again, that their statement 
be entered for the record.
    Chairman Good. Without objection.
    [The Information of Mr. Courtney follows:]
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] 
    
    Mr. Courtney. In my remaining time again, just to go back 
to the question in terms of the disclosure and transparency 
issue, Ms. Handorf, I think again, you have heard the exchange 
here before in terms of just how, you know, particularly third-
party entities, there is a need for more transparency in terms 
of helping with the way plans operate and cost.
    Maybe you could just comment on that in my remaining 40 
seconds.
    Ms. Handorf. Yes. I think that one of the real problems 
right now with health care is that there is a veil of secrecy. 
Most of the PBMs and the TPAs will not give employers 
information that they need. When you do find out information, 
you find out that there are no rules, really that they are 
playing by.
    Until you get transparency and some ability for plans to be 
able to get that information, we will not be able to fix the 
cost of care.
    Mr. Courtney. Thank you. I yield back.
    Chairman Good. Thank you, Mr. Courtney. I will now 
recognize myself for 5 minutes. I will remind the witnesses to 
pull the microphones a little bit closer if you would. Mr. 
DuBose, I found your testimony most interesting as you 
described some of the great work that Phifer has done to 
provide outstanding benefits, a quality work life experience 
for your team members.
    You have taken great efforts and steps for the mutual 
benefit, well-being and cost savings of the organization and 
your team members, and the government did not make you do any 
of it. You guys did it on your own, so you are to be commended 
for that. More specifically, your written testimony notes the 
ways that your company has used telehealth, so that patients 
across the country, particularly in rural areas have access to 
important health care services.
    Can you discuss this a little further, how telehealth has 
helped you expand access to care, while also delivering lower 
cost and lower premiums to your plan participants?
    Mr. DuBose. During the pandemic we noticed many of our 
rural families suffered from a lack of transportation and 
access, as providers were inundated with patients. We developed 
an internal telehealth solution with our own onsite health care 
clinic and offered 24/7 telemedicine to all of our family 
members, so we were able to provide additional access from 
their homes and created opportunities to improve their well-
being.
    The framework that ERISA allows us to be innovative, it is 
foundational for us to where we can create new policies and new 
techniques to protect our plan members, so the protections 
afforded by ERISA allow us to be innovative and expand.
    Now, we provide telemedicine to all of our plan members. We 
found, for example, prior to that Sunday afternoons we had the 
highest emergency department use. Then, since we adopted 
telehealth, we eliminated many admits to emergency departments 
on Sunday afternoon. We found actual, tangible benefits by 
expanding telehealth to our plan members.
    Chairman Good. Very good. Are there any barriers you are 
facing now, any obstacles to continue to provide telehealth 
benefits to your employees since COVID expired? The pandemic 
has expired. What obstacles are you facing now?
    Mr. DuBose. The current system is working well, as some of 
those provisions that are up for expiration, we are opposed to 
that. We want to see telehealth continue. We have found that 
telehealth has a very remarkable place in providing support for 
medical management, chronic disease management.
    There is a sweet spot for telemedicine, so we find that 
threats to ERISA allow us to--create harm for our telemedicine 
benefits because it would limit access that are plan members 
currently enjoy.
    Chairman Good. Very good. Thank you. Mr. Behrens, despite 
efforts by democrats and many on the left to try to force 
single payer health care over the last 15 years or so, more 
Americans have private health insurance than Medicare or 
Medicaid, or other Obamacare plans.
    Over half of Americans, I think you might have been the one 
who noted, have employer-sponsored health insurance. ERISA's 
preemption clause allows multi-State employers to follow ERISA 
rather than all states laws, and this provides the regulatory 
framework to maintain competition, the free market.
    If ERISA preemption is eroded, how would this impact 
employer-sponsored benefits?
    Mr. Behrens. I think there are several ways that it would 
impact employers. I mean one of the first ways is additional 
costs, and additional plan administration, especially in the 
workforce that we have with a lot of remote workers now 
consider a small employer.
    Employer in Kansas City, you have got a grocery store that 
has employees in Kansas, in Missouri, and you might have some 
administrative employees elsewhere. If you were required to 
comply with a whole bunch of different State laws, that would 
make things much more difficult for employers.
    It would also tie their hands on innovation, and the 
ability to be flexible and make changes quickly. For instance, 
in the pandemic we saw that employers were able to quickly 
adapt more telehealth benefits, were able to quickly amend 
their plans to provide more benefits for behavioral health care 
as well as testing and treatment, and so those flexibilities 
would be gone.
    Chairman Good. Would you be concerned if ERISA preemption 
was eliminated or faded away, that our country would move more 
closely toward a single payer system?
    Mr. Behrens. Absolutely.
    Chairman Good. Thank you very much. With that, I yield back 
and recognize Mr. Norcross from New Jersey for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Norcross. Thank you, Chairman and to the witnesses for 
coming here today to talk about ERISA, which few people outside 
this room really understand, and certainly from what it has 
done for both workers and employers over the years, I think it 
is a job well done, but also it means that there are some 
things that we can do to certainly improve it.
    One of those, and I know the Ranking Member talked about 
mental health illnesses and some of the impact. It is common 
today. It is probably as common as it was before, but now it is 
out in the open that we can have this discussion about that, 
and the stigma surrounding mental health is dropping, certainly 
not to where it needs to be, but it's going on.
    The numbers are 1 in 5 adults have some form of mental 
illness. ERISA's Advisory Council issued a report examining the 
barriers that workers face to accessing their long-term 
disability or LTD. Ms. Handorf, could you briefly talk about 
the impact of not offering adequate long-term disability 
coverage for those dealing with mental health or substance use 
disorder, on workers and their family?
    Ms. Handorf. I do not believe that mental health is treated 
the same way with disabilities as it is with health care. Many 
disability plans limit disability benefits if you are suffering 
from mental health problems to 24 months, which and on the 
other hand, it is endless for other types of health care 
disabilities.
    Well, mental health disabilities are no different than 
health care disabilities. They both make it impossible for the 
worker to work. If we really want parity in mental health, we 
need to make it apply to mental health, to long-term disability 
plans, as well as to health plans, and that would serve a very 
important purpose.
    Mr. Norcross. Certainly, the Parity Act, which talks about 
the enforcement mechanism that the Department of Labor could 
use because right now we have the speed limits, but nobody is 
obeying them, and there is no real recourse, so we want to make 
sure we do that.
    Let me just switch gears here a little bit, and the 
discussion on whether or not we tax our benefits, particularly 
in health benefits, has been around for years. There has 
unfortunately been some more discussion. I say unfortunately 
because I believe it would have a negative impact on what 
employers and employees would do.
    Mr. Behrens, if this happens, and that is a huge if, that 
we take away the tax status for our health plans, what do you 
think happens to the market? Not so much going to the single 
employer, or do they just turn it over to the employees and say 
go find your own?
    Mr. Behrens. I think one of the first things that happens, 
obviously if you change the rules around the exclusion, you're 
raising taxes. Workers will have less money in their paycheck. 
I think the idea is that it would change health care, reduce 
health care costs, but we do not envision that happening based 
on the information that we have, the plans that we work with.
    We think employers are actively working on behalf of their 
employers to provide good benefits that are in alignment with 
what the workers need. If the exclusion goes away, some of 
those benefits will go away, and so plans will get skinnier and 
narrower, and be less beneficial to workers and their families.
    Mr. Norcross. Thank you, and it is, I think, worth noting 
that when we look at tax breaks in general, the vast majority 
goes to those in a higher income bracket. This is what I call 
the working man's tax break. It helps in two ways. It helps 
them in their health care, mental health care, because they 
will now be covered.
    If thrown back to an employee, they have to make those 
tough choices each and every day, do I pay for sneakers for my 
kid going to school, or do I keep my health benefits? Those are 
decisions unfortunately that are very real.
    We believe that the idea of that exemption is the core for 
ordinary working men and women. Keep that. Let them have their 
tax break while you take your zillion dollar tax breaks on the 
other side. This is the working man's tax break. With that, I 
yield back.
    Mr. Allen [presiding]. Alright. The gentleman yields. I now 
recognize myself to ask questions. Over 40 years ago my wife 
and I took our savings and started a construction company. As 
the company grew, we were able to offer employee health 
insurance, which was not only a great benefit to our employees, 
but it was certainly critical to recruiting and retaining 
talent.
    This year we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, also known 
as ERISA. I am pleased that we are convening today's hearing to 
explore avenues to continue to enable small and large 
businesses alike to offer consistent and high-quality health 
care plans to employees nationwide.
    However, there is more that Congress can do to expand and 
strengthen this law, such as allowing self-employed individuals 
to be covered under ERISA. Helping small businesses ban 
together to offer insurance to their employees, like we passed 
in the House, passed the Choice Act last year, and reforming 
stem therapy.
    Right now, the government is running all of health care. 
Mr. DuBose, what would it look like if under the Affordable 
Care Act unions and the faith-based community were given 
waivers to run their own health care plans without--basically 
privately, without government interference.
    What would it look like if ERISA, along with folks, self-
employed folks able to participate in ERISA, what would it look 
like if ERISA got the same waivers, and companies like yours 
were able to run your programs without having to answer to HHS 
and CMS?
    Mr. Dubose. Thank you, Representative Allen. We believe 
ERISA provides a minimum set of protections through its 
framework that allows us to innovate consistently in our multi-
State plan. That is very important to us. If those guardrails 
were to change, then I believe that would create risk for our 
plan design, and ultimately would harm our working families.
    We support that. If we no longer had to report to CMS on 
our pharmacy data, and those type things, I would suspect we 
would even be more innovative in the way that we craft our 
plans to further lower cost for all of our plan members.
    Mr. Allen. Well, that is the idea is to lower costs, and 
that is what at least we know the faith-based community better 
known Medi Share offers to folks. We passed the Lower Cost More 
Transparency Act in December, which was intended to improve 
transparency in PBMs, so what is your opinion of the bill and 
proposals to improve the transparency?
    Mr. DuBose. It is a fantastic bill. We support the 
transparency aspects. I will say that we do urge Congress to go 
further. There needs to be PBM reform, especially in regard to 
spread pricing, and rebate pass through. There are practices 
within those industries that ultimately create higher costs for 
our working families, and we urge Congress to consider 
addressing those issues.
    Mr. Allen. Thank you. Mr. Behrens, as employees look for 
ways to control health care costs, it is amazing that people 
who benefit by selling new tactics in the name of cost savings, 
like alternative funding programs, or AFPs, or taking advantage 
of employers by not giving them the full picture. In your 
opinion, should plan sponsors be required to clearly inform 
enrollees of the existence of an AFP, and the specific 
conditions the program impacts?
    Mr. Behrens. When it comes to AFPs or any of the 
prescription drug models, I believe ERISA's disclosure 
requirements already require that information be provided about 
that. I will tell you from our experience, employers tend to 
shy away from those types of programs simply because of the 
challenges that employees face with having to comply with 
those, and some of the risks related to them.
    Mr. Allen. I want to thank you also, Ms. Mancino, for 
sharing the--your thoughts on telehealth and Mr. DuBose, so 
that is critical to health care. I am out of time, and so I 
yield back. Ms. Jayapal, you are recognized for questions.
    Ms. Jayapal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our health care 
system is broken, and the high costs are crushing workers. 
Meanwhile, CEOs of big insurance companies rake in billions of 
dollars in profits, and their executives make tens of millions. 
When Democrats held the majority in the House, we worked to 
improve regulation of big insurance, and lower health care 
costs for workers.
    In the Affordable Care Act, we capped the total out of 
pocket costs allowed in health insurance plans, and in the 
Inflation Reduction Act we went further, and capped the out-of-
pocket costs for prescriptions at $2,000.00 for people on 
Medicare, and that will begin in just a few months.
    Now, President Biden has called for extending that cap to 
everyone who has insurance to make big insurance pay its fair 
share of medical costs. My colleagues across the aisle have 
advocated for repealing many of these health insurance laws and 
decreasing regulation of big insurance.
    Ms. Handorf, in your testimony you discovered how current 
law allows insurance companies that administer group health 
plans to avoid the regulations in the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act. Can you provide examples of how this has 
affected workers in their real lives?
    Ms. Handorf. Yes. I think that by not providing the 
information that is necessary for fiduciaries to control costs 
and find out how things are actually being run, it has caused--
I represent two Taft-Hartley plans in Connecticut, who tried to 
get their plan data from Elevance, and were not given the data.
    They wanted it because in one of the plans the plan had to 
increase the deductible so high that their members were not 
going to the doctor. They were not taking the medications 
because they could not afford it. That is why they wanted to 
find out what was happening.
    They reached a stone wall. We actually had to file a case 
in Federal court to get that information, which has not yet 
been resolved. When you do find out what happens, you find out 
that the claims are not being paid in accordance with the 
negotiated rates. That there are fees that are being hidden 
from the plans, and that there is just no rhyme, no reason how 
these plans are being operated.
    Unless ERISA makes it clear that these TPAs are 
fiduciaries, or at least gives access to employers the 
information they need, and somehow is able to balance the 
bargaining power between the insurer and the plans, it is just 
going to continue the way it has been.
    Ms. Jayapal. And given the lack of regulation of big 
insurance, can you tell me how health care costs for employers 
and for employees have changed over the past decade?
    Ms. Handorf. Yes. Well, as costs have gone up, and there is 
no question the costs have gone up, employers are finding ways 
in which to share those costs with employees, who already have 
given up some of their wages in order to get health insurance.
    You see in a lot of instances, the deductibles going up 
very high, to the point where if you have a huge deductible, 
you are not going to go to the doctor.
    It immediately affects them. Then when you have things like 
what the New York Times reported, it also affects employees in 
the sense that they get stuck with bills that they should not 
be stuck with because the insurers are claiming 30 percent of 
the savings by repricing the claims. All of these practices 
hurt participants, and I do not think we know the extent of 
them without more information.
    Ms. Jayapal. What recourse do workers have if their medical 
care is denied by their group health plan? Is it easy to 
navigate the appeals process under ERISA?
    Ms. Handorf. Unfortunately, no. No. 1, it is very hard for 
participants to get health care lawyers to take their claims 
because they are big claims. The lawyer will not be compensated 
for the work in the internal appeals procedure where the record 
is made, and so there is a limit to what the record can be.
    Then sometimes they ask for records, and the plan will not 
give it to them, so it makes it very difficult for them to 
assert their rights to benefits. Their doctors usually know 
what is happening, but their doctors cannot bring a claim 
because there are anti-assignment provisions in the plan 
documents. There are all kinds of barriers.
    Ms. Jayapal. Of barriers, yes. It does not sound like with 
these increased costs that they are getting better care or 
benefits.
    Ms. Handorf. No. I do not believe so.
    Ms. Jayapal. When left unregulated big insurance increases 
costs and decreases care for people. That is what I am seeing 
from my constituents every single day, and it is really 
important that we continue to pass policies that reign in big 
insurance, and work toward affordable health care for everyone, 
like my Medicare-for-All Act. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back, Madam Chair, I yield back.
    Mrs. Foxx [presiding]. Thank you. Mr. Bean, you are 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Bean. Madam Chair, very good morning to you, and good 
morning HELP Committee, to our witnesses. We are glad to have 
you in our Nation's capital. We are talking health insurance, 
and the efficient delivery thereof. Mr. Behrens, you said do 
not do any harm, and I understand that.
    Here is our first question. Earlier this year a bipartisan 
group, 39 State Attorney Generals, including Attorney General 
Ashley Moody of my free State of Florida, wrote to Congress, 
urging us to take action on pharmacy benefit managers, PBMs.
    Their letter outlined several PBM practices, such as spread 
pricing and tying compensation to the list pricing of a 
medicine. According to these AGs, the practices affect patients 
and important stakeholders, employers, and community 
pharmacists, and also could increase the cost of health care 
delivery.
    Ms. Mancino, what say you? What should we be doing? Is 
there a problem with PBMs, and what are your thoughts on it.
    Ms. Mancino. Thank you so much for your question. I think 
it is really important that Congress do two things in this 
area. Based on our research, we feel as though Congress needs 
to provide vendors, and clarify that vendors such as PBMs have 
clear obligations to current ERISA fiduciaries.
    If you provide that type of guidance, I think that the 
market can take that information and will--it will improve the 
visibility and the understanding of contracting terms that 
exist in that market. I also think that it is important that 
Congress provide additional clarification and tools to current 
fiduciaries, including empowering them with access to 
meaningful data to carry out their roles.
    Mr. Bean. Mr. Behrens, Ms. Mancino says action is needed 
first of all. Is there a PBM problem? Two, what should we do 
about it if there is?
    Mr. Behrens. I think one of the--I think she is exactly 
right. Additional transparency will be very helpful, and so 
we----
    Mr. Bean. There is a problem. There is a problem.
    Mr. Behrens. There is a problem with the lack of 
transparency, with the opaqueness, and many times we also see, 
as Ms. Handorf has mentioned, as well, lack of transparency 
around fees. In addition, and so holding them to account to 
provide that fee information under 408(b) 2 of ERICA, the 
indirect and direct compensation would be beneficial.
    Mr. Bean. More sunshine is the answer. Is that the answer, 
Mr. Behrens?
    Mr. Behrens. It is part of the answer.
    Mr. Bean. Very good. When you leave your job, if you were 
to leave your job, and now I think it is an average of seven 
times that millennials leave their job, even more than that, 
that the average as of a few years ago was seven times. Do you 
know when you leave your job you always have to find new health 
insurance, but you do not have to find new house insurance. You 
do not have to find new car insurance.
    Is it time that we create a market out there where people 
can be responsible for their own health care? How great would 
it be to see a commercial saying 15 minutes could save you 15 
percent on your health insurance, or so easy a caveman can do 
it, and let people make their own decisions.
    Is that a good idea? Is it past time that we start our own 
health care market where people can make their own decisions, 
and have their own health insurance without going through their 
employer? I throw that out as a toss-up question. Mr. DuBose, 
jump in.
    Mr. DuBose. In practice, I do not think it is applicable 
yet because the players in health care, even if it is a new 
insurer, a new provider, those actors, the simple matter of 
fact is many of the goods and services are just overpriced, so 
those same problems are going to creep up.
    Mr. Bean. If we had a free market, a free market with some 
of the same protections that ERISA has given employers, would 
that be just a better way to go? It is kicking our tail right 
now. The health care costs are eating our lunch financially, 
and so is it time to do something different? We have done it 
this way for so long, but what can we do different?
    Mr. Behrens, what do you think about this new concept where 
people control their own health care?
    Mr. Behrens. I think there are a lot of ways people are 
able to. They have the choice. If you are leaving employment, 
you have the choice of continuing.
    Mr. Bean. Your choice is to take the company plan, or not 
take the company plan?
    Mr. Behrens. You have got the choice of enrolling on the 
ACA marketplaces; you have got the choice of enrolling 
potentially in a short-term limited duration plan. You have got 
the opportunity, depending on your eligibility, to enroll in 
Medicare or Medicaid. I think there are options out there, and 
I think fundamentally there are still challenges with each one 
of those options.
    Mr. Bean. Yes. You are saying go to Baskin Robbins and just 
take vanilla, and that is it. Hopefully we can have a general 
discussion, keep going forward and think differently. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield back. Thank you very much. Great Discussion.
    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Bean. Ms. Manning, you are 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Manning. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to our 
witnesses, and Mr. Bean, I just must say I love your 
enthusiasm. I agree with you that people should be able to get 
their own health care, and that is why we passed the Affordable 
Care Act, and that is why in my State, I am so thrilled that we 
finally, after all these years, decided to take Medicaid 
expansion, so that people could afford their own health care.
    I just want to use this to say Mr. Behrens, thank you for 
mentioning the Affordable Care Act, because it is such a 
critically important component of what people can now use to 
get their own health care.
    Ms. Handorf, the Biden administration finalized an 
important rule that would roll back the Trump administration's 
expansion of short-term limited duration insurance. Some would 
call it junk health insurance.
    I have recently had an experience with a constituent in my 
district who thought she had good health insurance, because she 
had gotten one of those short-term limited duration insurance 
plans, and then when she got sick, she learned it did not cover 
anything.
    I know that these plans serve as a stopgap but were 
expanded far beyond the purpose by the Trump administration. 
Can you talk to us about how these plans differ from ACA-
compliant coverage?
    Ms. Handorf. Well, one of the things they do is they do not 
cover pre-existing conditions, so that if you have a pre-
existing condition you are not going to be able to get care for 
that. It also limits the type of benefits that you can get. I 
believe mental health benefits are limited. Pregnancy benefits 
are limited.
    You are not getting the same quality that you would get 
otherwise. I think there are a lot of marketing techniques that 
make it sound like you are getting a lot more than what you are 
actually getting, so the value does not add up to what the cost 
is.
    Ms. Manning. In many circumstances these plans offer false 
promise to consumers?
    Ms. Handorf. Yes. They offer false promise.
    Ms. Manning. An important protection that was established 
by the Affordable Care Act is that it allows consumers to seek 
an external review of the adverse benefits determinations by 
their health plan or insurer. This is important because it gets 
people access to an independent review of their situation while 
avoiding having to go through the court system.
    I think, as you noted in your testimony, the time it takes 
for an external review can have tragic results. How can this 
process be improved?
    Ms. Handorf. Well, the process can be improved. The law is 
there to give you a prompt external review, but if people do 
not follow it, there are no consequences, as the case I pointed 
out in the Rose case where----
    Ms. Manning. There are actually no penalties if the rules 
are not followed?
    Ms. Handorf. Exactly, because there are no penalties, and 
the participant is limited in what relief they can get.
    Ms. Manning. Do you believe that independent review 
organizations for self-insured plans have the potential for a 
conflict of interest?
    Ms. Handorf. They do if you leave them in the hands of--I 
think that with any review process in ERISA, when you have the 
same reviewers over and over again, who want to be employed, 
they tend to give a decision that is going to make sure that 
they get chosen the next time.
    Ms. Manning. Thank you. Ms. Mancino, you mentioned that the 
lack of competition resulting from the consolidation of 
hospital systems can have an impact on costs. I know that in my 
own district, the pressure on our major hospital system to 
merge with a larger system is enormous, so that they can get 
more leverage to negotiate to achieve lower costs.
    I am concerned that mergers and consolidations actually 
provide worse care for my constituents. Can you talk about how 
we should be addressing that difficult balance?
    Ms. Mancino. Thank you very much for this important 
question. I think that the role that Congress can play here 
today and in the future is to address anti-competitive behavior 
that exists in concentrated markets.
    We would really like this Committee to focus on continuing 
to advance data transparency, codify price transparency, make 
it clear that TPAs cannot hinder access to employer claims 
data.
    Encourage the administration to implement the bipartisan 
advanced explanation of benefits requirement and incentivize 
employers and health plans to contribute their health care 
claims data to multi-employer claims data bases to help drive 
better purchasing and benefit design choices in concentrated 
markets, and we think you should address anti-competitive 
contracting practices like prohibiting all or nothing, or anti-
tiering contracting practices.
    Ms. Manning. Thank you. My time has expired. I yield back.
    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Ms. Manning. Mr. Burlison, you are 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Burlison. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuBose, you know 
when I think about how messed up the health care system is, and 
how expensive it is, I cannot help but think about how this 
place has totally taken an industry and turned it into a 
Frankenstein.
    That you have got a scenario that first when people used to 
have choice, then as my colleague was mentioning, at one point, 
you know, people do not go and shop for health insurance today 
because it is being done by their employer, and why? The 
employer gets the tax benefit, and the employer is required to 
provide that.
    We have consolidated and taken away the choice for 
employees at a company and said, if you are going to get 
insurance that is subsidized, and you do not have to pay taxes 
on it, it is going to be through whoever the employer picks. Is 
that correct?
    Mr. DuBose. In a self-insured plan that we have, we have 
providers. We do offer centers of excellence, and high-quality 
providers based on quality.
    Mr. Burlison. I am not talking about the providers. I am 
talking about the network. The insurance network. You pick the 
network.
    Mr. DuBose. Yes. In Alabama we do have essentially one 
network, and we do add to that network through direct 
contracting, but in Alabama our network does cover all the 
providers in the State with our carrier, so we have a different 
choice proposition in our State.
    Mr. Burlison. Right. At the end of the day, in order for 
the sake of providing this tax benefit, we have eliminated 
choice to the two individual insurers, right? Individual 
covered lives no longer have the same choice that they once 
did.
    Mr. DuBose. I do not agree. We have a lot of good----
    Mr. Burlison. Not if they are going to get the same tax 
benefits.
    Mr. DuBose. In Alabama the way our market works, the choice 
that we provide to our plan members is to go to the providers 
of their choice within the totality of the network based on 
quality, so we are able to navigate through innovation to those 
best of class providers.
    Mr. Burlison. Right.
    Mr. DuBose. Let the plan members make that conscious 
choice, and informed decision to see the provider that they 
feel the most comfortable with, that has the best outcome, best 
quality, best cost, so it is a decision that the plan member 
needs to make, but it needs to be an informed decision.
    It is not in our State, the network itself is not what is 
in play, because all of our providers are in the same network.
    Mr. Burlison. You understand that is not the way it is 
across America.
    Mr. DuBose. It is not. It is different from State to State.
    Mr. Burlison. Okay. In communities like mine there are 
basically two networks, and if you are a member of one, and 
your employer decides to go to the other, you have to leave 
doctors from one to the other. You are lucky. You are in a 
Goldilocks community in that regard.
    OK, so my other question has to do with the difference 
between the ERISA plans and the State regulated plans. What are 
the benefits that an employer receives to use an ERISA plan 
over what is regulated by the state?
    Mr. DuBose. The benefits for us for an ERISA plan is the 
fact that we are able to offer our plans multi-State, and 
remove variance, and make sure we have high quality plans that 
are consistent with all of our plan members, regardless of 
their location.
    Mr. Burlison. Right.
    Mr. DuBose. We create innovative, high-performing plans 
because ERISA allows us that framework to excel as opposed to a 
State plan that does not have those same luxuries.
    Mr. Burlinson. Right. I am hearing that while the ERISA 
plan is preferrable, really what you are avoiding is a lot of 
State mandates on insurance. Is that accurate?
    Mr. DuBose. In Alabama, what we offer in our ERISA 
preemption, in our ERISA covered plans, we believe we far--we 
excel. We far out-provide State provided plans.
    Mr. Burlison. Oh, I am sure it could be better than just 
saying you have got one size fits all mandates, that sometimes 
a State implements that can be the tail that wags the dog.
    Mr. DuBose. In the State of Alabama we do use our ERISA 
preemption, so when the State does pass laws or policies, that 
are unique to providers within the State, those are generally 
for State covered entities that are not ERISA covered plans.
    Mr. Burlison. Thank you.
    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Mr. Burlison. Ms. McBath, you are 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Ms. McBath. Thank you so much, Chairwoman and Ranking 
Member DeSaulnier, and your staff, and our witnesses that are 
here with us today. Thank you so much for making this hearing 
possible for us. As I have shared with the Committee before, I 
am a two-time breast cancer survivor, and the daughter of two 
health care professionals.
    My father was a dentist, and my mother taught nursing at 
Howard University Hospital. Health care, as you can see, is 
very, very personal to me, and I have seen this industry not 
only as a patient, and from the perspective also of a provider. 
I know that there is still so much work that we can do together 
to really ensure access to affordable health care for our 
constituents.
    I am glad to be here today as we look toward ERISA's 50th 
anniversary and reflect on ways to improve health care delivery 
for the folks that are counting on us back at home. Step 
therapy is an insurer, or pharmacy benefit manager, mandated 
protocol that requires patients to fail other treatments before 
they could take advantage of the actual medication recommended 
by their doctors, that in most cases really is the best 
medication, but they have got work their way to get to that 
medication.
    Often failing medication can result in debilitating side 
effects and irreversible disease progression. I will say that I 
actually have gone through this with my own husband, who has 
been diagnosed with a very rare autoimmune disease.
    Last time we gathered here to discuss employer-sponsored 
health care, I shared how my husband was actually being stepped 
through the wrong medication in order to obtain coverage for a 
therapy that our doctors knew would be better suited for his 
treatment.
    I am really proud to be working with Representatives 
Wenstrup, and Chavez-DeRemer on the Safe Step Act. Our bill 
would actually offer a streamlined procedure for processing 
step therapy exemption requests, and return these personal 
decisions to where they belong, with the patient, and with 
their family and their health care provider.
    I know what it feels like to walk hand in hand with a sick 
loved one. To see them go through the fear and the uncertainty 
of their diagnosis. When someone you love is sick, all you want 
to do is see them get the care, the medication, and the 
services and the support that they need to get better.
    The last thing anyone wants to hear is that their husband 
or their sister or their child, their care is being jeopardized 
in order to just kind of like check a box. Some patients simply 
do not have that luxury to wait, and I know in the case even 
with my husband, it was a matter of days really actually had we 
not been able to ascertain what disease he had, his disease can 
be fatal if not managed.
    I just want to say always we have to be thinking about the 
patients' care foremost in mind because our patients really 
can't wait. My question is for Ms. Handorf. Do you think it is 
appropriate for pharmacy benefit managers to refuse to cover an 
employee's treatment, even if it will result in irreversible 
health outcomes or death?
    Ms. Handorf. I think that costs usually end up driving 
decisions when they ought not to, and the bottom line should be 
that the benefits are for the participants' best health. I 
think that when pharmacy benefit managers control the 
pharmaceuticals that participants have access to, ultimately it 
does not result in a good result because it is just going to 
cost more in the long run.
    That's of course, assuming that the patients live for the 
second therapy, or the other drugs. I think there should be 
control of that situation.
    Mrs. McBath. Thank you for that. Can you talk a little bit 
more about pharmacy benefit managers, and how important it is 
to have more transparency, which we have talked about that 
today, but really if you would like to elaborate even more 
about the transparency for the American public when it comes to 
what they do and the decisions that they make?
    Ms. Handorf. Well, I think that is very hard to understand 
how you can control costs if you do not know what your service 
providers and the TPAs are doing. I think that transparency is 
difficult to define right now because we do not even know what 
we are looking for that needs to be open to the public view.
    I think it is essential for employers to have equal 
bargaining power with their service providers, in order to be 
able to really control costs and provide good benefits.
    Mrs. McBath. Thank you so much for your testimony, and I 
yield the balance of my time.
    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Ms. McBath. Ms. Hayes, you are 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you and thank you to our witnesses for 
testifying here today. I am happy to be here, however, I 
recognize that we are still just nibbling around the edges, and 
we need to address health care in this country, in a real and 
meaningful way.
    According to the Peterson KFF Health Systems Tracker, the 
majority of individuals under age 65 in the United States 
receive their health coverage through a job-based plan, 
including more than 164 million workers and their family 
members. While people are generally satisfied with their 
employer sponsored plan, the cost of health care is still far 
too high for many.
    According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services, health care in the United States is among the highest 
in the world, accounting for over $4.5 trillion in 2022. Those 
are policy choices. Despite this spending, we have worse health 
outcomes than other developed nations. This Congress has had a 
large focus on the lack of transparency in this market due to 
pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.
    This Committee even marked up legislation included in the 
bipartisan Lower Cost More Transparency Act, which would 
improve transparency regarding PBM rebates. Employers who 
sponsor health plans are often unable to determine the basics 
of how PBMs make decisions with respect to their plans.
    With respect to their plans, prescription drug benefits, 
including rebates they earn, and whether those rebates pose a 
conflict of interest that raises costs for workers and their 
families. Mr. DuBose, in your testimony you pointed out the 
need for Federal standards for PBMs. How do rebates impact how 
a PBM designs a formulary?
    Additionally, how does that affect consumers in terms of 
their premiums and out of pocket costs?
    Mr. DuBose. Thank you, Representative Hayes. Yes, we 
believe the PBMs, they control the formularies. When it comes 
to pharmacy costs for an employer-based plan, the formulary is 
the driver of those expenses.
    We have seen, and which was a reason we moved to a midsize, 
transparent PBM, it is because the placement of some of those 
formulary items are driven by the rebate model, as opposed to 
lowest net cost. We encourage our fellow employers and plan 
sponsors to focus on lower net cost because at the end of the 
day that equals lower costs, lower premiums, for plan members.
    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. According to the Drug Channels 
Institute in 2023, 80 percent of all equivalent prescription 
claims were processed by three companies, CVS Health, Express 
Scripts, through Cigna and Optim RX through United Health 
Group.
    Like many others on this Committee, I constantly hear from 
constituents that they are either paying too much for 
prescription drugs, or they cannot find the drugs they need 
because of pharmacy consolidation.
    How does this market concentration impact the employer's 
leverage in negotiating for better health plans, and is 
increased transparency regarding PBM rebates enough to lower 
health care costs, Mr. DuBose?
    Mr. DuBose. Yes. Representative Hayes, the recommendations 
we have outlined are necessary, but I do believe the fiduciary 
role of those PBMs is what is key to impact their behavior. If 
that happens, those other things that we have talked about, 
banning spread pricing. One of the Representatives mentioned 
delinking and rebate model control.
    Those types of things are necessary to change the business 
model so that the prices become affordable to both the plan and 
the plan members.
    Mrs. Hayes. Thank you. I guess I will end my time, but I 
got very excited when I heard my colleague, Mr. Bean, talking 
about this idea that people could have health insurance that 
was not connected to an employer, and they would not have to 
change it all the time.
    I just think that that was just such a ringing endorsement 
for the whole idea of the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, that 
we really should concentrate some time on improving plans like 
that, so that people who will have multiple options, and that 
all of those options will be both affordable and accessible, 
and will not be contingent upon employment or geography, or 
what community you are from.
    I really hope that we take the opportunity to improve the 
systems that we have in place to make them better for all to 
access. With that, I yield back. Thank you.
    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you, Ms. Hayes. I now recognize myself for 
5 minutes. Mr. DuBose and Mr. Behrens, State laws regulating 
pharmacy benefit managers have been the vehicles for 
litigation, challenging the extent of ERISA preemption. 
However, I cannot emphasize enough that protecting ERISA 
preemption is not about regulating PBMs.
    Congress must understand how these State laws are the 
camel's nose under the tent. How do these lawsuits impact other 
service providers, and other employee benefits under ERISA?
    Mr. Behrens.
    Mr. Behrens. Yes. I think you are exactly right that the 
way that states are looking at the response to the Rutledge 
decision and applying the laws go well beyond PBM regulation. 
If the idea is that the states can subvert the rights of this 
Congress to regulate employee benefit plans by regulating PBMs 
or TPAs, then that's going to have significant impacts.
    Mrs. Foxx. Mr. DuBose.
    Mr. DuBose. I agree that protecting ERISA preemption is not 
about the states in their attempts to regulate PBMs. I believe 
ERISA has always been to provide a self-insured employers a 
Federal regulatory framework to provide great benefits to their 
plan members. I just believe the states are reacting to a 
condition with pharmacy pricing. It's their attempt to reign 
that pricing in.
    Mrs. Foxx. Yes. I will start with you, Mr. DuBose. How 
should Congress both protect ERISA and ensure proper oversight 
of PBMs?
    Mr. DuBose. I think Congress and policy does a good job in 
protecting ERISA. I think the arguments made at the State level 
are things that need to be addressed at the Federal level. 
Things such as a PBM, site neutral payments, that Medicare is 
proposing. Those type things are very important, and we support 
those, and if those things were managed and taken care of at 
the Federal level, then the states would not have to engage.
    Mrs. Foxx. Mr. Behrens, do you have anything you would like 
to add to that?
    Mr. Behrens. I think transparency is certainly important 
and helpful. I would argue that in addition to some of the 
efforts that are already underway, ensuring that the 
information we are asking PBMs to disclose is disclosed timely. 
For example, if we are merely asking for rights to audit PBMs, 
those audits are very difficult and expensive.
    We would prefer to see regular data feeds of that 
information, so that it is actionable during the plan year. In 
addition, when it comes to the fees, we believe that it is 
important for PBMs, as well as TPAs, and others to disclose 
their direct and indirect compensation.
    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you. Ms. Mancino, anti-competitive 
contract terms are becoming more common as the health care 
market becomes increasingly consolidated. Do you believe that 
these anti-competitive practices inhibit a free market in 
health care?
    Ms. Mancino. Thank you for your question, Chairwoman. Yes. 
We do think that the market--the work that we see, and the 
challenges that employers face in the market, they are 
challenged to unlock competition and their purchasing power 
today.
    Mrs. Foxx. How would you recommend Congress address this 
anti-competitive behavior?
    Ms. Mancino. Congress can seek to address anti-competitive 
behavior in concentrated markets in two primary ways. Continue 
to advance data transparency, codify the cost transparency 
requirements, push that further, make it clear that TPAs cannot 
hinder access to employer claims data.
    Encourage the administration to implement the advanced 
explanation of benefits to give consumers actionable 
information as they make care decisions and incentivize 
employers and health plans to contribute health care claims to 
multi-employer claims data bases to drive better purchasing and 
design decisions. Finally, prohibit all or nothing, most 
favored nation, and anti-tiering contracting practices.
    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you very much. I have another question I 
am wanting to ask, but I am about to run out of time. It has to 
do with hospital charging facility fees for telehealth 
appointments. Mr. Behrens, would you give a very quick answer 
to that issue?
    Mr. Behrens. We are very skeptical of facility fees in 
general, specifically with respect to telehealth when the only 
required technology is a phone line or internet connection.
    Mrs. Foxx. Thank you very much. Mr. Scott, you are 
recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Handorf, we have 
talked about transparency. One of the shortcomings of 
transparency is it is just the first step. I think you have 
alluded to the fact that if you had transparency, a lot of 
people would not know what they were looking at. What does an 
employer know if he gets transparency?
    Ms. Handorf. Well, I think that that is a problem with the 
408(b)(2) disclosures because if you are going to get fees 
reported, you have to know that those actually are the fees 
that are being charged.
    What I think will happen is, if you get more access to the 
claims data you will be able to see how the fees are spent, how 
they are collected, and you will end up finding out more.
    I think that really the answer is to make the TPAs and the 
PBMs fiduciaries under ERISA.
    Mr. Scott. How would making them fiduciaries improve 
things?
    Ms. Handorf. Well, it would make them responsible to the 
participants and beneficiaries. They would have to follow the 
fiduciary rules. They could not set their own compensation. 
They are basically running the health care plans anyway now, 
and it would just put the responsibility where the power is, 
and the liability where it belongs.
    Mr. Scott. Thank you. You talked about denial of benefits. 
When benefits are denied do consumers get a de novo right of 
review when they go to court?
    Ms. Handorf. No. You get a discretionary standard review, 
which means that even if the judge thinks that you are right, 
if there is a reasonable basis for why the plan denied the 
claim, the court will have to affirm the denial. It really does 
put a barrier in terms of people getting benefits, which is 
what ERISA is designed to do, is to provide for those benefits.
    If we had a de novo review, the court would be looking at 
the record with a fresh eye and making a decision as to whether 
or not the benefits should be provided.
    Mr. Scott. I know there are other barriers like arbitration 
agreements that get in the way of consumers getting a fair day 
in court. Are there other barriers, arbitration agreements, for 
example, that serve as a barrier to consumers getting their 
fair day in court?
    Ms. Handorf. Yes. I understand that the employers want to 
control costs, but they put in their plan documents many things 
that keep participants from protecting their own rights, like 
class action waivers, arbitration provisions, venue provisions 
that cause people to have to go across the country to 
adjudicate their claims.
    They are all designed to keep people from protecting their 
interest. It is hard enough for employees to get representation 
in ERISA cases. These make it even more difficult.
    Mr. Scott. It is hard to get representation because we know 
the claims are only a few thousand dollars, then you cannot 
afford an attorney if that is all that is at stake, is that 
right?
    Ms. Handorf. That is correct. Usually, the claim will not 
be great enough that it makes sense for a lawyer to pursue the 
claim, so by allowing individuals to join together in a class 
action, they are able to effectively get relief for everybody.
    Mr. Scott. If the person--if the customer is successful, 
who pays the attorney's fee?
    Ms. Handorf. In a class action it comes out of the recovery 
from the plan.
    Mr. Scott. If there is no class action if it is an 
individual claim?
    Ms. Handorf. With an individual claim it still comes out of 
the recovery, but what it does is it allows people to get 
lawyers who they otherwise could not get.
    Mr. Scott. That is if there is a class action?
    Ms. Handorf. Yes. There is a lot of risk bringing class 
actions, as I am well aware. There are many barriers to 
bringing them. Article 3 standing provisions have kept many 
people from pursuing their claims.
    Mr. Scott. If there is an inappropriate denial that 
effectively causes malpractice who is on the hook, and the 
insurance companies essentially made the decision, what 
responsibility for the malpractice does the insurance company 
have?
    Ms. Handorf. It really does not because the Supreme Court 
said that ERISA pays for benefits. If they deny you the right 
to a benefit, you still have the right to get the health care. 
You just have to pay for it yourself, which is effectively 
denying the health care. When insurers for example, do not 
handle claims properly they should be liable for the 
consequences of not doing so.
    Mrs. Houchin [presiding]. The gentleman's time is expired.
    Mr. Scott. Thank you.
    Mrs. Houchin. I now recognize Ms. Chavez-DeRemer from the 
State of Oregon.
    Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. Thank you, Madam Chair, for holding 
this important hearing on employer provided health plans. Thank 
you to the witnesses for being here. Roughly, 48 percent of 
Oregonians get their health care from their employer. In a lot 
of those plans Oregonians have trouble getting past medically 
inappropriate step therapy protocols.
    It has been found that step therapy was applied to almost 
40 percent of all specialty drug decisions in the largest 
commercial plans, and that many step therapy protocols went 
against clinical guidelines. Not surprising, since the people 
imposing step therapy are not doctors, all at the expense of 
people's health.
    As a business owner myself, I know this is not the fault of 
employers, especially the small business folks. Pharmacy 
benefit managers, PBMs, are responsible for processing 
prescription drug claims, and they are implementing step 
therapy without any flexibility for any individual's patient 
medical history or needs.
    That is why I joined Representatives Wenstrup and McBath in 
introducing the Safe Step Act, and I hope this Committee can 
advance it this Congress. Mr. DuBose, the Safe Step Act does 
not end PBM use of step therapy, it simply establishes a timely 
exceptions process. Do you think that is a fair balance between 
finding savings without causing harm to the patients?
    Mr. DuBose. We support the Safe Step Act. We do reserve the 
right to use step therapy. I think what is important for plan 
sponsors, especially small businesses, what they need to really 
ensure in their plan design for pharmacies, is to make sure 
that they have independent analysis carved out for their 
authorizations for those specialty drugs.
    As you mentioned, as those specialists, the doctors and the 
pharmacists, as they confer to decide is it appropriate care, 
because ultimately that is the purpose is what is the most 
appropriate care of the right product at the right price at the 
right time? By doing so, you provide the best medicine for that 
patient to reach the best desired outcome possible.
    Ms. Chavez-DeRemer. At the right cost. We also know that 
misaligned incentives of the current payment system leave PBMs 
to favor medicines with high list prices, and larger rebates. 
That is why I am also proud to co-lead the Drug Act, which 
would crack down on PBMs who put the bottom line ahead of their 
clients and patients' interests.
    As PBMs have faced exposure over their practices, they have 
actually shifted their compensation models to focus on 
administrative and other fees, and those fees have typically 
remained tied to the list prices. Even in cases where health 
plans may be receiving a substantial portion of rebates for 
PBMs, PBMs may still have an incentive to favor those higher 
list prices.
    This compensation model is causing patients to face insane 
prices for their prescription drugs, and for what reason? I 
mean really PBMs can manipulate the market while Oregonians 
have to choose between going hungry and buying their medicine. 
It is really quite shameful what we are seeing across the 
country.
    Dr. Behrens, I want to make sure I get that right, thank 
you. Do you agree the Drug Act would help address these issues, 
and help bring down costs for employers and patients?
    Mr. Behrens. First of all, I need to clarify I am not a 
doctor.
    Ms. Chavez DeRemer. Oh, I had it wrong.
    Mr. Behrens. Just a Juris Doctor. Just a lawyer.
    Ms. Chavez DeRemer. That is okay. Take the credit where the 
credit is due.
    Mr. Behrens. I have not specifically reviewed the 
legislation. I would be happy to and followup more with it. I 
do think one of the challenges--one of the fundamental 
challenges here is the list prices and some of the prices that 
are charged to begin with, and a lot of the programs that are 
utilized, tools that are utilized are to deal with those high 
prices.
    I appreciate the opportunity to look into that more and 
followup.
    Ms. Chavez DeRemer. Yes. If you could followup, review it 
and get back with me that would be great. PBMs should not tie 
their compensation, in my opinion, to the price of medicine. 
That runs counter to the stated mission of lowering drug costs. 
Breaking a link between medicine list prices, rebates and PBM 
compensation will go a long way in removing the incentives that 
pad the PBMs pockets.
    Madam Chairwoman, these are critical to lowering costs for 
patients and improving transparency for employers throughout 
our districts. I do hope we can move through this process as 
this Congress wraps up, and with that, I yield back my time.
    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you. I now recognize Ranking Member 
DeSaulnier for 5 minutes.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Very good. Your high school French 
succeeded. Well, thank you again to all the witnesses. The 
ERISA Advisory Council just released a report for people who 
are on permanent disability, long-term disability benefits 
about behavioral health needs.
    The council found that 99 percent of long-term disability 
plans imposed duration limits for people with disabilities 
arising from their behavioral health conditions while not 
placing similar limitations on disability arising from physical 
health conditions. Ms. Handorf, could you briefly discuss how 
this fact squares with the concept of mental health parity?
    Ms. Handorf. I do not think it is consistent with the 
concept of mental health parity because I think, with mental 
health parity, Congress recognized that mental health 
conditions are just as serious as physical health conditions, 
so you should have parity. People should be treated equally. I 
think that is a public policy that has been well established. 
It really makes no sense for disability plans to have different 
standards for mental health disability and physical health 
disability They should be the same because the impact is 
exactly the same.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Exactly. Just this past week the New York 
Times did a frontpage story examining a company called 
MultiPlan, a private equity backed data and analytics firm that 
works with third party administrators of ERISA health plans. 
The practice is described as shocking, shortchanging health 
care providers, and leaving patients on the hook, often with 
bills amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.
    Anecdotally, I have heard from friends of mine and 
providers, long-term primary care providers, just talking about 
how much time they are spending on challenges to what used to 
be normally provided by health care plans, and it is just a 
waste of that in the system.
    Ms. Handorf, how did this company in particular make its 
money, and who ends up bearing the cost of the savings it 
achieves when patients are the ones who are billed for the 
difference?
    Ms. Handorf. I think it is still a secret exactly who bears 
the cost. I think that most plans do not even realize there is 
a savings fee attached to the payment. We have seen cases where 
a provider is paid $1,500.00 and there is a $30,000.00 savings 
fees attached to it.
    It goes to the plan as the benefit payment of $31,500.00. 
What is not clear is whether the patient, the employee, has to 
pay a higher coinsurance because of that, but we do know from 
the New York Times article that the providers will then bill 
the patient, and the patient is then obligated to pay more.
    I think this is probably, I have seen this a lot in plans. 
They are usually described as savings fees for catching fraud 
and abuse. In fact, they are fees for just bullying a provider 
into taking a lesser payment.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Just again, anecdotally hearing from 
friends who have been doctors for a long time. Here in the D.C. 
area, and in my district in the San Francisco Bay Area, about 
calling me and saying everything has changed. We have been 
providing the same kind of advice, with the same kind of 
financial support for years.
    Here is an example, with not just the direct costs that are 
lost to the person who is impacted by this, the person who is 
seeking advice in health care, but also the doctors and primary 
care doctors who don't have the kind of staff but have the kind 
of trust and relationship with their patients. It is a real, 
real, problem. I thought it was fascinating what the New York 
Times did with it.
    It seems like for efficiency, we should be able to do 
something in a bipartisan level for employers, and for the 
patients. The General Accounting Office recently noted that the 
Employee Benefits Security Agency at DOL has been almost flat-
funded for over a decade, even as its responsibilities have 
grown enormously during the time due to legislation like the 
Affordable Care Act.
    This has been a strategy by some of my Republican 
colleagues do not provide the funding to actually regulate what 
the law says. Ms. Handorf, do you have any comments?
    Ms. Handorf. Well, I worked for the Department of Labor for 
many years, and it is a big task. I think that without the 
funding you are putting a band aid on enforcement. You need a 
lot of money to investigate some of the insurers. They are not 
going to want to give you the information that you need.
    The problem is that not only does the Department not have 
the resources to do it, but employees do not have the ability 
to do it for themselves, so it is really important that the 
Department have money.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you, and I would like unanimous 
consent to submit to the record a letter that Mr. Scott and I 
have sent to the Department of Labor, and also a letter from 
SunLife. Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mrs. Houchin. Without objection.
    [The Information of Mr. DeSaulnier follows:]
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] 
    
    Mrs. Houchin. I now recognize myself for 5 minutes. Thank 
you for testifying before us today. We are grateful for your 
time. I have had the chance to speak with individuals and 
stakeholders on literally every side of this PBM reform issue, 
and I am hopeful that there are some policies we can agree on 
to increase transparency and oversight with respect to PBMs, 
and to reduce costs and address the concerns that I have been 
hearing from constituents and pharmacists alike.
    One such complaint is that there are three PBMs at this 
time that control the vast majority of prescription claims for 
the United States. In fact, their combined market share has 
skyrocketed from 48 percent in 2010 to 80 percent in 2022. 
While the PBM industry says there is a lot of competition in 
the PBM marketplace, I worry that self-insured employers 
actually do not have much choice.
    I continue to hear from my community and independent 
pharmacies, frustration about the lack of meaningful action in 
Congress to reign in PBMs, and I agree. I was a proud supporter 
of the Lower Cost More Transparency Act, which overwhelmingly 
passed the House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis last 
December, including some of my own language on the Hidden Fees 
Disclosure Act.
    As it sits in the Senate, unmoved. Mr. DuBose, you stated 
in your testimony that the recent increase in State laws 
seeking to regulate PBMs is caused in part by the vacuum 
created by lack of action in Washington on PBM abuses at the 
Federal level, and again I agree. As I continue to have these 
conversations and continue researching on this matter, I would 
certainly appreciate you sharing your expertise.
    Mr. DuBose, how do you think Congress can help ensure more 
competition in the PBM market, so employers do have real 
choices?
    Mr. DuBose. Yes. I agree the big three have taken over the 
market share within self-insured space. They do that because 
most employers subscribe to the rebate model that is in place. 
Those big three PBMs, they own the aggregators, in which 
rebates flow through from the manufacturers. So they own the 
pipeline.
    For employers, plan sponsors, they have to get educated, 
and they have to identify and find high performing transparent 
PBMs. I believe the key is they have to connect with PBMs that 
are willing to serve as fiduciaries, until the law is changed, 
and which decrees states that PBMs are fiduciaries.
    That is who they need to seek because then the plan design 
will move away to an administrative fee model, to where it 
becomes transparent and the PBM is working with you to protect 
the interest of the plan members.
    Then we both seek to find the lowest net cost solution, and 
to move away from an older paradigm that only enriches those 
big three companies.
    Mrs. Houchin. Is vertical integration an issue?
    Mr. DuBose. Yes. Actually, I believe it is the bigger issue 
from spread pricing. Delinking is very important as well 
because it drives that vertical integration where they own the 
pharmacies, especially mail order, so they are essentially 
selling to themselves. When you do that, the spread pricing is 
really not that important.
    Mrs. Houchin. Should pharmacies and insurance companies be 
able to own PBMs?
    Mr. DuBose. Yes. In a free market if a pharmacy wishes to 
own a PBM, I do not--I am not opposed to that, but I do believe 
that PBMs should be a fiduciary, and they should understand 
that obligation.
    Mrs. Houchin. Should they be able to mandate that it is 
their PBM that must be used, or should be?
    Mr. DuBose. Absolutely not.
    Mrs. Houchin. Should they be required to note only be 
transparent, but be subject to oversight and accountability?
    Mr. DuBose. Absolutely.
    Mrs. Houchin. How would having some uniform standards in 
place for PBMs help drug pricing and just the overall 
marketplace in general?
    Mr. DuBose. The standards are incredibly important because 
that is where the employers, those plan sponsors, fall down. If 
you do not have transparency, you cannot see the data, it is so 
opaque you cannot craft the policy, which means you cannot 
craft good plan design. Then that is where the plan suffers and 
fails to meet the needs of the plan members.
    I believe transparency has to come first, and then with 
those prohibitions on those practices, then the right pathways 
align.
    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you. I appreciate your knowledge on the 
topic. I hope that this Congress we will continue to consider 
how we can address it, and improve not only drug prices and 
cost transparency, but the overall marketplace. I yield back my 
time.
    I would now like to recognize the Ranking Member for a 
closing statement. Mr. DeSaulnier, you are now recognized.
    Mr. DeSaulnier. Thank you. I want to thank the Chair and 
the Committee, and the witnesses as well for your testimony. 
Thanks for spending your time with us. Fifty years ago, 
Congress took action and passed the Employee Retirement Income 
Securities Act, or ERISA, to protect the interest of millions 
of workers and their families who receive retirement benefits 
and health care through their employer.
    As I noted at the beginning of this hearing, it is critical 
to understand the significance of job-based coverage here in 
the United States. Over 164 million workers and their families 
benefit from health care coverage they receive through their 
jobs. However, time and an ever-evolving workforce and the 
health care industry have revealed that ERISA has failed to 
live up to its promise for millions of Americans.
    Significant gaps in health care coverage and exorbitant 
costs for hospitals, physicians, and lifesaving prescription 
medications continue to squeeze workers out of their last 
dollar. Loopholes continue to allow large, unscrupulous 
insurers to engage in practices that raise costs for both 
workers and their employers.
    Democrats have worked tirelessly to strengthen ERISA, 
promote access to care, and lower health care prices, but there 
is still room for improvement, only if consumer protections 
remain in place, and become more efficient. I look forward to 
working with the majority to see if we can find a common 
interest to accomplish this.
    I welcome and hope for earnest engagement with Republican 
colleagues so we can fully support employers and workers and 
continue to build our economy from the bottom up and the middle 
out. I yield back.
    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you. I now recognize myself for closing 
remarks. On behalf of the 153 million Americans whose health 
care benefits rely on ERISA, I think we have certainly learned 
a lot today about how we can improve the law. It is clear to me 
there are areas where government should get out of the way, 
like streamlining paperwork requirements.
    ERISA was created to reduce the regulatory burden that 
would arise from complying with various State laws. We should 
not replace regulatory relief with more regulation. In other 
areas, clarity is needed. I am particularly interested in how 
increased transparency will provide employers, and ultimately 
patients, with cost information for health care services.
    In the age of technology, it is time we move past these 
unknown and unexplained high health care costs. Employers and 
patients both deserve to know the price of care. Congress 
should protect the ERISA preemption, so that multi-State 
employers can continue to easily offer benefits across State 
lines.
    Protecting this provision will preserve the private health 
insurance system and shield American from devolving into a 
single payer system. Thank you certainly to our witnesses for 
your time, and for your insightful testimony. Without 
objection, there being no further business, the Subcommittee 
stands adjourned.
