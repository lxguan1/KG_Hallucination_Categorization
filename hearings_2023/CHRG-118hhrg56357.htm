       IP LITIGATION AND THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION

                              ----------                              


                         Tuesday, July 23, 2024

                        House of Representatives

           Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and

                              the Internet

                       Committee on the Judiciary

                             Washington, DC

    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:07 a.m., in 
Room 2141, Rayburn House Office Building, the Hon. Darrell Issa 
[Chair of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Members present: Representatives Issa, Massie, Fitzgerald, 
Cline, Kiley, Johnson, Ross, Lofgren, and Ivey.
    Mr. Issa. The Subcommittee will come to order. Without 
objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a recess at any 
time.
    We welcome everyone here today for a hearing on 
Intellectual Property Litigation and the U.S. International 
Trade Commission. I will note that we will work as 
expeditiously as possible, but we may have a short break during 
the first round of votes later this morning.
    I will now recognize myself for an opening statement.
    Today, we are examining the U.S. International Trade 
Commission, a forum of adjudication of, among other things, 
intellectual property cases. We want to focus on how IP 
litigation at the ITC fits into the overall IP system of the 
United States' IP-related issues raised by the ITC docket and 
recent developments relevant to the ITC and IP litigation. That 
is a complex way of saying that, in fact, after the eBay 
decision, the ITC has clearly become a place for the equivalent 
of injunctive relief, also known as exclusion.
    First, I want to thank the Ways and Means Full Committee 
Chair Jason Smith and Trade Subcommittee Chair Adrian Smith for 
graciously working with the Committee so that we could hold 
this hearing. Although this is not a joint hearing, there will 
be questions asked today specifically that were brought to us 
by the Ways and Means Committee, the Committee of Jurisdiction 
over the ITC.
    The ITC's mission, and I will repeat this many times 
throughout the day, is vital. The ability to enforce on behalf 
of American businesses and consumers is a role the ITC was 
formed for and needs to continue doing. The ITC focuses on 
investigating unfair trade practices and IP infringement is 
essential for maintaining the integrity of our market.
    Clearly, there were times when the ITC uniquely has the 
ability to act quickly and to stop the importation of 
counterfeit or unfair competition including patent-infringing 
goods. For example, on finding infringement, the ITC can grant 
exclusion orders and they do so quickly with only limited 
exemptions for granting them, and they do so because the 
companies or the individuals are usually outside the United 
States and anything but an exclusion order would be 
ineffective.
    However, recently, there has been a growing chorus of 
voices suggesting that the ITC is being misused for purposes 
other than its intent. Some stakeholders argue the ITC IP 
litigation system is being leveraged in ways that may distort 
the broader IP system. That is why the goal of today's hearing 
is to elevate the ITC's role and effectiveness in the overall 
landscape.
    We understand that the ITC's impact on IP litigation and 
enforcement is vital for ensuring the system remains balanced 
and effective. We must ensure the ITC continues to serve its 
role to maintain fairness, innovation, and competitiveness. 
This hearing is an opportunity to delve into those areas.
    I want to reiterate: The ITC, in the opinion of the Chair, 
for a very long time, has from time to time been misused. In my 
own home district, Qualcomm v. Broadcom, two multibillion 
leading corporations, found themselves before the ITC. Why? 
Because it was a convenient venue. Would Broadcom support the 
idea that the ITC should have had some limitations? Yes, except 
it benefited them. Would Qualcomm support the ITC needs to be 
limited? Yes, except when it benefits them.
    That is exactly why Congress must act. Corporations, large 
and small, want to see the best use of the ITC and, in the 
opinion of the Chair, a 100 percent retention of their 
authority over companies or individuals that are outside the 
financial reach of the United States.
    With that, I yield to the Ranking Member for his opening 
statement.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chair. The International Trade 
Commission was established as an executive agency by Congress 
in 1916 to oversee the importation of goods from around the 
world. Over 100 years later, it continues to protect the U.S. 
economy, our workers, and our innovators. Few know that the ITC 
has been around even longer than that.
    The agency we know today is the culmination of a series of 
legislative efforts that began at our Nation's founding. Our 
forefathers understood, as we do today, that while the 
importation of goods from overseas can strengthen our financial 
position on the world stage and enhance our access to 
innovations around the world, the wrong products can cause 
grievous harm to our streams of commerce.
    American laborers, manufacturing hubs, and intellectual 
property owners all have a vested interest in ensuring that 
when products are imported from overseas, the company doing so 
respects the laws of our Nation. This means that our country 
also has a vested interest in importing products that do not 
violate patents, U.S. patents, trademarks, and copyright laws, 
products that have not been produced in violation of U.S. human 
rights laws, and products that do not unduly interfere with 
vital American manufacturing sectors.
    The ITC is the designated venue for weighing such alleged 
violations. While our colleagues on Ways and Means have 
jurisdiction over the ITC and its dealings, we on House 
Judiciary have a particular interest in the proper functioning 
of the agency's adjudications because of its impact on 
intellectual property cases relevant to this Subcommittee's 
work. Under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the United 
States, through the ITC, is permitted to investigate and 
exclude imported goods that infringe on U.S. intellectual 
property rights.
    Unlike in District Courts, the ITC does not issue damages. 
Instead, it is required to take into consideration public 
interest factors to determine whether to issue a remedy such as 
an exclusion order. These factors include the impact of the 
importation of public health and welfare, competition in the 
U.S. economy, production of competitive articles in the U.S., 
and the best interests of American consumers.
    Today, I expect to hear some of my colleagues argue that 
the differences between patent litigation in the District 
Courts and the ITC mean that the latter is unfair, that we need 
to change how the ITC does business and that various shadowy 
figures are using the ITC to take advantage of the system in 
U.S. business.
    I respectfully disagree. At its core, a patent right is the 
right to exclude, making the ITC a particularly efficient means 
by which to enforce the fundamental purpose of a patent. 
Between exorbitant costs, procedural hurdles, and long wait 
times, it has become difficult for a small business owner to 
hold and enforce a patent here in the United States.
    It is unsurprising to me that the same folks who say our 
patent system is doing just fine as is, would also like to 
reign in the ability of the ITC to take and decide patent 
disputes. What we must remember is that the ITC is a separate 
system designed for a different purpose. ITC only issues trade 
remedies. It doesn't issue determinations of validity or for 
injunctive relief and is only available to a smaller segment of 
the patent-owning population. Section 337 investigations are 
designed to reach determinations quickly because businesses on 
both sides of the disagreement have an interest in speedy 
resolution to determine whether a product can be imported into 
the United States.
    On the specific topic of remedies, exclusion orders are 
narrower than injunctions in District Courts and limited to the 
importation of infringing products from overseas. Some argue 
that patent owners are going to the ITC for relief because it 
has become the only way to prohibit a company from making an 
infringing product available while a District Court case is 
ongoing.
    I agree that patent owners should not be forced to resort 
to the limited ITC remedies to solve issues in our patent 
litigation. That is why I am looking forward to joining 
Congresswoman Dean later this year when she introduces a bill 
to restore the availability of preliminary injunctions to 
patent litigants.
    I want to thank Chair Issa for his ongoing commitment to 
bipartisanship even when at times we disagree on policy. This 
Subcommittee's ability to hold serious hearings that delve into 
complicated topics is unmatched and I am grateful to have Chair 
Issa as a partner across the aisle.
    Thank you also to our witnesses for being here today and I 
look forward to hearing your testimony and I yield back the 
balance of my time.
    Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. Without objection, all 
other opening statements will be included in the record. I now 
would like to introduce our witnesses.

answered in the affirmative.
    As is the policy and we probably have all seen it on C-
SPAN, your entire written statements and intended oral 
statements will be placed in the record. We only ask that you 
try to limit yourself on or very close to five minutes so that 
we have time for a round of questioning, notwithstanding votes 
that are inevitably going to take us away.
    I now recognize Ms. Hairston for her opening remarks.

                   STATEMENT OF TARA HAIRSTON

    Ms. Hairston. Chair Issa, Ranking Member Johnson, and the 
distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Tara 
Hairston. I am Senior Director of Technology Policy at the 
Alliance for Automotive Innovation which represents the 
automakers producing most of the vehicles sold in the United 
States, and other players within the automotive ecosystem.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify at this hearing to 
share the auto industry's perspective on intellectual property 
rights' complaints and the U.S. International Trade Commission.
    Let me say at the outset, the auto industry knows the value 
of intellectual property rights to innovation. As significant 
rights holders, auto companies support robust legal protections 
for intellectual property rights. However, the auto industry 
today faces frequent and costly lawsuits alleging intellectual 
property rights infringement, many of which are filed by 
nonpracticing entities making spurious assertions. This is 
happening more and more frequently, and it is a real problem. 
Auto companies want to ensure that intellectual property rights 
are properly granted and not being used for anticompetitive 
purposes.
    My full written testimony expands on the following 
essential points:

    <bullet> LFirst, auto companies support the ITC Section 337 
investigative authority.
    <bullet> LSecond, Section 337 disputes involving auto 
companies have evolved in recent years.
    <bullet> LThird, the auto industry is increasingly 
concerned about the use of Section 337 by nonpracticing 
entities or NPEs.
    <bullet> LFourth, the auto industry supports ITC reform.

    The auto industry agrees with and supports the intent of 
Section 337 to protect domestic industry from unfair foreign 
competition. Auto companies have filed their own Section 337 
complaints at the ITC, when imported products infringe their 
intellectual property rights and/or when there was unfair 
competition. Auto companies have also been the targets of 
Section 337 investigations including those involving abusive 
claims by NPEs.
    Historically, Section 337 auto disputes dealt with 
importing mechanical and electromechanical articles, but now 
they involve technologies like semiconductors, 
microelectronics, and artificial intelligence. These modern 
technologies have led to a major increase in the number of 
patents in the automotive space which, in turn, has resulted in 
more patent infringement lawsuits targeting auto companies both 
in District Court and at the ITC. At the same time, auto 
companies are incorporating more technologies that are not 
unique to the industry into their products which also expands 
the number of patented technologies on which ITC complaints can 
be filed.
    A significant number of these cases have been brought by 
NPEs. NPEs regularly bring Section 337 complaints to the ITC 
often with the intent to gain unfair leverage against an auto 
company and force a company to settle pending litigation in 
another venue. They often succeed. The possibility that the ITC 
will issue an exclusion order makes the ITC an appealing venue 
for this purpose. This activity diverts important automotive 
resources from innovation and manufacturing to expensive 
litigation and settlements.
    Complaints filed by NPEs at the ITC frequently relate to 
small dollar parts within a vehicle. A potential violation of 
one patent could result in an import ban on an entire vehicle. 
Shared platforms across a single automaker or shared suppliers 
with components to multiple automakers could result in the 
inclusion of multiple vehicles.
    Since the primary enforcement remedy available to the ITC 
is an exclusion order that applies to the entire vehicle, auto 
companies are frequently forced into settling even when the 
merits of the complaint are weak. These exclusion orders hurt 
manufacturers, suppliers, customers, and overall competition by 
reducing consumer choice, discouraging innovation, and 
increasing costs for companies compared with others in the 
marketplace. This is why ITC reform is necessary so that the 
ITC can focus on its mission of protecting domestic industry 
and so that it is no longer misused by NPEs to hire 
manufacturers, workers, and consumers.
    The automotive industry supports the following reforms:

    <bullet> LStrengthen the domestic industry requirement to 
focus on production-based licensing, not revenue-based 
licensing;
    <bullet> LReinforce consideration of the public interest 
throughout a Section 337 investigation;
    <bullet> LIdentify potentially dispositive issues that 
should be decided by ALJs within a 100 days of instituting an 
investigation;
    <bullet> LLimit the issuance of exclusion orders when an 
allegedly infringing component is less than or equal to 10 
percent of the overall product; and
    <bullet> LMandate disclosure on real parties and interests 
by complainants and respondents.

These reforms would go a long way to making the ITC a less-
attractive venue for NPEs, seeking to force settlements in 
separate litigation.
    The Members of the Subcommittee, the ITC needs reform. This 
is an essential agency that advises the President and Congress 
on trade issues, but it is being misused by NPEs. This hurts 
both consumers and manufacturers. In our view, Congress should 
require the ITC to demonstrate that any exclusion order 
preventing the importation of a product into the U.S. is in the 
public interest, but this is not the case today. The Alliance 
for Automotive Innovation looks forward to working with 
Congress on meaningful reforms to the ITC. Thank you and I am 
happy to answer any questions.

    Mr. Issa. Thank you. Mr. Korte, you will be the last 
witness before we break for about 30 minutes total to do four 
votes on floor. Please proceed.

                     STATEMENT OF SAM KORTE

    Mr. Korte. Thank you, Chair Issa, Ranking Member Johnson, 
and the distinguished Members of the Subcommittee. My name is 
Sam Korte, and I am a Patent Attorney with Garmin.
    Garmin pioneered the GPS industry. Some of you may be 
familiar with our car navigation devices, smart watches, and 
fish-finders, but we also make products as diverse as aircraft 
auto-landing systems and Doppler radars. We are a global 
company employing over 7,000 people in the United States 
including thousands of highly skilled engineers. We have three 
large manufacturing facilities in Florida, Oregon, and Kansas. 
Intellectual property is very important to Garmin. We hold 
thousands of patents on our products and are committed to a 
strong patent system. A balanced patent system is not only 
necessary, but also a key factor in our ability to grow our 
U.S. business and employ thousands of Americans.
    In my testimony, I will address three issues:

    <bullet> LHow the ITC has shifted from this root as a 
specialized forum for addressing international trade disputes 
to a super power and super expensive District Court accessible 
to anyone with a patent.
    <bullet> LHow ITC 337 investigations often target American 
manufacturers impacting the design and manufacture of products 
within the United States, resulting in a high cost to everyone 
involved.
    <bullet> LHow Garmin, as an American manufacturer, has 
experienced these effects firsthand and has recommendations for 
Congress to address these issues.

    Section 337, dating back to its roots with the Tariff 
Commission was never intended to involve routine patent 
lawsuits, but over the years, through statutory changes by 
Congress and the ITC's own interpretation of the law, the ITC 
has become a forum accessible to almost anyone with a patent. 
In many ways, the ITC is now no different than any Federal 
Court with one critical exception.
    Exclusion orders which bar all imports of infringing 
products are automatic if the ITC finds a patent violation. 
District Courts, however, only employ the nuclear option of an 
injunction by carefully weighing equitable factors related to 
the parties and the public interest. In almost all cases, ITC 
exclusion orders against losing companies take effect soon 
after the ITC issues its final determination. Assuming a losing 
company is going to remain in business, it must either pay 
whatever ransom is demanded by the patent holder or go through 
the expense of changing its products. This is all, in addition, 
to the cost of defending of parallel lawsuits on the exact same 
technology with the exact same people in Federal District 
Court.
    Our cost to defend an ITC investigation is multiple to 
costs of defending a case in Federal District Court, in some 
cases exceeding $10 million. None of this is lost on those 
looking to harm U.S. manufacturers. Patent trolls, or 
nonpracticing entities if you prefer, have targeted Garmin at 
the ITC over basic commodities like computer memory and 
microprocessors. Because these components are central to 
Garmin's U.S. product manufacturing process, a loss at the ITC 
could shutter our critical American factories unless Garmin, of 
course, pay whatever ransom was demanded.
    Congress has many options to address these problems with 
the ITC.
    First, Section 337's domestic industry language has 
confused the ITC and the Federal Circuit since it was last 
revised by Congress in 1988. Clarifying the language regarding 
domestic industry such as by requiring a patent owner to show 
that it has assisted in bringing a product to market through 
licensing or other efforts would ensure that the ITC is not 
merely functioning as another Federal Court.
    Today, a patent owner can fabricate domestic industry by 
sitting on its patent for decades, suing a manufacturer that 
independently developed its products, chiefly licensing its 
patents to the manufacturer it just sued, and then racing to 
the ITC to file a 337 complaint against the rest of the 
established industry. This practice should end.
    Second, Section 337 could also be revised to address 
automatic exclusion orders by requiring the ITC to engage in a 
more detailed analysis of the public interest including 
weighing the impact of an exclusion order on a U.S. company, 
American workers, and the public at large.
    Finally, it is not lost on Garmin that the statutory 
purpose of the ITC is to protect American domestic industry, 
companies just like Garmin, with factories and places like 
Florida, Oregon, and Kansas. The ITC is now routinely used by 
foreign companies, sometimes funded by their own governments to 
disrupt American innovation and production. It is impossible to 
tell the true party behind an ITC investigation and ITC does 
not ask. This distortion of the ITC's purpose undermines the 
entire congressional intent behind Section 337 and poses a 
threat to the ability of American companies to compete on the 
global stage. Congress is best suited to address this problem.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to present testimony on 
this important issue facing American companies. I look forward 
to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Korte follows:]
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] 

    
    Mr. Issa. Thank you. As promised, we will now take a 
hopefully very short recess. We stand in recess.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Issa. The Committee will reconvene. When we left off, 
we had heard from two witnesses. We are now hearing from 
Professor Contreras. Yes, the mic both has to be turned on and 
held as close as possible. It is more effective that way. Thank 
you.

                STATEMENT OF JORGE L. CONTRERAS

    Mr. Contreras. There we go. Thank you for that.
    Mr. Chair, the distinguished Members of the Committee, my 
name is Jorge Contreras and I am a Professor of intellectual 
property law at the University of Utah.
    In the years following World War I European manufacturers 
were accused of flooding U.S. markets with cheap goods that 
violated U.S. intellectual property rights. In response 
Congress authorized what became the International Trade 
Commission to investigate unfair acts pertaining to U.S. 
imports including the importation of infringing articles.
    This authority was needed to fill gaps in then-existing 
law. For example, the U.S. Patent Act did not then offer a 
remedy against the sale of noninfringing products made abroad 
using processes patented in the U.S., nor could U.S. courts 
hearing patent cases assert jurisdiction over foreign producers 
of infringing goods.
    Today more than a century later the world is a different 
place. The Patent Act has been amended to prohibit the sale of 
goods made abroad using infringing processes. Likewise, 
overseas firms routinely establish subsidiaries in the U.S. 
bringing them squarely within the jurisdiction of the U.S. 
courts. As a result, in 2022-2023 only six percent of ITC 
patent cases lacked a domestic respondent subject to personal 
jurisdiction in the U.S.
    So, what about the other 94 percent of ITC patent cases? 
Ironically, they are brought against domestic companies who 
offer American consumers lower prices by manufacturing products 
overseas. They are brought by nonpracticing entities seeking to 
pressure manufacturers to enter into monetary settlements. Most 
surprisingly nearly a third of ITC patent cases are brought by 
foreign companies seeking to prevent U.S. companies from 
importing their own products for sale to U.S. consumers.
    So, patent asserters will tell you that the ITC is a 
wonderful thing, that it affords them exclusionary remedies 
that are no longer available in the courts, that it is fast, 
that its judges and staff have unprecedented expertise in 
patent matters. So, whatever the merit of these assertions, and 
some of them are somewhat questionable, they do not avail.
    Notwithstanding any tactical litigation advantages the ITC 
may offer to patent holders, there is little justification for 
the maintenance at an annual taxpayer expense of nearly $40 
million of a duplicate patent litigation system in the U.S.
    With respect to patent matters, the ITC is duplicative. In 
the last two years 83 percent of all ITC patent cases had 
parallel proceedings in District Court often involving the same 
parties, the same patents, and the same infringing product. The 
result is costly and inconsistent parallel litigation.
    We have recently seen examples in which patents are found 
invalid at the ITC and then asserted again in court. We have 
also seen the ITC extend its reach even beyond the patent 
statute blocking the importation of noninfringing goods that 
might someday be used for infringing purposes.
    The truth is that the ITC offers patent holders a second 
bite at the apple, an unprecedented opportunity to prevail in 
one venue on claims that were rejected in another. This 
privilege, while understandably attractive to patent holders, 
is virtually unknown in any other form of litigation, from 
medical malpractice to breach of contract.
    So, what should be done? Over the years a range of 
proposals have been made to reign in the ITC's ever-expanding 
patent jurisdiction, all to no avail. This month in its 
landmark decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo the Supreme Court 
issued a clear message to the Nation that the power of 
administrative agencies in the U.S. has gone too far and that 
the authority of these agencies must yield to that of our 
constitutionally empowered courts. As such, the time is right 
for Congress to reconsider the patent jurisdiction of the ITC.
    A few potential corrective measures might include:
    (1) Restricting ITC actions to parties over which the 
Federal Courts lack jurisdiction;
    (2) narrowing the definition of the U.S. domestic market to 
exclude patent assertion and licensing by parties that don't 
actually make or sell products in the U.S.;
    (3) requiring the ITC to follow judicial precedent when 
issuing remedies for patent infringement; and
    (4) enabling the courts to work directly with the Customs 
and Border Protection Agency to prevent the importation of 
patent-infringing goods as they already do with products that 
infringe U.S. copyrights and trademarks.
    With one or more of these straightforward measures Congress 
can correct the ITC's course to focus again on its primary 
mission of protecting U.S. markets from unfair foreign imports. 
Thank you for your time.

    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] 

    Mr. Issa. Thank you. Professor Doane?

                   STATEMENT OF MICHAEL DOANE

    Mr. Doane. Chair Issa, Ranking Member Johnson, and the 
distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this 
opportunity to speak with you today about intellectual property 
litigation before the U.S. International Trade Commission.
    My name is Michael Doane and I'm a Law Professor at the 
University of Akron School of Law where I teach intellectual 
property law including a course on intellectual property 
practice at the U.S. International Trade Commission. Before I 
became an academic, I was a lawyer specializing in ITC 
litigation and general counsel for a small technology startup 
company. I have viewed Section 337 investigations for over 30 
years from the prospective of the litigator and in-house 
counsel and now as an academic.
    During that time Congress strengthened Section 337 to make 
it an effective tool to address infringement of U.S. 
intellectual property rights by unfair imports. Congress was 
particularly concerned with protecting American innovators such 
as startups, universities, and individual inventors from 
foreign infringers. Congress should be cautious of proposals to 
restrict access to relief under Section 337 to ensure that they 
do not harm this important sector of the United States' 
innovation economy.
    Small startups face many challenges when bringing a new 
product to market. These include not only creating the patented 
technology but also developing a product that embodies the 
technology, obtaining financing to develop and bring that 
product to market, creating manufacturing capability, 
developing a distribution network, and ultimately finding 
customers. This is all expensive and time-consuming, 
particularly if the startup company is faced with infringing 
products sometimes before it is even able to fully develop and 
market its own product.
    Quite frequently, indeed in almost every circumstance these 
infringing products are imported into the United States. 
Section 337 provides startups with the most direct and 
efficient remedy for this problem. Efforts to limit access to 
relief under Section 337 will ultimately do more harm than 
good.
    Section 337, as has been noted, is a trade remedy statute, 
not an intellectual property statute, which was designed to 
address unfair imports and is one of the most effective 
mechanisms for defending U.S. intellectual property rights from 
imported infringing products, particularly from China.
    Section 337 provides many advantages: Expert administrative 
law judges, comparatively expedited proceedings, interim 
jurisdiction, and effective relief. It is perhaps this last 
advantage in the form of an exclusion order that is the most 
significant. Because of this remedy Section 337 is frequently 
the most effective, if not the only option for addressing two 
specific challenges that startup companies face: (1) Patent 
holdout and (2) knockoff products offered in online 
marketplaces.
    Patent holdout is when a large well-funded infringer uses 
its size and market dominance to ignore an IPR owner's 
infringement claims, imposes its own product on the product, 
and usually seeking to litigate the IPR owner into oblivion. 
Without a Section 337 exclusion order small entities could be 
forced in effect to license their technology to large importers 
at a reasonable royalty as determined by a District Court after 
years of litigation.
    As to knockoff products, numerous infringers, usually 
Chinese, offer their products in large online marketplaces. 
Infringing goods are offered by countless difficult-to-identify 
entities. Such entities are not burdened by the expense of 
developing technology or creating a new product, simply create 
a low-quality copy that is sold at a discount. When challenged 
such online entities easily disappear and reemerge elsewhere 
under a different name to continue selling in the online 
marketplaces.
    Policing online marketplaces to take down infringing 
products would be substantially more difficult if not 
impossible without Section 337. It is important that small 
entities have an avenue through which infringing products can 
be removed from the marketplace in a more efficient manner.
    Monetary damages, if they can even be obtained, are 
certainly important, but the ability to develop and market 
one's own product free from unfair competition from infringing 
imported products, particularly for a small startup company, is 
infinitely more important. When faced with infringing imports 
the high cost of potential litigation may effectively deter a 
small company from seeking to enforce its IP rights 
particularly against a well-funded infringer.
    Section 337 investigations, while also a potentially 
expensive endeavor, offer an effective and expedited remedy if 
successful. This is what Section 337 provides. In fact, 
Congress expressly amended 337 to make this relief more easily 
available to small innovators. As Senator Frank Lautenberg, one 
of the drafters of these amendments, noted, smaller businesses 
should not be denied the right to seek relief merely because 
they may have made smaller financial investments than large 
companies in developing or exploiting an intellectual property 
right.
    Section 337 provides unique and effective relief against 
imported infringing products. Any effort to limit access to 
Section 337 will ultimately negatively impact those that 
Section 337 was expressly amended to protect and should be 
carefully considered. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Doane follows:]
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] 

    
    Mr. Issa. Thank you. I want to thank all the witnesses.
    With that, we are going to go--there are a lot of people 
who have various other requirements, so I am going to try to go 
to people in the order in which they can ask questions. So 
don't be surprised when it skips around on both sides.
    With that, we go to the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. 
Massie.
    Mr. Massie. I thank the Chair.
    Ms. Hairston, Mr. Korte, and Professor Contreras, you all 
mentioned this thing called public interest. Do any of you want 
to explain to me what public interest is in the context of 
deciding a patent dispute?
    Ms. Hairston, what do you mean by public interest, that the 
ITC should consider public interest?
    Ms. Hairston. Thank you for the question, Congressman 
Massie. We would say that in the--public interest means that it 
is for the four factors that have been articulated in the ITC 
statute in terms of public health and welfare, competitive 
conditions, and other factors should be considered when looking 
at the public interest, that it should not be left solely to 
the ITC to determine that potentially infringing or 
noninfringing goods would constitute a violation of public 
interest.
    Mr. Massie. Mr. Korte, how would you describe the public 
interest consideration that you proposed?
    Mr. Korte. Yes, thank you, Congressman. So, public interest 
should be tied to the statutory purpose of the International 
Trade Commission, which is to protect American domestic 
markets. The ITC should not be taking any action, let alone an 
exclusion order, if it's damaging American industry. That 
should be the sort of analysis the ITC should do under Section 
337. That should analysis--that analysis should include what's 
already in the statute in addition to other requirements like 
the impact on American workers, American factories, and the 
American industry at large.
    Mr. Massie. Ms. Hairston, one of the remedies you said is, 
if there is 10 percent of the product that is infringing, or 
deemed to be infringing, assumed to be infringing, that you 
should still be able to import that product. Is that true?
    Ms. Hairston. Yes, Congressman Massie. That is a number 
that--the 10 percent threshold is something that we suggested 
in terms of to inviting conversation and dialog. Yes, a 10 
percent of the overall product is attributable to the allegedly 
infringing product. We believe an exclusion order should not be 
issued.
    Mr. Massie. OK. Let me just say something: I am appalled 
that you guys are here testifying like this. This is shameless. 
You are like here trying to divvy up the goods of the American 
inventor. What you are saying is that if you are only stealing 
10 percent of the product, let us keep importing it. Let us 
just keep stealing it as long as the theft is at a low enough 
level.
    Then this public interest notion. This is a communist term. 
What you are saying is it may be in the public interest to let 
somebody keep infringing. The Constitution guarantees the right 
to exclude somebody from infringing. It doesn't say that the 
government can come in and figure out what a fair price to pay 
is for that infringement, yet that is what all three of you, 
even you, Professor, are suggesting with this term public 
interest, because we have seen it used in the past.
    Really, I am just appalled that you have no shame in saying 
that you should be able to steal a product from an inventor in 
the United States, have it manufactured overseas in China, 
import that as a knockoff and if you are only stealing 10 
percent of the idea.
    Professor Doane, Professor Contreras suggested it seemed 
like that this ITC concept is archaic, that it is no longer 
needed, it has been supplanted by other means. Then, I hear you 
say, well, Congress has actually updated it. Mr. Korte said 
that the intent of Congress needs to be clarified. The intent 
of Congress is in the Constitution. We don't want you stealing 
things, getting them made overseas, ripping off American 
inventors, and then bringing it in here and selling cheap 
knockoffs to Americans that are faulty.
    Professor Doane, is the ITC obsolete?
    Mr. Doane. Absolutely not, Congressman. As I said, it was 
specifically amended for the purpose of at least small 
innovators in 1988 and 1994 to make it easier for small 
inventors/universities to bring these cases. I think that's an 
important task of the commission.
    Mr. Massie. Let me give you an example of whose hand has 
been caught in the cookie jar here. Apple saw this pulse 
oximeter technology. Said, oh, let's put that in an Apple 
Watch. They stole the idea, stole all the people that developed 
it from the original company that was making these in the 
United States, went to China, had this cheap CRAP made, and 
tried to bring it in and the ITC said you are infringing. Are 
you aware of this case, Professor Doane?
    Mr. Doane. Yes, sir, I am.
    Mr. Massie. That seems like that is the way this should 
work when you have got a big corporation ripping off a smaller 
corporation and trying to get the CRAP made over in China 
instead of made here. Doesn't the ITC have a role to play 
there, Professor Doane?
    Mr. Doane. I think that is specifically one of the 
important reasons for the commission particularly in the 
circumstance of a small inventor like--a small innovation 
company like Masimo going up against a large importer of a 
product to be able to after years of litigation--they've been 
in litigation for I believe almost 10 years in District Courts 
and the only relief they've been able to obtain is this ITC 
exclusion order.
    Mr. Massie. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Issa. Thank you. I would caution all Members if you are 
going to use acronyms like CRAP, please define what the letters 
stand for.
    With that, we recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. 
Johnson.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Professor Doane, this Subcommittee has a keen bipartisan 
interest in preventing the government of China from stealing 
U.S. intellectual property. How does the ITC prevent China from 
ongoing infringement of the property of U.S. inventors and 
would weakening the ITC help China import infringing goods into 
the United States? If so, why or how?
    Mr. Doane. I believe weakening Section 337 would certainly 
benefit China in particular. If you look at where the source of 
most challenge products come from, infringing products, by far 
I believe you would find they come from China. They come in a 
variety of forms. As I mentioned, all these little companies 
that come in, manufactured cheap knockoffs of U.S. products and 
sell them in online marketplaces and just end up dominating the 
marketplace.
    Or in the circumstance of bigger companies that have spent 
billions of dollars building infrastructure in China to 
manufacture there rather than manufacturing in the United 
States. In that circumstance a Section 337 exclusion order 
might be the only way a small company can get any kind of 
relief after extensive litigation against a large well-
established importer of what is essentially Chinese products.
    Mr. Johnson. Professor Doane, we have heard the arguments 
of some in the room who want to change the ITC and some in 
Congress have introduced legislation to amend the domestic 
industry requirement to make it more difficult to petition the 
ITC to investigate a trade violation. In your written statement 
you wrote that the ITC should not be amended by Congress. Could 
you explain to us why the ITC is functioning as intended as it 
is now?
    Mr. Doane. I believe the ITC does takes its mandates 
seriously as to meeting the domestic industry requirement. I 
think that in the face of the criticism, particularly involving 
alleged patent MPEs, they've taken a lot of steps to try and 
make sure that there is a substantial domestic industry.
    In cases where the complaint comes in with a weak domestic 
industry in the complaint, they will frequently place these 
into what's called a 100-day proceeding to determine whether 
there is a sufficient domestic industry to go forward. So, I 
think they've put mechanisms in place to try and weed out 
potentially problematic cases.
    Also, I think to the extent that there's a claim of a flood 
of MPEs coming to the commission, I don't think there's--the 
data has born that out. There are certainly some that come 
there, but I think the commission has taken steps in its own 
review and in use of things like the 100-day proceeding to make 
sure that cases like that, if it's merited, are weeded out. So, 
I don't think amending the statute would add anything to what 
the commission has already down to make sure that the statute 
is not abused.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you. Some have argued that Congress 
should revise Section 337 to effectively make it harder for 
U.S. companies to obtain exclusion orders at the ITC for 
infringement of their patent rights especially against U.S. 
companies, or other U.S. companies.
    As you know, since the Supreme Court's 2006 decision in 
eBay patent owners have struggled to obtain injunctions in 
Federal District Court with some studies showing a 90-percent 
decline in courts granting injunctions in cases where patents 
were found infringed. What is the difference between patent 
cases in the ITC and in Federal District Court and why are both 
tracks critical to protecting and incentivizing U.S. 
innovation?
    Mr. Doane. Well, I think Section 337 is critical because--
in large the remedy it provides. It gives the patent owner the 
ability to say, no, you cannot use my patent. I can't be forced 
to license it to you for a monetary award. You have to--I can 
keep your product out of the United States.
    The difference between the ITC and District Court right now 
is the fact that to obtain an exclusion order you do not need 
to establish injury, and that is there for the simple reason 
that Congress decided that it should be such. Congress 
expressly removed injury from the statute in 1988 after almost 
a decade of hearings on it, and because it felt that too many 
U.S. companies were losing because of requiring them to show 
injury. It was felt that infringement of your patent is injury 
enough. So, the injury was expressly removed by Congress, which 
is why eBay does not apply to Section 337 investigations.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you.
    Mr. Issa. Thank you. For the record, the acronym is Chinese 
Rip-off of American Products (CRAP). Just want to make sure 
that we understand that it was an acronym.
    With that, we go to Mr. Fitzgerald.
    Mr. Johnson. Mr. Chair, if I might--as for unanimous 
consent to enter into the record a letter from Conservatives 
for Property Rights, a letter from the Council for Innovation 
Promotion, and also an op-ed in The Hill entitled, ``The 
Unheralded Agency Protecting America's Innovation Edge.''
    Mr. Issa. Of course. Gladly. Without objection. So ordered.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you.
    Mr. Issa. Mr. Fitzgerald?
    Mr. Fitzgerald. Thank you, Chair.
    Professor Contreras, I introduced a bill, the Prohibiting 
Adversarial Patents Act. What we were trying to get at is it 
would prohibit companies on certain national security-related 
sanctions lists from licensing or asserting their U.S. patents, 
much as we discussed here this afternoon.
    To your knowledge are adversaries like China using forums 
like ITC to assert U.S. patents that generate revenue in 
circumvention of U.S. sanctions?
    Mr. Contreras. Congressman, I'm not aware of any concerted 
effort by the Chinese government in that respect. Certainly, 
companies from many different countries are able to utilize the 
ITC against U.S. companies and against other foreign companies 
if they do so through their U.S. subsidiaries, which almost 
every foreign company of any size has today, which does make 
the ITC a forum available to foreign companies controlled by 
whoever to take advantage of U.S. manufacturers.
    Mr. Fitzgerald. Right. I don't think we are concerned about 
some of our friends, but adversaries like China using patent 
assertion entities to bring infringement suits that generate 
revenue in circumvention of U.S. sanctions. So, is there 
anybody out there that have already demonstrated that they are 
moving in that direction, I guess is maybe a broader way of 
asking the question. Do you see any of these activity?
    Mr. Contreras. I'm not aware of a specific national 
security type of circumvention that's going on at the ITC. My 
other copanelists may be.
    Mr. Fitzgerald. OK. Mr. Korte, please explain kind of 
briefly how ITC rules of procedure defer from U.S. District 
Courts and why they often lead to higher cost for litigation, 
right?
    Mr. Korte. Yes, thank you, Congressman, for the question. 
So, there's two main areas where ITC procedure drives up cost. 
First, in U.S. District Court District Court Judges often 
manage their docket through motion practice, motion dismisses, 
and summary judgment motions. These motions before trial often 
resolve the case or lead to a settlement.
    At the ITC typically in a hearing none of these motions are 
decided until the morning before the trial. So, very few ITC 
investigations settle before the trial. The ITC noted this in 
their last budget request that they have increased workload 
because almost no ITC 337 investigations are settling. That 
drives up costs because every case is going to trial.
    The second main way that ITC cases drive up costs is the 
exclusion order. If you are a company either making a product 
in the United States or importing a product, you have to 
prepare in advance for that exclusion order in the event that 
you lose by designing your products, by changing your product 
supply lines, and by changing your inventory levels. That all 
adds incredible cost on top of the standard cost that you would 
face in a parallel lawsuit in Federal District Court.
    Mr. Fitzgerald. Yes, so ITC litigation kind of--the costs 
associated with it, which is probably difficult to put a hard 
number on, but there are so many different steps in that suit 
that you are engaged on a regular basis. I am sure the bills 
are just astronomical after a while for somebody involved in 
this, right?
    Mr. Korte. Yes. They're multiples of two, three, and four 
times the cost of a patent lawsuit in Federal Court where those 
lawsuits are already one of the most expensive activities on 
earth. Some years our ITC investigation defense costs are by 
far the biggest line item on our legal budget globally.
    Mr. Fitzgerald. Just really quick, Professor Contreras, 
when an entity brings a complaint to the ITC under Section 337, 
are they required--do they have to disclose who is funding 
their complaint? Is that something that is disclosed along the 
way?
    Mr. Contreras. No, they don't. There's a lot of ambiguity 
around who is behind some of these entities, many of which are 
names that you wouldn't recognize at all. Their sole purpose is 
bringing these actions.
    Mr. Fitzgerald. Because of the lack of disclosure there are 
some risks there, right, I am sure.
    Mr. Contreras. Absolutely. Absolutely. It could go back to 
the other question that you asked previously. It could be a 
pure corporate maneuver. It could be a governmental maneuver. 
We just don't know.
    Mr. Fitzgerald. Yes. Thank you. I yield back, Chair.
    Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman.
    We now go to the gentlelady from North Carolina, Ms. Ross.
    Ms. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Chair and Mr. Ranking Member, for 
holding this hearing.
    Just for context I represent the Research Triangle in North 
Carolina. We don't have as many great big patent holders, but 
we have a lot of innovators, small startups. Then, of course, 
we have North Carolina State University which has a tremendous 
number of patents and does some of the most work in the textile 
industry in the entire country.
    The ITC is one of the best tools that American innovators 
have for addressing patent infringement. Even though the ITC 
hears relatively few patent cases when compared to district 
courts, it serves a key function for small inventors, startups, 
and other innovators who find themselves facing patent 
infringement, of course from people abroad.
    Our intellectual property system is not always friendly to 
patent holders, particularly small patent holders, and it is 
often far too difficult to obtain an injunction from a District 
Court. The PTAB is too often misused to the detriment of 
innovators and small patent holders.
    The ITC on the other hand has a strong record of issuing 
exclusion orders to protect patent holders from counterfeit and 
infringing products even when these patent holders are facing 
large companies seeking to dominate them through litigation 
spending.
    Professor Doane, I frequently hear from patent holds about 
how the law does not protect their intellectual property. This 
is one of the reasons that I am a sponsor of the PREVAIL Act, a 
bill to address the high rate of patent invalidations at PTAB 
and prevent dual challenges at PTAB and District Court. Do you 
think the fact that the ITC is one of the only venues where 
patent holders feel that they are treated fairly has 
contributed to the rise in patent cases that the ITC hears?
    Mr. Doane. Yes, I believe the companies, patent owners, 
come there because they do believe they get a fair shake at the 
ITC. They get an effective mechanism. They get an efficient 
mechanism.
    We've heard mention about how long it takes for a summary 
determination motion and how they're not granted at the ITC. 
Well, in part, because the ITC moves so much faster than 
District Court, that there's simply no time. By the time you're 
in trial at the ITC, in a District Court, you're just getting 
started.
    So, it provides small patent owners an attractive forum 
because it gives them quick, effective, and predictable relief 
that will remove the product from the marketplace, not just 
force a license agreement on them.
    Ms. Ross. Thank you. Then I want to followup on Ranking 
Member Johnson's question about domestic industry requirements. 
Because, as I said, I represent a large university. It has a 
lot of patents, and those issues are front of mind in my 
district.
    How could proposed changes to the domestic industry 
requirement, such as limiting how patent licensing can satisfy 
the requirement, harm small investors and patent holders?
    Mr. Doane. I think it would injure them in a number of 
ways. We know that there's the claim about patent assertion 
entities, and I just think that's not borne out by the data. I 
think that these changes to the domestic industry fall with 
greater harm on the shoulders of small innovators who are still 
maybe trying to develop a product, maybe trying to--who've 
invented something, like a university that wants to license.
    These additional requirements would just simply further 
burden them, as opposed to actually dealing with the purported 
problem of patent restriction entities. I think it just adds 
another hoop that these complainants, these patent owners, 
would have to jump through to get any kind of relief for 
enforcement of their patents.
    Ms. Ross. Thank you very much.
    I was going to ask another question, but, instead, I'm 
going to agree with Congressman Massie, who has since had to 
leave, and just say that we've heard some testimony here in 
favor of weakening the ITC to some degree and it's troubling--
to make it harder for a patent owner to stop competitors from 
bringing infringing products manufactured abroad into the 
United States.
    That's on top of the eBay decision, which, since 2006, has 
made it nearly impossible for patent owners to get injunctions 
in court to protect their property. I don't think that U.S. 
innovators should be left with no way in court or in the ITC to 
protect their businesses from infringing products manufactured 
overseas.
    With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Issa. I thank the gentlelady. We now go to the 
gentleman from California, Mr. Kiley, for five minutes.
    Mr. Kiley. Good morning. I wanted to get a little better 
sense in the circumstance where an exclusion order is issued. 
What is the sort of typical response by the infringing entity? 
Mr. Korte or Ms. Hairston, if you want to weigh-in? Is a 
license usually the result of that? Do they shift their 
manufacturing domestically? What is the typical response?
    Mr. Korte. Yes, thank you for the question, Congressman. 
So, the typical response is years more of fighting. So, once an 
exclusion order is issued, the company that lost probably has 
already planned for that, as I mentioned earlier, and has 
products if things don't fall within the scope of that order.
    So, the next step after a loss at the ITC is to go to 
Customs, Customs and Border Protection. There's months or years 
of briefing and argument by lawyers at Customs over the scope 
of the exclusion order and what products it should apply to. 
So, oftentimes, there is no license after a loss at the ITC. 
There are product changes on the market, and then, more 
fighting at Customs, and eventually at the Federal Circuit over 
what the scope of an exclusion order might actually be.
    Mr. Kiley. Well, that part of it seems problematic to me 
and maybe everyone, both sides, would agree on that. Professor 
Doane, what do you think about this issue of fighting with 
Customs for years? Is that beneficial to the system?
    Mr. Doane. Well, I don't know about how much fighting there 
is, but, with Customs, I do know that respondents that have 
lost do try to redesign their products, which, by the way, is 
kind of the point of a patent, is that, if you infringe it, the 
idea for the patent is that you will then try to design around 
it, and thus, advance technology even further by coming up with 
something different.
    The Commission does, in fact, provide respondents with the 
opportunity to present redesigns to the Commission as well. 
Either during the course of an investigation, if they can get 
them in on time, or in an advisory opinion proceeding at the 
Commission, you can say, ``I, Commission, I want to import my 
new product. Here's why I think it doesn't infringe. Will you 
give me permission?'' The Commission can then say yes or no, 
and if you win, then you are free to import. You don't even 
have to talk to Customs. It has been blessed by the Commission.
    Mr. Kiley. Right. So, maybe that's an area where we could 
focus on our forum as well, is sort of streamlining that 
process, so that it would at least set the stage for a better 
negotiation over a license or let folks know what kind of 
alternatives are available to them.
    Also, when it comes to the consideration of the public 
interest, I guess, Professor Doane, this would be a good 
question for you. Do you know in what percent of cases an 
exclusion order is not issued based on the public interest 
factors, roughly?
    Mr. Doane. Well, I could tell you the number--if the 
question is the number that has been denied because of a public 
interest consideration, I believe there has been, actually, 
very few, maybe four or five. The Commission always does take, 
particularly in the last 10-20 years, has taken public interest 
not to deny relief, but to modify the scope of relief. They 
consider it in how they draft the exclusion order, whether 
particular products are covered, whether to grandfather in 
already imported products or new products. They do take public 
interest into consideration to make sure that there is no harm.
    For example, this is a trade secret case, not a patent 
infringement case, but there was a case in which it was found 
that batteries for electric cars were going to be excluded 
because they were being produced after a theft of trade 
secrets. The Commission modified the exclusion order, giving 
American car companies the opportunity, several months before 
the exclusion order would go into force, to allow them to 
switch to it and design in the types of batteries into their 
cars, so that they wouldn't be using an infringing battery.
    Mr. Kiley. So, what do you make of this notion that these 
proceedings are duplicative because you might have parallel 
litigation going on in U.S. courts? Is there any validity to 
that? From my perspective, it seems that, if you're importing a 
product that may be infringing, then maybe in that situation, 
we should have more scrutiny and perhaps the additional remedy 
in an exclusion order, which we don't really have now in the 
U.S. system. What do you make of that argument?
    Mr. Doane. Well, it certainly is the case that one can file 
a District Court complaint with a Section 337 complaint. In 
fact, I would say it's probably more common than not that this 
is done, largely because the ITC does not grant, does not have 
the authority to give money damages. So, if you do actually 
want to get compensation for past infringement, you do have to 
go to District Court to get that. The exclusion order is the 
perspective going forward and removes the product from the 
market.
    There is 28 U.S.C. 1659, I believe is the number, which 
gives the--if you are a respondent in an ITC case and a 
defendant in a District Court case, you are automatically 
entitled to a stay of the District Court case until the ITC 
litigation is completely completed, including all the way 
through appeal. So, you're not facing two trials at once, 
unless you choose to. You can decide to waive that right. The 
statute gives a respondent in that circumstance an absolute 
right to stay the District Court action.
    Mr. Kiley. Thank you. Well, I think that there are a number 
of opportunities for reform to make this process work better, 
but in the process we need to make sure that we're not in any 
way making it easier for China to infringe on American 
intellectual property, which seems to be a huge risk here.
    Also, need to be mindful of the impact that weakening the 
availability of exclusion orders would have on innovation in 
this country and, particularly, small innovators.
    So, I thank the Chair for holding this hearing, and I think 
there's a lot we can work on this going forward. I yield back.
    Mr. Issa. I thank the gentleman. We now go to the 
gentlelady from San Jose, Ms. Lofgren.
    Ms. Lofgren. Thanks very much, Mr. Chair.
    Standard essential patents--those are SEPs, Mr. Chair, for 
the acronyms--for many products comply with industry standards. 
As you know, owners of SEPs agree to license these patents on 
fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms--that's, 
Mr. Chair, the acronym--to ensure that the technology is 
accessible.
    At the same time, the ITC can issue exclusion orders to 
stop the import of products that infringe on patents. However, 
these orders can be disruptive, especially when it comes to 
SEPs, because they could block the import of widely used 
products, impacting businesses and consumers.
    I'm wondering if each one of you has an opinion on these 
two questions.
    First, the issue of monetary remedies versus exclusion 
orders. Considering the potential disruption of exclusion 
orders, do you believe that monetary remedies should be the 
first option, with exclusion orders reserved only for the most 
severe cases when SEPs and FRAND are involved?
    Second, given that commitment to license on fair terms, 
should the ITC avoid issuing exclusion orders when they 
conflict with FRAND commitments? How should we handle these 
situations to balance the needs of patent holders and their 
rights with those of the broader market?
    Anybody have an opinion on those two questions?
    Ms. Hairston. Thank you for the question, Congresswoman. 
With regard to monetary remedies versus exclusion orders, our 
position is that, if there is actual infringement, that the 
first option should be those monetary damages and potential 
royalties, particularly as it relates to standard essential 
patents. They are licensed largely with the intent to monetize 
the IP, intellectual property, and, therefore, we don't think 
that an exclusion order is appropriate.
    With regard to fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory 
terms, we don't think that the ITC should be granting exclusion 
orders. We think that injunctive relief is not appropriate in 
that context because of the FRAND commitment that the SEP 
patent holders have made to license all willing implementers.
    Ms. Lofgren. Yes?
    Mr. Contreras. Yes, thank you for the question. As you 
know, undoubtedly, in 2013, U.S. Trade Representative Froman, 
representing the administration, issued the last disapproval of 
an ITC exclusion order that had been issued to Samsung against 
Apple, precisely because it involved standard essential 
patents. Trade Representative Froman was very clear in his 
explanation of the disapproval that standard essential patents 
and standardized products are important for the U.S. economy, 
for U.S. producers, and to block the importation of products on 
the basis of a standard essential patent was a very significant 
matter, and that the ITC had not adequately developed the 
record in terms of FRAND and standard essential patents in that 
particular case.
    To its credit, the ITC has modified its procedures in the 
intervening 11 years, so that there is a much more detailed 
record developed around SEPs. The ITC has not issued any 
exclusion order against a product by virtue of infringing 
standard essential patents.
    That's absolutely the right approach to take. When a 
company is involved in the standardization process, it makes a 
commitment, a binding contractual commitment to the standards 
body, that it will grant licenses of its patents on fair, 
reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms.
    That means it agrees that, if others are going to use its 
patents, it will accept a monetary royalty, and as long as a 
company is willing to pay that reasonable royalty, there's 
really no cause for an exclusion order or an injunction in 
court, either. So, the only question is how much money that 
reasonable royalty ought to be, and that's a question that the 
courts will decide.
    So, yes, so I think that absolutely the ITC should stay 
away from exclusion orders in the FRAND context.
    Mr. Doane. As Professor Contreras pointed out, the 
Commission has developed a procedure to develop a record on a 
SEP and to determine whether an exclusion order might be 
necessary. I think that the availability of an exclusion order, 
the threat of an exclusion order needs to stay in place, even 
for a potential SEP, to avoid the problem of holdout, of 
companies that say, ``Well, yes, you haven't offered me good 
enough FRAND terms. So, I'm not going to license and I'm going 
to keep going, infringing, because you can't make me stop.''
    Ultimately, I think that the threat of the exclusion order 
is beneficial in that, ultimately, it might force the end of 
patent holdout in the circumstance, in a case of an SEP.
    Ms. Lofgren. I see my time is just about up, Mr. Chair. So, 
I yield back. Thank you all for your testimony today.
    Mr. Issa. I thank you so much.
    I now ask unanimous consent that two pieces of litigation 
history be placed in the record. (1) Code Alarm v. Directed 
Electronics, ED, Michigan, 1996. Code Alarm, Plaintiff, v. 
Directed Electronics, Defendant; (2) Code Alarm, Plaintiff, v. 
Magnadyne Corporation, Defendant. One is an ITC hearing or 
process, and the other is an Article III Court in Michigan.
    Mr. Issa. Since no one else is here, I'll now recognize 
myself. I put those in the record because those are my cases. I 
was a defendant. The ITC very appropriately found that the 
accuser had unclean hands and, in fact, did not have a valid 
patent, but, in fact, was asserting a patent that they had 
applied for after a vendor gave them not only the idea, but the 
chip.
    The ITC, for the first time that I know of, refused a 
dismissal by the plaintiff, continued the case, and the 
plaintiff then said,

        That's great. You made your decision on summary judgment to 
        find my patent invalid, but I'm going to continue an Article 
        III.

Where we continued an Article III, ultimately, having it 
decided twice at the Federal Circuit, once, sustaining the ITC; 
once, opposing the defendants' plea; that is, the patent in 
Article III was valid.
    All of that goes to say that my experience with the ITC, 
although quick and expensive, in fact, was fair. Now, the 
question is for all of you--and I'll start with Professor 
Doane--do you believe that the ITC is appropriate, for example, 
when Broadcom and Qualcomm, two very large, multibillion dollar 
companies, face each other over a portion of their intellectual 
property and they are a simultaneously an Article III case? Yes 
or no, please.
    Mr. Doane. Yes.
    Mr. Issa. Professor Contreras?
    Mr. Contreras. No.
    Mr. Korte. No.
    Ms. Hairston. No.
    Mr. Issa. So, this doesn't surprise me. What does surprise 
me is that much of the discussion today has been about small 
entities, large entities, and so on. So, I'm going to go into a 
couple of areas that were brought up and try to tie together 
some of the testimony today.
    SEPs, Professor Doane, they exist to collect revenue. Your 
belief is that, even though their attempt is to collect 
revenue, that injunctive or exclusion should still be granted 
as a leverage tool to get them not to be holdouts, or in other 
words, not to assert their full rights in Article III, where 
they might prevail. Is that correct?
    Mr. Doane. Were you saying SEPS or--
    Mr. Issa. An SEP, a potential infringer of a standard 
essential patent.
    Mr. Doane. I think that--
    Mr. Issa. You're saying it should still be explored and 
that an exclusion should still be granted in the ITC?
    Mr. Doane. I think the availability of an exclusion order 
should be an option in cases where there has been holdout. I 
think I would hope that--
    Mr. Issa. OK. I got you. I just wanted to make sure. So, 
for the other three, because I'm suspecting a different answer, 
the idea that the ITC is, in Professor Doane's experience of 30 
years of practicing, a tool for leverage on what, ultimately, 
is a royalty-only product--meaning that a royalty will be 
granted; it will be paid if the defendant loses. Yet, the 
professor has said that it's an effective, from his litigation 
history, an effective tool. Would you (a) agree it's an 
effective tool, and (b) do you believe it should be a tool, 
essentially, used as a hammer to predetermine the outcome of an 
Article III Court case?
    Yes, Professor Contreras?
    Mr. Contreras. Yes, I have been involved in numerous cases 
where this has been used as a tool and it is effective, but 
whether it's appropriate is another question. It's not an 
appropriate tool. Of course, it's a tool that is favored by 
patent holders because any tool in the litigation toolkit 
should be--
    Mr. Issa. There's a reason Broadcom sued Qualcomm in the 
ITC. It is it was a tool available to them, just as Kodak and 
Apple, and lots of other large companies.
    Mr. Korte, has Garmin used the tool ever? You're an 
American manufacturer. Have you used it again Asian imports?
    Mr. Korte. No. Although we do face our own flood of Asian 
imports, and including from China, we have never used 337 
against those imports. We've found other recourse, including 
Article III Courts, to be much more cost-effective and useful 
to stem the flood of knockoff products.
    Mr. Issa. Ms. Hairston?
    Ms. Hairston. I would agree with Professor Contreras that, 
while it can be a very effective tool, we don't necessarily 
believe that it's an appropriate tool to use, particularly as 
it relates to standard essential patents.
    Mr. Issa. OK. We have another person coming. So, I'm going 
to take a few extra seconds here.
    One question--and I'll start with Professor Contreras--when 
there is an SEP, for example, we could suggest to the other 
Committee of Jurisdiction that a bond in lieu would be a remedy 
that we could make available to the ITC--not mandate, but make 
available. Do you think that a bond in lieu, where the full 
cost of the holdout would then be paid in and continue to be 
paid until the Article III Case reaches final adjudication? Is 
that a reasonable alternative to exclusion?
    Mr. Contreras. I would say it's an improvement. As you 
undoubtedly know, many European jurisdictions have this idea of 
a bond in lieu of the injunction. It's still not really 
necessary.
    We do have Article III Courts to adjudicate these matters. 
Even with a bond, the bond is a significant cost. The small 
companies are the ones who won't be able to pay the bond; the 
large companies will.
    Mr. Issa. Mr. Doane, or Professor Doane, would you say that 
a bond--but a cost that is an alternative to exclusion is this 
at least something that should be a tool in the quiver, if you 
will, of the ITC?
    Mr. Doane. It is difficult to say without knowing how such 
a bond would work, but it's certainly something that can be, 
should be discussed.
    Mr. Issa. OK. Ms. Hairston, you talked about your various 
manufacturers, auto manufactures, and so on. Is this something 
where the idea that you're perfectly willing to pay the 
damages, capable of paying the damages, if a license--and we're 
assuming that we're only talking for a moment about companies 
which are licensors; in other words, not a company that demands 
an exclusive and only has an exclusive. Is that something that 
you think would improve the treatment at the ITC, assuming they 
still took the cases?
    Ms. Hairston. I think it is something definitely worth 
exploring. I'd like to take it back to my member companies to 
discuss to get more insight and share that with you at a later 
time.
    Mr. Issa. Thank you. That's what this hearing is for.
    I now go to the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Cline.
    Mr. Cline. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Professor Contreras, would you agree that there is a rising 
trend in abusive investor-funded patent litigation in legal 
venues across the United States, including at the ITC?
    Mr. Contreras. There's certainly a trend in investor-funded 
litigation. Much of this investor-funded litigation is for NPE 
litigation, both the District Courts and definitely at the ITC.
    Mr. Cline. In fact, increasingly, shell companies and other 
intermediaries conceal the involvement of parties, often 
foreign, including sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, and 
other opaque entities, in patent litigation against U.S. 
companies?
    Mr. Contreras. This is an issue across the board in patent 
litigation, yes.
    Mr. Cline. Do these shell companies target critical 
manufacturers and industries which could disrupt fragile supply 
chains and undermine the industries and companies that are 
vital to America's national and economic security?
    Mr. Contreras. That is certainly what happens.
    Mr. Cline. Does Section 337 currently require the 
disclosure of who is funding the complaint?
    Mr. Contreras. No.
    Mr. Cline. So, it would be accurate to say that absent 
adequate transparency in the disclosure of the real parties and 
interests in these ITC cases, the extent of this harm will 
remain unknown to the U.S. public and to the government?
    Mr. Contreras. That's correct. We just don't know.
    Mr. Cline. Would it also be accurate to say that the lack 
of routine disclosure of the real parties and interests raises 
serious concerns when determining whether ethical conflicts 
exist during ITC proceedings?
    Mr. Contreras. This is a concern as well, yes. There's 
really no reason that there shouldn't be full transparency.
    Mr. Cline. I'm pleased that, as a Member of the 
Appropriations Committee during the Fiscal Year 2024 and Fiscal 
Year 2025 cycles, I was successful in including tort language 
in the CJS bill to, essentially, articulate what you just 
confirmed and direct the ITC to consider implementing a 
standing rule that would require each party to disclose the 
real parties and interests in all Section 337 litigation at the 
ITC.
    This is a temporary victory, but it seems that legislation 
is necessary to ensure the disclosure of real parties and 
interests. Would you agree?
    Mr. Contreras. I would agree.
    Mr. Cline. OK. Thank you for that.
    Mr. Issa. Would the gentleman yield?
    Mr. Cline. Yes, happy to yield.
    Mr. Issa. Let me ask a question. The reverse of the 
complaint about eBay that I've been hearing here today--and 
I'll go, start with Professor Doane--if an Article III Court 
were to find infringement, and the ITC then was empowered, 
essentially, sua sponte, to issue an exclusion based on that 
decision, notwithstanding eBay, would you support that?
    Mr. Doane. I don't know if I need to support that. I think 
that's how that would work. I think if--
    Mr. Issa. Well, even if you haven't been in the ITC, you 
would simply go to the--
    Mr. Doane. Yes, if you have a finding of infringement, and 
you, then, say, ``Well, they're continuing to import, even 
though I have this finding of infringement against them,'' the 
Commission would be bound by the District Court's order, the 
finding of infringement. To the extent there were validity 
findings, they would be bound by those as well. If the other 
requirements of 337 were met, then, certainly, they can issue 
an exclusion order.
    Mr. Issa. So, as a summary decision, Professor Contreras, 
do you agree that, notwithstanding the eBay decision, that a 
Federal Court that finds infringement, and the ITC finds that 
the product is still being imported, that an exclusion would be 
something you could grant in a matter of, basically, days--not 
a year?
    Mr. Contreras. Yes, that is certainly possible. It's really 
Customs and Border Protection that is the relevant implementer 
here. The ITC--
    Mr. Issa. The ITC, this could be an effective power that 
would dissuade people from going to the ITC at greater expense, 
but have everyone recognize that you can't rely on eBay if, in 
fact, you're importing?
    I'm asking because we're looking to try to find common 
ground here. We are not the Committee of Primary Jurisdiction, 
even though our Article III Judges find themselves a little 
amused that they are stayed while an administrative act that 
may not be a complete remedy occurs.
    The other two witnesses, any comment on that? You certainly 
have Article III against infringers.
    Mr. Korte. Yes, certainly, and my only reservation with 
that process is the ITC's statutory requirement is to protect 
American domestic industry. So, before it takes any action, 
including an exclusion order, it should be looking to see if 
that exclusion order is in furtherance of that American 
investment.
    Mr. Issa. Sure. That's why I said days, not hours.
    Mr. Korte. Yes.
    Mr. Issa. How about for the auto industry? Is this 
something that would be comfortable as a possibility that the 
ITC would act in an expeditious manner, but after an Article 
III case was adjudicated?
    Ms. Hairston. I think that certainly sounds reasonable. I 
would agree with Mr. Korte's reservations, but that's something 
that could be potentially workable.
    Mr. Issa. OK. Then, having no other questioners, I'm just 
going to quickly give you the synopsis--I'll give you a written 
copy--of questions from the other Committee of Jurisdiction, 
Ways and Means.
    They were particularly interested in activities that are on 
the order of the Chinese Government, the Chinese Communist 
Party.
    One question was:

        How might Section 337 be improved to be a more powerful tool to 
        block imports of products that infringe U.S. patents, 
        misappropriate U.S. trade secrets, and otherwise undermine 
        intellectual property of Americans?

So, as you can see, their question is, how do we make it 
stronger?
    Mr. Doane, Professor Doane, I think you'll enjoy answering, 
helping us answer that.
    The next one is:

        To the extent that some witnesses call for reforms related to 
        337 litigation, will these reforms be helpful to better hold 
        China accountable for abuse of intellectual property?

I would assume that's both directions, infringing and perhaps 
the patent troll process.
    Then:

        To the extent that some of the witnesses call for reforms 
        related to 337 litigations, to what extent would the problems 
        you identified be solved by administrative action by the ITC 
        rather than a statutory change?

In other words, can they heal thyself is the question?
    That is an important question that occurs to me, too; that 
we may--sometimes our hearings provoke changes at agencies.
    Mr. Issa. Do you want to make any closing statements?
    Mr. Johnson. No, I have none. I'm just ready to get to my 
next Committee.
    Mr. Issa. Seeing that there are not, I would ask, in 
closing, would you all agree, pursuant to our normal closing 
statement, that there would be five legislative days in which, 
for Members of the Committee, either that did ask questions or 
those that weren't able to, to send you questions for the 
record, in addition to the ones you got from the Ways and Means 
Committee?
    Mr. Doane. Yes.
    Mr. Contreras. Yes.
    Mr. Korte. Yes. Thank you.
    Ms. Hairston. Yes.
    Mr. Issa. Thank you.
    That's actually the only thing I need to ask. So, thank you 
very much, again, for attending. We will take your additional 
remarks, in addition to questions, if you have further thoughts 
during that same period. Well, five days to get it to you and a 
reasonable time for you to answer.
    Mr. Issa. Thank you very much. We stand adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:15 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
