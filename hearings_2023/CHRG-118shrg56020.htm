              CONFIRMATION HEARING ON FEDERAL APPOINTMENTS

                              ----------                              


                      WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2023

                              United States Senate,
                                Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:07 a.m., in 
Room 226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. 
Durbin, Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Durbin [presiding], Feinstein, Klobuchar, 
Coons, Blumenthal, Hirono, Padilla, Ossoff, Welch, Graham, 
Grassley, Lee, Hawley, Kennedy, Tillis, and Blackburn.
    Also present: Senators Moran, Young, and Smith.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Chair Durbin. This hearing of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee will come to order. My colleague, Senator Graham, is 
on the way and told me to go ahead and get started. So we will.
    Today we'll hear from four judicial nominees and an 
executive nominee. They are Richard Federico, nominated to the 
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; Judge Joshua Kolar, 
nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit; 
Judge Jeffrey Bryan, nominated to the District of Minnesota; 
Judge Eumi Lee, nominated to the Northern District of 
California; and Deborah Robinson, nominated to be the 
Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator in the Executive 
Office of the President. My congratulations are extended to 
each nominee and their family.
    First, I'd like to note that Mr. Federico and Judge Kolar 
both currently serve in the U.S. Armed Forces as Reservists, 
following previous active duty service, and we thank them for 
that.
    Second, each of today's judicial nominees has received blue 
slips from both of their home State Senators. This includes Mr. 
Federico, who has received a blue slip from Senator Moran, who 
is here today, and Senator Marshall, of Kansas. It also 
includes Judge Kolar, who's received blue slips from Senator 
Young, who is here with us, and Senator Braun, of Indiana. I 
want to thank these Senators from Kansas and Indiana for 
continuing to work with the White House in good faith to fill 
judicial vacancies in their State on a bipartisan basis.
    There's been a lot of criticism of this blue slip process, 
and it has been abused in the past. But these Senators and the 
White House Counsel's Office have shown, once again, this 
process can work if people of good will meet together and do 
their best. We can result in outstanding nominees such as those 
before us today.
    I'm encouraged that several of my Republican colleagues in 
the White House have done this, and swiftly identified and 
advanced highly qualified nominees. I look forward to seeing 
more of the same.
    We have several colleagues joining us today to introduce 
our nominees, and Senator Graham would've made an opening 
statement at this point, but we'll hold that until he arrives. 
And first, let's start with the introductions by Senator Moran 
of Kansas.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN,
            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Chairman Durbin, thank you, and to Senator 
Graham, my respects and regards when he arrives, and thank you 
to all the Committee Members for their attention today. I've 
had the opportunity of being in front of this Committee. This, 
I believe, is my third time in support of a judicial nomination 
related to Kansas.
    And I appreciate what the Chairman had to say. I take my 
responsibilities as a Senator, as do all Senators, seriously, 
and I'd like at least part of my legacy in my service in the 
United States Senate to be that I participated in a process 
that provided a good judicial--members of the judiciary for 
Kansas, now and in the future. I take this responsibility 
seriously, and I want Kansas nominees to be of the highest 
quality. And I'm here today in support of one that is.
    It's my pleasure to introduce Captain Richard Federico for 
the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
The Tenth Circuit sets in Denver, Kansas is one of its 
constituent States. I appreciate that Rich Federico made the 
right choice in making Kansas his home after moving to our 
State in order to attend law school at the University of 
Kansas. Although his military service has moved him around the 
country, Kansas has remained his home for him and his family.
    Rich has had an impressive 21 years of service, including 
13 years on active duty in the Navy's Judge Advocate Corps. 
During his service, Rich has served as a prosecutor, a defense 
counsel, and as a judge. His extensive and versed experience 
resulted in a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating by the 
American Bar Association, and in my view, a deserved position, 
or serious consideration for that position, for a seat on the 
Tenth Circuit.
    We know that military service is family service, and that 
servicemembers are made stronger by family members who support 
them. And so today, I use this as an opportunity not only to 
thank him, Captain Federico, as a member of the Armed Services 
for his present and past service, but also to thank his family.
    His wife, Ann, is here. She's a native of McPherson, 
Kansas, and their children, Mia and Libby. You should meet 
their family, his family, and you, too, will reach the 
conclusion that Captain Federico deserves your confirmation, 
``aye.''
    In his eighth year in the Navy Reserves, Captain Federico 
currently is serving as a litigator in the Federal Public 
Defender's Office for the District of Kansas. Public defense 
has been a critical component of the fabric of our judicial 
system.
    I'm sure as the Ranking Member can speak from his own 
experiences in the JAG Corps, it's important that defendants in 
our justice system are represented to hold the Government to 
its highest standard in the defense of our civil liberties.
    It's also important that judiciary continues to recognize 
this component, and having both been a prosecutor and a defense 
attorney, I believe Captain Federico will bring an important 
perspective to the Tenth Circuit.
    I thank Captain Federico and his family for their 
willingness to continue to serve the United States of America, 
and I look forward to the hearing today as it proceeds. Mr. 
Chairman, Ranking Member, thank you for the opportunity.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Moran. Senator Young.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TODD YOUNG,
            A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF INDIANA

    Senator Young. Thank you, Chairman, Ranking Member Graham, 
and Members of the Committee. I come before you today to 
introduce a fellow Hoosier, Judge Joshua Kolar, as the 
President's nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Seventh Circuit.
    Judge Kolar is joined behind me today by Rachel, his 
beautiful wife, and their four lovely children. And the row 
behind that, we find his father, Bob, and his mom, Brooke. So, 
he has an amazing and very supportive family, and we thank them 
for all of their service in their respective capacities.
    You, I know, have seen his bio. But beyond his legal 
credentials, you're no doubt impressed, as I was, by a service 
in the U.S. Navy Reserves. The slogan for the Navy Reserves is, 
``Ready now. Anytime, Anywhere.'' And in reviewing his judicial 
record and hearing from his colleagues, it's apparent that the 
slogan applies not only to Judge Kolar's military service, but 
to his courtroom service, as well.
    I've received several letters of support for Judge Kolar, 
and among the adjectives used to describe him are 
``thoughtful,'' ``decisive,'' ``straight shooter,'' 
``diligent,'' ``civil,'' ``professional,'' and, ``one of the 
best.'' This high praise comes from individuals he's worked 
for, and with, in the United States Attorney's Office, as well 
as those who have appeared before him in his current capacity 
as magistrate judge.
    I'm proud of Indiana's string of judicial appointments that 
have been confirmed by bipartisan majorities, and my hope is 
that this hearing will demonstrate that Judge Kolar is ``Ready 
now. Anytime, Anywhere,'' and worthy of your support. Thank 
you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Young, and thank you for 
your service, too, to our Nation.
    We have a number of other nominees, and the first I'll 
recognize is Senator Klobuchar to introduce Judge Bryan.
    Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you very much, Senator 
Durbin. I'll defer first to my colleague who's a visitor to our 
Committee, and then I'll go ahead. Thank you.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much to Chair----
    Chair Durbin. Senator Tina Smith is recognized.
    Senator Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TINA SMITH,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA

    Senator Smith. To Chair Durbin, and Ranking Member Graham, 
and to all of the Members of the Committee, I want to thank you 
for the opportunity to introduce Judge Jeffrey Bryan, an 
outstanding nominee to be Federal district court judge for the 
District of Minnesota.
    And I particularly want to thank my colleague, Senator Amy 
Klobuchar, for her dedication and hard work on this Committee, 
and for the work that I know that she'll be doing to support 
the nomination of Judge Bryan, along with myself.
    Let me begin by recognizing those here today who are 
supporting Judge Bryan, including his wife, Liz Kramer, and his 
longtime friend and fellow law school graduate, I understand, 
Father Richard Avila. And I'd also like to acknowledge Judge 
Bryan's family, and friends, and mentors who couldn't be here 
today, but are undoubtedly cheering him on from Minnesota, and 
elsewhere. Thank you, all, for your support of this excellent 
judge.
    Judge Bryan's background and experience make him 
extraordinarily well qualified to serve as a Federal district 
court judge. An experienced State court judge and former 
Federal prosecutor, he is an exemplary public servant who is 
dedicated to the fair and equitable administration of justice.
    After earning his J.D. from the Yale Law School, Judge 
Bryan clerked for Judge Paul Magnuson of the District Court for 
the District of Minnesota, the same court to which he is now 
nominated. After a stint at the Minneapolis firm of Robins 
Kaplan as a civil litigation associate, he joined the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Minnesota as an assistant U.S. attorney, 
where he prosecuted drug crimes and white collar defendants.
    In 2013, he was appointed as a trial court judge in 
Minnesota. During his tenure on the bench, he was recognized 
for his leadership, and recommending and implementing important 
reforms to our State's judicial justice system.
    Then in 2019, Judge Bryan was appointed to serve on the 
Minnesota Court of Appeals, where he has decided over 500 
cases.
    Judge Bryan was recommended by an independent judicial 
selection committee that Senator Klobuchar and I convened, 
comprised of distinguished lawyers, advocates, and judges from 
Minnesota. He has committed colleagues to the rule of law and 
fair administration of justice. He is a first-rate legal mind. 
And with his judicial experience and Federal trial court 
experience, I know that Judge Bryan is ready to serve as an 
outstanding Federal district court judge from his first day on 
the job.
    So I urge you to support his nomination. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Smith. Senator Klobuchar.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you. It's great to be here 
with my colleague, and with all of you, and back from our weeks 
at home. I just wanted to add some things to Tina's great 
review of Judge Bryan's record. He was born in an Army 
hospital--I'm doing this for Senator Tillis' sake--an Army 
hospital on Fort Bragg.
    As Tina noted, he grew up as a son of a captain with the 
82nd Airborne who instilled in Judge Bryan an appreciation for 
public service. His mom was an English teacher. His father's 
work with the Army brought their family to Fort Bliss near El 
Paso, and that's where Judge Bryan spent most of his 
upbringing. That's where he went to college.
    And after graduating summa cum laude from the University of 
Texas, he went back home to El Paso and worked as a substitute 
teacher before going to law school. As a law student at Yale, 
he served as a student supervisor in the Parents and Children 
Clinic, and was president of the law school Christian 
Fellowship. He also met the love of his life, a Minnesotan, at 
law school, and ultimately he traded the Texas heat for 
Minnesota winters, as he and Liz settled down in St. Paul, 
Minnesota.
    If he is confirmed, he will be the first Latino Federal 
judge in Minnesota. He is active in the Minnesota Hispanic Bar 
Association. He served on the board of Twin Cities Habitat for 
Humanity, the Minnesota Urban Debate League, and the local bar 
association. For 20 years, even before he had children himself, 
he taught Sunday school at his church.
    After his clerkship for Judge Paul Magnuson, a judge 
appointed by President Reagan, and several years in private 
practice, Judge Bryan spent 6 years--as Tina noted--as an 
assistant U.S. attorney, where he prosecuted violent gangs and 
large-scale drug trafficking organization.
    He prosecuted over 350 criminals and directed what was, at 
that time, the largest cocaine and the largest meth 
investigations ever conducted in the District of Minnesota. He 
played a key role in dismantling a cocaine trafficking network 
that spanned from McAllen, Texas, to St. Cloud, Minnesota.
    Additionally, he led an investigation that resulted in the 
recovery of more than 9,600 grams of meth, as well as 
convictions of more than 60 defendants. We have heard from 
former local, State, and Federal law enforcement officials who 
praised him for his work ethic and dedication to administering 
justice.
    He was hired as a prosecutor by Erica MacDonald, who went 
on to be appointed by President Trump to serve as U.S. attorney 
for Minnesota. She also gave a rec, as well as many Democratic-
appointed prosecutors and jugdes.
    Judge Bryan left the U.S. Attorney's Office in 2013 and, as 
noted by Senator Smith, was appointed to serve on the Ramsey 
County District Court in St. Paul, where he presided over 8,000 
cases.
    In 2019, he was appointed to serve as a judge on the 
Minnesota Court of Appeals. He has sat on over 500 cases as an 
appellate judge, and has authored nearly 200 opinions, and has 
only been reversed in two cases--which is better than our 
record around here.
    Judge Bryan has earned endorsements, as I noted, of some of 
the most esteemed jurists in our State, including four senior 
U.S. district court judges. For the same reasons, the ABA 
Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Judge Bryan 
as ``well qualified'' to serve--the highest rating that the 
committee awards.
    I know he will make an outstanding Federal district court 
judge for the District of Minnesota. Every judge I have 
nominated since I have gotten here, with the President's help 
and both sides of the aisle, have received bipartisan support. 
And I want to keep my record. So, this is a really, really good 
judge. And Senator Smith and I are proud of the work of our 
committee, and I hope that you will support him. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Klobuchar. Before recognizing 
Senator Feinstein, who will introduce one of the nominees, I 
recognize my colleague, Ranking Member of the Committee, 
Lindsey Graham.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM,
        A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back, 
everybody. I'll try to be brief. As we move forward today on 
nominations, it's very heartening to see our Republican and 
Democratic colleagues working together on circuit nominations, 
as a compliment to you all.
    I'm trying to find a way to work with my Democratic 
colleagues on appointments. They won the election and that 
comes with winning. And I think we've done a pretty good job. 
So, hats off to both of you.
    Everybody has been asked, or will be asked, about military 
nominations. I have talked to Senator Tuberville many times. I 
understand his concerns about DOD abortion policy. I share 
those concerns. I was under the assumption that we would vote 
on that policy. I think he's entitled to vote to change it. I 
would gladly support him in his efforts to change that policy. 
Apparently, that's not going to be enough.
    I just got back from a trip around the world here. And one 
thing I know for sure, the world is not getting a safer place. 
It's getting a more dangerous place. To my colleagues, I think 
we need to vote on abortion policy by the Pentagon, but we also 
need to get these folks promoted. An individual promotion 
should be stopped, in my view, because of the behavior of the 
individual.
    All of us here have gripes with one another and with the 
administration. There is no end to this war once you start it. 
We have yet to do this, and I hope this will not be the norm. 
We put people on hold, we block nominations to try to get the 
attention of our colleagues on the other side. That makes 
perfect sense to me. But the one thing we all depend on is an 
effective military.
    We have 300 nominations that have been stalled at a time 
when we need leadership in the military. So, I'm hoping that we 
can find a way to have a vote on the underlying abortion 
policy. And if that's not enough, that we'll dedicate floor 
time, Mr. Chairman, to getting these nominees to move forward.
    One last thing, it's September the 6th. The chance of 
getting 12 Appropriation bills through the Senate and the House 
to the President's desk is pretty remote. I compliment Senators 
Collins and Murray for passing 12 bills to the Appropriations 
Committee. We're going to take up a minibus next week.
    I'm all for regular order, but I'm not for the Government 
shutting down. So, we're going to eventually need a CR, but we 
also will need a supplemental because of Hawaii and many other 
things. I just want to let the body know, from my point of 
view, I will not vote for an omnibus bill. I'm not ever going 
to do that again.
    So, we need to be thinking about how this movie ends with a 
supplemental that will get bipartisan support to deal with the 
issues that our Nation faces. So the idea of an omnibus in 
December is off the table for me. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. I might say in response that my colleague, 
Senator Graham, and I disagree on many issues, but we are 
friends. And we have worked together, as well, on many issues, 
and we'll continue to.
    And I think your statement about the situation with 
military promotions is one I hope your colleagues share on your 
side of the aisle. Nine months. It's been 9 months since one 
Senator from Alabama has held up the promotions of hundreds--
hundreds of professional military who are seeking to move up 
because of their commitment to our country, and their 
willingness to risk their lives for our country.
    It is a hardship, not only on them but a hardship on their 
families, for one Senator to hold up these nominations on the 
floor. There are many opportunities to raise many issues before 
us, but to hold hostage innocent men and women, who have 
dedicated their lives to our country, and risked their lives, 
and been rewarded for their service in the past, is just 
unfair--fundamentally unfair to these families.
    If you say you stand behind our military and love our 
military, prove it. Stop what's going on on the floor of the 
United States Senate. This debate on the other issues can take 
place in many different venues, but not at the expense of these 
good women and men who've served our country so well. So I 
certainly hope we can move forward on those quickly.
    Nine months they're waiting. Kids--I understand the kids of 
these families are not sure where they're going to go to school 
this year. They start in one school and they may be headed to 
another. For goodness' sakes, we're doing this to men and women 
who risk their lives for our country. Shame on us. I'm glad you 
said what you did, Senator.
    Now, we have several other nominees to be introduced, and 
I'd offered to my friends, colleagues who've come here and 
already testified, if they have to leave because of their 
schedule, we certainly understand it. But next will be Senator 
Feinstein who's going to introduce nominee Lee. Senator 
Feinstein.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN,
          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Senator Feinstein. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm pleased to 
join in the introductions of Kim Lee, who has been nominated to 
serve on the Northern District of California.
    Judge Lee currently serves as a State court judge on the 
California Superior Court in Alameda County. As many of you 
know, she has both the skills and the experience needed to 
serve on the Federal bench. I think that's a fair conclusion 
from the Bay Area.
    Judge Lee is a graduate of Pomona College. She received her 
law degree from the Georgetown University Law Center. Early in 
her career, she gained important insight into the role of a 
Federal judge when she served as a law clerk for two Federal 
judges: Judge Warren Ferguson of the Ninth Circuit and Judge 
Jerome Turner of the Western District of Tennessee.
    She then entered private practice. So you see, she's had a 
multitude of experience, which I believe serves a judge well.
    In 2005, she joined the faculty at the University of 
California Law School in San Francisco. Again, broadening her 
views. She served as a professor in the clinical program where 
she taught law students about the practical application of the 
law to the real world as it exists.
    In 2018, she was appointed to serve as a State court judge 
on the California Superior Court for Alameda County. During her 
5 years of judicial service, she has presided in over 70 trials 
and thousands of hearings in both civil and criminal cases. She 
is, in fact, well qualified. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Senator Padilla.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ALEX PADILLA,
          A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, and Ranking 
Member Graham. I'll try not to be too repetitive, but it is 
also my honor to introduce President Biden's latest nominee to 
serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of 
California, Judge Lee.
    Judge Lee is joined today by her family. And I know that 
we're a long way from the Bay Area, but I want to thank her 
family and her friends for supporting her, and allowing her to 
continue to serve. We also know there's a lot of family and 
friends watching from back home. And it just speaks volumes of 
her willingness to serve and their support of her in service to 
not just the judiciary, but to our country.
    Judge Lee's a proud daughter of two parents who survived 
the Korean War before immigrating to United States. Judge Lee 
was born in Wisconsin and grew up in Tennessee, but her 
commitment to public service would eventually bring her to the 
Bay Area in California.
    As you've heard from Senator Feinstein, she earned her B.A. 
from Pomona College in 1994. She worked as a teacher in 
Oakland, California, for 2 years with Teach For America before 
earning her J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center in 1999.
    After law school, she clerked for several Federal judges. 
First, at home, in the Western District of Tennessee, where she 
clerked for Judge Jerome Turner, and later she clerked for 
Judge Warren Ferguson on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Those early days also included a period working in private 
practice, where she focused on complex litigation and white 
collar defense, and where she first developed a pro bono 
practice.
    Later, in addition to serving as an independent legal 
consultant, she began teaching as a professor at UC, Hastings 
College of Law. Her commitment to equal justice was reflected 
in the co-founding of the Hastings Institute for Criminal 
Justice.
    And in December of 2018, Governor Brown appointed Judge Lee 
to serve on the Alameda County Superior Court, where she became 
the first Korean American ever appointed to serve on that 
bench.
    Over the last 5 years, she's presided over both civil and 
criminal matters, gaining immense and important experience in 
demonstrating a wealth of legal expertise. And throughout her 
20 years of diverse experiencing--experience practicing law, 
she helped to support and mentor women, people of color, and 
others, typically underrepresented in the legal profession.
    Why? It's because Judge Lee serves our country every day 
knowing that our justice system works best when it reflects the 
diversity of the country that it serves. So, colleagues in 
private practice, in the classroom, and in the courtroom, she's 
demonstrated the intellect, the temperament, and independent 
thinking needed to not just serve on the Federal bench, but to 
serve with distinction.
    And I encourage my colleagues to join me in proudly 
supporting her nomination today. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Padilla.
    I'm pleased to introduce Ms. Deborah Robinson nominated to 
be the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator. Born in 
Philadelphia, she attended Howard University and earned her 
J.D. from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. She began 
her career in private practice--after beginning her career in 
private practice, she served in the Philadelphia district 
attorney's office for 7 years.
    In 2005, relevant to this nomination, she joined the 
Recording Industry Association of America, providing guidance 
and legal support for criminal investigations and prosecutions 
of illegal distributions of sound recordings.
    Spent 10 years with Paramount Global as vice president and 
senior counsel in content protection. And over the course of 
her career, handled content protection and IP matters at 
Federal and State levels.
    She's created and implemented global anti-piracy 
strategies, managed civil litigation, consulted on a number of 
legal matters pertaining to entertainment and content 
protection. I look forward to hearing more about her breadth of 
experience when her panel is called a little later. 
Congratulations to Ms. Robinson and her family.
    Now, there are three levels of Article III courts. Of 
course, we're all familiar with the district court level, then 
the circuit court level, and of course, the Supreme Court. In 
deference to that ranking, we will start with the two circuit 
court nominees, and I ask them to come forward.
    Mr. Federico and Judge Kolar, if you each approach the 
table and stand to be sworn. If you'll raise your right hand.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Chair Durbin. Let the record reflect that both nominees 
have answered in the affirmative, and that makes my job easier. 
And we'll start with Mr. Federico. Please proceed with your 
opening statement.

STATEMENT OF RICHARD E. N. FEDERICO, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
           STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT

    Mr. Federico. Good morning, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Graham, and Members of the Committee. It is truly my honor to 
be sitting before you today.
    I first want to thank President Biden for the special trust 
and confidence he's placed within me with this nomination. I 
want to thank Senator Jerry Moran and Senator Roger Marshall, 
from the great State of Kansas, for the graciousness they have 
shown me throughout this process. And in particular, Senator 
Moran, for his introductory remarks this morning.
    I want to acknowledge the nearly three decades of service 
of the Honorable Mary Beck Briscoe of Kansas to the circuit 
court. Her service on that court has my respect and admiration.
    I want to introduce and thank my parents, who I know are 
watching: Judy Federico in Florida; my stepmother, Greta 
Federico, and father, Rick Federico, in Arizona. To my many 
friends, family, shipmates, and colleagues, I say thank you for 
your support.
    I would like to introduce some who are with me here this 
morning: my sister, Jenny Stout, who flew in this morning from 
Indianapolis; my law school classmate and longtime friend, 
Christie Mizer, with her husband, Navy Captain Brian Mizer, who 
is my longtime Navy shipmate and best Navy friend; my law 
school classmate, fellow Kansan, and good friend, Jennie 
Guttery; and my former colleague and friend, Lieutenant Colonel 
Amy Fitzgibbons, of the Army JAG Corps.
    To the Navy, I would not be sitting here today before you 
but for the training, experience, and opportunities that I was 
afforded while serving as a naval officer, and the persons I 
was able to serve with in uniform. For almost my entire adult 
life, I've had the honor and pleasure to serve as a Navy judge 
advocate. And I'm especially proud to be sitting here today 
next to a fellow naval officer and fellow nominee in Judge 
Kolar.
    The Navy gave me the confidence as a leader-lawyer, which 
has carried me in my legal career. And having served in joint 
commands, I know my remarks are equally applicable to all 
branches of our Armed Services. But in my opinion, the Judge 
Advocates General's Corps is the crown jewel of our legal 
system. You will never find another group of legal 
professionals more dedicated to service and to upholding the 
rule of law than the JAG Corps, and I'm grateful to be a part 
of it.
    I'm also fortunate to serve as a Federal public defender, 
first in the District of Oregon, now with the District of 
Kansas. Public defenders are dedicated public servants and 
tireless advocates. To my many brilliant friends and colleagues 
in the public defender offices who have my utmost respect and 
gratitude, I say thank you.
    I would like to introduce our daughters, Mia and Libby, who 
I'm excited were able to join us here in Washington this 
morning. They, in turn, are equally excited to be missing a few 
days of school to be here in Washington. I am here today for 
what is essentially a very important job interview, but girls, 
the most important job I will ever have is as your dad. I'm 
very proud of you, and thank you for your love and support.
    And last, and mostly, I want to introduce and thank my 
wife, Anne. Anne is my life partner, my law school classmate, 
my ethics counselor--she is the bedrock foundation of our 
family. Anne, thank you for all that you do, for your love, and 
support for our family.
    Thank you, again, to the Committee, for allowing me to be 
here and inviting me here this morning. I welcome and invite 
your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Mr. Federico. Judge Kolar.

 STATEMENT OF HON. JOSHUA P. KOLAR, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
          STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT

    Judge Kolar. Good morning, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Graham, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for the 
privilege of appearing before you today. And thank you to the 
President, for the humbling nomination to the Seventh Circuit 
Court of Appeals.
    I'm very grateful for the support of my home State 
Senators, Senator Young and Senator Braun. I was moved by 
Senator Young's words right now, as well as his gracious 
hospitality here in the Capitol.
    I'd like to introduce some people sitting behind me today 
who have inspired my public service and made it possible. My 
parents, Bob and Brooke Kolar, instilled in me the importance 
of education and community service. And their love and support, 
in a very real way, laid the foundation for the life that I 
lead today.
    And today, I am very fortunate to have my wife, Rachel, as 
my best friend and partner in raising our four, wonderfully 
chaotic boys, 11, 9, 6, and 3, who are going to be quiet for 
the remainder of this hearing.
    [Laughter.]
    Judge Kolar. I also have a sister, aunts, uncles, friends, 
and family, who are watching, and I can't thank them all, but I 
would not be here without them.
    I was incredibly lucky, and have been incredibly lucky, 
throughout my career to have amazing mentors and colleagues 
that I've learned from. First, retired Judge Wayne Andersen 
taught me invaluable lessons when I was clerking for him. And I 
continued to learn those lessons from partners and colleagues 
that I worked with, and for, in private practice.
    Over 15 years ago, I was fortunate enough to start working 
in the Northern District of Indiana, where I continued to learn 
from opposing counsel, colleagues, and the court. And I was 
incredibly honored when the judges of the Northern District of 
Indiana selected me as a magistrate judge. The hardworking 
judicial officers and staff of the Northern District of Indiana 
are wonderful colleagues who continue to teach me lessons every 
day.
    I am incredibly proud to continue my service in the Navy 
Reserve, and I know that my family continues that service with 
me. Their love and support is what allows me to serve in 
multiple capacities, and I'm very proud of the lessons the boys 
are learning, and the people they're becoming.
    I'd like to thank, finally, the soldiers, sailors, airmen, 
and Marines that I've served with. They, too, have taught me 
wonderful lessons and continue to inspire my service.
    Senators, I look forward to your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much, Judge Kolar.
    We each have 5-minute rounds to ask the nominees questions.
    And I'll start with Mr. Federico. I think we have 
considered approximately 157 nominees for Article III 
judgeships before this Committee in the time that I have been 
the Chairman. And I would say that it's pretty predictable how 
each of us react after all those experiences and all the 
different nominees.
    There is a feeling among some that anyone who is a public 
defender is soft on crime and won't take it seriously. And 
they'll go back in cases that they defended and say, that 
criminal defendant was a bad guy, and you stood up for him and 
fought for his rights in court, and did your duty as a defense 
counsel.
    And they'll think that that really tells the story of what 
kind of judge you may be. Now, you have a confounding 
background when it comes to that because you've served as both 
a prosecutor and as a defensive counsel in your career. And 
certainly, during the time you were serving in the Navy and 
Navy Reserve, I'm sure you had opportunities to deal with both 
sides and both tables in the room.
    What can you tell us about your background that would 
assure people that you will be fair-minded, and not lean one 
way or the other when it comes to criminal cases?
    Mr. Federico. Mr. Chairman, as you noted, I have served as 
a Navy prosecutor. My first full active duty tours were as a 
Navy prosecutor, first here in Norfolk, Virginia, and then 
overseas in Europe and Southwest Asia.
    So, I had the experience as a prosecutor before I received 
orders to then go on the defense side at the military 
commissions, and then I later was an officer in charge of 
defense offices. So, as an active duty judge advocate, I 
certainly experienced both sides of the aisle. I think that 
makes me potentially understand the equities that the parties 
bring within the courtroom.
    Of course, later in my career, I've become a military 
judge. And so transferring from an advocate onto the bench to 
neutrally decide the issues that are before me in cases, I know 
that I was able to lean on my experience as a prosecutor, and 
as a defense counsel, and as an appellate defense counsel, in 
my Reserve capacity.
    So certainly in my military career, I have done both sides 
of the aisle. I know that can only make me a better circuit 
judge. As a Federal public defender, of course, I get court 
appointed to represent persons charged in Federal court with 
crimes. But, again, my job--and I believe very strongly in the 
Sixth Amendment and the right to counsel. And what a great 
country and system we have, that not only do we afford counsel 
to persons that are charged, but we demand that that counsel 
represent them zealously within the bounds of the law.
    So I take that oath, I took as a lawyer, similar to the 
oath I took as a naval officer, very seriously. And I 
understand that crime impacts all of our communities. I've 
worked with victims directly with Victim Outreach, and so I 
understand that side of it, as well. It's my hope and belief 
that all of those experiences will make me a better circuit 
judge, should I be confirmed.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you.
    Judge Kolar, I have to confess a conflict of interest: 
Wayne Andersen has been my personal friend for decades, and we 
went out to dinner together just a few months ago. I know you 
clerked for him, and he's now in private life. But he's a 
member of the other party in my State that I've respected and 
counted as a friend for a long period of time. And I'm sure you 
feel the same about him.
    Judge Kolar. Yes.
    Chair Durbin. How about this world of appellate practice? 
Tell me about your preparation for that.
    Judge Kolar. Thank you, Senator. I started at the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in the Northern District of Indiana as the 
appellate point of contact. And I was fortunate enough early in 
my career, as a Federal prosecutor, to focus on appellate work. 
And I drafted or argued over 20 cases in the Seventh Circuit 
Court of Appeals.
    And that was an experience that laid the groundwork in a 
very real way for my career on the bench now and my time as a 
Federal prosecutor. It allowed me to see how a record develops 
and how that translates into appellate practice, and gave me 
deep familiarity with the entire spectrum of a case from the 
beginning to end. It helped me in avoiding issues as a 
prosecutor when I later went on to prosecute complex cases, and 
I think it's prepared me well for the position of circuit 
judge.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Judge Kolar. Senator Graham.
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, I try to be 
open-minded and broad-minded about nominations. I'm even 
willing to consider two people from the Navy----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Graham [continuing]. Which is a stretch for me. But 
anyway, I can see why you have support of your Senators. You 
seem to be incredibly, bothly talented and dedicated to the law 
and to the country. So, congratulations to you and your family.
    My view of this process is to try to find out if you're 
qualified and not to replace my judgment for yours on political 
issues, and just to make sure that, you know, you're well 
rounded in the law. And I think you both are. And I was a 
military defense attorney. I didn't get to pick my clients. 
They came over to the office, and once they were there, I did 
my best.
    Mr. Federico, I think you were--you represented some 9/11 
defendants. Is that right?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, Senator. One 9/11 defendant.
    Senator Graham. Tell me about that.
    Mr. Federico. Senator, I reported to the Office of Military 
Commissions, Defense, in 2008 in the spring. As you may recall, 
and I know you worked hard on those policy issues, that was 
after the passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006. That 
was when the 9/11 case was first charged.
    I learned on my first day in the Office, from my military 
leadership, that I would be detailed to that case. I didn't 
know going in that was one of the cases I would work on. Of 
course, I then found it to be both----
    Senator Graham. Is it fair to say you did your best and 
gave it your all?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, Senator, I did.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Mr. Kolar, your time in the Navy, how 
has that prepared you for what awaits you, you think?
    Judge Kolar. Senator Graham, it's prepared me in a number 
of ways. First, the ongoing service of the people that I've had 
the honor of serving with really does inspire me, even as I do 
my civilian job.
    Second, when I am in uniform, I have a chain of command. 
And it's important that I follow that chain of command. And I 
feel the same way when I'm in chambers. My job is to follow the 
chain of command, follow binding precedent both as a naval 
intelligence officer and as a judge. I try to make sure that 
I'm rigorously analyzing anything that comes before me, and 
taking into account all relevant facts. And in the end, I do my 
job within that chain of command, and I'm inspired to do so by 
those with whom I'm served.
    Senator Graham. So let me ask you about problems our Nation 
faces. Do you believe that ISIS and other radical Islamic 
groups represent a threat to the United States?
    Judge Kolar. Senator, I've prosecuted cases involving ISIS 
and other terrorist organizations where people were inspired by 
rhetoric that certainly can cause a danger to the United 
States, and violates multiple Federal laws that this body has 
passed.
    Senator Graham. You agree to that, Mr. Federico?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, sir, I do.
    Senator Graham. Okay. So even though we're in an undeclared 
war, the enemy is out there. Are you familiar with the term 
``enemy combatant'' ? Both of you?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, Senator, I am.
    Judge Kolar. Yes, I am.
    Senator Graham. Could you very briefly explain what an 
enemy combatant is?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, under the Geneva Conventions, in 
particular, you designate persons as combatants and non-
combatants. An enemy combatant is a person who has the status 
as a combatant, but, of course, is an opposing force.
    Senator Graham. We have people held at Guantanamo Bay now 
under the designation as enemy combatants. Are you both 
familiar with that?
    Judge Kolar. Yes, Senator.
    Mr. Federico. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Our Supreme Court has reviewed those 
cases----
    Judge Kolar. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. You agree?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Under the law of war, can an enemy 
combatant be held off the battlefield as long as they're a 
threat to our Nation?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, I'll say, under the law of armed 
conflict, it has always been that you can detain enemy 
combatants through the duration of hostilities.
    Senator Graham. Mr. Kolar?
    Judge Kolar. That's accurate, Senator.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Do you know when this war is going to 
be over?
    Mr. Federico. I hope as soon as possible, Senator.
    Senator Graham. But do you agree with me it's ongoing?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, we've had a declared--or, that 
certain wars and certain theaters are over. I agree with you, 
however, that there are still enemies out there, and that there 
is still active armed conflict in certain areas.
    Senator Graham. Do you agree with that, Mr. Kolar?
    Judge Kolar. I agree with that, Senator. The duration of 
the hostilities is determined by the President, and in certain 
instances, this body as well.
    Senator Graham. Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. I'm just going to 
ask you each two sets of questions because I know my colleagues 
have questions to ask.
    Mr. Federico, for much of your career you were tasked, as 
Senator Graham pointed out, with being a zealous advocate for 
the interests of your clients as an attorney in the Navy, as 
well as a public defender.
    You have represented clients who've been accused of serious 
crimes. You've also prosecuted cases and served as a military 
judge, presiding in over nearly a dozen cases.
    Can you say more about how your view about the role of a 
judge, and how it differs from that of an advocate? And do you 
have any reservations about setting your personal views to the 
side when evaluating the facts, or the laws, as a judge? And 
talk a little bit about that difference of your past work, 
because you get all the sides, and how you've been able to do 
that as a magistrate judge.
    Mr. Federico. Thank you, Senator. I'll answer the second 
question first. I have absolutely no reservations or 
hesitations about setting aside my role as an advocate if, and 
when, I'm confirmed as a circuit judge. In fact, I've, as you 
noted, had that experience as a military judge.
    And so an advocate's job is to represent the interest of a 
client as zealously as you can within the bounds of the law. I 
have, of course, departed from that role as an advocate. As a 
military judge, I put on the robe and assumed the bench. And 
just as if confirmed, I would have no hesitation to become a 
neutral arbiter of the issues and disputes before me. I've done 
that as a military judge, and I could do it again as a circuit 
judge.
    Senator Klobuchar. Very good. Thank you.
    Mr. Kolar, congratulations, Judge. I think we, in 
Minnesota, we've had two magistrate judges, since my tenure on 
this Committee, that have become Federal judges. I think it's 
great experience. One thing, you know the judges and that 
helps.
    And you were appointed by the sitting district court judges 
and have presided over things like civil motions, criminal 
proceedings, settlement conferences.
    How has your experience as a magistrate judge informed your 
views of what you'll be like as a Federal judge?
    Judge Kolar. Senator, it's been an incredible honor to 
serve as a magistrate judge, as you indicated. It's an honor to 
serve the court and the judges of the court. And more 
specifically, I think it's prepared me very well for the role 
of circuit judge.
    I have cases that I have on consent where I've tried jury 
trials or decided other dispositive issues. I understand the 
civil docket and everything that goes into it, and the 
discovery process. Obviously, I have vast experience in the 
criminal area, as well. And that has allowed me to see cases 
from beginning to end, and understand what the record is when 
you're then reading it, kind of cold, if you will, from an 
appellate standpoint after having done appellate work as an 
assistant United States attorney.
    So it's prepared me well to understand the range of issues 
that come before Federal courts and how that record is made and 
practical things to consider on appeal.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Kolar--am I 
saying your name right?
    Judge Kolar. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Will you allow your personal beliefs 
to affect your judgment on the bench?
    Judge Kolar. No, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Do you have personal beliefs?
    Judge Kolar. Senator, I have personal beliefs like anyone, 
and I certainly understand the issues that the country is 
facing. I try very hard because of the fact that, both as a 
Reservist and as a sitting Federal judge, I have to act within 
a chain of command, and specifically as a judge, only decide 
issues after I've been presented arguments by the party to 
reserve----
    Senator Kennedy. You were--you were in the Navy?
    Judge Kolar. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Do you think the Navy is systemically 
racist?
    Judge Kolar. Senator, I've served with people in the Navy 
from all different backgrounds----
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, sir. But as an institution, do you 
think the Navy is systemically racist?
    Judge Kolar. I think our Armed Forces were one of the first 
institutions in this country that were desegregated and allowed 
for people from all backgrounds to serve their country and 
better their lives. I don't necessarily understand what----
    Senator Kennedy. But today----
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. That term means to everyone, but 
I don't----
    Senator Kennedy. I think it's a pretty straightforward----
    Judge Kolar. I don't think today----
    Senator Kennedy. Is it systemically----
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. The Navy I'm serving in is 
systemically racist.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. That's all I wanted to know. Judge, 
our second judge, will you allow your personal beliefs to 
interfere with your judgment on the on the bench?
    Mr. Federico. No, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. And do you have personal beliefs?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. I'm glad to hear that both of you have 
personal beliefs. You've thought about the world.
    Judge, do you think--do you think minorities need special 
help to achieve?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, I think, as a country, we have come 
a long way. There are certain issues that the Supreme Court 
just decided last term on a case of affirmative action that 
dealt with this issue----
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, sir, I'm familiar with the case. Do 
you believe that minorities in America need special help to 
succeed?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, I think all people should deserve 
equal opportunity to succeed.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Do you believe minorities need 
special help to succeed?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, again, I think, based upon a 
person's background and their work community they come from and 
what hardships they face, I hope that all persons in this 
country who work hard have an opportunity to succeed.
    Senator Kennedy. Let me try it again. Do you believe that 
minorities in America today need special help to achieve--to 
succeed?
    Mr. Federico. Again, Senator, from all persons, no matter 
what community they come from----
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, sir, but do you understand the 
question? Am I not being clear?
    Mr. Federico. No, I understand. Yes, sir.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Would you answer it for me, please, 
sir?
    Mr. Federico. Well, Senator, I'm stating, again----
    Senator Kennedy. It's a ``yes'' or a ``no.'' It's pretty 
simple.
    Mr. Federico. Well, I believe that is a complex question, 
in many ways, that it's difficult to answer yes or no. Again, I 
believe all persons----
    Senator Kennedy. I don't understand why. You either believe 
that minorities need special help to succeed or you don't. Is 
there a reason you won't answer my question?
    Mr. Federico. Well, Senator, again, my answer is persons 
from all communities. I would also note, of course----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Mr. Federico [continuing]. There are certain issues. When 
you say minorities----
    Senator Kennedy. You're not going to answer it, are you?
    Mr. Federico. Well, like race, there has been--the Supreme 
Court----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Let's move on. I think by not 
answering it, you have answered it. But can you tell me what 
you think about the Navy, whether it's systemically racist?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, the Navy I know is not. And in fact, 
its primary focus is to be the most lethal maritime fighting 
force in the world.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Thank you for a straightforward 
answer.
    Do you--judge. We'll move back to our second judge. Judge, 
do you think that a person's sex is a biological reality, or do 
you think it's a social construct?
    Judge Kolar. Senator, there certainly is a biological 
reality of sex assigned at birth----
    Senator Kennedy. Right.
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. But there are, as you are well 
aware, issues that are before the courts, both in district 
courts and appellate courts, where----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. Individuals are raising issues 
about how----
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, okay.
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. To define that.
    Senator Kennedy. Let me ask you, you're not--I can tell 
you're reluctant to answer. And these are tough questions, but 
I want to know what you think. I'm entitled to know what you 
think, I think, before you vote. Do you think, Judge, 
minorities in America today need special help to succeed?
    Judge Kolar. Senator, I think that----
    Senator Kennedy. Do you think that's a complicated 
question?
    Judge Kolar. Senator, I think it's a question that the 
Supreme Court----
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, but I'm just asking you----
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. As you just indicated----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. What you believe.
    Judge Kolar. So with the Supreme Court, and that's----
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, sir. But what do you believe? I know 
what the Supreme Court has said. What do you believe?
    Judge Kolar. I believe that if I am presented with an 
argument that there is an affirmative action program----
    Senator Kennedy. What about you personally?
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. Or any type of program----
    Senator Kennedy. What about you personally? Not on the 
bench. We stipulated that you're not going to allow your 
personal judgment to affect your decisions on the bench, and I 
believe you. Do you think minorities need special help to 
succeed in America today? That's a pretty basic question.
    Judge Kolar. I think that question, Senator, is one that 
the courts will struggle with after----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay, I'm way over. I just can't believe 
neither one of you gentlemen will answer my question. I just 
can't. And that's about as fundamental as you get in terms of 
America today. And I really am disappointed. I thought you 
would hit it head on. You're going to have tough questions on 
the bench now. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Padilla.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I don't want to be 
too repetitive. A lot of the important questions and issues 
have been raised already, so I'll focus on just one.
    Anybody who's observed my questions of similar nominees 
over the last few years know that I care a lot about diversity. 
I think most people appreciate that the diversity of our 
country is a strength for us.
    We talk a lot about diversity, not just in the diversity of 
the nominees that have come from the President, across 
Government, but also in all levels of the judiciary. But beyond 
the diversity of the people who sit on the bench, I think 
diversity throughout the courtroom is helpful for the 
functioning of a courtroom and people's confidence in the 
judiciary.
    So a question to each of you is this, if you're fortunate 
enough to be confirmed--because you're always trained to 
preface every answer with that--what would you--well, first of 
all, do you agree with my value statement about diversity? And 
if you do, what would you do to ensure diversity in the 
courtroom? Not just among support staff or bailiffs, but 
specifically, I want to hear about law clerks.
    Because the other flip side of this question is, tell me if 
your experience or observation is different. But a quality 
clerkship experience can be very pivotal for a young lawyer 
that maybe seeks to serve on the bench one day, or be a leader 
in private practice, or elsewhere in the legal career.
    So, do you agree with my value statement on diversity? And 
what would you do to foster diversity in your courtroom? Mr. 
Federico.
    Mr. Federico. Senator, first of all, I absolutely agree 
with you. And second, you mentioned clerkships in particular. I 
believe, and very strongly, that the diversity of viewpoint is 
extremely important. I would want clerks who come from a 
variety of communities, diversity in the broadest sense, who 
are not afraid to challenge my view of the law so that we can, 
as a group, produce a better quality in the opinions that come 
out of my chambers, if I'm confirmed.
    I also view judges as leaders within the legal community, 
and it would be my responsibility, if confirmed, to hire and 
train the next generation of leaders. So I want clerks who will 
come in with an open mind, with a diverse viewpoint and 
opinions, who are not afraid to express those opinions even 
when they differ from mine, and who want to be leaders within 
their legal communities.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you. Judge Kolar.
    Judge Kolar. Senator, I agree with those comments. I find 
that organizations that are able to have individuals from all 
backgrounds are better able to execute their mission, frankly, 
whether that's in the military or whether that is in chambers.
    I certainly will strive to make sure that when I'm hiring 
clerks, I'm first conducting the outreach that's necessary to 
make sure that everyone's aware of the value of the clerkship 
experience, and that the clerkship experience is available to 
them.
    As Senator Durbin mentioned at the outset, I was very 
fortunate to have a clerkship with Judge Andersen that taught 
me an amazing amount, and introduced me to many people in the 
legal community. And that's the type of thing that I would hope 
for anyone who comes through my chambers.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, both.
    Mr. Chair, in closing, let me just state for the Committee: 
Let's not obfuscate ``equal treatment'' and ``equal 
opportunity'' with ``special treatment,'' as some would 
suggest. Thank you.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Senator Padilla. Senator 
Hawley. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see Senator Blackburn walk in. 
Senator Blackburn, you're recognized.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
for being here, and congratulations on your nominations. And 
you guys are doing great. All the kids in here today are doing 
a great job. So, good parenting.
    Mr. Kolar, I want to come to you on the Gibson case. And 
this is--do you remember that case?
    Judge Kolar. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Blackburn. The defendant? Okay. Mr. Gibson, he was 
charged with three counts of bank fraud and one of aggravated 
identity theft. And I think we would agree these are pretty 
serious offenses, and both the Government and the Probation 
Office recommended that Mr. Gibson be detained pending trial.
    But you decided to ignore that and to release him. And even 
when you did this, you noted his long arrest record and the 
numerous pending charges that were there in his multiple 
failures to appear in court. So, you noted every bit of that.
    And then your word defining it was to say it was, 
``troubling,'' that he had had these attempts to flee. And 
despite every bit of that, your recognition of it, your 
admission of it, your mentioning it, you decided that he should 
be released pending trial. And I would just like to know why 
you made that decision.
    And the reason is because in Tennessee, as I talked to 
Tennesseans, what bothers them is the rise in crime, the fact 
that prosecutors will not prosecute, and that judges will not 
sentence people. So, as I reviewed your record, that one stood 
out to me. So, I would like to know why you decided to release 
him pending trial.
    Judge Kolar. Senator, public safety is incredibly 
important. It's something that I worked for within the confines 
of the legal system.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Well then, let me stop you right 
there. Because you also made the statement that he is, and I'm 
quoting you, ``likely a danger to the community. He may attempt 
to flee.'' So, public safety was not the priority.
    Judge Kolar. Senator----
    Senator Blackburn. Okay.
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. I work in a hierarchical system, 
and in that case, I specifically noted that I did not have 
briefs in front of me. And I subsequently have indicated to 
both the prosecution and defense that if anyone were to brief 
that issue, I would consider it. And let me explain what that 
issue was.
    The Bail Reform Act, and binding precedent, tells me when I 
can release a defendant on conditions, or when that defendant 
should be detained pending trial. I'm bound by the Bail Reform 
Act that was passed by this body. The Bail Reform Act itself is 
written in a way that I had to make a decision without briefs 
and without a good degree of caselaw in a quick circumstance 
where the Government was focusing on one prong. Under the Bail 
Reform Act, there's two things that are usually argued, whether 
they're in conditions or combinations of----
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. So, you're saying it was a process 
decision?
    Judge Kolar. It was a decision that I felt I was bound by--
--
    Senator Blackburn. Okay.
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. The plain meaning of the Bail 
Reform Act. And I made clear in my decision, in writing, that--
--
    Senator Blackburn. Okay.
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. I had to make that finding on 
that----
    Senator Blackburn. All right. Let me----
    Judge Kolar [continuing]. Particular record and made 
clear----
    Senator Blackburn. Let me move on. I do have a question for 
Mr. Federico. And this concerns the Gann case. You recall that 
one?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Blackburn. Okay. Now, Mr. Gann had a habit of 
collecting child pornography, and he did this for years and 
years and years, and he sought out other offenders online to 
discuss torturing and sexually exploiting children.
    He ended up pleading guilty to distributing child 
pornography, and he could have received a sentence, the size, 
20 years? And that is under the guidelines, but you advocated 
for a sentence far below those guidelines, and just for 9 
years. Is that correct?
    Mr. Federico. I don't remember the particulars of our 
sentencing recommendation, Senator, but I know I asked for a 
lower sentence than the Government did.
    Senator Blackburn. And why would you do that?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, I recall there were some objections 
to those guidelines that were sustained by the court. I don't 
recall how his final sentence was reflected in regards to the 
guideline range. I do know he was sentenced to over 10 years in 
Federal prison.
    Senator Blackburn. Would you like to go back and look at 
that case so that you refresh your memory and then submit a 
fuller answer for the record?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, I'm happy to do so.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Federico, let's keep talking about the Gann case that 
Senator Blackburn was just asking you about. This is a case 
where the sentencing guidelines recommended up to 240 months in 
prison. The guidelines range was 210 to 240. Do you remember 
what range you--or, what number you asked for from the court as 
his attorney?
    Mr. Federico. I'm sorry, Senator. I don't recall the 
exact----
    Senator Hawley. It's 105.
    Mr. Federico [continuing]. Sentencing----
    Senator Hawley. So less than half of the lowest end of the 
guidelines range. Now, the Government, in this case, said that 
it was being very lenient. I've just read their sentencing 
memorandum and yours. I have them all right here. The 
Government said it was being very lenient.
    Do you remember what they recommended to the court?
    Mr. Federico. I'm sorry, Senator. I do not.
    Senator Hawley. One hundred and eighty-nine months--189. 
You pushed for 105. What--why is that?
    Mr. Federico. Well, Senator, I'll note first, I've 
prosecuted those cases in equal number to the number I've 
defended. And so I have worked with victims and I understand--
--
    Senator Hawley. So what would you say to the victims in 
this case who--let's just review Mr. Gann. I'm not--I'm not 
going to read the specifics. It's too revolting. But let me 
just--here's, this is from the presentence report: ``This 
particular defendant''--this is sanitized, but it's still 
unpleasant--``The defendant used multiple mediums to access, 
obtain, and distribute depictions of child rape, bondage, and 
sexual exploitation. He used dating websites to meet people 
offering children for sex. He used email to send depictions of 
child sexual exploitation to his cohorts.''
    Why, why 100 months? I mean, listen, you could have 
recommended any number of--I get that you want to defend your 
client, sure. But you could have chosen 175. You could have 
agreed with the Government, 189, which they characterized 
already below guideline sentencing, quite lenient. You 
advocated for 100.
    I mean, do you think that that's a sentence that does 
justice to his victims? You say you prosecuted these cases?
    Mr. Federico. Yes. Well, Senator, yes. You noted the 
difference between when I'm court appointed to represent them 
and, zealously, their interests compared to when I prosecute 
them. But ultimately, the decision as to the appropriate 
sentence in that case, like all others, lied with the district 
judge, Judge Broomes.
    Senator Hawley. Right. But you made a choice to recommend 
and to advocate for a particular sentence. Right? I mean, I'm 
looking at your memorandum right here. You did author it, I 
think. Right?
    Mr. Federico. Well, Senator, also, when formulating a 
sentencing recommendation, the client's objectives also weigh 
heavily upon what we would ask the court to do when it----
    Senator Hawley. Well, I'm sure the client would like to 
have zero time in prison. So, if you were going to rec--just 
regurgitate what your client wanted, I'm sure he didn't want to 
be in prison at all.
    So some of the arguments that you made, you said that he 
had a work history that demonstrated that he was employable. 
Why should that result in a sentence of 100 months below the 
lowest guideline recommendation? I mean, how does--how does 
that help his victims? I'm just--I'm trying to understand here 
why you advocated this sentence for this individual.
    Mr. Federico. Well, Senator, the Sentencing Statute 3553(a) 
tells the district court that it must take into account his 
history and characteristics. And so it is my job, as his court-
appointed advocate, to present to the court information for it 
to take into consideration. Things like employment. And so----
    Senator Hawley. So you're--you're totally comfortable with 
this? You don't have any regrets about this at all?
    Mr. Federico. Well, Senator, also, as a defense lawyer, of 
course, when I am court appointed to represent someone, it's 
not a personal endorsement upon their conduct. It is my job 
under our Sixth Amendment----
    Senator Hawley. But nor are you an automaton, Mr. Federico. 
You're an officer of the court. You're a very capable attorney. 
You have to make moral judgments as a defense attorney. 
Wouldn't you agree?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, of course.
    Senator Hawley. Yes. You have ethical obligations as a 
defense attorney. Wouldn't you agree?
    Mr. Federico. I certainly do.
    Senator Hawley. You have ethical obligations to the court 
as a defense attorney. Wouldn't you agree?
    Mr. Federico. I do.
    Senator Hawley. Okay. So, your brain is fully engaged. You 
have a moral responsibility to society. I'm just--listen, I 
mean, you can recommend as his attorney, you do whatever you 
want. Right? But you're asking here for a lifetime appointment. 
So, I think it's entirely appropriate we ask you about your 
judgment in these kinds of cases.
    This is a case with a defendant who committed very serious 
crimes against children, and frankly, contributed to a social 
problem so significant this Committee has recently passed major 
legislation--I hope will soon pass into law--that would 
overhaul our system with regard to this crime, and rightly so.
    So, I want to know from you, do you think that the sentence 
that you recommended does justice to his victims?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, I could not agree more about the 
problem----
    Senator Hawley. That's really kind of a yes-or-no question, 
I think.
    Mr. Federico. Well, Senator, again, on that case I 
recommended the sentence----
    Senator Hawley. I know----
    Mr. Federico. Weighing factors----
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. You did. Did it do justice to 
his victims?
    Mr. Federico. Ultimately, it's the court that determined 
his sentence.
    Senator Hawley. But you had to make a decision, Mr. 
Federico. You had to make a decision, as his attorney and an 
officer of the court, whether this was appropriate or not. I'm 
asking about your judgment here. So, are you comfortable with 
it? Now, in retrospect, are you comfortable with that?
    Do you think that that sentence, 100 months--over 100 
months less than what the lowest end of the guidelines was, 89 
months less than what the Government characterizes a very 
lenient sentence. The court ultimately gave him 165 months, 
years more than you wanted.
    Do you think that did justice to his victims?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, again, it wasn't my decision as to 
his ultimate sentence. It was my decision----
    Senator Hawley. I don't understand why you won't answer 
this question. I mean, isn't the answer yes if you're 
comfortable with it as his attorney? You can't blink your own 
responsibility in making the recommendation. Right?
    Mr. Federico. Well, Senator, I just don't recall, in 
particular, in that case----
    Senator Hawley. What's to recall. We've talked about all 
the salient details. I just read to you your memorandum.
    Mr. Federico. Well, I don't recall exactly how it landed on 
the specific sentencing recommendation that we made to the 
court.
    Senator Hawley. Yes. That sounds to me like, you know, it 
was a bad idea. It was way low. Way, way low----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Senator Hawley [continuing]. And now you can't defend it. 
And frankly, neither can I. And for that reason, among others, 
I'm going to oppose your nomination. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Mr. Federico, did you say that you prosecuted 
cases of this nature as well?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, Mr. Chairman, I have.
    Chair Durbin. How did you happen to end up as a defense 
counsel in this case?
    Mr. Federico. I was court appointed by the district court.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Senator Welch.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. I came in at the end, 
but I used to be a public defender. And like you, I didn't 
choose who I represented. And oftentimes it was a very 
uncomfortable situation because who of us doesn't have enormous 
sympathy for victims. So, that's a--that's a hard role.
    And I just want to express to you my gratitude that you 
took on the responsibility to maintain the integrity of our 
judicial system by making certain that everyone who's accused 
of a crime has access to competent, aggressive legal 
representation. And there were many times when people were very 
angry at me because they oftentimes mistook the role that, I 
think, a defense counsel plays, particularly a public defender, 
where you have no role, no benefit. You just do the job of 
representing the person the court has assigned you to 
represent. So, I want to express to you my gratitude.
    By the way, Mr. Chairman, I'm extremely concerned about the 
proposed cuts to the Federal Defender budget. We cannot--we 
cannot have a judicial system that doesn't have very competent 
public defenders to represent people and uphold the integrity 
of the judicial system.
    So my hope is that colleagues on the Committee will be very 
supportive of making certain that the Federal Defender budget 
is absolutely solid to make certain that the integrity of the 
judicial process with vigorous prosecution and vigorous defense 
is upheld.
    But Mr. Federico, you've been asked by Senator Hawley about 
recommendations. I'm just going to give you an opportunity, 
you've probably already done it, about why you made--and 
frankly not the best career choice if the goal is to be a 
Federal judge. This is not the chosen path, the proven path. 
Very proud of Justice Ketanji Brown.
    But, how is it you made that decision? And tell us a little 
bit about that.
    Mr. Federico. Senator, thank you for giving me the 
opportunity to speak about public defenders. And I also want to 
say how much I appreciate your remarks about the public 
defender budget. I know that's been an issue within our 
organization, and I know that there are a lot of people who 
will thank you for that position.
    Senator, as you noted, and yourself, have the experience. 
Being a public defender is a challenging, but yet rewarding job 
as a lawyer. I mean, what an amazing country that we live in. 
That no matter who you are and what you're charged with, even 
those who we charge as our greatest enemies, not only we give 
that person a lawyer, but we give that lawyer the professional 
charge that you will do your best within the bounds of the law 
to represent them.
    That is a value that is enshrined within our Constitution 
that I believe we should all cherish, we should all respect, 
because it makes all of us more free. And it's been an honor to 
serve in that capacity.
    Senator Welch. And just to answer the question often asked 
to me, how do you think, when you change your role from being a 
public defender to being a judge, you can be fair and impartial 
because the responsibility of the judge is obviously completely 
different than the responsibility of either the prosecutor or 
the defense attorney, public defender?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, Senator. I completely agree that the 
role of an advocate is different than that of a judge. I've 
been a prosecutor. I've been an appellate defense lawyer, a 
defender, and also, of course, a military judge.
    So, I've had that experience already. I understand the 
differences between representing a client's interest and 
compared with being a neutral decider of issues that are 
brought before you on the court. And as a circuit judge, 
reviewing records of cases on appeal in a neutral, unbiased 
way, doing my very level best to decide the case based upon the 
record facts and the written law, and I pledge to do my best in 
that regard.
    Senator Welch. Okay. Well, I want to thank you very much, 
Mr. Federico. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thanks so much, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to you 
for being here, and being willing to serve.
    Mr. Federico, let's start with you. During the Trump 
administration--during the early weeks of the Trump 
administration, there was an announcement made about the--some 
changing procedures for handling expedited removal proceedings.
    You made a rather lengthy blog post on the Federal public 
defender blog. I was a little surprised to see that because, as 
a Federal public defender, this is pretty clearly outside of 
your domain of where you operate as a Federal public defender.
    In fact, in the post itself, you acknowledged the 
distinction between criminal proceedings, including criminal 
proceedings, for example, for illegal reentry, which is a 
Federal offense, and removal proceedings, which are civil 
proceedings, not criminal proceedings.
    In what you're giving--in this post, you're giving advice, 
as far as I can tell, to individuals who may become subject to 
expedited removal proceedings. And the post lists, these 
practical tips for people who find themselves in that 
circumstance, telling them what to do, what to say, what not to 
say, what to do in advance, how to arrange things with their 
documentation, arrangements for their children, and so forth.
    And then you attach a separate document that gives 
additional advice, a document put out by the ACLU. Now, it is 
understandable why the ACLU might put out a document like that, 
but I was surprised to see you put this out on the website, on 
the blog attached to the official website of the Federal public 
defender's Office.
    Just tell me why--why did you decide to write and publish 
this, and how is this consistent with your role as a Federal 
public defender?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, as I recall, I was asked to write 
that blog post by my Office leadership, I think, because we 
were getting a lot of calls about immigration matters. If I 
recall, that blog post--also, there is another lawyer, who is 
an immigration lawyer, whose name is on it, as well.
    And I think we were careful to say even though we do, as 
you noted, handle a lot of immigration matters in the criminal 
context, we were simply not taking any position on the policy 
changes, or if there were changes, simply stating what legal 
rights persons may have, which is sometimes what lawyers do.
    Senator Lee. Now, you are listed as the author of it. 
There's in small text, very faint, some mention of a Melody 
Brannon. Is this another lawyer?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, sir. Melody Brannon is the Federal 
public defender for the District of Kansas.
    Senator Lee. Okay. And does she have a role in removal 
proceedings?
    Mr. Federico. No, sir.
    Senator Lee. Okay. So, it's also interesting that, at the 
bottom of the post, you note, quote, ``that the document,'' is 
not, quote, ``not meant to be, and should not be, relied upon 
as legal advice regarding immigration matters,'' closed quote. 
So, as best I can tell, this is more of just sort of a 
political statement. Does the Public Defender's Office in 
Kansas often make political statements or comment on political 
issues that are outside of its jurisdiction?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, I'll speak for myself only, and I 
certainly don't, or don't intend to.
    Senator Lee. And, as someone who's employed by the Federal 
Government and an officer of the court, is it appropriate to 
issue documents that could be interpreted as facilitating the 
breaking of the law?
    Mr. Federico. Well, Senator, certainly breaking of the law, 
as a lawyer, I can never counsel clients to do that.
    Senator Lee. Okay. And how is this differentiated from 
that?
    So you're not--so that one of the things that I found 
interesting when I discovered this--I went and found the blog 
because I wanted to see what the website looks like as a whole, 
and what the blog looks like as a whole. I couldn't tell right 
at first whether this was something operated independently by 
lawyers freelancing who happened to be employed there. It's 
not. This is attached to the official document. So, this was 
published at Government expense, operated on a Government 
server.
    The rest of what I saw on there, obviously there's a lot of 
material there, but from my scanning through it, through 
material posted over years, the rest of it made perfect sense. 
As one who has long practiced in front of the Tenth Circuit, it 
made sense to me. Here are the sitting dates for the Tenth 
Circuit. Here are the hot issues affecting criminal matters 
before the Tenth Circuit. Here are some issues related to 
motions to suppress based on this or that kind of evidence 
gathered in response to a search warrant or, you know, things 
like that.
    This one was an aberration. It goes completely outside of 
your work on behalf of any clients and can be interpreted as 
advice to ameliorate the facts, or, perhaps, even to facilitate 
the breaking of the law.
    How can we be certain that if we confirm you as a judge, 
you will be an even-handed arbiter of the law and not someone 
counseling, or encouraging, or facilitating someone in breaking 
the law?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, I will do my absolute best, as it is 
my professional duty to be a neutral arbiter of the law, as 
I've done as a military judge. In regards to that blog post, 
again, all of our clients charged with criminal immigration 
offenses have corollary, administrative immigration matters. 
So, they're relevant to each other because it's the same 
client.
    As I recall, at that time, we were getting a lot of 
inquiries, again, about immigration matters. It certainly--and 
I believe there's another name, that was an immigration lawyer, 
who was cited in that blog post, as well. Our intention was 
merely to explain some of the differences between a criminal 
matter and an administrative immigration proceeding and to 
state some of the rights people may have, which, again, is what 
lawyers often do, whether you work at a law firm, the Federal 
public defender, or elsewhere, just stating legal rights.
    Senator Lee. Yes. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Blumenthal.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, 
both, for your service, your distinguished careers, both of you 
as prosecutors, and Mr. Federico as a public defender. I've 
followed the hearing and some of your answers. And I wonder--I 
just want to be absolutely clear, as a member of the Judge 
Advocates General's Corps, you don't choose your own cases. Do 
you?
    Mr. Federico. No, Senator.
    Senator Blumenthal. They are assigned to you?
    Mr. Federico. Yes, sir.
    Senator Blumenthal. And how does that happen?
    Mr. Federico. Senator, as a prosecutor, if you are charged 
with investigating a matter, you do so. And then, until 
recently in a law change, almost all of the time the decision 
whether to prefer--excuse me, refer charges to court-martial 
was done by the convening authority.
    Of course, in the National Defense Authorization Act that's 
being implemented now, there were some changes to that. And 
now, uniformed judge advocates will make those charging 
decisions. But as a line prosecutor, the cases were brought to 
you by commanders referring them for investigation.
    And the same as a defense counsel. Once someone was charged 
and entitled by statute to counsel, it was sent over for 
request. As an officer in charge, I made some of those 
assignment decisions, and we detailed military counsel to 
represent servicemembers.
    Senator Blumenthal. And as a public defender, you don't 
choose your own cases. Do you?
    Mr. Federico. No, sir, I do not.
    Senator Blumenthal. How does that happen?
    Mr. Federico. Once someone is brought in for initial 
appearance, usually upon arrest, for example, if they've been 
indicted, they are going to be brought in before a U.S. 
magistrate judge, such as Judge Kolar, and the court will 
appoint counsel to represent them.
    Our office is there to represent most persons. Of course, 
we have conflicts, and we have a Criminal Justice Act Panel of 
really fine jurists, as well. It's our job then, once we're 
court appointed, to zealously represent our clients.
    Senator Blumenthal. You're not rewarded for, as people 
commonly say, ``getting people off.'' You're not increased in 
salary if you get an acquittal. You're there to represent that 
person, present the best possible defense because that's your 
duty as an advocate, just as the prosecutor has a duty on 
behalf of the United States Government to be as zealous as 
possible. But you are there really to make the legal system 
work. Correct?
    Mr. Federico. Correct, Senator, I could not agree more.
    Senator Blumenthal. And so the suggestion by Senator Lee 
that somehow as a judge you will skew the process because of 
your background, your adherence is to the rule of law. Correct?
    Mr. Federico. Absolutely. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. If there are no further questions, I thank 
the gentlemen who've appeared in this panel. There may be 
questions for the record sent your way, and I hope you can 
respond to them promptly. And at this point, you're dismissed.
    Mr. Federico. Yes, sir.
    Chair Durbin. We'll call up the next panel, the three 
nominees: Judge Bryan, Judge Lee, and Ms. Robinson.
    [Pause.]
    Chair Durbin. Before swearing in the next panel, I want to 
acknowledge the parents in the room whose children did a great 
job, too.
    If you would all please remain standing and raise your 
right hand.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Chair Durbin. Let the record reflect all three have 
answered in the affirmative. And I believe that Judge Bryan, 
you are the first. You have 5 minutes.

  STATEMENT OF HON. JEFFREY BRYAN, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
   STATES DISTRICT COURT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA

    Judge Bryan. Thank you, Chairman Durbin. And I want to 
thank the Ranking Member, and the other Members of this 
Committee, for the privilege of appearing before the Committee 
today.
    I also want to thank President Biden for the confidence 
placed in me through this nomination. And I'm especially 
honored by the support of my two home State Senators, Tina 
Smith and Amy Klobuchar. I want to thank their staffs, as well, 
and Senator Smith for her generous words this morning. And also 
to Senator Klobuchar for her comments, friendship, and support.
    I would like to introduce two people who are here with me 
today: my very close friend from law school and fellow El 
Pasoan, Ricardo Avila, and my wife, Liz. I'm full of love for 
her and gratitude that she is my life partner.
    I also want to acknowledge those watching remotely: my 
father and stepmother from Texas, and my mother who's watching 
from St. Paul.
    And I'd like to acknowledge my children, although I hope 
that they are now paying attention to their teachers and not 
watching remotely. But nevertheless, I want to say I love them 
both and am extremely proud of them.
    And finally, I'd like to express my gratitude for all of 
the judges and the attorneys who've impacted my career, like 
Judge Magnuson for whom I clerked, and Judge Tunheim whose seat 
I have been nominated to fill, and so many other State court 
judges who have taught me so much. Thank you, Senators, for 
this opportunity to speak with you this morning.
    Chair Durbin. Judge Lee.

   STATEMENT OF HON. EUMI K. LEE, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
   STATES DISTRICT COURT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF 
                           CALIFORNIA

    Judge Lee. Thank you, Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member 
Graham, for scheduling this hearing today. And thank you to 
Senator Padilla----
    Senator Welch. Is your microphone on?
    Judge Lee. It is. All right, let me scoot in a little 
closer. Thank you.
    So, I began briefly by thanking Chairman Durbin and Ranking 
Member Graham for scheduling this hearing. And thanking Senator 
Padilla and Senator Feinstein for the warm introduction, 
recommendation, and kind words. I am grateful to President 
Biden for the tremendous honor of this nomination, and I am 
humbled by the faith he has placed in me.
    I would not be here today, but for my parents, Seok Yong 
and Dong Seok Lee, who are watching from home. My parents were 
children of the Korean War, and like so many immigrants before 
them, they came to America to pursue their dreams. They stayed 
for ours. My parents instilled in my brother and me the value 
of hard work, the importance of education, and a commitment to 
service.
    They could not have imagined that I'd be sitting here 
today.
    I'd like to introduce those who are with me today. My 
brother, Eugene, who is representing our family, is a 
psychiatrist who previously served our country as a major in 
the Army Reserves, where he was stationed here at Walter Reed.
    My husband of 15 years, Michael, my steadfast partner and 
an amazing father--I would not be able to do this without him. 
Near him, or here in the building, is my 8-year-old son, who's 
been my inspiration.
    I'm also joined by four women who are my chosen family: 
Lori Perlman, my close friend from the Bay Area; Rachel Jensen, 
my former co-clerk from the Ninth Circuit; Renee Lee, my best 
friend from college; and finally, Beth Penland, one of my 
closest childhood friends from Tennessee.
    Briefly touching upon my family and friends who are 
watching and supporting me remotely: my sister-in-law, Sharon, 
who has worked at the VA for over 30 years; my husband's 
parents, Charles and Marilyn, who have welcomed me as their own 
daughter, and my husband's brother and sisters; and to my 
aunties and uncles growing up in Tennessee, who formed their 
own little Joy Luck Club there, thank you.
    They are joined online by my professional family, the 
attorneys and staff who I worked with at Keker & Van Nest, and 
my former colleagues and students from UC, Hastings College of 
Law, now UC College of Law, SF.
    And to my court family, my colleagues on the bench, and the 
staff of the Alameda County Superior Court, it is an honor to 
serve with you. Special thanks to Amanda and Charles who are 
holding down the fort in my department.
    And as a former educator, I'd be remiss if I did not thank 
my teachers. My professors from Georgetown Law, Pomona College, 
and my teachers from Oak Ridge High School. Thank you for 
always encouraging me.
    I also want to thank the legal giants who gave me my start 
in the law, and who are no longer with us: the late Judge 
Warren J. Ferguson of the Ninth Circuit, and District Judge 
Jerome Turner of the Western District of Tennessee. Both taught 
me the values and principles that shaped me into the attorney I 
was, and the jurist I strive to be every day.
    Senators, thank you for allowing me this opportunity, and 
for your consideration of my nomination.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Judge Lee. Ms. Robinson.

    STATEMENT OF MS. DEBORAH ROBINSON, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ENFORCEMENT COORDINATOR AT THE EXECUTIVE 
                    OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT

    Ms. Robinson. Good morning, Chairman Durbin, and I'd like 
to acknowledge Ranking Member Graham, although he stepped out, 
and distinguished Members of the Judiciary Committee. Thank you 
for convening this hearing and for your time, attention, and 
consideration of my nomination.
    I am honored and grateful to have been nominated by the 
President to serve as the Intellectual Property Enforcement 
Coordinator. I would like to express my thanks to the President 
and the administration for having the confidence and trust in 
me and my ability to carry out such an important role.
    I would also like to give a special thanks to my parents, 
Charles and Bernice Robinson. They both passed away within the 
last year, but would have been absolutely thrilled to watch 
this hearing today. Both of my parents were educators and 
instilled in me the value of hard work and exposed me to 
opportunities that led to my professional success. I am here 
today because of their love, support, parenting, and fine 
examples of what it looks like to be good citizens and good 
people.
    In addition to my parents, I have a wonderful family. My 
family members supporting me in person today are my sister, Dr. 
Lesly Robinson, and my cousins, Nancy Guy, Dr. Carole Guy, and 
Dr. Ayana McIntosh.
    Also present are dear friends who I consider family. They 
are Jimmie Johnson, Penny Carmichael, Andrea Coleman, Darla 
Washington, Valerie Williams, Jay West, Terry Cubia, Judge 
Karen Simmons, Jennifer Long, and my Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority 
sisters, who I will not name individually in interest of time 
today.
    Watching remotely, our additional family, including my 
godmother, Joanne Cannon, colleagues, sorority sisters and 
friends, including Rosa Copeland Miller and Carla Jackson. 
Thank you all for your encouragement, support, and prayer 
throughout my career and, especially, today.
    I have practiced IP in both the private sector as a 
corporate attorney and in public service as a prosecutor. While 
I could not have imagined that my professional choices would 
have led me to a nomination, I have always envisioned that I 
would use my skills to have meaningful impact on the community.
    If I am fortunate enough to become the IPEC, I will proceed 
with that goal every day. Simply put, if I am confirmed, I will 
be dedicated to working to effectively enforce the intellectual 
property rights of the American people.
    Beyond coordinating with the relevant agencies to develop 
the United States overall IP enforcement strategy, my goal will 
be to make sure that Americans know that their Government 
prioritizes the protection of their gifts, brilliance, and 
creations, and will secure the rights of inventors, scientists, 
artists, authors, farmers, and everyone across the whole of the 
IP landscape.
    Having worked on content protection issues for more than 15 
years, it is clear to me that effective IP enforcement requires 
Government to take both a proactive and reactive approach to 
protecting intellectual property rights.
    To achieve this, I would work closely with the Justice, 
FDA, Homeland Security, Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, and 
State Departments, the Copyright Office, USPTO, and many other 
agencies and stakeholders to build on the work of previous 
IPECs.
    There are four areas of focus that will guide my approach 
in the IPEC role.
    Broadly speaking, they are, first and foremost: safety and 
security of the American people. This means, among other 
things, supporting the enforcement agencies to ensure that 
infringing products such as counterfeit medicines, knockoff 
batteries, and poisonous health and beauty products stay out of 
American homes and businesses. I will also build on the work of 
previous IPECs to facilitate stakeholder-driven voluntary 
initiatives and programs, especially, to prevent digital 
infringement.
    Second, ensure that the IPEC office and the relevant 
enforcement agencies stay abreast and understand technological 
developments that affect IP rights and pose threats.
    Third, support existing international partner programs and 
work closely with our international facing agencies and 
partners to disrupt and prevent foreign-based and State-
sponsored infringement.
    And fourth, use education and access to information to 
create an open line of exchange of content protection-related 
information between IP owners and stakeholders in the office of 
the IPEC.
    I am happy to discuss these four areas of focus in greater 
detail. Thank you, again, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member, 
and each of the Senators of this Committee, for this incredible 
opportunity. I look forward to answering your questions today.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Ms. Robinson. So I read here the job 
you are seeking advises the President and coordinates with 
departments and agencies on matters of intellectual property 
policy and strategy. Seems like a pretty big job.
    Ms. Robinson. Yes.
    Chair Durbin. Pretty important job.
    Ms. Robinson. Yes.
    Chair Durbin. So, let me confess, I'm going to ask you a 
question, and I don't expect you to answer it----
    Ms. Robinson. Okay.
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. But you may try----
    Ms. Robinson. Okay.
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. And maybe do much better than I 
expect. And it's on something called artificial intelligence, 
AI.
    Ms. Robinson. Okay.
    Chair Durbin. The presiding Democrat in the Senate is 
Senator Schumer. And Senator Schumer has taken intense personal 
interest in artificial intelligence to the point where he's had 
several high-level briefings that he's invited his colleagues 
in the Senate on a bipartisan basis to attend.
    I have done my best to try to understand this issue through 
the eyes of a liberal arts lawyer----
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Which doesn't take me very far. 
But it seems that AI, or artificial intelligence, would have 
some real relevance to the future of the area of interest that 
you're seeking.
    Would you like to make a comment on that?
    Ms. Robinson. Sure, Senator. First, I think that AI is both 
a promise and a concern. And a concern in that AI could lead 
people to more infringements into more counterfeit goods. But I 
think that I need to get more information before making sort of 
like a broad comment on AI because intellectual property is 
decided on a case-by-case basis, and I wouldn't want to use a 
broad brush to talk about an emerging technology that is 
developing still.
    But what I will say is that I know that there's a lot of 
research being done right now, and, if I am confirmed, I will 
make sure that I learn about all the research being done on AI. 
That I stay abreast of conversations.
    And I actually applaud this Committee for starting that 
conversation about AI. And I would absolutely stay abreast of 
conversations, and, in that context, the question that I would 
have when looking at the research and at those conversations 
is, how will AI affect American jobs? How will it protect the 
health and safety of the American people? And how will we use 
AI or combat things that result from AI to protect innovation, 
to protect creativity, and to make sure that all Americans are 
safe?
    Chair Durbin. That's all I could ask. And as I said, I 
didn't expect the answer to completely exhaust the subject 
because it's almost unlimited in the applications.
    I was just paging through here, as well, Judge Bryan, 
because it says at one point that you have handled 8,000 cases. 
Is that true?
    Judge Bryan. As a district court judge in St. Paul, I was 
assigned to various types of cases. And adding them all up is 
more than 8,000 that I was assigned case numbers.
    Chair Durbin. Some experience. And what about trials?
    Judge Bryan. Well, as a practitioner working for the United 
States Department of Justice, I had trials in Federal court as 
a Federal prosecutor. As a judge, I estimate between a 100 and 
120 trials that I presided over. That doesn't include some of 
the petty misdemeanor trials, that are trials, that would 
number in the hundreds.
    Chair Durbin. Quite a lot of experience.
    Judge Lee, I can recall appearing as a small town attorney 
before a Federal judge. And knowledge of the law was important. 
Knowledge of the facts was critical. But the temperament of the 
judge had more to do with the outcome than almost all the work 
we did in preparation.
    Can you speak about the temperament of a Federal judge who, 
if they're successful, ends up with a lifetime appointment?
    Judge Lee. Thank you for that question, Senator Durbin. I 
would have to go back to the judge who I clerked for on the 
district court, Jerome Turner. He was somebody who, no matter 
what his views were, no matter what he had for coffee that--you 
know, what he had for breakfast that morning, his temperament 
on the bench was even-handed, fair.
    He always treated every litigant as they were the most 
important ones in the room. He always made sure that he was 
well prepared, and he treated each case as though it was the 
most important. And I think bringing all those qualities, that 
is what our litigants deserve in our courtrooms every day. That 
is what I try to do. And he did it all with this incredible 
depth and humility.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you. Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Lee, I'd like 
to start with you, if that's okay. A few years ago you 
published an article in the Hastings Race and Poverty Law 
Journal.
    In that publication, you criticized the prison system based 
on the fact that the prison system, quote, ``relies heavily on 
a dichotomous sex-based means of classification.'' Meaning, 
quote, ``prisoners are classified by their biological 
attributes, or attributes rather than their gender 
identification.''
    Do I take this to mean that you think that, in some 
circumstances, biologically male prisoners should be placed in 
prison facilities set aside to incarcerate women based on their 
identification?
    Judge Lee. Senator, that article, or that piece, was a 
summary of a panel, which I moderated----
    Senator Lee. Sure.
    Judge Lee [continuing]. Over--maybe it was 13, 14----
    Senator Lee. Uh-huh.
    Judge Lee [continuing]. Years ago. We had three panelists, 
which focused on three different populations, or segments, of 
the prison population. The piece's purpose was to summarize the 
arguments and discussions that were raised by each of those 
panelists.
    Senator Lee. Right. And that's why----
    Judge Lee. And so that's----
    Senator Lee [continuing]. I'm asking the question----
    Judge Lee [continuing]. What that is.
    Senator Lee [continuing]. About what you think. Do you 
think biological male prisoners should be placed in female 
women's--in prisons set aside for women?
    Judge Lee. Senator, that issue, in terms of designations 
or--and so forth, are live issues which are happening across 
the country in our courts. Well, important conversations, which 
policymakers are having and which we are deciding and reviewing 
as courts. And so I don't want to be--I don't want to make it 
appear as though I'm prejudging the case.
    Senator Lee. Okay. But you did comment on that, and that's 
what raised the question. The reason I'm concerned with it is 
there are a number of women who have been concerned about 
this----
    Judge Lee. Yes.
    Senator Lee [continuing]. Including a number who are the 
survivors of domestic violence who are currently suing Governor 
Gavin Newsom in the State of California to stop a California 
law that would do this. It would house prisoners based on their 
declared gender identity thus allowing, in many circumstances, 
for a biologically male prisoner to identify as female, and on 
that basis, be placed inside a prison facility set aside for 
women.
    They've raised concerns there so, what--what would you say 
to those women? And what would you say to those who, as 
allegations are now being made, I'd say, that they've been 
assaulted while in prison by a fellow inmate, raped by 
biologically male prisoners who were placed in a female prison?
    Judge Lee. Senator, I would say to them that every woman 
has a right to feel safe and be free of sexual violence. I 
would also say that----
    Senator Lee. Including in prison?
    Judge Lee. Yes.
    Senator Lee. Okay.
    Judge Lee. And I would say--sorry, Senator, I didn't mean 
to interrupt.
    Senator Lee. Well, no, that's okay. I just--it appeared to 
be a critique, if you're telling me it was not a critique--one 
on pages 227 and 228 of the aforementioned Hastings Race and 
Poverty Law Journal article, when you appear to be criticizing 
the prison system for the fact that it, quote, ``relies heavily 
on a dichotomous sex-based means of classification.''
    Was that not a criticism by you?
    Judge Lee. As I said, it was a panel which I moderated. And 
with that piece was a summary of each of the panelists, their 
views, the issues that they were raising across the board with 
those three populations.
    Senator Lee. Okay. In a speech you gave in 2016, you stated 
that, quote, ``Korean-American lawyers continue to fight 
against a bamboo ceiling.'' You're not alone in this. And I 
took it from that bamboo ceiling referring to limitations 
imposed on the basis of race. You're not alone in that.
    And what you described seems similar to some of the 
discrimination that was experienced by the Asian-American 
plaintiffs in the Students for Fair Admissions case, in which 
the Supreme Court found that the law had been violated. The law 
in the Constitution had been offended by some of these 
programs, and yet the Asian Law Caucus, of which you are a 
board member, fought to maintain Michigan's Affirmative Action 
policies--policies that were found unlawful in that case.
    Do you want to explain these two positions that seem to be 
different? On the one hand, you're describing the bamboo 
ceiling effect. On the other hand, you're on the board of an 
organization that sought to perpetuate the very policies that 
were found to be discriminatory against Asians.
    Judge Lee. Thank you for that question, Senator. I was on 
the board of the Asian Law Caucus, I believe, over a decade ago 
or so.
    Senator Lee. Mm-hmm. So you were not on the board at the 
time--at the time that case was decided, in other words. Okay.
    Judge Lee. And so, and in terms of the case, the Students 
for Fair Admissions, that is the law of the land. What that 
says is what I will be applying fully, faithfully, and without 
reservation.
    Senator Lee. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, can I ask one quick 
follow-up on this? And I'll be brief, relevant to that.
    In the Students for Fair Admissions case that the Court 
concluded with this statement: ``Eliminating racial 
discrimination means eliminating all of it. For `[t]he 
guarantee of the equal protection cannot mean one thing . . . 
when applied to a person of another color.' . . . `If both are 
not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal','' 
closed quote.
    Do you agree with that statement?
    Judge Lee. I agree, as what is emblazoned on the wall of 
the Supreme Court, that there should be ``equal justice for 
all.''
    Senator Lee. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. I'm going to focus 
on our Minnesota nominee, but thank you to the other nominees, 
as well.
    Judge Bryan, prior to your decade of service on the bench, 
you served as an assistant U.S. attorney in Minnesota, where 
you prosecuted over 350 defendants. Law enforcement officers 
that you worked with said you will make, in their words, ``an 
outstanding Federal judge.'' As case agents, they wrote that, 
``We knew that he treated every case as his highest priority. 
We believe that he will do the same for each of the matters 
assigned to him as a Federal judge.''
    What motivated you to become a Federal prosecutor? What 
cases are you most proud of? And then, what lessons did you 
take from that time that will help you as a judge, or help you 
as a judge?
    Judge Bryan. So, I think you look to the example of both of 
my parents, who--my father was a clinical psychologist after 
leaving the Army and dedicated his professional life to helping 
people. My mother was a public school teacher throughout her 
life, 35 years plus, of being a public school teacher. And they 
instilled that appreciation for public service in me. And I 
think that's one of the reasons I was driven to pursue that 
career.
    As a prosecutor, I respected the case agents that I worked 
with very much, and the sacrifices that they made, the risks 
that they had to take to do their job. And I felt it was only 
fitting that the U.S. attorneys who were working with them, the 
assistant U.S. attorneys working with them, would also bring 
the same sense of dedication that they showed.
    I think there are a lot of lessons that I can take from my 
time as a prosecutor that will help me as a judge, if 
confirmed. I take those lessons with me to the bench every day, 
the lessons I learned from the judges in front of whom I 
practiced, and I hope to be able to emulate all of their great 
examples when I take the bench.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. If you are confirmed, you'll 
be the first Latino on the Federal bench in Minnesota. You've 
been active in Minnesota Hispanic Bar Association, specifically 
working with young attorneys.
    Why do you believe that mentoring young attorneys is so 
important?
    Judge Bryan. Well, because I've experienced the benefits of 
being mentored myself. I know that as a young attorney, there's 
a lot of questions that you come to the office with, and it 
does really help to have someone supportive who can take you 
under their wing.
    There's a letter from one of those persons, Erica 
MacDonald, who was someone who I was mentored by as a young 
AUSA and was honored to have her support as part of this 
process. But that's why, because I know personally how 
meaningful it was for me.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes. I'll note that Erica MacDonald was 
a line prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office, and went on to 
be a State court judge, I believe, and then was the U.S. 
attorney appointed by the previous administration.
    So, Judge Bryan, you presided over 8,500 cases as a trial 
and appellate judge. You've been reversed only six times: four 
times on the district court, and twice on the court of appeals. 
I'm sure you remember each of them, but nevertheless your 
rulings have been upheld 99 percent of the time.
    Could you talk about your judicial decision-making and what 
led you to have that kind of a record?
    Judge Bryan. I, as a judge, try to faithfully and 
objectively apply binding precedent to the issues in front of 
me. I try to understand and frame the issues in a concrete way, 
but one that allows for application of binding precedent.
    And the few times where I have been reviewed, I welcome it. 
It's an important--a crucial part of what makes our system of 
justice consistent and fair. So, I learn from it every time, 
and I welcome it whenever it occurs.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. I don't have any 
other questions.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Judge Lee, I don't believe you were 
truthful in answering Senator Lee's questions. You wrote an 
article in 2010 entitled, ``An Overview of Special Populations 
in California Prisons.'' Did you not?
    Judge Lee. Yes, I did.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. And in that article, you argued that 
male prisoners should be allowed to claim they are transgender 
in order to be assigned to a female prison. Didn't you?
    Judge Lee. As I said to Senator Lee, that was an article 
which arose from a symposium which I just moderated the panel, 
and then summarized for the symposium edition, the different 
arguments and issues that were raised.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, I've read your article and I don't 
think that's accurate. You identify certain special 
populations: transgender people, immigrants, and racial 
minorities. And you're very critical of the way the California 
prison system treats them.
    For example, I'm going to quote here, your words, not mine: 
``The prison system relies heavily on a dichotomous sex-based 
means of classification. Prisoners are classified by their 
biological attributes rather than their gender identification. 
As described by one of the people in the California prison 
system, the classification process is gender neutral. We really 
don't distinguish between transgender and non-transgender 
inmates.'' Did I read that correctly?
    Judge Lee. Senator, I don't recall it word by word, but I 
assume so.
    Senator Kennedy. Here it is.
    Judge Lee. Okay.
    Senator Kennedy. And at the end, here's your conclusion, 
your words, not mine: ``In conclusion, because each of these 
populations, including transgender, traditionally has been 
marginalized by American society based on their gender, race, 
ethnicity, or status, they are often further distanced from and 
marginalized by society upon incarceration. A recent President 
said, `You can fairly judge the character of a society by how 
it treats the weak, the vulnerable, the most easily forgotten.' 
'' Did you say that?
    Judge Lee. That's what was written.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. And so you--but you're saying your 
article is just a summary of the opinions of people that you 
moderated?
    Judge Lee. I moderated a panel. There were three panelists 
about those different topics. That's what was represented in 
terms of the issues that said panelists raised.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, let me just ask you, do you think 
that a male prisoner convicted in a court of law on a final 
judgment, should be allowed to claim that he is transgender in 
order to be assigned to a female prison?
    Judge Lee. Senator, as discussed earlier, the issue of 
assignment in facilities and such is one which is being 
actively litigated in California and maybe come before me, if I 
were to be confirmed. I would do----
    Senator Kennedy. Oh, now, all of a sudden, you can't answer 
it. You answered it in your law review article.
    Judge Lee. Senator----
    Senator Kennedy. You were for it. But now you can't answer 
it. Is that your testimony?
    Judge Lee. My testimony is, that was an article from over 
13 years ago. And that as a judge now, and as I have been for 
nearly the last 5 years, my responsibilities are to fully, 
faithfully, and impartially----
    Senator Kennedy. The truth is, you believe that a male 
prisoner should be able to allow, at the sentencing phase, to 
claim that he is transgender in order to be assigned to a 
female prison. Now, you believe that. Don't you?
    Judge Lee. Senator----
    Senator Kennedy. You wrote it.
    Judge Lee. Again, that was a piece which summarized, and 
came out of a symposium edition, about the California prison 
crisis, generally.
    Senator Kennedy. You founded, at Georgetown, the Georgetown 
Journal of Gender and Sexuality [sic] Law journal. Did you not?
    Judge Lee. At Georgetown, I was one of the founding 
members. I didn't--of the----
    Senator Kennedy. Did you found it? Did you help found it?
    Judge Lee. I was one of the initial founding group members.
    Senator Kennedy. All right. And one of the first articles 
was entitled--that you picked, was entitled, quote, ``The 
Politics of Eradication and Future of LGBT Rights.'' And in 
that article, you accused Repub--or, the article you chose, 
accused Republicans of being influenced by, quote, ``a desire 
to eradicate LGBT identities.'' Is that accurate?
    Judge Lee. Senator, I was an articles editor in the first 
edition, that was never----
    Senator Kennedy. You don't remember that article?
    Judge Lee. I do not recall. I do not know whether or not I 
wrote--I edited that.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Well, here's another article you 
picked, quote--here's the title of the article that you picked 
for your journal, ``Gender is Fake: The Ongoing Need for an 
Equal Rights Amendment.'' And the article says, quote, ``The 
need for the ERA is more pressing now than ever given modern 
conceptions of gender as a social construct.'' Did I read that 
right?
    Judge Lee. Senator, I don't--as I said, I was an----
    [Gavel is tapped.]
    Judge Lee [continuing]. Articles editor who may, who may 
have--who edited a couple of articles----
    Senator Kennedy. Well, Senator Durbin may save you here, 
but I don't think--I don't think you've been honest with this 
Committee. Because I've read your writings, and I'd respect you 
a lot more if you stepped up to the plate and said, ``This is 
what I believe.''
    Chair Durbin. I might say to the Senator from Louisiana, my 
goal is to run the Committee and not salvation. I believe the 
judge can speak for herself.
    Senator Kennedy. I'm sure what--well, let me say this, 
thank you for giving me the extra time.
    Chair Durbin. Judge Padilla.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Padilla.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Padilla. I've been called worse.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Padilla. I do have a question I asked the first 
panel that I intend to ask the second panel. But given the 
issues, and if I can use air quotes, ``concerns,'' raised by 
some of my colleagues, let me try to address the topic at hand.
    Some of my Republican colleagues have mentioned, before 
joining the bench, the superior court bench, Judge Lee 
published a piece on the treatment of special populations in 
California prisons--a dynamic I'm familiar with, having served 
in the State legislature.
    This academic paper presented a factual review of the 
difficulties that, yes, certain marginalized populations, 
including women, immigrants, and transgender individuals face 
while they're in custody. There is plenty of documented 
evidence of this.
    That, the paper in question, as I reviewed, did not 
actually take any stance on any of these efforts or advocate 
for any specific position. Judge Lee, is that correct?
    Judge Lee. Senator, that is correct.
    Senator Padilla. So there was no stance. With that 
clarification, is it fair to clarify, for the record then, that 
the piece was not an opinion piece?
    Judge Lee. That is correct, Senator. At the time, I was in 
academia, I was moderating a panel. The people who were 
speaking at the panel were the experts. Those are not areas 
which I was an expert of, in academia or otherwise. It was 
summarizing the issues that were presented, the issues which 
were active, as you mentioned, at that time in California.
    Senator Padilla. Okay. And to reiterate the fundamental 
question, or concern, for Members of the Committee, should you 
be fortunate enough to be confirmed, how would you make 
critical decisions, respecting precedent, caselaw, etc., how 
would you--would you, or would you not, separate personal 
beliefs, opinions from how you would rule?
    Judge Lee. Senator, it's something which I do every day. 
I've done so for nearly the last 5 years. It is an oath I take 
seriously to uphold. When I put on that robe, I set aside any 
other outside opinions, or politics, or things which people 
discuss, because I'm focused on that case--that case which is 
before me. That's what I owe the litigants, and I fully, 
fairly, and impartially follow the law to the facts that are 
before me.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you very much.
    Now to my question. You all were in the audience when I 
asked this of the nominees on the first panel. And it comes 
back to the importance of diversity.
    Number one, would you agree that diversity is an asset to 
our Nation, including the judiciary? And if you disagree, I 
would like to hear it. If you do agree, what would you do, if 
you're fortunate enough to be confirmed, to ensure diversity in 
your courtrooms, with specific attention to law clerks?
    Because you know how important a quality clerkship 
experience can be for young lawyers who may seek to some day 
serve on the Federal bench, or serve as lawyers in the public, 
or the private sector. We'll start with Judge Bryan.
    Judge Bryan. Thank you, Senator. I think a judicial branch 
that includes judges from a variety of different backgrounds is 
one important way that the judiciary can build and maintain 
public trust and confidence.
    I do try and hire law clerks that are a good fit for my 
chambers because you work so closely together, and, as you 
noted, it can be something that really does impact somebody's 
career. And I'm grateful for my own experience as a law clerk, 
and try to keep that in mind of when I approach the hiring 
decisions.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you. Judge Lee.
    Judge Lee. I similarly value having that diversity, and 
it's something which I encouraged in my law students, when I 
was at Hastings, to do so: was on the clerkship panel--I mean, 
faculty committee, met with students, mentored students. 
Similarly, have done so since I was a judge. And if I were 
fortunate enough to be confirmed, I would try to reach 
diversity in every level: geographic, school, and otherwise, in 
terms of my chambers.
    Senator Padilla. Ms. Robinson?
    Ms. Robinson. I do believe diversity is important. I'm not 
going to speak about courts and courtrooms. I'm not obviously 
here for that. I think that it's important, as well, to 
recognize diverse creators, authors, and all those across the 
IP landscape.
    And if I am confirmed and become the IPEC, I will continue 
to keep diversity in all of the decisions that I make as part 
of the strategic plan, and remember those creators that have 
diverse interest in IP.
    Senator Padilla. And I appreciate the distinct role that 
you're nominated for, not just this Committee, but 
Subcommittees of the Judiciary Committee have had discussion. 
Exhibit A right now is AI, right, and the both promise and 
concerns about quickly evolving technology and the need for 
diversity and inputs, if we're going to ensure proper outputs 
of technology. This is one example of diversity in the IP and 
technology space more broadly. So, thank you for that 
distinction. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Padilla. Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And 
congratulations to each of you on your nominations.
    I ask the following two questions of all nominees for any 
of the Committees on which I sit. So I will ask each of you, 
and we'll start with Judge Bryan in responding.
    Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted 
requests for sexual favors or committed any verbal, or physical 
harassment, or assault of a sexual nature?
    Judge Bryan. No, Senator.
    Judge Lee. No, Senator.
    Ms. Robinson. No, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Have you ever faced discipline or entered 
into a settlement related to this kind of conduct?
    Judge Bryan. No.
    Judge Lee. No.
    Ms. Robinson. No.
    Senator Hirono. Judge Bryan, I must say that presiding over 
8,000 cases, and 100 or 120 trials, that is impressive and to 
be reversed only 9 times. Now, I note that you testified that 
you apply precedent, faithfully and objectively, in deciding 
your cases. I think you said that.
    Judge Bryan. Yes.
    Senator Hirono. That's commendable.
    And Ms. Lee, you have been questioned by some of my 
colleagues about things you have written, and ostensibly, maybe 
those things reflect your views on certain things. But would 
you agree with Judge Bryan that the way you--you've been a 
judge for 5 years now. Is that correct?
    Judge Lee. That's correct.
    Senator Hirono. And that you, too, apply the law faithfully 
and objectively----
    Judge Lee. Yes, Senator----
    Senator Hirono [continuing]. In deciding?
    Judge Lee. Yes, Senator. It's one of the things I take very 
seriously. And similarly, in terms of the reversal rate, which 
I've had, which is only less than three--I've tried to do and 
reflect, I think, as well--reflects in my record, as well.
    Senator Hirono. Regarding the--your writing that talked 
about how transgender persons, immigrants, and racial 
minorities are treated in prison. I can agree with you that--
and with Judge Bryan, that these are, I would say, marginalized 
groups.
    And basically, you and I, in particular, you and I are part 
of the marginalized groups. You know how people can be treated 
in a way that is highly discriminatory. So I can only envision 
that in a prison setting, that becomes even more--it can become 
even more pronounced in terms of discrimination. So you have an 
understanding of those kinds of environments. Thank you very 
much for that.
    Now, both of you, both you and Judge Bryan have talked 
about how important mentoring is.
    Can you just explain--describe a little bit more about 
someone whose mentoring meant so much to you? Judge Lee.
    Judge Lee. There have been multiple people. I've been very 
fortunate, both in terms of the district court judge who I had 
mentioned, Jerome Turner, and, as I'd mentioned earlier, we 
were very different people coming from different backgrounds.
    Senator Hirono. Mm-hmm.
    Judge Lee. But he embedded in me a fundamental respect and 
was very rigorous about it, in terms of the rule of law and the 
value of precedents.
    Senator Hirono. Mm-hmm.
    Judge Lee. We might disagree about a lot of things, but we 
always agreed about the law. And in terms of doing that, I've 
held that rigor in terms of my analysis as a judge now, making 
sure that I'm following binding precedent, otherwise, and 
applying it.
    And then for the Ninth Circuit, I would say Judge Turner 
always told me to go back to the community, and I've tried to 
do so--I mean, Judge Ferguson has always told me to go back, 
and I've tried to do so.
    Senator Hirono. One of the things that you wrote about is 
the barriers facing formerly incarcerated people upon reentry, 
and how important it is to provide them avenues where they can 
reenter the community.
    And recently, the only Federal halfway house in my State of 
Hawaii was closed, and this reentry facility was vital to our 
community. And I have been fighting to reopen this facility in 
order to provide these important services.
    Could you tell us briefly more about the importance of 
having a reentry program for decreasing recidivism and 
reintegrating formerly incarcerated people who--by the way, 
most incarcerated people do get back into the community. Why 
are these reentry programs so important?
    Judge Lee. Thank you, Senator, for that question. I think, 
as you mentioned, at the time when that piece was written, and 
discussing it was a relatively new issue, and one which I was 
not as familiar with.
    Later on, when I was at Hastings, making sure that people 
knew service to be provided, making sure that they knew the 
remedies which they would have is something I focused on later 
on, while I was at UC, Hastings. And across the board, it's 
important that, for public safety, that we go back and we make 
sure that people can be reintegrated within society. And so I 
had done some of that work when I was at UC, Hastings.
    Senator Hirono. I would say that every Federal prison 
program should have a reentry kind of program.
    Mr. Chairman, may I just make one comment regarding Ms. 
Robinson?
    She has not been getting very many questions, but you went 
into how important diversity is in the IP area and I completely 
agree with you because we know that women and minorities are 
not very much represented in terms of people who get patents 
and all that. So, I would expect that you will do everything 
you can to have women and minorities be very much a part of a 
system that really means innovation and leadership in our 
country.
    Ms. Robinson. Yes.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Hirono.
    I want to apologize to the nominees, and their families, 
and friends, that I have to step out. There's a roll call vote 
on the floor. My two colleagues are going to take over in the 
Committee. Both voted, I hope. So, I have to run to the floor.
    I'd like to say two things quickly. I've sat here through 
hundreds and hundreds of nominees, and you catch the drift of 
questioning. And two things that we saw--that we witnessed 
today are very common.
    One is, to find the nicest thing you ever said or did about 
the worst client you ever had, and to be reminded of that, and 
try to defend it. That is common. And people can draw from 
that, which they will.
    And the second is trying to draw each one of the nominees 
into their personal feelings. Imagine this hypothetical, and 
only a hypothetical. What if I said at one of these hearings, 
``I do not believe in same gender marriage? I just don't 
believe in it at all.'' How would that affect me as judge on 
the first case I have involving that issue. People would say 
right away, ``I want a new judge. I want a change of venue. I 
want to get somebody who's at least objective on the issue.''
    So the nominees are instructed, and properly, don't answer 
that question about your personal feelings. They're supposed to 
apply the law as established to the facts that are brought 
before them. And so they're faced with withering criticism for 
not being forthright in their personal feelings, but 
professionally they're doing the right thing.
    I thank the nominees and I turn over the floor to Senators 
Coons.
    Senator Coons [presiding]. I defer to Senator Welch.
    Senator Welch. Thank you, Senator Coons. First of all, 
thank you, Judge Lee, and thank you, Judge Bryan. I really 
appreciate it.
    And I do have some questions for you, Ms. Robinson. You 
have what I think is an incredibly important role, subject to 
your confirmation. You know, the patent process, as we know, 
has a very valid purpose, and that's to protect the 
intellectual property rights of creators. And it gives them an 
awesome power of pricing power during that period. I'm talking 
about drugs right now. During that period of exclusivity, 
basically, the creator of the drug can fix their price, and 
it's a take-it-or-leave-it situation.
    But I'm also concerned--and I respect that. What I 
disrespect, and it has to be dealt with, is the patent abuse 
tactics like evergreening, which I'm sure you're familiar with, 
or tactics like the patent tickets that are created. All of 
these are intended to, as you know, extend that monopoly 
pricing power beyond the stated period of market exclusivity.
    My view is that this has been an incredible problem for 
taxpayers, for consumers, for employers who provide healthcare 
to their hardworking employees because it keeps prices up 
because of that abuse of the patent system. And my question to 
you, in your role, is thoughts about how, A, is that a problem, 
and B, how to deal with it?
    Ms. Robinson. Senator, as you know, the IPEC does not 
create laws or create policy. But, there's--and I just want to 
acknowledge, also, that there's great discussions happening 
around the issues that you're bringing up.
    And I'm not privy to some of those discussions that are 
happening right now because I'm not currently in the 
administration and have all the information on those things. 
But reiterating that the IPEC doesn't create policy or law, the 
IPEC, though, does, is concerned about counterfeit drugs 
entering into our country and affecting the lives of Americans.
    And so, if I am confirmed, I will make sure that I work 
with all the relevant agencies to support the work that they're 
currently doing, but also to look at nuances, and new 
technology, and new ways of infringing in bringing those 
counterfeit drugs into our homes.
    Senator Welch. Well, thank you. And that's very important 
to do. But in addition to that, there is the patent system 
that, I think, in order for it to maintain credibility and its 
purpose, there has to be a focus on where there's abuse of it.
    And is there anything in your role that--is there anything 
that would be part of your role in this position that would be 
monitoring, or reviewing, or paying attention to situations 
where there's an abuse of the patent system?
    Ms. Robinson. So, once again, the IPEC's role is not to 
create law or policy, it is to create a strategic plan for 
intellectual property for the United States, and to coordinate 
the relevant agencies. And you mentioned jobs, you mentioned 
security. The IPEC does care about that. And I think that 
having a rigorous, robust, and strategic plan to enforce 
against counterfeit drugs is a way to protect those jobs, 
protect our economy, and our security, and our homes and 
businesses.
    Senator Welch. Okay. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Robinson. You are welcome.
    Senator Welch. I'll just ask you, Judge Bryan, is there 
anything you want to add to what you have spoken to? I had to 
step out to vote, as well, but I don't know if anyone in my 
absence has asked you questions you'd like to elaborate your 
answer on. I want to give you an opportunity to do that.
    And Judge Lee, for you to do that, as well.
    Judge Bryan. Thank you, Senator. I do not have anything to 
add to my previous remarks.
    Senator Welch. Okay.
    Judge Lee. Thank you, Senator. I do not have anything to 
add to my previous remarks, either.
    Senator Welch. Well, I want to thank all three of you for 
the service you've been providing throughout your careers. It's 
pretty impressive. Thank you.
    Judge Lee. Thank you.
    Senator Welch. I yield back.
    Senator Coons. Thanks, Senator Welch. And thank you, Judge 
Lee, Judge Bryan. Thank you, to you, and your families, for 
your willingness to continue to serve our Nation. I also now 
have to run and vote. I wanted to make sure the Chairman got to 
get there and vote.
    But I briefly am going to engage with President Biden's 
nominee to serve as the Intellectual Property Enforcement 
Coordinator.
    Deborah Robinson is uniquely qualified to serve in this 
role. And I'm grateful that you're willing to step forward and 
contribute to this. This is a position I had a hand in helping 
strengthen and fund, and I have been anxious--eager for there 
to be a confirmed person leading our intellectual property 
enforcement.
    And I'm going to submit for the record a wonderful letter 
of strong endorsement of your qualifications that has dozens of 
organizations listed on it. But I will briefly reference the 
Copyright Alliance, the Motion Picture Association, the Screen 
Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA), and Universal Music Group.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Senator Coons. So, even at a time when they are sharply 
divided on some other issues, they were able to agree that you 
would be a great nominee for this position.
    One of the areas I'm particularly concerned about is making 
sure that we are striking the right balance. We are, next 
Wednesday, going to have a broad conversation with IP leaders 
and innovators from across a wide range of fields that will 
include a SAG-AFTRA representative and the head of the Motion 
Picture Association.
    I'm about to release a proposal that would protect 
individuals against unauthorized AI reproductions of their 
voice, name, image likeness, and I would love to ask you about 
how Congress should balance these rights. But I know you are 
not yet in a position to, and that the IPEC does not make 
policy.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Coons. You are well trained in that answer----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Coons [continuing]. Well briefed and well prepared 
for this hearing.
    How would you, in this role, ensure that the agencies of 
the Federal Government who have a relevant IP role all have a 
seat at the table and contribute to shaping our policy, 
particularly in such a contentious and fast-moving area as the 
intersection of AI and copyright?
    Ms. Robinson. First, thank you for your nice comments. I 
appreciate that, Senator. And one of the roles of the IPEC is 
to coordinate. And so, if I'm so confirmed and I become the 
IPEC, the first priority I would have is to go to each of the 
relevant agencies and the stakeholders, and to ask about what 
their challenges are. Ask about what they're seeing, what their 
data is, get all the information that I could so that I 
wouldn't be coordinating in sort of a hole, so that I have all 
the information that is available to me. And also lean on the 
relevant departments like Office of Science and Technology 
Policy.
    And then come up with a strategic plan that coordinates all 
the efforts of these individual agencies and so that they 
complement each other in what they're doing.
    Senator Coons. That's music to my ears. I look forward to 
seeing you move swiftly in that direction.
    I came here from a global manufacturing company where, as 
in-house counsel, I had to deal with a trade secret theft 
episode where there was no right of private action to seek 
redress.
    And literally, the individual raced out of our plant with 
a--I mean, it was almost like a movie--like with a laptop full 
of secrets, and ran to the airport, and got on a plane to 
China.
    Senator Orrin Hatch and I worked tirelessly and ultimately 
got the Defend Trade Secrets Act signed into law a number of 
years later. It is important to me that at a time when there 
seems to be bipartisan agreement, that protecting American 
invention and innovation should be a high priority--that we do 
our best at that.
    Online piracy is a particular concern to me, as well, and 
it's estimated to cost $30 billion in lost revenue, and nearly 
a quarter million jobs a year. The UK, Australia, and the EU 
use no-fault injunctions to combat digital piracy.
    If I were somehow magically successful in getting that 
remedy available here in the United States, as I think it 
should be, would no-fault injunctions help empower the IPEC and 
help empower our intellectual property protection efforts?
    Ms. Robinson. So, consistent with what I've been saying 
before is that the IPEC doesn't create law or policy, but what 
I do care about is protecting American innovation, creativity.
    And so if no-fault injunctions were available, I would use 
that like I would use every other resource that would come to 
me, either from agency stakeholders or the like, to come up 
with a plan and facilitate that plan to enforce against any 
infringements out there.
    Senator Coons. One of the other things you talked about 
with Senator Welch was the importance of protecting our Nation 
and our people from counterfeit pharmaceuticals. We have one of 
the safest drug supplies in the world.
    But I have lived and worked in places in the developing 
world where as much as 30 percent of the pharmaceuticals 
available for sale are, in fact, counterfeit, which is both 
dangerous and heartbreaking in countries where access to modern 
medicine is a challenge.
    What do you view as the biggest challenge in curtailing 
counterfeit goods, and how would you focus your efforts on 
addressing that problem?
    Ms. Robinson. So, one of the biggest challenges is China, 
right now. And how I would focus with China or otherwise, and 
with any other infringement coming from any other country, is 
to work with the foreign-facing agencies and support what 
they're doing currently.
    But also, work with the foreign-facing agencies as they use 
the programs that they have with international partners to 
prevent counterfeits, hopefully, from coming into the country 
in the first place.
    Senator Coons. One of the big challenges I would argue we 
face is that now in the digital marketplace there's really no 
incentive for online platforms to be as thorough and vigorous 
as they could be at ensuring that there's no transactions or 
sales on their platforms of counterfeit goods.
    Senator Tillis and I are soon going to reintroduce our SHOP 
SAFE Act that would provide very targeted incentives to the 
online platforms to make sure that third-party sellers of goods 
are respecting IP rights.
    Thank you. Thank you, Judge Lee, thank you, Judge Bryan, 
thank you, Ms. Robinson, for your willingness to serve. I look 
forward to a positive vote on all of you getting out of this 
Committee and to the Senate floor, and God willing, being 
confirmed at some point later this year. And I appreciate your 
patience, and I, too, now must go vote.
    Before I adjourn, a quick logistical note. Questions for 
the record from Members of this Committee are due to the 
nominees by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, September 13th. And the record 
will remain open until that time to submit records such as 
letters or similar materials.
    Thank you very much. With that, this hearing is adjourned.
