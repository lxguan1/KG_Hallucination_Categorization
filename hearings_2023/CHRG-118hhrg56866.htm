    Mr. Duncan. I will call the hearing of the subcommittee, 
``Oversight of NRC: Ensuring Efficient and Predictable Nuclear 
Safety Regulation for a Prosperous America,'' to order.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF DUNCAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
           CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    Let me thank everyone for being here today, and I welcome 
all five NRC Commissioners. I look forward to your testimony 
today. It has been over 2 years since we have heard directly 
from the Commission, and about 9 years since we have had a full 
panel of all 5 Commissioners before the committee.
    This is an exciting time in nuclear energy, and it is an 
important time to make sure our laws and policies are up to 
date and will enable the full promise of nuclear energy. Today 
we will hear from you, the Commissioners who set the policies 
for NRC, to discuss and understand how you are preparing the 
NRC for the future, what is working, what is not working, and 
what needs to be done.
    We have a bipartisan goal in this committee of advancing 
durable nuclear policy that will expand nuclear energy and its 
many benefits for our Nation. Part of this work involves 
examining the NRC to ensure its licensing, its regulation, and 
oversight of safety and security is predictable, efficient, 
risk-informed, performance-based, and protective of health and 
safety. A well-functioning NRC that meets these goals helps 
achieve the broader policy goal established by Congress, which 
is to enable the expansion of nuclear that will be key to a 
more prosperous America.
    In April, Chair Rodgers, Ranking Member Pallone, 
Subcommittee Ranking Member DeGette, and I wrote a number of 
stakeholders for recommendations that might be needed to 
improve the NRC and the Federal nuclear policies in general. As 
we work on this legislation, your testimony today should help 
those efforts.
    We can all agree here on the numerous benefits of 
maintaining a robust U.S. nuclear industry. The current nuclear 
fleet consists of 94 reactors, with Vogtle unit number 3 coming 
online just last month and number 4 by the end of the year, 
first of next year. This was the first nuclear unit built in 
the United States in more than three decades. This fact is 
reflective of the fact that our current licensing structure is 
not set up to encourage large-scale growth or investment of 
large-scale nuclear projects, i.e., V.C. Summer in South 
Carolina as an example.
    Nuclear energy accounts for nearly 20 percent of our 
Nation's total electricity and more than half of the country's 
carbon-free electricity. In my home State of South Carolina, 
nuclear power generates over 90 percent of our carbon-free 
electricity and over half of our total electricity, around 58 
percent. We understand nuclear in South Carolina.
    The benefits of nuclear energy range from grid reliability, 
emission reduction, and national security. New and advanced 
reactor technology provides exciting promise for the future of 
the industry. In order to achieve this promise, the NRC must be 
ready. Its work to license nuclear technologies and assure 
adequate safety of the industry is central to nuclear 
expansion. NRC should not be an impediment to the advancement 
of nuclear power and nuclear energy in this country, but it 
should rather fulfill its mission, and that is to foster 
nuclear power in the United States of America.
    The NRC has been talking about preparing for the future for 
a very long time. More than 5 years ago, the NRC's then-
executive director of operations initiated a transformation 
effort. Building on other recent reforms, that effort led to 
continued work on transformation, all to meet the needs of 
existing and future fleets. Shortly after that, at the end of 
2018, Congress passed the Nuclear Energy Innovation and 
Modernization Act, or NEIMA, which pressed the NRC to develop 
new regulatory framework to license advanced reactors. I am 
hopeful we will get a sense today how these agency and 
congressional efforts have been working.
    From what we learned in our April meeting with industry 
experts, it might not be going so well. The NRC has been slow 
to update its environmental reviews and site and construction 
permits. It has sent uncertain signals about the policy 
direction of the Commission, leading to uncertainty in the 
marketplace. And its implementation of new regulatory framework 
for advanced reactors has, to date, been a profound 
disappointment.
    I am hopeful we can hear some positive news today. Chair 
Hanson and other Commissioners speak positively about preparing 
the NRC for the future. We want to hear about that, but I would 
like to start seeing some concrete evidence that that progress 
is being made.
    Modernizing the agency does not mean moving away from your 
core principles of safety. It means ensuring regulations are 
updated to reflect the advances and capabilities of the nuclear 
industry today. The United States has the technological and 
engineering talent and capabilities to be the global leader in 
nuclear, and we have got to return to that. We need a regulator 
that reflects this to propel us into the nuclear future.
    I am excited about the future of nuclear energy. This 
committee is excited about the future of nuclear energy on both 
sides of the aisle. We have a window of opportunity here to 
advance nuclear power in this country. It starts today with 
this hearing, with the regulators themselves, and we will 
create policy to help advance nuclear technology and nuclear 
energy production in this country.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Duncan follows:]

    Mr. Duncan. So I want to thank you all for being here, and 
I now will recognize the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee 
DeGette for 5 minutes.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DeGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO

    Ms. DeGette. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to 
all of the NRC Commissioners for being here today. You are 
right. It is nice to see five today.
    As the agency responsible for overseeing our Nation's 
nuclear fleet and radioactive materials, the work that the NRC 
does is vital not only to our Nation's overall energy security 
but to the health and safety of the American public. Experts 
agree that nuclear energy has the potential to play a 
significant role in our efforts to drive down our Nation's 
greenhouse gas emissions as we take on the climate crisis. But 
in my opinion, shared by most people here, I think, we can only 
do that if we continue to prioritize public health and safety.
    Currently, nuclear energy is responsible for producing 20 
percent of all the electricity generated in this country and 
nearly half of all of the carbon-free electricity the U.S. 
generates each year. As we work to reduce our emissions from 
the U.S. energy sector, nuclear energy is often seen as a key 
technology that can continue to be used to provide the American 
people with the power they need to make the clean energy 
transition. So it goes without saying that the NRC would be at 
the forefront of that effort.
    While there are several potential benefits of increasing 
our use of nuclear technology here in the U.S., we simply can't 
do so unless we address a number of issues first. In April, as 
the chairman said, this committee sent a series of letters to 
some of the Nation's largest nuclear stakeholders to solicit 
their feedback on NRC's licensing process. The overwhelming 
response we received from these companies was that the 
licensing process is overly burdensome and needs to be 
reformed.
    So if we are going to make nuclear energy a key part of our 
clean energy transition, we have to streamline the process. 
But--and this is a big but--we have to do so in a way that will 
continue to ensure the highest level of public health and 
safety. Streamlining the process without increasing safety is 
not an option.
    Now, the NRC has a long record of making safety a priority, 
and we have to keep it that way. We need to develop a long-
term, comprehensive, and community-driven strategy for dealing 
with spent nuclear fuel. For far too long, we as a nation have 
simply ignored this problem. And if we are going to expand this 
resource, we cannot do it anymore. Expanding nuclear energy 
without a long-term strategy to deal with the spent fuel, fuel 
rods that will come as a result, will only leave more 
communities vulnerable to an unwanted buildup of nuclear waste 
in their area.
    So while I believe deeply that these are issues that must 
be resolved before we begin to expand the use of this 
technology in the U.S., I also think that solutions are 
possible. Through meaningful engagement and dialogue we can 
address each of these issues and start moving forward in 
looking at the use of this critical technology. But if we 
don't, if we fail to address the issue of spent fuel or if we 
fail to take the steps needed to ensure that the highest 
standards of protecting the public's health and safety remain 
in place, then I frankly don't see a way that nuclear energy 
will become a significant part of our clean energy future.
    So let me just close by saying I believe there is a real 
opportunity to drive down our emissions and accelerate our 
clean energy transition through increased nuclear power, but 
only if it is done the right way and only if it is done 
collaboratively.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. DeGette follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Ms. DeGette. So I am looking forward to hearing the 
testimony and the discussion today, and I yield back, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. It is now my 
distinct pleasure to recognize the chair of the full Committee 
on Energy and Commerce, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, for 5 minutes 
for an opening statement.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs. Rodgers. American leadership in nuclear energy and 
energy technology is critical to our economic security and our 
national security. It is how we win the future with reliable, 
affordable, and clean energy to power our way of life, keep the 
lights on, build stronger communities, and keep our economies 
going.
    American leadership has been essential to civilian nuclear 
energy around the world. We can trace this vision back to the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954 that--when Congress established and 
said, I quote, ``To make the maximum contribution to the 
general welfare, the development, use, and control of atomic 
energy shall be directed as to promote world peace, improve 
general welfare, increase the standard of living, and 
strengthen competition and private enterprise.''
    With that policy, the United States led the world for over 
40 years developing civilian nuclear technologies. We set the 
standard for safety and security that continues to this day. 
You can find American know-how in more than 80 percent of the 
nuclear reactors deployed around the world. These reactors 
trace to innovations by American companies that were spread by 
Congress' vision for what nuclear can provide. That is the 
vision of nuclear leadership we are working to restore during 
this Congress.
    The world today presents serious challenges to American 
nuclear leadership. China and Russia seek to dominate emerging 
nuclear markets to control supply chains for technology and 
fuels. Here at home, nuclear generating capacity has been 
nearly flat for three decades.
    We can reverse this trend, but there is work to do. For 
example, Congress enacted incentives for a resurgent nuclear 
industry in 2005, and in 2009 the NRC had received 8 
applications for 28 new state-of-the-art reactors. To its 
credit, NRC issued licenses for the construction and operation 
of 14 new reactors over the following 9 years. Yet, for a 
variety of reasons, only 2 of those projects have been 
constructed: a plant at Vogtle in Georgia. The remaining 
licenses were terminated or in indefinite hold by the 
applicants.
    And so, today NRC operates as an agency that is overseeing 
the completion of 2 reactors, from start to finish, over the 
last 40 years. To restore American nuclear leadership, we need 
an NRC that performs its mission with the urgency reflected in 
the Atomic Energy Act. NRC must focus on providing reasonable 
assurance of adequate protection of public safety--public 
health and safety. That is its core mission.
    And I agree with NRC Chairman Hanson that ``NRC must do its 
best not to implement''--be an impediment, sorry--``NRC must do 
its best not to be an impediment to innovation and 
deployment.''
    We need a modern regulator that works in service to the 
policies established by Congress. There is no time to waste. 
America has the best operating fleet in the world. The 
performance and safety of American nuclear plants are 
unmatched. There are many promising advanced nuclear 
technologies coming to the doorstep of NRC for licensing.
    Our allies in Eastern Europe and elsewhere yearn for 
American technology and support. We heard this when we were in 
Portland and the Czech Republic--Poland, sorry, Poland and the 
Czech Republic earlier this year. Our allies seek American 
leadership on safety and performance.
    We need an NRC that encourages innovation. Key questions 
for this hearing concern how the Commission plans to modernize 
and meet the urgency of the moment.
    Will it update its regulations to account for the best 
available data and operational experience?
    Where is the urgency enabling innovations that will improve 
efficiency of operations, oversight, and safety?
    Where is the urgency to implement the reforms directed by 
Congress to establish predictable, clear regulations 
appropriate to the risk of the technologies it licenses?
    And is NRC a results-driven agency?
    I am looking forward to this hearing, looking forward to 
the discussion, the answer to these questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mrs. Rodgers follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mrs. Rodgers. And I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back, and the Chair will 
now recognize the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. 
Pallone from New Jersey, for 5 minutes for an opening 
statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE 
            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Nuclear power plays an important role in producing carbon-
free power for the electric grid. In April this subcommittee 
held a hearing examining the current and future nuclear energy 
landscape. I thought it was an informative and bipartisan 
hearing, and I look forward to building on that progress today 
as we conduct oversight of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
    Democrats have long been committed to decarbonizing the 
power sector to combat the worsening climate crisis. Over the 
past 2 years, congressional Democrats and President Biden took 
major action on climate by passing both the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, and these 
laws included historic climate investments to help us lead the 
rest of the world in the transition to clean energy, while also 
creating millions of good-paying, clean-energy jobs and 
lowering energy costs for Americans.
    In 2022 the power sector accounted for about 31 percent of 
total U.S. carbon dioxide emissions. If we are going to 
dramatically reduce power sector emissions while keeping prices 
low for consumers, we need reliable, carbon-free resources that 
can sustain output for long periods of time. And nuclear power 
can meet this test, and that is why we looked to bolster 
nuclear power in the two new laws, both the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law--we authorized in that the Civil Nuclear 
Credit Program, a $6 billion fund at the Department of Energy 
to support our existing reactor fleet. And then, as part of the 
Inflation Reduction Act, we created a tax credit for zero-
emission nuclear power and invested $700 million in a program 
to support the next generation of nuclear fuel.
    Now, the NRC has done an admirable job over the years of 
ensuring nuclear power is safe and secure. The nuclear industry 
often touts its safety successes over the past decades, but 
that success is partly due to the efforts of Federal regulators 
to stay on top of inspections and safety protocols at plants 
across the country.
    I would also like to commend the NRC for creating an 
environmental justice review team 2 years ago to evaluate how 
the agency's policies and activities address environmental 
justice. The resulting set of recommendations is an important 
first step on environmental justice, and the report recommends 
that the NRC enhance its environmental justice outreach 
activities. It also recommends that the Commission reassess its 
ban on using funds to assist environmental justice communities 
in participating in NRC proceedings and other topics.
    This is also an issue that I discussed with the FERC 
Commissioners when they were before the subcommittee yesterday. 
It is critical that our Federal agencies and commissions 
acknowledge and include communities that have 
disproportionately faced the negative effects of energy 
generation and climate change.
    Now, the NRC is also in the process of creating a new 
regulatory framework for advanced nuclear reactors. This was 
something that Congress required the Commission to do in 2018 
as part of the bipartisan Nuclear Energy Innovation and 
Modernization Act. Earlier this year NRC staff proposed a draft 
of this new framework, which is now referred to as part 53.
    In April I joined Chairs Rodgers and Duncan and Ranking 
Member DeGette in a request for information. We asked nuclear 
power stakeholders for comments and recommendations on the NRC 
licensing and regulatory process. And one common theme we heard 
in these responses is that the draft 53 or part 53 framework is 
too cumbersome and difficult to use. So I hope the Commission 
can make targeted revisions to the licensing framework so it 
can be used to safely and efficiently license advanced reactors 
in the future.
    Advanced reactors can be designed to provide enhanced 
safety features and produce less waste. They can come in 
different sizes, be constructed faster with lower construction 
costs, and be sited in more remote areas.
    Finally, I want to briefly mention the Commission's 
decommissioning rulemaking that will guide the process for 
shutting down and decommissioning shuttered nuclear reactors. A 
proposed version of this rule was published last year, but I 
remain seriously concerned that that rule provides an 
insufficient role for local communities to participate in the 
decommissioning process, and I hope this will be corrected 
before the rule is finalized.
    But it is good to see all five Commissioners here today, 
and I look forward to your testimony.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Pallone follows:]

    Mr. Pallone. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back, and that now 
concludes the Members' opening statements.
    The Chair would like to remind Members that, pursuant to 
committee rules, all Members' opening statements will be made 
part of the record.
    So I thank all the witnesses for being here and taking time 
to testify. Each witness will have the opportunity for a 5-
minute opening statement, followed by a round of questions from 
Members.
    There are some lights in front of you. If it goes to 
yellow, that means start trying to get to the end. If it goes 
to red, it is time to wrap it up. Just try to stay on time, and 
that goes for committee members, as well.
    So let me introduce everyone.
    First off, we have the Honorable Christopher T. Hanson. He 
is Chairman of the NRC, and we welcome the Chairman.
    We also have Commissioner Jeff Baran.
    Jeff, thanks for being here.
    I am going to skip over David for a second. We have the 
Honorable Annie Caputo.
    Thanks for being here, Commissioner.
    And Commissioner Bradley Crowell, thanks for being here.
    I skipped over David Wright. He and I have known each other 
for about 20-plus years, and he is a fellow Clemson graduate--
and go, Tigers.
    So I look forward to hearing from everyone today, and, 
Chairman Hanson, we are going to jump right into this, and you 
can start with your opening statement.

  STATEMENTS OF CHRISTOPHER T. HANSON, CHAIR, AND JEFF BARAN, 
    DAVID A. WRIGHT, ANNIE CAPUTO, AND BRADLEY R. CROWELL, 
          COMMISSIONERS, NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

               STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER T. HANSON

    Mr. Hanson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank 
you to Ranking Member DeGette and Chair McMorris Rodgers and 
Ranking Member Pallone and other distinguished members of the 
subcommittee. My colleagues and I appreciate the opportunity to 
discuss the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's fiscal year 
2024 budget and to update you on some of the agency's licensing 
and oversight and rulemaking activities.
    The NRC is an independent Federal agency established to 
regulate commercial nuclear power plants, research and test 
reactors, nuclear fuel cycle facilities, and radioactive 
materials used in medicine, academia, and industry. The agency 
also regulates the transportation, storage, and disposal of 
radioactive materials and waste and the export and import of 
radioactive materials, nuclear reactors, and fuel cycle 
facilities and, finally, the export of nuclear facility 
components.
    The NRC's fiscal year 2024 budget is right around $1 
billion, which is a 6.7 percent increase, or $63 million, over 
the NRC's enacted budget for fiscal year 2023. This increase is 
primarily to support salaries and benefits in accordance with 
U.S. Office of Management and Budget Guidance.
    The budget also this year proposes to use 27 million in 
carryover to offset the nuclear reactor safety budget. The NRC 
expects to recover 832 million of the fiscal year 2024 budget 
from fees assessed on NRC licensees. This will result in a net 
appropriation of 156 million.
    The NRC has realized several important accomplishments over 
the past year. To highlight a few, the NRC authorized the 
operation of Vogtle Unit 3 in Georgia. As Chairman Duncan 
noted, Summer nuclear company projects Vogtle Unit 4 will be 
operational by late 2023 or early 2024. Further, the NRC 
completed NuScale's design certification for its small modular 
reactor, and we also renewed the license of Westinghouse's fuel 
fabrication facility in Columbia, South Carolina, for another 
40 years.
    Our progress in the advanced reactor space is accelerating 
as the agency looks to the future while addressing present 
needs. Indeed, we are currently interacting with 15 companies. 
We have already dispositioned 51 technical reports and white 
papers while we currently have 33 under review. Vendors, 
utilities, and project sponsors tell us to expect as many as 20 
applications in the 2025 to 2027 timeframe.
    The staff reports--I have it here in my notes that the 
staff reports that it is ahead of its 21-month review schedule 
for the Kairos Hermes test reactor. In fact, Mr. Chairman and 
Madam Ranking Member, I am pleased to announce that we are 
going to issue the safety evaluation report for the Kairos 
Hermes test reactor later today, 3 months ahead of schedule and 
on budget for that construction permit.
    We are also making progress on our 18-month review schedule 
for the Abilene Christian construction permit for their 
advanced test reactor at the university there in Texas.
    And we have the TRISO-X application for their fuel 
fabrication facility in Tennessee for--to manufacture high-
assay, low-enriched uranium fuel in Tennessee there for that 
facility.
    Resources will--in the budget will continue to support 
staff work on the technology-inclusive reactor licensing 
framework for advanced reactors--as a number of you have 
already mentioned, part 53--ahead of the congressionally 
mandated schedule in--under NEIMA. It will also assist in the 
development of alternative physical security requirement for 
advanced reactors and a rulemaking for increased enrichment to 
support accident-tolerant fuels and advanced reactor fuel 
designs.
    The Commission recently directed the staff to develop a 
licensing framework for near-term fusion energy systems under a 
product material framework, and a major step forward, I think, 
in fusion regulation.
    The fiscal year 2024 budget request is anticipated to 
encompass the regulation of 94 operating power reactors, 31 
nonpower production or utilization facilities, 23 power reactor 
sites undergoing decommissioning, and numerous other facilities 
and materials that we regulate.
    In addition, the budget request supports increased 
international collaboration on SMRs and advanced reactor 
technical reviews. We have had quite some success through our 
memorandum of cooperation with the Canadian regulator in joint 
technical reviews, finishing six topical reports in highly 
complex areas of interest.
    Funding will also allow NRC to provide critical 
international assistance to countries with burgeoning 
regulatory programs while we rise to the emerging challenges 
around the world.
    The budget request supports our goals to continuing 
fostering a healthy organization and a hybrid work environment. 
We will continue to maintain a highly qualified workforce 
through recruitment and retention of staff, with greater 
emphasis on entry and midcareer-level hiring to address 
projected attrition and prepare for anticipated increasing 
workload in future years. In fiscal year 2022 we successfully 
hired over 250 people, and we are exceeding 50 percent of our 
hiring goal for fiscal year 2023.
    In closing, the fiscal year 2024 budget request allows the 
NRC to focus on conducting our mission activities and 
recruiting and retaining a highly diverse and skilled workforce 
to ensure the safety and security of nuclear power facilities 
and nuclear materials.
    On behalf of the Commission, I thank you for the 
opportunity to discuss the important work we anticipate in the 
year ahead and for your support of the NRC's vital mission, and 
I look forward to responding to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Hanson follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Chairman Hanson.
    Now we recognize Commissioner Baran for your 5 minutes.

                    STATEMENT OF JEFF BARAN

    Mr. Baran. Thank you, Chairman, Ranking Member DeGette, and 
members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to 
testify today. It is always great to be back with my colleagues 
to discuss NRC's important work.
    I have been reflecting on the changes in the nuclear energy 
landscape since I left the Energy and Commerce staff and joined 
the Commission in 2014. A lot has changed. We have seen major 
shifts in NRC's workload, budget, staff size, hiring, and 
overall outlook for the future. When I arrived on the 
Commission, these factors were all on a downward slope. Our 
workload was shrinking, our staff and budget were shrinking. We 
had the Project Aim effort to reduce costs, narrowly avoided 
layoffs, and essentially had a hiring freeze. Nuclear power 
plants were shutting down. Back then there was little talk of 
new construction beyond Vogtle. There was some interest in 
small modular reactors but almost no real discussion of 
advanced, nonlight water reactors.
    Today we are in a very different situation. Policymakers 
and the public are increasingly focused on climate change and 
on energy security. The urgency and scale of the challenge have 
led to a growing consensus that meeting ambitious climate and 
energy security goals will involve nuclear power, including new 
reactors. The bipartisan infrastructure legislation and the 
Inflation Reduction Act make large investments to drive this 
expansion, including through the Clean Electricity Production 
Tax Credit and funding for domestic high-assay, low-enriched 
uranium supply chain. Few, if any, nuclear power plants are 
expected to close anytime soon, with more potential 
applications for advanced reactors, small modular reactors, 
subsequent license renewal, new fuel designs, power uprates, 
and risk-informed programs expected. NRC's overall workload is 
increasing. We are hiring again, and our budget requests are 
stabilizing or even growing a bit to allow us to do this new 
work.
    The outlook for nuclear has markedly changed, and it is an 
exciting time to be doing our important work. NRC has a key 
role to play in addressing climate change and energy security. 
It is our job to ensure the safety and security of nuclear 
power in the U.S. energy mix. To accomplish our mission, NRC 
needs an efficient, effective, and timely licensing process 
that can handle every application that comes our way. This is 
an important NRC responsibility.
    Based on preapplication interactions with potential 
licensees, the NRC staff anticipates that at least 20 advanced 
reactor designs, reactor license applications, and early site 
permit applications will be under review in the next few years. 
The Department of Energy, utilities, and vendors predict that 
applications for hundreds of additional reactors may follow in 
the coming decades. NRC must, therefore, be fully prepared for 
a surge in new reactor work.
    Readiness is a multifaceted challenge. NRC has intensified 
its focus on having sufficient resources and the right 
expertise to conduct these reviews. We are focused on retaining 
our talented staff and on the significant external hiring 
necessary to do the work in front of us now, and to be ready 
for the work coming our way.
    The agency is also working hard to establish a risk-
informed, performance-based, and technology-neutral regulatory 
framework for new reactors.
    At the same time, the staff is taking steps to make 
individual licensing reviews more efficient and predictable. 
The NRC staff is employing core review teams with stable 
staffing over time, doing more in-person checks of support 
information and fewer formal requests for information, 
addressing more substantive technical issues during 
preapplication engagement, elevating tough licensing issues 
more quickly for senior leadership or Commission direction, 
using probabilistic risk assessments to focus reviews on 
safety-significant items, and utilizing data analytics to 
quickly identify schedule risks.
    In addition, the staff has developed a generic--has 
developed a draft generic environmental impact statement for 
advanced reactors.
    As Chair Hanson noted, these efforts are already having an 
impact with the Kairos application and the Abilene Christian 
University application.
    To sustain and build on this early progress, I believe that 
the Commission must provide leadership and accountability by 
communicating our expectations for new reactor licensing 
reviews. Since NRC was established, Commission policy 
statements have been used to share our expectations for the 
staff or regulated community on high-priority issues facing the 
agency.
    I think it makes sense for the Commission to issue a policy 
statement on the effectiveness, efficiency, and timeliness of 
new reactor licensing reviews. A Commission policy statement 
could address several key aspects of the agency's licensing 
work, including aggressive but achievable target schedules for 
the safety and environmental reviews, a first-of-a-kind 
applications and subsequent reactor applications of the same 
design, the ability to apply regulatory findings and analyses 
from first-of-a-kind reviews to simplify subsequent reviews, 
innovative licensing approaches and techniques that will evolve 
over time to optimize reviews, and a risk-informed focus on 
safety and security.
    I think we all recognize that this is a critical moment for 
the nuclear sector. I want to see NRC meet the moment.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Baran follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Commissioner Baran. I now recognize 
Commissioner Wright for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

                  STATEMENT OF DAVID A. WRIGHT

    Mr. Wright. Thank you, Chairman Duncan, Ranking Member 
DeGette, and honorable members of the committee, and thank you 
for the opportunity to appear before you today.
    And Chairman, thank you for your personal comments. As you 
know, we have been friends for a very long time. And if you 
remember, I was the very--you were the very first person I 
called when I was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer back in 
2008. So you are very important to me in my life. So thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. David, if you could, pull the mic a little 
closer.
    Mr. Wright. Oh, sure, I am sorry. All right.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you.
    Mr. Wright. So I would like to start by thanking my 
colleagues on the Commission and their staffs for being willing 
to work together on important issues before us such as small 
modular reactors, advanced fuels, cleanup of legacy uranium 
mines, and spent fuel storage, just to name a few.
    I am also grateful for the NRC staff who are truly some of 
the smartest and most talented people I have been around. And 
as I have said before, they do an outstanding job of monitoring 
the day-to-day safety of our nuclear facilities, and I want to 
take the moment to acknowledge them.
    As you have heard, this is an exciting time for the 
Commission. The policy decisions that we have in front of us 
will play a pivotal role in shaping the energy future of this 
country as well as beyond our borders. And I am honored to be a 
part of that process.
    As I mentioned to you all the last time I was here, we know 
what success at the NRC looks like. Success means that we 
enable the safe use of nuclear technology and don't disable it. 
It means that we continue to accomplish our mission of 
reasonable assurance, of adequate protection of public health 
and safety, and to promote the common defense and security, and 
to protect the environment.
    The challenge is deciding how to reach that goal in the 
most effective, efficient, and reliable way. I believe the NRC 
is up to the challenge. This is a unique and special 
opportunity in time, and by working together the five of us can 
help meet this moment.
    For example, I am currently reviewing a brand-new proposal 
by one of my colleagues on efficiencies related to advanced 
reactor reviews. I am also working together with Commissioner 
Caputo on a new expedited proposal for establishing metrics in 
key areas so the staff has tools to show that they are meeting 
their goals with the urgency that is required for us to meet 
this moment in time.
    And by working together, we as a commission can do our part 
to help provide energy security, energy resilience, grid 
security, and national security, not just here in the United 
States but for our allies around the world.
    So thank you for the opportunity to appear before you, and 
I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Wright follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. I thank you, and I now go to Commissioner 
Caputo for 5 minutes.

                   STATEMENT OF ANNIE CAPUTO

    Ms. Caputo. Thank you, Chairman Duncan and Ranking Member 
DeGette, and to the members of the committee for holding this 
important hearing. Like Commissioner Baran, I have fond 
memories of my time in service to the members of this great 
committee, and I am pleased to come before you today.
    The primacy of the NRC's mission is indisputable, but we 
must innovate how we accomplish that mission and do so with a 
sense of urgency in recognition of our national and global 
clean energy needs. We must innovate how we regulate, improve 
our performance, and cultivate results-driven leadership. With 
advanced reactor technologies emerging, our regulatory approach 
must keep pace.
    Significant work remains to develop the regulatory 
framework Congress envisioned in NEIMA, one that is truly risk-
informed, reflecting the inherent safety found in advanced 
designs. It is imperative that the Commission focus its 
collective effort to meet Congress' intent with a sense of 
urgency to allow safe nuclear energy deployment on a scale 
warranted by our national and global clean energy needs.
    Second, we must strive to improve our performance, not 
simply measured by safety but also by the efficient and timely 
completion of our work. As the old saying goes, you can't 
manage what you don't measure. If you weren't measuring, you 
won't know if something is getting better or worse. For over 20 
years we have successfully used performance indicators to 
objectively measure safety through our reactor oversight 
process. However, there are few agency performance measures 
that the Commission or the public see beyond those reported to 
Congress with our budget, and those are not designed to drive 
performance improvement.
    Given the business intelligence tools the agency has 
available today, I believe we should have meaningful, near-
real-time measures available to the Commission and the public 
to track the duration and level of effort for our licensing 
reviews. Gathering data on these reviews would allow us to 
benchmark best practices, discover opportunities for process 
improvements, and refine budget estimates.
    Measuring the agency's performance would also enable 
Congress and us at the Commission to hold ourselves accountable 
for improving. Releasing this information publicly would also 
reduce perceptions of regulatory risk by providing external 
stakeholders a window into our progress.
    I am glad to see Commissioner Baran emphasized timely 
decision making by proposing that the Commission establish its 
expectations for new reactor reviews. While I agree with his 
intent, I am unconvinced it will achieve results without a 
robust set of performance indicators. I am pleased to be 
working with my colleague, Commissioner Wright, on a proposal 
to do--for the Commission to do just that.
    Third, I believe we need results-driven leadership. We must 
cultivate effective staff leaders who can innovate, implement, 
and sustain change without falling prey to groupthink. We need 
our leaders to cultivate a workforce with the best talent and 
brightest minds and instill a culture of striving for the 
highest levels of performance.
    We must also empower our leaders to use their deep 
knowledge of agency processes to renew our focus on licensing 
and oversight work. Staff leadership should engage the agency 
in a back-to-basics effort to risk-inform and streamline 
internal operations, thereby reducing unnecessary busywork and 
stress on the staff.
    In 2008 and 2009 the NRC was rated the best place to work 
at a time when the agency was executing a heavy new-reactors 
workload with challenging schedules and a sense of urgency. I 
am confident our staff will strive to meet or exceed the goals 
we set for them. Demonstrating that we can achieve timely 
reviews and celebrating those successes is vital to improving 
morale.
    In conclusion, as the Nation's safety and security 
regulator, we are the gatekeepers to the deployment of advanced 
reactors. The posture with which we approach our mission will 
have a distinct impact on whether nuclear energy will make a 
growing contribution to our energy needs. Congress has made its 
expectation clear, and the drumbeat from external stakeholders 
is unmistakable. Our regulatory structure should be clear and 
straightforward to navigate, and our decision making should be 
timely, transparent, and predictable. It is incumbent upon us 
as an agency to innovate, improve our performance, and 
cultivate the results-driven leadership capable of bringing it 
all together to meet these expectations.
    Going forward, I hope the committee will continue its 
oversight and monitor our performance and hold us accountable. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide my comments, and I 
look forward to your questions. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Caputo follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you, Commissioner Caputo, and welcome 
back.
    I will now go and recognize Commissioner Crowell for 5 
minutes.

                STATEMENT OF BRADLEY R. CROWELL

    Mr. Crowell. Thank you, Chair Duncan, Ranking Member 
DeGette, and members of the committee. Thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today.
    As the NRC's newest Commissioner, I have had the pleasure 
of building positive working relationships with my fellow 
Commissioners, and it has been readily apparent that a genuine 
spirit of collegiality among the Commission forms the 
foundation for successfully overseeing the execution of the 
NRC's mission with maximum effectiveness and efficiency.
    Indeed, the benefits of collegiality are most fully 
realized when operating with the full complement of 
Commissioners. With five Commissioners since last August, the 
Commission has made progress on pivotal issues related to the 
existing reactor fleet while forging ahead on establishing a 
responsible regulatory framework to support the next generation 
of nuclear technologies.
    Chair Hanson highlighted many of these topics in his 
testimony, as well as other notable recent accomplishments by 
the NRC, while also emphasizing the robust work schedule ahead 
for fiscal year 2024 and beyond.
    The NRC plays a central role in the future viability of 
nuclear energy, both in the U.S. and abroad. As our Nation's 
regulator for the safe and secure operation of civilian nuclear 
technologies, the NRC is committed to fully meeting this 
responsibility such that the public can have confidence that 
all NRC licensees operate in a manner that minimizes risk and 
maximizes safety.
    The foundational mission of the NRC must always be the 
uncompromising commitment to public health, safety, and the 
environment, and to promote the common defense and security. 
However, as we look to the future, this vital mission must be 
achieved using a broader lens than has traditionally been used 
at the NRC.
    While the function of an independent commission-led agency 
such as the NRC is intentionally distinct from traditional 
Federal executive branch agencies, Congress did not intend for 
independent agencies to operate in a vacuum or be immune from 
the inherent collective responsibility of all U.S. Government 
agencies to advance the common good. Based on this bedrock 
principle, I believe the NRC must renew its commitment to 
safety and security by embracing the shared responsibility of 
our Nation's collective effort to address climate change and 
energy security within the context of executing the agency's 
statutorily defined mission.
    Nuclear energy provides over half of America's carbon-free 
electricity and avoids more than 470 million metric tons of 
carbon dioxide emissions that would otherwise come from fossil 
fuels. This is just in the United States. Globally, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that nuclear 
energy avoids 2 gigatons per year of carbon emissions. This is 
roughly equivalent to displacing the energy output and 
associated pollution of over 500 coal plants. To achieve an 
equivalent reduction in emissions without nuclear energy would 
require siting, building, and operating over half a million new 
wind turbines.
    Similarly, recent geopolitical events have brought back 
into clear focus that energy security and national security go 
hand in hand. Meanwhile, maintaining the current operating 
fleet of nuclear reactors and deploying new and advanced 
reactors is one of the very few options to achieve meaningful, 
near-term reductions in carbon pollution while serving as an 
important baseload power supply.
    These benefits, combined with the anticipated significantly 
enhanced safety features of newer and advanced reactors, 
creates the opportunity for advanced nuclear energy to be truly 
game-changing technology in the U.S. and beyond. However, while 
the potential for nuclear energy to make meaningful and 
enduring contribution to reducing carbon emissions and 
stabilizing our energy grid is real, time is of the essence.
    The NRC plays a critical role in our Nation and, indeed, 
our world's collective effort to meet this moment. But to be 
successful, the NRC must embrace a contemporary sense of 
purpose that embodies the challenges and opportunities before 
us. Essential to this effort, the NRC must restore, build, and 
maintain public trust through proactive and meaningful 
interactions with the public, other governmental organizations, 
and the full spectrum of stakeholders.
    Likewise, we must not focus solely on the benefits of 
nuclear energy and the power sector. The NRC must also maintain 
a commitment to safely regulating the full fuel cycle by 
asserting commensurate focus on issues from mining to waste in 
its regulatory decisions, oversight, and research activities. 
Proactive engagement on used fuel management, decommissioning, 
and waste disposal is critical to enhancing public confidence, 
and failing to do so will have the opposite effect.
    I am excited by the challenges of what we can and must 
accomplish by the end of this decade, but we must get to work 
now to maintain this level of commitment--and maintain this 
level of commitment in subsequent years to succeed. With 
adequate resources for the agency and under clear, consistent 
leadership by the Commission, I believe we can achieve our 
goals, and I am confident that the NRC staff is up to the 
challenge.
    The fiscal year 2024 budget request is an important next 
step to ensure the NRC has the resources necessary to meet this 
pivotal moment, and I look forward to discussing that with you 
today and your questions. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Crowell follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Duncan. I thank you for that, and time is of the 
essence, exactly.
    I want to thank everyone for their testimony. We will now 
move into the question-and-answer portion of the hearing, and I 
will begin by recognizing myself for 5 minutes of questions.
    Each of you talked about preparing the NRC for the future 
while maintaining its mission to provide assurance of adequate 
safety. I appreciate that. I support that and will support you 
in that mission.
    However, the NRC seems to have been undergoing efforts to 
transform itself to meet the future for over a decade. The 
future is now. I am wondering how that is going. An important 
example is license renewals for existing reactors. This work 
may double over the next decade.
    Chair Hanson, you and I talked about the staff review of 
license renewals and subsequent license renewals that take 
longer and cost more. The reviews doubled in cost and in time 
from the first reviews in 2000 through 2015 and have trended 
higher ever since. NRC is charging $6 million per review today 
versus $2 million in 2000, including for previously reviewed 
sites. This does not reflect an agency learning, improving, or 
getting more efficient.
    Now we learned that applicants like Oconee, Turkey Point, 
and North Anna, that their subsequent license renewals will be 
delayed by months, failing to meet their published deadlines. 
So how is that a sign of positive transformation or efficient 
and predictable regulation, Chair Hanson?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate 
the discussion on subsequent license renewals.
    I agree we should be getting more efficient on these. I 
don't have all the numbers about the dollars in front of me. 
Since 2015, when we have really been tracking the specific 
hours on these, we have had an average of about 21,000 hours. 
We are a little above that right now on the subsequent ones, 
for 25,000 hours. I have been digging into this. I am not 
entirely satisfied with the answers I am getting, and I am 
going to continue to explore this.
    There are some more--a few more areas we need to look at 
when we go from 60 to 80 years, but there should be a lot of 
things that are also the same. And I admit that our review 
process isn't fully risk-informed, and we need to take a look 
at that and see how we can achieve some efficiencies there and 
make sure we are focused on the most safety-significant items. 
So that is an area that I am focused on with the staff as we 
speak, and I am going to continue to do so.
    Mr. Duncan. And I appreciate the 60 to 80 years. I know my 
constituents would probably be concerned that we are licensing 
nuclear reactors out to 80 years, but I appreciate your efforts 
there, I will say that.
    Commissioner Caputo, you make an important point about 
being an innovative regulator. I am hopeful we will see more of 
that. You also talk about measuring results and references. You 
have referenced Congress' requirements for metrics in the 
NEIMA. Have those metrics been implemented sufficiently to 
measure performance?
    Ms. Caputo. Well, Congress has established expectations, 
but I have yet to see how we publicly track those with actual 
metrics.
    And when I refer to business intelligence software that is 
accessible to us, I believe it is possible for us to track 
progress of reviews in what I said in my statement, near real 
time, to show progress in terms of a percentage of completion 
but also to track hours and review. A lot of our reviews are 
done by chapters.
    So as discussions unfold and hours that are budgeted for 
the review are executed, it would be easy to tell in real time 
where the hours necessary to complete the review--how far along 
we are in that review, so that people can actually see what 
progress we are making and where any sticking points might be 
in terms of actual schedule.
    Mr. Duncan. In real time for all the Commissioners to 
actually keep track of?
    Ms. Caputo. And the public.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes, good.
    Well, Chair Hanson, let me come back to you. You and I 
talked about measuring performance. What are you doing to 
improve the metrics so that staff leaders can manage better?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have--we are 
implementing a couple of tools. One is called our Mission 
Analytics Portal, which we have been kind of piloting inside 
the agency, where project managers on specific reviews can 
track hours, and not only track hours but actually assign hours 
to resolve particular technical issues. So----
    Mr. Duncan. These are regulators or industry folks?
    Mr. Hanson. I am sorry?
    Mr. Duncan. Are these regulators or industry folks that are 
working together on that?
    Mr. Hanson. Well, it is--we have piloted this largely 
internally, and then we have got an external version which we 
are just starting to roll out so that our licensees can then 
track our progress and know what to expect on our reviews.
    What we haven't done, I think, yet is then kind of set the 
benchmarks on that. We are tracking it, but, you know, setting 
those bright lines within that system and fully understanding 
where we are approaching them or where we are crossing them, I 
think, is kind of the next step then in the management of that.
    Mr. Duncan. Yes.
    Mr. Hanson. So we are--again, I don't think we are fully 
where we need to be. I think Commissioner Caputo makes a good 
point about needing to make progress in this area. I fully 
agree with that. But we have taken some, I think, some 
important steps.
    Mr. Duncan. Thank you for that. My time is expiring. I will 
say this, that there's a lot of industry folks in the room, and 
we engage--all of us engage with industry folks, and they need 
to know certainty, timelines. And they have investors they have 
got to inform. I like the open portal for the public. So what I 
am hearing I appreciate.
    I will now go to the Ranking Member DeGette for 5 minutes.
    Ms. DeGette. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    So as all of you know, in April we had a hearing with 
leaders from the nuclear industry to talk about the challenges 
that they are facing in their operations and their planning. 
And the question I asked, which I referred to in my opening 
statement, was how the panel--how the lack of a comprehensive, 
long-term nuclear waste strategy impacts their planning and 
their industry.
    So now, here--we have you all here today. I would like to 
ask a similar question, starting with you, Chairman Hanson. In 
your view, how has the lack of a comprehensive spent fuel 
strategy impacted the nuclear industry?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Ranking Member DeGette, for that 
question.
    We are overseeing right now the safety and security of 
spent fuel at sites around the country, and that spent fuel is 
being safely stored.
    Ms. DeGette. How has it impacted the industry that we don't 
have a long-term policy?
    Mr. Hanson. I think I would say that it has probably 
increased the costs for the industry, but I think safety--we 
are able to assure the safety of that spent fuel on----
    Ms. DeGette. Right.
    Mr. Hanson [continuing]. On site.
    Ms. DeGette. Would it be a good idea to get a long-term 
policy about disposing of spent fuel? Maybe that is a better 
question.
    Mr. Hanson. Undoubtedly.
    Ms. DeGette. And would----
    Mr. Hanson. I think it is--it may be up to our colleagues 
at the Department of Energy to formulate that strategy, and 
then we are going to have the role----
    Ms. DeGette. You will implement it.
    Mr. Hanson [continuing]. Of, well, not implementing it, but 
assuring the safety of that. So for instance, in the interim 
storage facilities, whether that is at reactors or away from 
reactors, we license those and we evaluate the safety and the 
environmental impacts of that. And then the overall national 
strategy of that, the policy of that really kind of resides in 
other arms of the executive branch.
    Ms. DeGette. Right, thank you.
    So the committee sent a series of letters to nuclear 
stakeholders soliciting feedback on the licensing process, as 
several of us have mentioned. And a lot of what we heard was 
that the process was burdensome and would benefit from 
streamlining. But as I said in my opening, we can't sacrifice 
the public health and safety of Americans in the name of 
speeding up development of nuclear energy.
    So let me try this question, Mr. Chairman: Do you think 
that the NRC can make meaningful reforms to streamline the 
process without sacrificing public health and safety? Yes or no 
will work.
    Mr. Hanson. Absolutely, I do.
    Ms. DeGette. What about you, Commissioner Baran? You are 
shaking your head.
    Mr. Baran. I agree, yes.
    Ms. DeGette. Commissioner Wright?
    Mr. Wright. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. DeGette. Commissioner Caputo?
    Ms. Caputo. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. DeGette. Commissioner Crowell.
    Mr. Crowell. Yes.
    Ms. DeGette. Great. I think it is an important point about 
not sacrificing public health and safety. And so, Mr. Chairman, 
not to keep you on the hot seat, but under your leadership has 
the NRC considered safety features of new nuclear technologies 
while ensuring the same standard of safety evaluations that we 
have come to expect from the agency in which it is performed?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, ma'am. We have a policy statement that 
says advanced reactors should achieve at least the same level 
of safety as the current operating fleet, and that is one of 
our guiding principles as we explore these new reactors.
    We have dived into the--some of the unique aspects of these 
reactors. I mentioned the 51 technical reports. A lot of those 
have been about the new technology that is being deployed, et 
cetera, so that we can get a head start on some of that and 
evaluate some of that early.
    Ms. DeGette. Great, thanks. Now, if we were to reform the 
licensing process, the amount of work required by the NRC would 
increase, and Congress would have to provide additional 
resources to ensure the safety that we have come to expect from 
the agency.
    And so, Commissioner Crowell, I was going to ask you, what 
resources are most needed for the NRC to continue to ensure 
safety within our nuclear fleet?
    Mr. Crowell. Thank you for the question. You know, the NRC 
is primarily a fee-based agency, so we derive most of our 
operating money from the licensees. But as that dynamic changes 
and fees may change over time, depending on the amount of 
applicants we have or the facilities we oversee, I think it is 
important to be able to do some independent evaluation on 
safety and security that isn't necessarily tied to the fees of 
licensees. And so having some appropriated dollars to focus on 
those areas in--you know, generically and generally, I think 
would be helpful.
    Ms. DeGette. Commissioner Baran, do you have anything to 
add to that?
    Mr. Baran. Sure, yes. I would just say that in the last few 
years Congress has been very supportive on the advanced reactor 
side, establishing the framework, right? So there is no one to 
bill for establishing the overall advanced reactor framework 
that we have been talking about, part 53 and several of the key 
policies around that. That is not a specific licensing review, 
it is the--a regulatory framework. And so that has been off the 
fee base, which is good. And Congress has been very supportive 
in that area, and that has really helped us build that out 
without affecting fees.
    Ms. DeGette. Great, thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. I will now go and 
recognize Mr. Latta from Ohio for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Latta. Thanks, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the 
Commissioners for being with us today. It is good to have you 
all here again. I am going to kind of revise some of the 
questions that I had earlier.
    But let me start with this, Mr. Chairman. How much uranium 
do we get from Russia for reactors in this country?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, I believe it is about 20 to 30 percent of 
our current needs are fulfilled by Russia.
    Mr. Latta. And the second question is how much of that is 
being enriched by the Russians?
    Mr. Hanson. I guess I thought that number was enriched 
uranium.
    Mr. Latta. Enriched and receiving.
    Mr. Hanson. Yes.
    Mr. Latta. OK. Let me ask this. If I could just get a yes 
or no question maybe from all the Commissioners, is it a good 
idea that we are getting this much uranium from the Russians, 
or should we be getting it from the--from ourselves or from 
other sources?
    Mr. Hanson. I think I can say, as a matter of policy, no, 
it is not a good idea.
    Mr. Baran. I agree, it is not a good idea.
    Mr. Wright. No.
    Ms. Caputo. Not at this point, given their recent actions 
in the last few years.
    Mr. Crowell. I agree with the Chair's response.
    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you. And I think it is important 
because the question that we were discussing when the Secretary 
of Energy was here not too long ago was this. And I was just 
following up with my friend from Colorado with her line of 
questions, especially when we are talking about--with our spent 
nuclear rods and where they are being stored.
    France right now is about the only country in the world, if 
I am not mistaken--is the only one that is really recycling 
their rods. Is that correct?
    Mr. Hanson. Correct.
    Mr. Latta. And why isn't the United States not looking at 
trying to do the same thing? Because it is my understanding, if 
you can go out and with a spent rod you might be able to get 
another usage out of it if you recycle it, which would then 
reduce our dependance on uranium from foreign sources, and then 
it would also have us take care of the situation as how we are, 
you know, we are restoring it.
    Because, you know, it has been several years ago that 
several members of this committee have been out to Yucca 
Mountain, which I have got to say is the most expensive hole I 
have ever been in, at over--I think it was over $18 billion--
not being utilized, that we should be doing something in this 
country with our spent rods.
    But what is happening in this country that we are not doing 
it?
    Mr. Hanson. Well, Congressman, I can tell you that we--our 
regulations are certainly adequate to ensure the safety of any 
kind of recycling or reprocessing operation that might come 
down the pipe. I think in the history, there hasn't been a--at 
least in the last 30 or so years, been any prohibition on 
recycling in the U.S. And so I think it has been a matter of 
policy on other parts of the Government and the economics of 
that.
    Mr. Latta. Commissioner Caputo?
    Ms. Caputo. Congressman, the point that you make regarding 
domestic supply is very accurate, and that is in fact what 
drove both France and the UK to develop reprocessing, because 
estimates in the 1970s were that uranium was going to become 
extremely expensive. But it is a cost-intensive process. And so 
the economics of reprocessed uranium versus natural uranium is 
an extreme cost difference.
    I think the question----
    Mr. Latta. May I interrupt on that question?
    Ms. Caputo [continuing]. That we will be looking at----
    Mr. Latta. When you say an extreme cost difference, could 
you tell me any kind of a percentage of what we are looking at 
there?
    Ms. Caputo. When I graduated from school and took my first 
post working with nuclear fuel buyers, the difference was 
between 950 a pound for uranium and roughly 400.
    Mr. Latta. OK. And since that time, though, has the cost 
been able to be brought down from that level?
    Ms. Caputo. Possibly. But I think one of the things--one of 
the potentials for advancement here is with the advanced 
reactors that we are seeing. They can use--utilize reprocessed 
materials, I think, in different ways, just based on the 
reactor physics of how they operate. So I think there are 
opportunities perhaps for less cost-intensive separations, 
technologies that could then fuel some of these advanced 
reactors.
    So I think there is room for progress in bundling those 
two----
    Mr. Latta. And are those studies going on right now and--or 
the analysis of being able to bring those costs down to make 
sure that we could be?
    Because again, what happens if that 20 percent of the 
Russian uranium that we are receiving right now all of a sudden 
dries up? What does that do to the cost of everything else, 
then, that would----
    Ms. Caputo. Well, the difference between the 1970s and now 
is we have much better understanding of uranium reserves, and 
they are really prolific. And should the cost really rise, we 
can actually recover it from seawater, although that, I think, 
still remains in excess of $200 a pound. So there are 
opportunities like that.
    The last time a serious cost estimate was done, I believe, 
was in 2006, and this was commissioned by energy and water 
appropriations. But that was looking at the--a slightly 
modified version of historic technology. So there is probably 
room, I think, at this point to perhaps do another cost 
estimate looking at the advanced reactor technologies and the 
separations technologies that might facilitate those reactors.
    Mr. Latta. Well, thank you very much, and thanks to the 
Commissioners for being here.
    Mr. Chairman, my time is expired, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman, and I now go to the 
ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Pallone, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start with 
a topic that is relevant to my State and many others with shut-
down nuclear plants: NRC's decommissioning rulemaking.
    Unfortunately, the proposed rule before the Commission 
fails to properly expand the role of States and local 
governments in this process, one that has generated impacts on 
these communities. So with regard to the decommissioning 
rulemaking, let me ask Chairman Hanson. In 2021 I asked you to 
commit to taking a serious look at this, and you agreed, 
stating, and I quote, ``I understand the importance of this for 
local communities.''
    Can you update me on where things stand as it relates to 
the role of States and local governments in this proposed rule?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, thank you, Congressman Pallone.
    We had an extensive public comment period on the draft rule 
that--and had included a number of questions for the public and 
got a lot of feedback on that. The staff is currently revising 
the draft rule, and we expect to have a final rule in front of 
the Commission, I believe, in October or November later this 
year. Then we will see what the changes have been and how they 
have incorporated the public's comments.
    Mr. Pallone. Now, let me ask Commissioners Baran and 
Crowell. Do you believe the proposed rule appropriately 
addresses the role of States and local governments in the 
decommissioning process?
    I will start with Commissioner Baran.
    Mr. Baran. Well, at the stage of the proposed rule I didn't 
think it did. I shared your concerns about that. I think we 
should go further in making sure that States and local 
governments have a voice in the decommissioning process.
    I mean, a plant shutting down is a big deal for everyone, 
right? It is a big deal for the company, it is a big deal for 
the workers, the State, the locality. And right now the rule 
there is really very limited.
    And one thing that could be done--and there were a lot of 
comments we got on the proposed rule in this regard--was to 
have a decommissioning plan that is approved by NRC. I would 
like to see that, before it is approved by NRC, go to the State 
as well for their feedback and have that baked in before NRC 
even takes a look at it.
    But I think there is more that we can do, and I would like 
to see us do more on that rule to empower local communities 
more than they are now.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you.
    Commissioner Crowell?
    Mr. Crowell. I would generally agree with those sentiments. 
I think, whether within the proposed rule or through other 
mechanisms, there is room for improvement for engaging local 
communities on decommissioning. You know, I think we could do a 
lot outside of the rule, just through good stakeholder 
engagement, to help communities feel like they are--their 
interests are being protected in the decommissioning process. 
We could do those mechanisms formally through a rule, but I--
there is no reason why we can't do them in an informal fashion 
as well, to make sure that the communities are getting what 
they need.
    Mr. Pallone. Thank you. And I mentioned in my opening 
statement in 2021 the NRC created an environmental justice 
review team to review how the agency's programs, policies, and 
activities addressed environmental justice. The resulting 
assessment made six formal recommendations.
    And yesterday, at a subcommittee hearing with FERC 
Commissioners, I discussed the newly established FERC Office of 
Public Participation, something I have advocated for a long 
time. And this office will assist the public with participating 
in often complex FERC proceedings. So let me ask Chairman 
Hanson.
    The FERC Office of Public Participation model seems like it 
would provide similar benefits if implemented at the NRC. Both 
commissions regulate complex topics that are often difficult 
for regular citizens to understand and participate in. Would 
you consider standing up an Office of Public Participation at 
the NRC as part of the ongoing environmental justice review?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congressman Pallone. Yes, the paper 
that we got back from--on environmental justice from the staff 
kind of--really centered around two main things. One was about 
updating our strategy and policy, which are 20 or 30 years old. 
The other part was really enhancing public engagement on that. 
And so the paper is still before the Commission for 
consideration, but should the opportunity arise in one of my 
colleagues' votes to establish such an office, I personally 
would welcome that.
    Mr. Pallone. All right. And I don't know if there's only 45 
seconds left, but Commissioners Baran or Crowell, do you have 
any comments on this idea?
    Mr. Baran. Yes, I think----
    Mr. Pallone. Thirty seconds.
    Mr. Baran. I think it is a very good idea. I think it is 
important for NRC to establish a similar office. Other Federal 
agencies like FERC have done that, and we got that comment over 
and over and over in our environmental justice review comment 
period.
    I mean, just tons of stakeholders were saying it is very 
difficult to navigate NRC's processes and procedures, and on 
top of a lot of technical information. And having an office 
that could help folks navigate all that, I think, would be 
really valuable.
    Mr. Pallone. All right. Thank you so much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman's time has expired. I now 
recognize the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Griffith, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Griffith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it.
    As you all may be able to read from the plaque, I am from 
Virginia. I represent the southwest portion of Virginia, and I 
am excited about Governor Youngkin's energy plans, overall 
energy plans, and his aspirations to make the Commonwealth of 
Virginia a leader in nuclear power renaissance. We are looking 
at the viability of small modular reactors in my district, 
particularly the possibility of using an abandoned mine site, 
particularly a surface mine or a brownfield site.
    Now I would ask all of you, for early site permit 
timelines, what would be your goal for applications--
application review time, including preapplication meetings, and 
particularly for small modular reactors?
    Chairman Hanson, and then we will just go down the row.
    Mr. Hanson. OK, thank you.
    I believe the early site permit would include an 
environmental impact statement in there. And I think the new 
debt ceiling bill includes some specific timelines in there for 
the completion of EISes. I believe that is 24 months, so we 
would expect to meet that schedule.
    Mr. Griffith. All right. Any difference of opinion?
    Mr. Baran. No, not at all. In the proposal we were talking 
about earlier that I had, you know, presented to my colleagues 
just last week, I think one of the things we should be doing is 
looking at what are the aggressive but achievable schedules we 
should be thinking about for different types of applications 
like early site permits.
    Mr. Wright. I absolutely think, Representative, that we can 
do better than 24 months. And that would be--I mean, efficiency 
is something that is needed right now in order to meet this 
moment, and I think we have got--we are the ones that have to 
kind of model that.
    Mr. Griffith. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Caputo. I agree with that, but I also think that the 
Commission and the agency have been fairly quiet about these 
timeframes and the need to meet them and have a sense of 
urgency. And so I think there is room for us to sort of step up 
the message and create an expectation for staff that we are 
serious about meeting these goals.
    Mr. Crowell. And I will just agree with most of what my 
colleagues have said and just add that if an applicant chooses 
to pursue an early site permit, that should help facilitate the 
license review and approval process, not just add time to it. 
So we need to make sure that that is being taken into account 
as we review early site permits.
    Mr. Griffith. Yes. And I am excited about it possibly 
coming into our region. The district is an energy region, 
historically. We are also--the district is fairly large, so it 
does stretch out a little bit, but we are only a few miles from 
BWX in Lynchburg. We are maybe 30, 40 miles from BWX in Erwin, 
Tennessee. And the district also is only about 75 miles from 
Oak Ridge. So we have got all the right components close by 
that I think we need to make sure that we have a safe 
opportunity, and we are excited about those prospects.
    Commissioner Caputo, I understand that the NRC holds a so-
called mandatory hearing for several license types. These 
hearings can be duplicative. By the time you all get around to 
the hearing, the license has been subject to an extensive NRC 
staff review, Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguard reviews, 
and public challenges and public comments. Could you talk some 
about the streamlining of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's 
licensing hearings?
    Ms. Caputo. Well, these hearings are currently mandated in 
the Atomic Energy Act, but they are separate from adjudications 
and adjudicatory processes that result from contentions that 
get filed. So these are the practices to conduct these at the 
Commission level.
    So I think there would be a fair amount of streamlining 
that would occur in terms of reducing the time to prepare and 
actually hold these hearings. The Commission is, hopefully in 
the fall, going to hold a mandatory hearing for, essentially, a 
research and test reactor. But the months leading up to it are 
filled with preparation. And it is a full day of the Commission 
with numerous witnesses and, I think, probably in excess of 30 
staff members committing their time.
    If the Commission were to find itself reviewing a 
significant number of applications, it would be pretty time 
intensive both for the Commission staff to prepare for these 
hearings and for the Commissioners to put a lot of these on the 
calendar in addition to its regular duties.
    So I think there is room for a reform there to give the 
Commission discretion over situations where they might believe 
a mandatory hearing would be warranted versus opportunities to 
streamline the calendar by not conducting them.
    Mr. Griffith. All right. Will you help us if we need to 
draft legislation to help you all do that?
    Ms. Caputo. Happy to.
    Mr. Griffith. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I now go to 
California, Mr. Peters, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the 
witnesses for being here.
    I want to start by congratulating you on what is really a 
remarkable safety record in this industry. I did a little 
looking and was really surprised at how really safe nuclear 
power is in relation to other industries. If you want a fun 
listen, I recommend the Freakonomics podcast about this, which 
I am--you are all smiling, you have all heard. And--but 
congratulations, and thank you for your work on that score.
    I do want to say also thank you for the continued interest 
in fusion and work on that. That is a--clearly, a long bet that 
is worth making, and I continue to support the country's 
investment in that.
    But I am also interested, as my colleagues know, in making 
our climate goals. What I read is it is very difficult to 
imagine how we do that without really relying on nuclear, and 
nuclear is really a safe bet in terms of how to get there. So I 
thank you for your work and look forward to working with you in 
the next generation of nuclear power.
    And I want to talk to you, Mr. Chairman, about my concerns 
about the time it takes to get permitted. NuScale power is, so 
far, the only company to achieve an NRC license for their small 
modular reactor design. They chose to use the part 52 licensing 
pathway, pursue a design certification which could help ease 
future licensing reviews for their design. NuScale has publicly 
stated they have spent over 500 million on application 
activities, 2 million labor hours obtaining their design 
certification. And according to the generic milestone schedule, 
a combined license under part 52 could take anywhere from 30 to 
42 months to reach a final safety evaluation. And this is not 
entirely unknown. This is a schedule we really want to 
compress.
    So as you work to develop the new part 53 pathway, one that 
will be specifically designed for advanced reactor licensing, 
can you explain how the NRC intends to create a framework that 
will lead to a more efficient and less costly licensing and 
permitting process that--still guaranteeing safety?
    What is our goal here? What are--where are we trying to get 
to?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, thank you, Congressman. It is a great 
question. If I could, I will make a couple of remarks about 
NuScale, and then kind of what we learned and how I think we 
are applying that then----
    Mr. Peters. Right.
    Mr. Hanson [continuing]. To the part 53 process.
    We learned a lot through that NuScale design. It took 41 
months. I am not sure how much money NuScale spent. They paid 
us about $67 million over the period--that period of time to 
conduct that review. But the part 52 process was also a process 
where they needed to have, basically, a complete design. And 
then that design is codified in regulation that anybody can use 
to deploy anywhere, and so the idea being that the additional 
review would just be site-specific type things, emergency 
planning, external hazards, that kind of thing. So you make an 
upfront investment then to achieve efficiencies on the back 
end.
    Mr. Peters. Right.
    Mr. Hanson. For part 53, what we are really trying to do is 
make it much more technology inclusive. The regulations that we 
have now in part 52--as you noted, part 50--are very specific 
to light water reactors. And so the folks who are pursuing 
maybe advanced reactor applications under that have to go then 
and do a detailed analysis, we have to do a detailed analysis 
about which parts really apply.
    Well, if we take a lot of that--maintain the safety 
standards but take a lot of that light water reactor 
specificity----
    Mr. Peters. Right.
    Mr. Hanson [continuing]. Out of the regulation, then that 
provides, I think, an enormous potential to streamline the 
process.
    I can tell you that, even under part 52, our goal is to get 
down to 24 months----
    Mr. Peters. OK.
    Mr. Hanson [continuing]. For a design certification----
    Mr. Peters. Thank you for that.
    Mr. Hanson [continuing]. Approval.
    Mr. Peters. I appreciate that.
    Is it Caputo, Commissioner? Is that how you say it?
    I would just like to point out on reprocessing--so I have 
got a--north of me I have got the San Onofre. I represent San 
Diego. North of me is the San Onofre, a shuttered facility now, 
with a bunch of spent fuel sitting there, you know, near 
population centers, near faults, near a military base. I am 
counting on you to keep that safe. I believe you when you tell 
me that you will keep it safe.
    But it does seem like a waste in another way. And I 
understand that the added cost of reprocessing that you 
explained. But when we are thinking about the costs that we are 
talking about spending in terms of a permanent disposal, I 
think we ought to factor those in as sort of opportunity costs 
when we think about reprocessing. So I just favor us looking 
aggressively at reusing that fuel in a way that generates power 
and to the extent that that requires a Federal effort.
    And I would love to have you answer that, but I am out of 
time, so someone else has got to ask the question, or you could 
sneak it in on somebody.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Peters. Thank you. I yield back.
    Ms. Caputo. I am happy to take it for the record.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. I now 
go to Mr. Walberg for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Walberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the 
Commission for being here. We all have plenty of questions we 
would love you to answer even further. So thanks for taking the 
ones we do have.
    My district is home to two nuclear plants, Cook on Lake 
Michigan and Fermi on Lake Erie, both sides of the State. I am 
encouraged by the future of nuclear, but I also am concerned 
about some things that I read.
    NEI recently conducted a survey that found that over half 
of nuclear utilities are exploring power upgrades. But the 
problem is the NRC's review process has gotten longer and 
longer and longer, and consequently more and more expensive. 
For example, Palisades Nuclear Plant is located just a few 
miles north of my district, on Lake Michigan. While it is 
being--currently being decommissioned, there are serious 
efforts to bring the plant back online, including through the 
Civil Nuclear Credit Program established by Congress.
    So, Chairman Hanson, there are a few hurdles the plant must 
clear before reaching the Commission. But if it does, how can 
we ensure an expeditious approval process to bring it back 
online?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congressman Walberg. I grew up right 
near Palisades, actually, and my family lives near Cook, so--
and I worked at the State park there right next to the plant 
during college.
    Mr. Walberg. Warren Dunes, yes.
    Mr. Hanson. I know that site well and have taken a keen 
interest in it too, obviously.
    We are in active discussions with Holtec, the current owner 
of that site, about how to--they have gotten a series of 
exemptions when they shut down--basically, how to undo those 
exemptions in a timely way, how they are going to physically 
bring the plant back into compliance, and how they are going to 
reestablish the programs.
    It is new ground for both Holtec and, I admit, for us. But 
I am confident that the staff can approach this with the 
appropriate sense of urgency and creativity while maintaining 
safety too, to--if Holtec decides to proceed through that and 
the economics work for them and so on and so forth, that we can 
work with them productively to get that plant up and running.
    Mr. Walberg. Well, that is encouraging to hear. The only 
discouragement that I potentially feel comes from concerns 
about Diablo and what went on there in California. In that 
situation, as far as I know, the operator asked the NRC 
Commissioners and staff to resume review of the previous 
licensing application, which had been 80 percent complete. And 
I know that is a bit different than what Palisades would have, 
but I think the principles are still there.
    It is my understanding that staff, not the Commission, 
rejected the request. This was a new and novel matter that 
would appear to fit the definition of a policy matter requiring 
Commission input, not as staff matter. But the staff does not 
appear to have consulted the Commission. And so when you say 
that you are confident of the staff in working with Palisades, 
that gives me a little bit of concern. Choices like these could 
cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars more than necessary.
    Could you encourage me a bit more, Mr. Chairman--and I 
offer to the Commission, as well, to respond--on the 
Commission's role in Palisades and other similar entities in 
the future?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congressman. You know, I was out at 
Diablo just a couple of weeks ago, and I engaged in this 
conversation with the licensee.
    Because we didn't grant the request--essentially, the staff 
didn't grant the request to just restart--my question for them 
was how are interactions going with the--you know, the idea 
here is that the licensee shouldn't have to start from zero, 
that a lot of the information in that previous application 
ought to be usable kind of going forward. And how are those 
interactions going? I wanted to hear directly from the 
licensee.
    And the feedback at least I got from Pacific Gas and 
Electric was that they were going well, that they didn't--that 
there weren't big areas that they were going to have to do, 
that they could rely on previous decisions that the NRC made in 
this new submittal, et cetera. So that is part of why I am 
feeling reasonably encouraged.
    You know, I am not Pollyannaish. You know, I don't want the 
staff to--and we shouldn't regulate to, you know, eight decimal 
places when one or zero will do for a reasonable assurance of 
adequate protection. So----
    Mr. Walberg. Well, the regulated, of course, in responding 
to you, doesn't want any more upheaval----
    Mr. Hanson. Right.
    Mr. Walberg [continuing]. And may temper what they say.
    But I guess I am asking more about future, how involved--
and I guess I could--Mr. Wright, give me your thoughts on that 
so I feel more confident that the Commission will make sense of 
what should go forward, regardless of the good staff.
    Mr. Wright. Right.
    Mr. Walberg. What will you guys do?
    Mr. Wright. Right. So I am--quickly, on two issues. One, 
you are talking about Diablo. I think we missed a huge 
opportunity right there to be transformative, innovative, doing 
something new and novel, because it could happen that way, it 
could have happened, right? And we would have probably given 
the licensee a little bit more time, I guess, and--to get 
things done. But we have kind of put them up against it a 
little bit. So things have got to go right, going forward. And 
I know they are engaged, and I think that staff is on top of 
that, and I am following that not just with staff, but also 
with the licensee.
    And with Palisades, I think that approach has been 
different from the start. Holtec is--I have talked with them. I 
have talked with staff as well. The engagement process there 
was very early, and it has been going on. They have been very 
transparent with each other, and everybody now--I get the sense 
that everybody knows what is required, who has got to do what 
and by what time they have got to get it done. So I feel better 
about that.
    Mr. Walberg. Well, my time has expired, but I think warp 
speed ideas need to take place. We know what we are doing. 
Continue upgrades, but let's get her done.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I will go to Ms. 
Matsui for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Matsui. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I want 
to welcome all the Commissioners here today. It is great to see 
you all.
    You know, while many of my colleagues are focused on the 
future of nuclear power, my district encompassing the 
Sacramento region continues to grapple with the past. The 
Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant in my district closed over 30 
years ago, but the site is still acting as a temporary storage 
site for spent nuclear fuel.
    More than 88,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel are currently 
stranded at current and former reactor sites around the 
country. This material is a burden on local utilities like the 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District, and it prevents long-
closed nuclear plants from being redeveloped and used for other 
purposes.
    I support nuclear energy as an important source of zero-
carbon energy, but we must address the waste question. I 
believe the first step is to build a consolidated interim 
storage site. According to a 2021 GAO report on spent nuclear 
fuel, nearly all of the experts interviewed cited the 
advantages of consolidated interim storage, including cost 
savings.
    Now, advanced nuclear reactor designs and small modular 
reactors have many potential advantages over the current 
nuclear fleet. However, new nuclear plants will continue to 
produce hazardous wastes.
    Chair Hanson, can you briefly explain how spent fuel and 
other radioactive waste produced by these new reactors would 
differ from the current generation of reactors?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congresswoman Matsui.
    It is really going to depend on the technology. So in some 
cases, we are talking about smaller light water reactors, in 
which case the fuel is going to be very similar to what we have 
seen so far. In other cases, there are some new ceramic fuel 
fabrications. Think of ping-pong-ball-sized or billiard-ball-
sized elements of nuclear fuel that will require, you know, 
different storage configurations or security configurations as 
well.
    In many cases we are talking about high-assay, low-enriched 
uranium, and so we are talking about longer burn-up times, and 
so there may be some additional heat time that will potentially 
change the storage requirements.
    Ms. Matsui. OK. But we still have the waste question here, 
and especially if we are going to start building new nuclear 
power plants. And the status quo can't continue indefinitely.
    The NRC has reviewed at least 4 consolidated storage sites 
over the last 30 years, and we are not any closer to actually 
building a consolidated storage facility. This is due in large 
part to the failure of Congress to pursue a consent-based 
siting process for consolidated storage facilities.
    Whether it is a Federal or private-sector use, community 
support will be essential to successfully building a 
consolidated storage site. That is why I am glad to see the 
Biden administration's efforts to develop a consent-based 
approach to siting consolidated spent fuel storage. I have 
secured funding for these efforts in each of the last 3 years 
and look forward to working to secure funding for this crucial 
program in fiscal year 2024.
    Chair Hanson, my understanding is that there is currently 
no requirement for storage license applicants to have community 
support. But according to the standard review plan for dry 
storage facilities, applicants must demonstrate financial 
feasibility. Isn't that correct?
    Mr. Hanson. That is correct. They must demonstrate the----
    Ms. Matsui. OK.
    Mr. Hanson [continuing]. Financial capability of----
    Ms. Matsui. So applicants need to demonstrate this 
financial feasibility because otherwise, reviewing the 
application would be a waste of staff time. Similarly, 
community support is clearly a very important element in 
determining feasibility, is it not?
    Mr. Hanson. We are focused fully on the safety aspects, and 
the financial capability is how that pertains to the safety of 
the facility.
    Ms. Matsui. OK. So community support is actually a very 
important element, right?
    Mr. Hanson. It is important, but it is not an area in which 
we are directly involved.
    Ms. Matsui. OK. I want to make clear that I support the 
NRC's authority to license private-sector storage sites. These 
sites are safe and cost effective. But regardless of whether it 
is Federal or private-sector sites, we must pursue a consent-
based siting process for spent fuel storage, and I believe it 
is time for Congress to authorize a consent-based siting 
process.
    Now, the NRC is also responsible for regulating the 
transport of nuclear fuels, nuclear materials, and waste. One 
of the concerns that is commonly raised regarding the 
development of a consolidated storage site is that the 
transport of radioactive material poses new safety risks.
    Chair Hanson, to what degree is spent nuclear fuel already 
transported around the country?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, so spent nuclear fuel is already 
transported around the country by the Department of Energy, by 
the Navy, et cetera, has been safely for decades. We recently 
undertook a readiness review for the commercial--the transport 
of commercial spent fuel, and we believe our regulations and 
policies and procedures are adequate to ensure the safety of 
those operations.
    Ms. Matsui. So you are confident that we can safely 
transport spent fuel and other radioactive waste?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Matsui. From reactor sites to the consolidated storage 
facility?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Matsui. OK, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. I now go to the 
chair of the environmental subcommittee, Mr. Johnson, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to you 
folks, the NRC Commissioners, for being with us today. This is 
an important hearing, and this is going to inform us. And I 
know I and others on this committee want to legislate in this 
space, so I am looking forward to getting some of your thoughts 
today as we go through this hearing.
    I am planning on reintroducing my Strengthening American 
Nuclear Competitiveness Act in the coming weeks, and the 
legislation will require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, you 
folks, to present several reports to Congress. So first I want 
to go to Commissioner Caputo.
    You mentioned in your testimony that you want the NRC to 
innovate how it accomplishes its mission. My legislation would 
ask the NRC to issue a report on innovative, nonelectric uses 
of advanced nuclear technology or small modular reactors in--
perhaps in energy-intensive manufacturing and other 
applications. Do you believe NRC is equipped to study these 
technologies for future licensing, and do you support the NRC 
having a role here?
    Ms. Caputo. I believe it is very appropriate for us to 
study the nature of how process heat, as it is generated in the 
plant, would ultimately be used within the bounds of how it 
impacts safety. So----
    Mr. Johnson. But are you equipped to do that studying, do 
you think?
    Ms. Caputo. For the safety review?
    Mr. Johnson. Yes.
    Ms. Caputo. Yes, indeed.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, all right. What about you, Chairman 
Hanson?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, I believe we are well equipped to evaluate 
the nonpower applications of nuclear power and the safety on 
that.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, all right. Well, next I want to touch on 
another part of my legislation.
    I think we all can agree here today that we are not 
interested in inhibiting investment in nuclear technology here 
at home. We want and need to strengthen the fleet. My bill 
would lift the Atomic Energy Act's outdated ban on foreign 
investment and control from entities in allied, friendly 
nations. This has at times proven to be a barrier to further 
nuclear development here in the United States.
    So, Chairman Hanson, do you and the NRC have a position on 
this?
    Mr. Hanson. The Commission hasn't yet taken a position on 
this. I can tell you I have very close relationships with the 
regulators in a lot of the friendly countries that you identify 
in your bill, Congressman, and I think there is a real 
opportunity there to work more closely together.
    Mr. Johnson. Do you think it is appropriate to continue 
this ban? Do you have an opinion on that, or should we consider 
changes?
    Mr. Hanson. The Commission hasn't really taken a position 
on this, as you know. But I can tell you certainly that, since 
the invasion of Ukraine, I have--my interactions with my 
friendly, like-minded countries on all aspects of the nuclear 
fuel cycle have increased significantly about how we can 
cooperatively work together, reduce international regulatory 
barriers, et cetera, to integration of the global nuclear 
supply chain along the lines that you propose.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, all right. Next I want to pivot to keeping 
our American innovators competitive overseas.
    You mentioned the war in Ukraine. You know, we have seen an 
increased interest overseas in the security and reliability of 
nuclear energy. Ideally, these new reactors are U.S. designs. I 
am encouraged by recent announcements in Poland and Romania. 
Importantly, the designs that these countries are interested in 
building are either licensed and operating or certified by the 
NRC. We are talking about Westinghouse, AP1000, or NuScale.
    Chairman Hanson, how can the NRC help other regulators 
understand U.S. technologies and licensing decisions to spur 
global deployments?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, thank you. We are doing this literally as 
we speak, Congressman.
    We have been--we have had a 10-year relationship with our 
Polish regulatory counterparts. We have ramped up those 
interactions in the last 2 or 3 years. I know there were a lot 
of decisions--a lot of factors that went into the decision to 
pick U.S. technology in Poland, but I think, you know, the 
commitment on the part of the NRC to walk alongside and to help 
prepare that Polish regulator was certainly a factor.
    I think Commissioner Wright's visit to Romania last year 
helped cement that relationship, as well. Our work with the 
Canadians on the GE, Hitachi, BWX in the joint review we are 
performing there--and also, the GE is looking at exporting that 
to Poland and other parts around the world also.
    Mr. Johnson. OK.
    Mr. Hanson. I can tell you we have established now a civil 
nuclear cooperation agreement with Ghana, and I am headed there 
to work with their regulator here in just a few weeks.
    Mr. Johnson. OK, all right. Well, thank you very much, Mr. 
Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. We will now go to 
the Granite State, Mr. Tonko, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Tonko. Empire State, sir.
    Mr. Duncan. Empire State.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Duncan. Somebody mentioned granite to me the other day 
about----
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Duncan. And that was just in my mind. My apologies to 
the State of New York, Mr. Tonko.
    Mr. Tonko. OK, New York appreciates you.
    Well, thank you, Chair, and thank you to Chair Hanson and 
the Commissioners. I appreciate you being here this morning.
    Let me do a special shout out to Commissioner Baran: 
Welcome back to the committee.
    I have immense respect for the Navy's role in helping to 
develop the workforce that our civilian nuclear industry relies 
upon. Many of those sailors are trained on reactors in my 
district. But I believe our Nation's engineering schools also 
have an important role to play. RPI, Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute in Troy, in the 20th congressional district, is one 
such university. RPI and its students have been the 
beneficiaries of grants under the Commission's University 
Nuclear Leadership Program.
    So, Chair Hanson, can you discuss this program and its role 
in supporting nuclear engineering programs at our Nation's 
research universities?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congressman.
    I think I am an enthusiastic supporter of the University 
Nuclear Leadership Program. We have supported over 2,900 
students since 2014. Almost 50 percent of those students have 
then gone on to pursue and obtain nuclear-related employment, 
where another 25 percent are still working on their Ph.D.s or 
their master's degrees. Part of that is our research grants 
that kind of support graduate students and professorships and 
so forth, and some of them are just direct fellowships and 
scholarships to students that then establish that relationship 
with the NRC.
    I have visited probably half a dozen universities so far in 
my tenure. I try and include those when I go and visit plants, 
and encourage students both in the nuclear field but also in 
public service. And I think we are seeing some results there.
    Mr. Tonko. That is great.
    And Mr. Chair, I noticed this program was zeroed-out in the 
President's budget request. Can you shed any light on that 
decision and what you expect the future might look like for the 
program?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes. We are--we usually have about a year of 
funding kind of ahead of where we are in any given year, 
historically, in order to meet the budget targets that we are 
given. We have not requested funding. Congress will then give 
us that funding in advance, and we are happy to receive it, and 
happy to move forward in implementing that program.
    Mr. Tonko. OK. I believe every Commissioner recognizes 
nuclear energy's role in addressing climate change, but we know 
these reactors exist in environments that are increasingly 
stressed by the impacts of climate change, including increasing 
numbers of extreme weather events and severe droughts.
    Mr. Chair, how is the Commission working to ensure that the 
existing fleet is more resilient to the impacts of climate 
change?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, thank you.
    We have a--within the NRC we have a program on the 
assessment of natural hazards information that, basically, is 
an ongoing evaluation of information surrounding the entire 
fleet about the environment, about the impacts of climate, you 
know, changing climate, wildfires, et cetera, and the 
resilience.
    I would say that our plants, as we see, I think every year 
in hurricane season in this country--and due to both operator, 
you know, cautious operator action, as well as NRC oversight 
are--have been incredibly resilient to weather-related impacts.
    Mr. Tonko. Do any other Commissioners choose to weigh in on 
that whole concept? Are our reactors adequately updating their 
operations and response plans to reflect climate change 
concerns?
    Mr. Baran. Yes, I would just add, you know, one of the 
steps we took post-Fukushima was this program that the Chair 
talked about. You know, there was a time when NRC was much more 
reactive. You know, there would be new studies out there, 
whether it be on earthquakes or flooding or climate-related 
changes. And unless someone kind of brought that to us, we 
weren't--the staff wasn't necessarily conducting those kinds of 
reviews.
    Now we have something that is much more proactive. We are 
going out there, the staff is making sure they are up on the 
latest science in these areas. They are attending academic 
conferences. They are talking to the Federal agencies with 
responsibilities so that we are keeping a much closer eye on 
that, I think, than historically the agency has.
    Mr. Tonko. All right, thank you.
    And as Congress debates and continues to debate permitting 
reform, it has become even more clear that successful energy 
projects must be built based on early and robust community 
engagement. So, Mr. Chair, what do you see as the role for 
engagement with communities that host reactors, and how does 
the Commission help to ensure license holders are good partners 
with their hosts?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you.
    For all of our--the reactor applications, as well as the 
preapplication engagement activities, the vast majority of 
those meetings are held in public. They are available for folks 
to watch online. And then, when we actually get into the 
application stage and we need to perform the environmental 
review, we will hold numerous public meetings, opportunities 
for the public to come and understand the technology, how we 
are approaching that review, and also then the--how we are 
approaching the environmental assessment for that.
    I know we can always do better in terms of explaining our 
processes, how we are reaching our decisions, et cetera, but we 
have got the basic--I think the bones, I think, are good and--
on the processes that we have.
    Mr. Tonko. Thank you.
    With that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The Empire State yields back.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Duncan. And I will now go to the crossroads of America, 
Mr. Bucshon for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Bucshon. You got that right. It is the crossroads of 
America, Indiana. So thank you, Mr. Chairman, thanks to the 
Commissioners for being here.
    And recently the State of Indiana shared its intent to join 
the NRC's Agreement State Program. This program empowers 
individual States to assume NRC regulatory authority for 
specific categories of nuclear materials, relinquishing some of 
the regulatory load off of the NRC. So maybe I will start with 
Mr. Crowell here.
    Commissioner Crowell, could you discuss the benefits of 
this program for both the NRC and for the agreement States?
    Mr. Crowell. Thank you for the question. So I think the 
more States that become agreement States, the more robust that 
Agreement State Program overall becomes, and the burden 
somewhat lessens on the NRC from having to do that directly. We 
can do it through oversight, and it should lower costs over 
time as well.
    I also think the benefit of the Agreement State Program is 
that it helps create an understanding and familiarity with 
various aspects of nuclear power in those States, and that can 
help with broader public engagement and support.
    Mr. Bucshon. And can you maybe briefly discuss the timeline 
and process for a State like Indiana to join the program?
    Mr. Crowell. I would actually defer to the Chair on that.
    Mr. Bucshon. All right, Chairman Hanson.
    Mr. Hanson. Sure, Congressman, I would be happy to. 
Typically, it is about a 4-year process.
    Mr. Bucshon. OK.
    Mr. Hanson. We work closely with them. There is a lot of 
training and a lot of back and forth. We really walk alongside 
the State to get them ready to take over that responsibility.
    Mr. Bucshon. Great, and anyone can add. Do you think that 
the Agreement State Program plays a role in supporting public 
engagement efforts that foster public support for the safe and 
responsible deployment of nuclear technologies?
    Mr. Hanson. I certainly do. I agree with Commissioner 
Crowell. Having folks--you know, government often works best at 
the level closest to the populace, and I think this is a good 
example of that.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes, I think you are right. I mean, we need 
that. It is very important, right, for all the work that we 
are--all of us are trying to do here to have public sentiment 
behind us. As Members of the Congress, of course, that is the 
most critical piece of this equation.
    Yes, Commissioner Wright.
    Mr. Wright. Congressman, just--I am a big fan of the 
Agreement State Program, and I have been in the presence of the 
people from Indiana at some of the meetings, the Organization 
of Agreement States. We are willing to engage, so if we need to 
come and meet with somebody, we are willing to do that. And I 
would commit that I would go myself if you need me to.
    Mr. Bucshon. Sure, thank you very much.
    The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act directs 
the Commission to develop a risk-informed, technology-neutral 
framework for advanced reactors. And I had another hearing in 
Health, so I may have missed some of this. We have already 
heard some comments on that, of course, but NRC is supposed to 
provide reasonable assurance of adequate safety of nuclear 
reactors.
    Commissioner Caputo, can you speak to what risk-informed 
means, and how that works in the context of reasonable 
assurance of adequate safety standard?
    Ms. Caputo. Risk informing fundamentally means using risk 
insights together with other considerations to focus safety 
reviews on the items that are the most significant to safety. 
So it is an attempt to sort of narrow what our focus is to the 
areas where safety regulation creates the biggest safety 
benefits. So by narrowing that, it is a hope of limiting the 
regulatory burden to where things are truly safety significant.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes. I also want to say I was recently in 
Poland also with the chairwoman, and we were talking about this 
issue, and we do have competition. They are talking with the 
French, as you know. So it is very important for the United 
States and North America to make sure that we are the--we don't 
have things, processes in place that limit our ability to 
effectively compete. And part of that is cost, part of that is 
time, part of that is safety, other issues. So I just wanted--I 
wanted to say that.
    And then, in closing, I--the NRC doesn't regulate nuclear 
submarines, is that correct?
    Mr. Hanson. That is correct, Congressman.
    Mr. Bucshon. So I do find it--and somebody mentioned this 
to me the other day, that--if you have ever been on a nuclear 
submarine--which I have, the USS Kentucky--when it refueled and 
went out into the Pacific Ocean, it struck me that the person 
that dove the boat under the water was about 22 years old. And 
the entire ship, including the commanding officer--the 
commanding officer, I think was about 33. So we have this big 
nuclear reactor in a nuclear submarine in the middle of the 
ocean, and we have--literally, we have very strong young people 
that are in charge.
    And so I just say that because I think we need to put that 
in context of the overall situation that we are in here, and 
that this can be done. I know it is different, but it can be 
done if there are strong programs in place, and we don't need 
all these barriers all the time.
    Mr. Hanson. Yes.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes, Chairman, briefly.
    Mr. Hanson. We are great beneficiaries of our Nuclear Navy 
program. About 25 percent of our workers are military veterans, 
and the vast majority of them from the Navy. And so that kind 
of experience and that kind of a strong experience, including 
our executive director of operations here behind me, Dan 
Dorman, in operating and working on nuclear submarines.
    Mr. Bucshon. Yes. I yield back, Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. Not a single mishap in the United States Navy 
with regard to nuclear.
    So I now go to the Granite State for real.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Duncan. Ms. Kuster is recognized for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Kuster. Thank you, Chairman Duncan and Ranking Member 
DeGette, for holding this important hearing. And I want to 
thank all five NRC Commissioners for taking the time to join 
us.
    There are 54 nuclear power plants in the United States, and 
these power plants provide, as you have heard today, nearly 20 
percent of the electricity generated and 50 percent of the 
noncarbon electricity. The nuclear power generated in the 
United States displaces the equivalent of roughly 500 coal 
plants. But unlike coal or natural gas, nuclear energy is 
carbon-free.
    Given the significant role nuclear energy plays in our 
energy system and our energy future, the footprint of nuclear 
power plants across the Nation, most Americans would be 
reassured to learn about the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or 
NRC. The NRC exists for one purpose: to ensure nuclear power 
plants in the United States operate safely. And I want to 
underscore that this is an incredibly important responsibility.
    Chairman Hanson, the NRC currently has a full contingent of 
five Commissioners. Can you explain how a full contingent of 
five Commissioners helps the NRC function properly?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congresswoman.
    I think, fundamentally, having five people with differing 
views but who have very professional and collegial 
relationships actually results in stronger decision making and 
policymaking on the part of the agency.
    It really--because of, I think, as the chairman mentioned, 
the urgency of the issues in front of us, we are able to kind 
of divide and conquer on a number of things, whether it is 
Commissioner Caputo focusing on effective performance measures, 
or Commissioner Baran on policy statements, or other things 
that I have the opportunity to lead on. I think, given the 
amount of work in front of us, it is more important than ever 
that we have a fully--a full complement of Commissioners.
    Ms. Kuster. Well, thank you. And I might note Commissioner 
Baran's term expires at the end of the month, and his 
renomination is currently pending before the Senate. I am very 
supportive of Commissioner Baran, and I hope that the Senate 
acts quickly to confirm him.
    I want to zero in on the impact of nuclear energy in my 
State, New Hampshire, the Granite State. Nuclear energy is the 
largest power generation source in New Hampshire. All the 
nuclear electricity generated in New Hampshire comes from the 
Seabrook Nuclear Power Station. And while Seabrook is a key 
piece of infrastructure in my State, it also faces some 
significant challenges.
    There is an ongoing alkali-silica reaction, ASR, at 
Seabrook that is slowly causing cracking throughout the 
facility. Monitoring the ongoing ASR is critical to ensuring 
the integrity and the safety of Seabrook and my constituents, 
my colleague Chris Pappas, and our colleagues in Maine, Jared 
Golden and Chellie Pingree.
    Thankfully, the NRC has two resident inspectors at Seabrook 
whose full-time job is to walk the plant and ensure its 
operating safety. The two resident inspectors, Chris Newport 
and Travis Daun, are unsung heroes, and I want to acknowledge 
how important their work is for keeping the public safe. They 
literally have spent thousands of hours per year inspecting the 
plant and ensuring that it is safe.
    Chairman Hanson and Commissioner Baran, both of you have 
visited Seabrook. Can you briefly describe the role that Chris 
and Travis play and the benefits of having NRC personnel on 
site at our nuclear power plants around the country?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congresswoman. Well, hopefully, 
after this hearing they are not completely unsung.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Hanson. I think very highly of both Chris and Travis, 
as well as the rest of our resident inspectors who walk around 
these plants every day.
    And with regard to the alkali-silica reaction, that is 
actually a phenomenon that NRC staff discovered at Seabrook, 
and we have been keeping track of that ever since and bringing 
the expertise of the agency and working with the licensee to 
bear on that.
    And I make it a point--and I know my colleagues do too--to 
meet and spend some quality time with our resident inspectors 
when we go visit plants, understand both in more depth the 
situation at that plant but also how our program is working for 
them. It involves maybe more moves for them around the country 
because of the rotations that we require, often in kind of far-
flung places. Seabrook isn't particularly far flung----
    Ms. Kuster. It happens to be beautiful, the sea coast of 
New Hampshire.
    Mr. Hanson. It is beautiful, but we do have plants in some 
far-flung places that can make that more difficult.
    So, I don't know, Commissioner Baran, if you want to add 
anything.
    Mr. Baran. Well, thanks. I agree. I think our resident 
inspectors at Seabrook are terrific. And, you know, they are 
closely tracking the alkali-silica reaction issues, but all the 
more traditional safety and security issues as well.
    I think one of the things that's so great about that team 
is they are focused on being transparent about sharing their 
findings with the community so that folks understand what is 
going on and what NRC is doing there. And when I visited in the 
run-up to that visit to Seabrook, I talked to C10, one of the 
community organizations that is very engaged, and I heard from 
them that our residents are really building, you know, trust 
and confidence. And that is really good to hear. And in some 
ways, I think that team at Seabrook is really the model for 
what that relationship should look like between----
    Ms. Kuster. I hate to cut you off, my time is up. But thank 
you. We will leave it at there, the model.
    Mr. Baran. Thank you.
    Ms. Kuster. Thank you very much, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentlelady, and I will now go to 
the vice chair of the Subcommittee on Energy, Mr. Curtis, for 5 
minutes.
    Mr. Curtis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was hoping you would 
call Utah the crossroads of the West.
    Mr. Duncan. You are the crossroads of the West.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Curtis. Listen, I am really delighted to be here, and I 
have stayed here through this whole hearing. I think this is 
incredibly important. I am not sure in recent time that we have 
had any more five important people in front of us for the 
future of our energy security and our climate and energy goals 
here in the United States and around the world.
    I want to begin by giving a shout out to a couple of Utah 
projects. The Pacificorp project is very exciting, although 
that will ultimately be in Wyoming. I am hoping their 
additional plans will expand in Utah, and I am just really 
pleased to see the progress that they are making.
    Also, a shout out to Utah Municipal Power Authority--UAMPS, 
excuse me, UAMPS--and you well know the amount of time and the 
work that they have put into that small nuclear reactor.
    I think that, as I look at 2050, I see our energy sources 
being affordable, reliable, and clean, and nuclear, you know, 
hits it out of the park on reliability and on clean. But 
currently, affordable is problematic, and a lot of that has to 
do, of course, with the delay in time period and uncertainty in 
licensing.
    And we have talked a lot today with my colleagues about 
speed, and I have heard a lot of positive things from you about 
speed and innovation. But I want to make sure that we are all 
kind of on the same page, because I am thinking we are not 
talking about doubling speed, we are not talking about tripling 
speed. I am thinking we are talking about, between now and 
2050, hundreds of nuclear facilities here in the United States, 
maybe thousands of nuclear facilities here in the United 
States. And I just want to get your reaction.
    Are there behind-closed-door conversations of, like, no, 
this isn't a little bit faster, this is not necessarily even 
faster, this is figuring out how to permit hundreds and 
thousands of these facilities in the next couple of decades?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes.
    Mr. Curtis. Mr.----
    Mr. Hanson. No, it--thank you Mr. Vice Chairman. It is a 
great question, and it is a completely fair question.
    The key to a lot of this, I think, is going to be the 
standardization of the design. And I think for us, then, if we 
have a standardized design that is getting cranked out of a 
factory, we can go to that factory and say, ``Yes, quality 
assurance is what it needs to be.'' Then all we are really 
doing is looking at site-specific requirements. And I think 
that--you know, external hazards and----
    Mr. Curtis. Sure.
    Mr. Hanson [continuing]. And some emergency planning and 
that kind of thing, I think that review can be--my thought--and 
again, I haven't consulted my colleagues--I think it can be 
less than a year when we get those standardized designs that 
are going to--kind of getting pushed out----
    Mr. Curtis. I am really pleased to hear that, and I think 
that is a good message for the industry as well.
    And yet, at the same time, the industry is in this 
interesting place where SMRs are getting standardized, but, 
like, the Pacificorp project, there are also a lot of other 
tentacles trying out new things, which we want to encourage as 
well.
    Let me pivot just to--a minute to the concept of investor 
confidence. I know it is not your job to promote technology, 
but many in the industry, investors, are watching what is 
happening. What would you say, Mr. Hanson, as the Chair?
    I know you would all do so well, but you are the Chair for 
the group. What would you say to industry about how we can give 
them the confidence they need to make the investments that they 
are going to need to this, and not be scared about the process?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, certainly, I agree that there is a need to 
kind of demystify the regulatory process here, in part for the 
regulatory community. And I have had some conversations where I 
have volunteered to do that where necessary.
    But I think we can point to some things in terms of what we 
have done. That is, the lessons we have learned from previous 
reviews, and whether that is Vogtle or NuScale, but also then, 
you know, what we did on Kairos, that advanced reactor 
technology, and also then the Commission's efforts to really 
roll up its sleeves and focus in on this advanced reactor 
rulemaking to make sure that that is predictable, efficient, et 
cetera, while upholding our safety standards.
    Mr. Curtis. Sure. I am a little concerned, too, that if we 
don't have the type of domestic program that we want to have, 
we won't have the influence internationally that we would like 
to have with international standards and safety standards. Can 
you speak to what you are doing and what the Commission is 
doing to make sure we have influence overseas?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, thank you.
    Well, first of all, we are heavily engaged at the IAEA to 
make sure that our interests are advanced and protected in that 
international multilateral forum, but then also engaging, you 
know, with our bilateral partners, whether that is in Poland or 
Romania, the Czech Republic. I have had numerous discussions 
with--and they are a very close ally.
    But also then, even some folks that we are competing with, 
in terms of the French, that we make sure that the standards 
are high, you know, but that we are approaching it with the 
right kind of flexibility.
    Mr. Curtis. And I am, unfortunately, out of time. I would 
like to just thank you and all five of you for being here 
today, and for the chair and the ranking member for this very, 
very important conversation.
    Mr. Duncan. I appreciate the gentleman. I now go to Ms. 
Schrier for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all 
of our witnesses for being here today.
    And I would say thank you to Mr. Curtis, as well. I thought 
that question line was really excellent.
    In my home State of Washington, we have adopted a very 
ambitious goal to completely eliminate carbon emissions from 
our energy portfolio by 2045, which means we need to construct 
new, emissions-free capacity resources like advanced nuclear 
with haste. And this is in addition to wind and solar and the 
abundant hydropower that we enjoy now as base load. And by 
expanding our nuclear portfolio, we will be able to better and 
more smoothly integrate other renewables like wind and solar 
into our grid and reduce emissions.
    Commissioner Caputo, I was struck by your testimony when 
you acknowledged the need for NRC to ``innovate with an eye 
toward the future,'' because that is what we are looking for in 
Washington State. And you acknowledge that NRC must follow 
congressional intent to develop--again, quote--``a framework 
that is truly risk-informed, reflecting the inherent safety 
found in advanced designs.'' And I think that is critical, and 
I think it also pertains to Mr. Curtis' line of questioning 
about how much more quickly we should be able to do this.
    I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on this 
point and how you are taking into account the difference in 
risk, maybe what are your--some of your challenges, how can we 
help?
    Ms. Caputo. Well, when the Commission directed the staff to 
proceed with the rulemaking, one of the elements of that 
direction was to direct the staff to apply the same safety 
standards as the existing fleet. By having advanced reactors 
meet that same level of safety, it allows those reactors 
through the technology to take credit for aspects of their 
design that may provide inherent safety, just based on the 
technology itself. And I think that is perhaps the most 
important aspect that we need to focus on in part 53.
    Ms. Schrier. OK, thank you. I am going to pivot to another 
question also about Washington State, which is Hanford.
    And I know that this is primarily a Department of Energy 
issue, but since I have your expertise in front of me, I would 
love to know if any of you have reservations, technical 
reservations, about the Department of Energy reclassifying some 
of its low-activity waste to something other than high-level 
waste, because it would change how we can dispose of that. If 
it is a low level, it can be disposed of in a grouting process, 
and a high level needs to be--it needs to go through 
vitrification, which is far more complex. I am just wondering 
if any of you have any comments about that safety.
    Mr. Hanson. I admit, Congresswoman, I am loathe to wade 
into those waters, but I will note that----
    Ms. Schrier. So am I.
    Mr. Hanson. But the classification system that we have in 
this country is largely based on origin and not based on 
radioactivity. So sometimes high-level waste, regardless of the 
activity level, is high-level waste because it is spent nuclear 
fuel or originates from reprocessing operations.
    Ms. Schrier. OK. Thank you for that clarification.
    Does anybody else want to wade into this?
    Ms. Caputo. I agree with the Chair. It is primarily 
classified by the origin. So the characteristics of the waste 
itself may be substantially different, based on where it is--
not based on where it is classified. So if there is a 
reclassification done to more reflect the nature of the waste 
itself, then there may be a scientific basis for doing that 
rather than hewing to the historical classification based on 
origin.
    Ms. Schrier. Thank you. That is really interesting and 
really reassuring. And that is why I asked you that question. 
Thank you very much.
    And I will yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady yields back. We will stay in the 
Evergreen State, and it is my distinct pleasure to recognize 
the chairwoman of the full committee, Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, 
for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Duncan and I, along with Ranking Members DeGette 
and Pallone, wrote together to a range of nuclear stakeholders 
in April seeking information about NRC licensing and oversight 
activities. And we wanted to ``identify what makes sense for a 
modern regulator to assure efficient, predictable regulation 
that provides for a robust and growing nuclear industry.'' And 
this is keeping with the goals of the Atomic Energy Act.
    Chairman Hanson and Commissioners, an indisputable part of 
your mission is to protect public health and safety. However, 
your authorities derive from the Atomic Energy Act, which has 
broader goals. I would like to ask each of you, beginning with 
the Chairman, to describe how you would define NRC success as a 
regulator in the context of the policy to provide for a robust 
and growing industry.
    Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Chairwoman Rodgers, for that 
question.
    Our success, I think--I met with a utility executive 
recently that described the NRC as a tough regulator, but a 
fair regulator. I took that as a point of pride. And I think we 
can always be improving the efficiency of that and the 
predictability of our regulations. And I think that is--I think 
you are seeing an emphasis on that across the Commission as we 
move forward, and an adaptability and creativity in achieving 
those aims while protecting public health and safety.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK.
    Mr. Baran. Yes, I think we need to do two things at the 
same time: one, maintain our focus on public health and safety; 
and two, have an effective, efficient, and timely licensing 
process. Both of those things.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you.
    Mr. Wright. Thank you for the question, and I agree with 
what my colleagues are saying here. And I was present when I 
heard the comment, as well, about being a tough but fair 
regulator.
    But also I would say that we do a pretty poor job of 
talking about our successes and how--maybe the good things that 
we do, because--and--because I am a believer, if you don't tout 
your successes, you are going to be defined by your failures. 
So there are a lot of good things that are going on, but we 
certainly can do better.
    Ms. Caputo. I think I will get passed back to a comment 
that Mr. Bucshon made which relates to naval submarines. When 
the Navy approves a submarine, it really is a dual mission, 
which is safety, but also to enable the mission. And our 
mission as a regulator is purely safety.
    So I think there is room there to consider a little more 
balanced approach because we are, as I said in my opening 
statement, gatekeepers to a nuclear future, and we need to, I 
think, focus on the fact that, while safety is our preeminent 
role, we do have a responsibility to ensure timely decision 
making so that we can actually enable the safe development of 
nuclear power.
    Mrs. Rodgers. Thank you.
    Mr. Crowell. And Congresswoman, I will just add that if--
while protecting public health and safety are the--you know, 
the primary goals and responsibility of the NRC, if we are 
meeting that mission but we are not doing so on a timeline that 
is commensurate with addressing reducing carbon emissions and 
enhancing energy security, then I don't think we are 
succeeding. I think we need to be doing both.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK, thank you.
    To help set the Commission up for success, Congress enacted 
reforms in 2019 to update its fee schedule and directed NRC to 
issue risk-informed regulations appropriate for advanced 
reactors.
    My understanding is the staff spent about 2 years putting 
together a proposal, the part 53 proposal, yet they have been 
informed time and time again that the new regulations that they 
were putting together ignored stakeholder input, and future 
applicants would not use the rule as it was proposed. And then 
staff chose to send a rule that they knew wouldn't work to the 
Commission to fix. Something isn't right with that whole 
situation.
    Why is--so I wanted to start with the Chairman, and however 
time we have--why is staff putting together rules that fail to 
comply with congressional direction?
    And what does this say about the staff working in service 
to the Atomic Energy Act?
    Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you. While I am certainly not going to 
endorse or agree with all the things that the staff sent, we 
asked them to put together that rule very quickly. And I think, 
as a result, it--there is a high level of what I would call 
adjacency to our existing frameworks that are not necessarily 
conducive to the new technologies that are coming down the 
road----
    Mrs. Rodgers. So quickly, 2 years and they ignored 
stakeholder input.
    Mr. Hanson. Well, I think in some cases both the framework 
A and framework B were included and structured that way at the 
behest of stakeholders.
    Mrs. Rodgers. OK. More to follow.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Hanson. Happy to.
    Mr. Duncan. You could add some extra time. You are the 
chairwoman.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Duncan. I will now go to Florida, Ms. Castor, the 
Sunshine State, for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Castor. Yes. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling 
this hearing. It has been a good, bipartisan collaboration 
here.
    And I want to thank the NRC Commissioners for your public 
service and being here today.
    If we are going to slash climate pollution with the urgency 
that is needed to avoid the worsening impacts and the 
escalating costs, we have got to rely more on this carbon-free 
energy source, nuclear power, that is consistent in its output 
over long periods of time.
    We have learned a lot over the past few years. There has 
been a shift in thinking because of the climate crisis. In 
fact, when I had the pleasure of chairing the House Select 
Committee on the Climate Crisis, we invited nuclear energy 
industry experts in to advise us and to help craft policies. 
And it resulted in our action plan report that had a number of 
recommendations relating to nuclear power that were 
subsequently incorporated into the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law, the IRA, the CHIPS and Science Act.
    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $6 billion for 
the Civil Nuclear Credit Program, funds that will help ensure 
that our already existing fleet of nuclear reactors stays safe 
and competitive, and it also will save thousands of jobs over 
time.
    The Inflation Reduction Act created a tax credit of up to 
1.8 cents per kilowatt hour for zero-emission nuclear energy 
and provided the Department of Energy with $700 million to 
invest in increasing the availability of next-generation 
nuclear fuel for advanced reactors.
    And the President's proposed budget this year includes a $1 
billion investment in the NRC, including an 8 percent increase 
in nuclear reactor safety.
    Commissioner Baran, you highlighted this in your testimony. 
You said the urgency and scale of the challenge have led to a 
growing consensus that meeting ambitious climate and energy 
security goals will involve nuclear power, including new 
reactors. The bipartisan infrastructure legislation and the IRA 
make large investments to drive this expansion, including the 
Clean Energy Production Tax Credit and funding for a domestic 
high-assay, low-enriched uranium supply chain. Few, if any, 
nuclear power plants are expected to close anytime soon.
    So when you think of life before these new Federal laws, if 
they hadn't happened, what would the picture look at--look 
like, Mr. Chairman, if you compare life before the 
infrastructure law, the IRA, CHIPS and Science, where would we 
be today?
    Mr. Hanson. There are a lot of issues--I call it a series 
of chicken-and-egg problems--associated with the deployment of 
new nuclear. And certainly, the financing and the policy around 
those can be one of them. And certainly, NRC regulation, I 
recognize, is one, as well.
    For us, as regulators, we see a renewed interest in the 
continued operation of the existing fleet. So we are expecting 
both subsequent license renewal applications as a result of the 
law as well as power uprate applications, and then also 
requests for evaluation of perhaps new fuel forms so that these 
reactors can operate at potentially higher output levels, et 
cetera, to take full advantage of that and deliver more clean 
energy to the grid.
    Ms. Castor. Commissioner Baran?
    Mr. Baran. Yes, I think, in talking with our licensees, the 
utilities, you really see an almost immediate transformation in 
the way they were thinking about things. The price signals sent 
by the legislation were really significant.
    There were very few people talking about power uprates, 
those kinds of investments in the plant to get more electricity 
out of them, prior to the legislation. Now there is a lot of 
talk about that.
    There was talk, obviously, about subsequent license renewal 
going from 60 to 80 at a lot of plants. Now it is, like, kind 
of near universal. I mean, the whole value proposition has 
changed enough that it was almost like a switch. I mean, you 
could just see the effect of it.
    When I was talking with Tennessee Valley Authority, you 
know, not that long ago, they were talking about one small 
modular reactor at the Clinch River site in Tennessee, then it 
was four identical ones there, then it was four and maybe they 
do four more at other sites if that goes well. So it is--it has 
really ramped up the interest. I mean, there is a real surge in 
interest now.
    Ms. Castor. And Commissioner Wright?
    Mr. Wright. I do not disagree with anything that my 
colleagues have said.
    I would also add that there is something else that could be 
taken advantage of, and that is through--I believe it is NICA, 
where you could use monies that are funded through DoE that 
would come back to the Commission to help some of these small 
vendors that are trying to get moving, because they don't have 
deep pockets, right? And you could help identify issues that 
are maybe barriers that could be solved early and that would--
you know, again, it would save money on the licensee--or the 
applicant's part as well.
    Ms. Castor. Great. Thank you very much.
    I am out of time. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady's time has expired. I will go to 
Mrs. Lesko, who has the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant in her 
district.
    You are recognized for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Lesko. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Yesterday we had a hearing here discussing--we discussed 
grid reliability and all of the different concerns there are 
from different Government organizations about grid reliability, 
and that we are retiring baseload energy plants too fast and 
replacing them with intermittent energy. And so I do believe 
nuclear is part of the solution, so I thank you for your work 
in making sure our nuclear plans and plants are safe. My 
questions are for anyone that wants to weigh in.
    My first question regards--says the NRC sends inspectors to 
the nuclear plants to inspect machinery and for safeguards. 
Nuclear plants like the one in Arizona have full-time 
Government inspectors that stay on site. I have been told that, 
in addition to these on-site inspectors, NRC sends out 
additional inspectors that the nuclear plants pay for and that 
these inspectors may be duplicating some of the work that the 
on-site inspectors do.
    In addition, I have been told that, during COVID, remote 
technology was used to conduct--you know, sometimes used to 
conduct the inspections.
    And so my question is, do you think it would make sense to 
better utilize the on-site inspectors and use remote technology 
for some of the inspections?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, thank you, Congresswoman. We learned a lot 
during COVID about how to better use technology, and everything 
from laptops and, you know, iPads and this sort of thing to 
help conduct inspections. I hope that there is not a lot of 
duplication. I will dive into that for you and be happy to get 
back to you about the duplication that our on-site resident 
inspectors are conducting, and then our engineering inspectors.
    We recently made a change at the Commission to reduce the 
frequency of engineering inspections, actually, from 3 years to 
4 years to kind of account for the reduced--I would say kind of 
the reduced need to do a deep dive with some of these visiting 
inspectors that you mentioned.
    Mrs. Lesko. Yes, Ms. Caputo?
    Ms. Caputo. Some of that virtual technology that resident 
inspectors were able to use was to conduct routine monitoring 
of plant parameters. And by, I think, making their time more 
efficient, it frees them up to pursue other activities that are 
more safety significant. So I believe there are probably 
opportunities to do some of that and upskill our resident 
inspectors so we rely less on regional inspectors and help our 
residents to cover more ground. So I think there is room for 
efficiency there.
    But yes, all of these inspections are paid by licensees.
    Mrs. Lesko. Yes. Anyone else?
    Yes, Mr. Wright.
    Mr. Wright. So this is an area that we really listen to our 
residents. So when I go into plants--and I know my colleagues 
do, as well--we meet with them. And one of the questions that 
we ask them is, ``What is it that you are doing on site in your 
inspections that you think could be done better or done 
differently?'' Because they are the boots on the ground. They 
need to be there, but they can also help us--you know, we 
can't--from the top, that is not where we should be doing it.
    Mrs. Lesko. Yes.
    Mr. Wright. It needs to bubble up from the bottom, where 
the boots are on the ground, so----
    Mrs. Lesko. OK, great, thank you.
    Oh, yes.
    Mr. Baran. Sure. I would just add, you know, I think a lot 
of the work that the resident inspectors do, and then the 
regional inspection team, it is very complementary. You know, 
the residents are there day to day, walking down the plant, 
ensuring the safety day to day, you know, but then we have 
specialized teams, maybe cybersecurity or a particular type of 
engineering inspection. And those folks are real specialists in 
those areas. And those--that is why we deploy the teams as 
well.
    But one of the things we learned--we learned a couple of 
things, I think, during the COVID period. One, the value of 
having boots on the ground and really seeing things firsthand, 
that there is, you know, in-person inspection, the actual 
inspection part of looking at equipment was really better than 
remote. But there was stuff that we could do remotely. You 
know, there was--there is a certain amount of--it is not 
trivial, but, like, paperwork review, looking through the 
licensing documents ahead to prepare the inspectors before they 
go. That stuff we don't have to have the folks there on site 
doing, and it saves time and money to have people do that back 
at headquarters.
    So I think there are lessons learned----
    Mrs. Lesko. I am glad you are looking into this. I only 
have a few seconds left.
    The Nuclear Energy Institute has suggested the following 
additions to your mission statement: ``Ensure that the 
regulation of nuclear activities is efficient and does not 
unnecessarily limit the potential of nuclear technology to 
maximize its contribution to the benefit of society.'' Do you 
agree with their recommendation, anyone?
    Mr. Hanson. We have principles of good regulation, and 
efficiency is one of those, along with openness, reliability, 
independence, and clarity. And so every day we strive to live 
up to our principles of good regulation, and efficiency is a 
key one of those.
    Mrs. Lesko. Yes, Mr. Wright.
    Mr. Wright. I would just like to add, if we are going to 
start talking about putting it in policy and we have got it in 
our principles of good regulation, then it ought to be in the 
other areas, too, to be consistent.
    Mrs. Lesko. OK, thank you, and my time has run out. Thank 
you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentlelady's time has expired. I now go to 
Mr. Cardenas for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Cardenas. Thank you very much, Chairman Duncan and 
Ranking Member DeGette, for holding today's hearing. And I 
appreciate the Chairman and Commissioners of the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission for being here today and sharing your 
thoughts.
    As it stands, 79 percent of our electricity comes from 
fossil fuels, making the power sector the second largest share 
of greenhouse gas emissions nationwide. If we are going to be--
significantly cut carbon pollution, it is undeniable that we 
will need to utilize carbon-free and reliable energy sources.
    On the front end, nuclear seems like an ideal zero-carbon 
electricity source, and I appreciate the committee's ongoing 
discussion about its role in building out a clean energy 
economy. However, as I have mentioned in previous hearings, I 
have concerns about the legacy of toxic waste associated with 
nuclear energy, and believe that to ensure the long-term health 
and safety of communities, we must find more permanent storage 
solutions.
    As the commission overseeing the safety and licensing of 
our Nation's nuclear reactors and interim storage facilities, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you about 
these concerns today. Chairman Hanson, can you describe the 
Federal standards and processes in place that ensure safety 
when storing low-level and high-level waste in interim storage 
facilities, and how are environmental impacts and community 
input considered during the licensing process of interim 
storage facilities?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes. Thank you, Congressman, for that question.
    We have standards for storage facilities, as you mentioned, 
and they are focused on containing the radioactive material, 
providing radiation shielding for the people who work around 
those spent fuel canisters, preventing nuclear criticality, so 
making sure that we have got the right kind of materials in 
those casks that prevents a nuclear chain reaction, and also 
maintaining retrievability. That is, if something goes in a 
concrete cask, that you can pull that out again, should you--
should the need arise, essentially.
    Post-Fukushima, we also required additional instrumentation 
on spent fuel pools to maintain water levels. So we have got 
a--and we have a robust inspection protocol for those spent 
fuel storage systems as well.
    Mr. Cardenas. So everything you just described somebody 
can't get at a Container Store.
    Mr. Hanson. I am sorry?
    Mr. Cardenas. Somebody can't get what you just described at 
a Container Store. These are very----
    Mr. Hanson. No, no.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Cardenas [continuing]. Specialized, highly engineered, 
proven techniques, thank God, that we have available to us 
today.
    Mr. Hanson. Correct.
    Mr. Cardenas. And that is part of the process of properly 
storing spent fuels.
    Mr. Hanson. Absolutely, highly engineered barriers.
    Mr. Cardenas. OK, thank you. How long are interim storage 
facilities intended to hold nuclear waste?
    And how common is it for these facilities to hold nuclear 
waste for longer than the agreed-upon time?
    Mr. Hanson. Well, most of the spent fuel storage facilities 
at operating reactors are licensed along with the reactor. So 
it would be as long as that reactor has its operating license, 
the spent fuel storage facility will as well. When that reactor 
shuts down, there are some regulatory boxes to check there that 
then transitions that to a standalone facility.
    We license storage casks for an initial period of 40 years, 
and then up to an additional 40 years.
    Mr. Cardenas. But this spent fuel, these byproducts, they 
are dangerous for 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 50 years, 1,000 
years? About how long?
    Mr. Hanson. The initial fission products, the real heat off 
of that, the heat declines really reasonably precipitously, the 
thermal heat. But the radioactivity then, the high amounts, 
probably 500-ish years, and then some of the long-lived 
radioisotopes can be much longer than----
    Mr. Cardenas. Five hundred years. So a lot longer than any 
of us may be in Congress or you might be a Commissioner, right?
    Mr. Hanson. I----
    Mr. Cardenas. Multiple times longer.
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, yes, sir.
    Mr. Cardenas. OK. No, I just wanted to get--for the average 
American to understand what we are talking about here. We are 
not talking about, OK, storing things for 5 or 10 or 15, 20 
years. We are talking about super-duper long term.
    Mr. Hanson. Well, in the near term we can assure--we have 
reasonable assurance that the systems that we use to store 
spent fuel are safe and protective of the public.
    Mr. Cardenas. But also, as a society, we need to make sure 
that longer than tens of years--that there is a way to make 
sure that people don't just say, ``Well, I am done, it has been 
20, 30 years, we can just leave it alone and stop monitoring 
it.'' And so this is a process that is--that takes--it is going 
to be around for a long time.
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, Congressman, you have identified a key 
policy issue about the--about spent fuel storage and its 
connection to ultimate disposal.
    Mr. Cardenas. OK, thank you. My time expiring, I just 
wanted to remind everybody that we really appreciate you very 
much, and any recommendations you can make to us, we look 
forward to it.
    Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I will now go to Mr. 
Pence from Indiana.
    Mr. Pence. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the 
Commissioners for being here today.
    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is critical to deploying 
innovative nuclear resources for our grid to provide zero-
emission baseload power, as my colleague next to me talked 
about a minute ago.
    I am encouraged that, under Chairman Duncan's leadership, 
this committee can advance important reforms to streamline 
licensing for nuclear assets and lay the groundwork to deploy 
next-generation reactors.
    In the Hoosier State, my State, innovators are leading the 
way to power the next generation of nuclear energy. Purdue 
University is a national leader in nuclear engineering programs 
and home to the country's first and only fully digitalized 
nuclear reactor used to train students and research cyber-
physical protection. Recently, the university released a 
completed feasibility study with Duke Energy to bring a small 
modular reactor to power their campus.
    Similarly, Rolls-Royce, with facilities in Indianapolis, is 
advancing their designs for transportable small modular 
reactors to provide 470 megawatts of baseload power.
    Chairman Hanson, SMRs have been defined as generating 300 
megawatts of power or less. Rolls-Royce has developed an 
innovative design that produces 470. Given these innovative 
designs, how do you view SMRs above the 300-megawatt threshold?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congressman. I don't think that 
there is anything particularly magical about the 300-megawatt 
threshold, and a lot of the safety issues, I think, would be 
very similar between 300 megawatts and 470. So it--from a 
regulatory standpoint, there shouldn't be any additional--you 
know, depending on the design and a lot of other things being 
equal----
    Mr. Pence. Yes, super.
    Mr. Hanson [continuing]. Should be relatively 
straightforward.
    Mr. Pence. So do designs such as those from Rolls-Royce 
present different challenges from a licensing perspective?
    Mr. Hanson. I would have to understand a little bit more 
about the specifics. It can, but oftentimes--and we encourage 
this--with preapplication engagements, where people are coming 
to us and talking about maybe the unique aspects of their 
design and getting kind of a presign-off, we can sign off on 
that stuff in advance of them getting that application in. That 
often works very well to resolve those issues.
    Mr. Pence. I think your colleague would like to comment on 
this as well.
    Ms. Caputo. One difference I would like to point out is 
indemnification under the Price-Anderson Act. I believe the 
threshold is 300 megawatts. So the insurance required and the 
participation under that indemnification framework would 
probably be slightly different for the reactor at 470, because 
it would be treated more akin to the larger operating units 
that exist today. So below that 300-megawatt threshold, small 
modular reactors operate under a different price structure.
    Mr. Pence. OK, thank you. Kind of changing horses here a 
little bit, last month Purdue University and Duke Energy's 
feasibility study included important policy recommendations to 
advance nuclear energy for our State and Nation. As part of 
their findings, the report detailed the need for a highly 
skilled workforce to design, build, and operate the fleet of 
next-generation reactors. And all of you talked about training 
and hiring and looking forward with personnel.
    To help maintain and build this workforce, the NRC has 
supported critical nuclear science and engineering initiatives 
through the University Leadership Program. However, the NRC's 
fiscal year 2024 budget request did not include any funding for 
this program, which I hope is corrected and is included in some 
way.
    What gaps, Chairman, do you see in the current workforce 
for next-generation reactors, and could the University 
Leadership Program be helpful to meet these needs?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congressman. The University Nuclear 
Leadership Program is already helping meet these needs.
    We are getting graduates out of these programs with 
expertise in material science, nuclear engineering, fuels, et 
cetera. It has been a real asset----
    Mr. Pence. Sure. Is the program robust enough?
    Mr. Hanson. It is. I believe it is robust enough, and----
    Mr. Pence. It is providing you a lot of options?
    Mr. Hanson. It is. Because we are both funding research 
activities at places like Purdue and other big programs, but 
also then we are just funding fellowships and scholarships for 
students, as well, but just academic support.
    Mr. Pence. OK. How can the NRC leverage expertise of 
leading universities like Purdue to meet the challenges posed 
by SMRs, in particular, and other transportable reactors of the 
future?
    Anyone? With 15 seconds left.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Hanson. I think universities play a really important 
role, in part by building some of these new, innovative designs 
at a small scale. So Abilene Christian, University of Illinois, 
Purdue, et cetera, I think, have a real----
    Mr. Pence. So there will probably be something in the 
budget as we go forward, then, I would assume. Thank you.
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you.
    Mr. Pence. I am out of time, and I yield back, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. And she has been 
patiently waiting, so I will go to Texas, the Lone Star State, 
to Mrs. Fletcher for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Fletcher. I was waiting for that Lone Star State. 
Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to Ranking Member 
DeGette for having this hearing. Thank you to the Chairman and 
all the Commissioners for being here and spending your time 
with us this morning.
    I think we have seen from today's hearing that there is 
wide, bipartisan agreement that nuclear energy plays an 
essential role in our system of generating reliable, carbon-
free baseload power. And advances in next-generation nuclear 
technologies, including SMRs that we were just talking about 
and have talked about a lot today, offer real potential 
advancements that could increase efficiency, can improve cost, 
safety, and versatility for our electric grid. These are very 
important issues to those of us in Texas, and something that we 
are working on, not surprisingly, as well.
    Chairman Duncan mentioned in his opening that NEIMA 
required NRC to create a new regulatory framework for advanced 
nuclear reactors to speed up the development of next-generation 
technology. And as Ranking Member DeGette noted, we have heard 
from a lot of stakeholders, especially at our hearing in April, 
that the proposed rule is overly complicated, that it needs to 
change to provide functionality and really to make it possible 
for this advanced nuclear reactor sector to grow.
    So as I said, Mr. Pence was just asking about SMRs, and, 
really, they have a great potential to lower emissions in a 
variety of industries. And that is something that we are 
focused on, which I expect my colleague Mr. Weber, who 
represents the Texas Gulf Coast, may mention next. But I want 
to raise that X-energy, in partnership with Dow Chemical, 
recently announced that they would be deploying first grid-
scale advanced reactor at a site along the Texas Gulf Coast. 
The project, once deployed, could open a new frontier for 
advanced nuclear applications in the industrial sector, 
creating an effective pathway to help energy-intensive 
industries lower their carbon emissions while at the same time 
providing reliable power to support our domestic supply chains.
    While many of these reactors in development haven't shared 
if they plan to use part 53, it is important that the NRC issue 
a rule that allows these innovative technologies to be 
developed. And as we have discussed, I think some of the 
considerations that Congress intended in NEIMA don't seem to be 
included in this rule to develop a technology-inclusive 
regulatory framework that is risk-informed and performance-
based.
    So like I said, we have heard from a variety of 
stakeholders. I would love to get your input on part 53. And 
maybe, if each of you could share your thoughts. As the NRC 
continues to revise the proposed rule, how can a risk-informed 
approach be better incorporated to recognize risk significance 
when it comes to advanced nuclear technology?
    And Chairman Hanson, I would love to start with you and 
then just go down the line.
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you. The staff did tee up, I think, a 
number of key policy issues about part 53: whether or not there 
should be one framework or two; the appropriate role of as-low-
as-reasonably-achievable; the role of risk assessment and 
probabilistic risk assessments; and the role of the design. And 
along with my colleagues, I think our staffs are meeting on a 
weekly basis to basically work our way through these policy 
issues, understand the entire picture of what that rule should 
look like, and, I think, to achieve some potential 
simplification on that.
    I think we are all sensitive to the concern that folks 
perceive it to be complicated, et cetera. So we are diving into 
that, trying to understand the technical basis for that, and 
then diving into what our options might be around that to have 
something that is technology-inclusive, risk-informed, et 
cetera.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Great. Thanks.
    Mr. Baran. It is hard to add much to that. I mean, I agree 
with everything that the Chair said.
    I guess I would just say I think we are all focused on 
getting the substance of the rule right. You know, there is a 
lot to digest. We are digesting it, we are talking about it, 
our staffs are looking at it. I think we have identified the 
key issues, some of which the Chair just talked about. And we 
want to make sure, in the end, at least speaking for myself, 
that we have an efficient and effective framework. And so that 
is the goal. And there is some more work still to do there.
    And then, you know, not to take us off part 53, there are 
other pieces we have got to get in place, too, for the whole 
overall framework.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Great, thank you.
    Commissioner Wright?
    Mr. Wright. Thank you so much.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Anything to add?
    Mr. Wright. First off, it has got to be used and useful, 
right, for the people that are going to use it. And we have 
heard from stakeholders out there that they haven't been 
listened to. I can tell you that is one of the things that we 
are doing. My team, my staff is--we are talking to everybody 
who said they weren't paid attention to. So we want to hear 
from them and see if they are--and if they have got suggestions 
that make sense, we are going to put it in. We are going to 
talk about it.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Great, thanks.
    And I just have a few seconds left, Commissioner Caputo.
    Ms. Caputo. I agree with most of what has been said. I 
think I also agree with a comment made earlier. I am a bit 
struggling with the nature of the staff having sent us a draft 
proposed rule that the vast majority of the industry considers 
unworkable.
    So what I have done is tasked my reactor aide with 
proceeding through the rule on a line-by-line basis to ensure 
that we can--that at least the vote that I cast is the best 
framework possible to be issued as a proposed rule and that we 
are sending something forward that will meet the intent of 
NEIMA and be workable and even beneficial over the existing 
frameworks.
    Mrs. Fletcher. OK, and Commissioner Crowell, in 2 seconds, 
I am way over time.
    Mr. Crowell. I will be very----
    Mrs. Fletcher. Or you can add it for the record.
    Mr. Crowell. I will add it for the record.
    Mrs. Fletcher. Wonderful, that would be great.
    Mr. Crowell. I generally agree with my colleagues that----
    Mrs. Fletcher. Thank you.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you so much, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. You are welcome, thank you. And I will now go 
to Mr. Weber, also from Texas.
    Mr. Weber. Thank you, and I appreciate you all being here.
    I had the South Texas Nuclear Project in my--when I was in 
the State legislature, and we got to go there in 2010 and watch 
them change out spent fuel rods. It is absolutely fascinating. 
They can do it cleanly, they can do it safely.
    Do you all have a periodic schedule, where you go to the 
different plants and watch those kinds of activities?
    Mr. Chairman, I will start with you.
    Mr. Hanson. Oh, yes, absolutely. I am headed out to the 
Midwest next week to go to LaSalle and to the new medical 
isotope facility in Wisconsin. I was in California a couple of 
weeks ago, so I try to hit as many as I can.
    Mr. Weber. Do all the Commissioners have a similar format 
of checking, you know, seeing that process take place? You all 
do?
    Mr. Wright. I am going to add a little bit more to it. I 
actually go and spend a day, what I call an inspector for a 
day. I go and spend a whole day with the resident inspectors 
doing the walk downs and doing what they do.
    Mr. Weber. OK. Well, if you come to South Texas Nuclear 
Plant, they have alligators in their water pond, cooling pond, 
and they taste like chicken. Just so you know.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Wright. I was going to say they taste like chicken.
    Mr. Weber. Yes, sure.
    Ma'am?
    Ms. Caputo. South Texas is one of the plants that I have 
seen. And yes, it is a very impressive facility.
    I think one of the things that gives me a little pause 
going forward is the Commission budget has operated at the same 
level since 2014, with the exception of a couple of years. So I 
think we are getting to a point where there are potentially 
some constraints on staffing and perhaps travel.
    Mr. Weber. OK.
    Ms. Caputo. So I think we are trying to work our way 
through that.
    Mr. Weber. Commissioner?
    Mr. Crowell. I would just say it is, you know, it is an 
incredibly important part of the role as a Commissioner, is to 
visit sites that we regulate, not just for the benefit of the 
site but also so you can be an ambassador for--and reassuring 
the public about the safety case at the NRC, be it at a 
particular site or anywhere in the country.
    Mr. Weber. Yes.
    Commissioner, did we skip you?
    Mr. Baran. Yes. No, I have been to about, I think, about 
maybe 40 of the operating sites at this point.
    Mr. Weber. OK.
    Mr. Baran. And I learn a lot every time, and it is very 
valuable.
    Mr. Weber. To my colleague that said that he was concerned 
about waste being handled safely, they had a video that showed 
them with a really super-big steel container that they put 
waste in. They put it on the flatbed of a railcar, chained it 
all down, and then they rammed it into a concrete barrier at 60 
miles an hour. And of course, the chains break, and the 
container goes spinning off, but it doesn't fail.
    And so, if we could somehow get that word out to the 
American public that we can handle waste cleanly and safely--
have any of you all been to--I am sure you know about Andrews 
County, Texas, Waste Control Specialists, low-level, and--have 
any of you all been there?
    Mr. Crowell. I was just there last week, and I think they 
do an admirable job and could do more.
    And I do agree with your point that the--I don't think the 
public appreciates the robustness of waste packaging and 
transport, and it is really--it is impressive, it is world 
class.
    Mr. Weber. Yes. So how do we get that--how do we get a 
high-level waste facility like that? That is up to us, isn't 
it? Yes. Well, what we ought to do is aim at someplace in 
Nevada, in the mountains. See how that works for us.
    So, Winter Storm Uri 2 years ago February, the water 
cooling system on South Texas Nuclear Project, one of them, 
failed. Now, we have unit 1 and unit 2. When I was in the 
statehouse, they used to brag that unit 1 produced more 
electricity than--for households than any other unit in the 
country, and unit 2 was number 3. I don't know who it snuck in 
there between us, because in Texas we like being in the lead. 
They produce household electricity.
    So did you all get to see the setup? Have you been--you 
have been there to Waste Control, especially. Have you been to 
South Texas lately? Did I miss that? Who has been there the 
most lately?
    Has anybody been in South Texas nuclear project?
    You have. When was that?
    Ms. Caputo. I think it was shortly before that storm.
    Mr. Weber. Winter Storm Uri in February.
    Ms. Caputo. Yes.
    Mr. Weber. Two years ago. Anybody else?
    Ms. Caputo. But I was able, having been there, to talk with 
folks from the plant about the nature of what caused that one 
outage to go down.
    Mr. Weber. Right.
    Ms. Caputo. Because both of those plants are more or less, 
you know, required to be prepared and protect against extreme 
weather events. And as it turns out, I think it was a 6-foot 
piece of insulation that had not been put back after some 
recent work.
    Mr. Weber. Right.
    Ms. Caputo. So it was an oversight on--in terms of not 
following procedures.
    Mr. Weber. Right.
    Ms. Caputo. But----
    Mr. Weber. Funny how that happens.
    Ms. Caputo [continuing]. Otherwise, they were in good 
shape.
    Mr. Weber. Just take the--50 percent of the capacity. They 
got 18 degrees on the Gulf Coast of Texas. I have grown up in a 
20-mile radius, 70 years. I have never seen 18 degrees on 
Galveston Island. Have you all been to Galveston Island?
    We do want you to come down there and spend lots of money. 
But thank you all for what you do. I just want to make sure 
that you all are watching and paying attention and getting out 
there in the field because there's a lot of jobs involved. 
There is a lot of energy and electricity involved in it. So I 
just--I appreciate what you all do. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. We will stay in 
Texas, go to Mr. Veasey for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Veasey. Thank you very much. I want to thank Chairman 
Hanson and the Commissioners for coming here today.
    Nuclear technology has been in use for decades now in the 
U.S., and it still produces about a fifth of U.S. electricity 
with little or no carbon emissions. We use it in Texas on 
ERCOT, and it has been a good, reliable source of energy for a 
lot of Texans.
    And from Germany to California, places planning to retire 
their reactors have now really started to have second thoughts 
on that. I know as Germany, in particular, they are burning a 
record amount of coal because of--partly because of Ukraine's 
unlawful invasion of--Russia's unlawful invasion of Ukraine. 
And as you know, we in Texas are in similar situation where the 
Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant is currently seeking 
relicensing just outside of my district there in Johnson 
County.
    And it is just not the relicensing of existing plants. The 
Department of Energy released a report in March that estimated 
U.S. domestic nuclear capacity has the potential to scale from 
approximately 100 gigawatts in 2023 to about 300 gigawatts in--
by 2050, driven by deployment of advanced nuclear technologies.
    One of these new technologies is being led by Natura 
Resources and sponsored at Abilene Christian University, which 
I have had really great interaction with that group from 
Abilene Christian there to my west. And I know that potential 
new additions of safe, reliable, affordable, and clean nuclear 
power like those being developed and demonstrated at places 
like Abilene Christian are going to be essential to U.S. 
security, U.S. energy security, and the deployment of new 
advanced reactor technology that is going to be crucial for us 
to be able to compete with Russia and China in the global 
nuclear industry. For new nuclear technology to get us to these 
goals, these reactors need to be licensed at a quick pace by 
NRC at scale.
    And my question is that I understand last week Commissioner 
Baran submitted a memo to the Chair and colleagues calling for 
the development of a policy statement on effectiveness and 
efficiency for new reactor reviews. I would like to know from 
each of the Commissioners and the Chairman, do you support 
Commission action to address the elements outlined in 
Commissioner Baran's memo?
    And what--and where do you think current efforts may need 
redoubling to meet the expectations ahead?
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you, Congressman. I certainly support the 
objectives of Commissioner Baran's memo.
    Mr. Veasey. Thank you.
    Mr. Baran. Well, having authored the memo, I would just say 
I look forward to my colleagues' thoughts about it, their ideas 
and suggestions, and I wanted to get the conversation started.
    Mr. Wright. So, yes, I spoke with Commissioner Baran about 
it on Friday, I believe it was when he brought it to us. But I 
am also working with my colleague, Commissioner Caputo, on 
another approach, as well, that brings some urgency to the 
situation as well.
    Ms. Caputo. I am thrilled to see him interested in timely 
licensing, and I fully expect to vote yes on the process.
    My concern is that, by the time a policy statement goes 
through notice and comment, it could be quite some time before 
it is in place, perhaps as long as 3 years or more. So I think 
a very important complement to his memorandum would be the one 
that Commissioner Wright and I are working on to try and put 
metrics in place in the near term.
    Mr. Crowell. I think Commissioner Baran's proposal is both 
timely and appropriate, and I do support it.
    Mr. Veasey. Yes, thank you very much. So what additional 
support does the NRC need from Congress to aid the effective 
and efficient review of advanced reactor technologies? And 
anyone can answer that.
    Mr. Hanson. Congressman, I guess I would kind of focus on 
two things.
    One is just additional hiring authorities so we have got 
that flexibility in the way we bring people on. It is not to 
say that we need a lot more people, necessarily. I have--I 
think I have been pretty consistent in saying that we both need 
to bring new people into the agency and also change the way we 
work.
    And I guess the other thing, then, is that some off-fee 
money, where we don't--we are not relying on folks to come to 
us with a specific product in order to get up to speed on some 
of these reactors and some of the technologies and the novel 
approaches that people are using.
    I would kind of maybe focus on those two things to start.
    Ms. Caputo. As I mentioned earlier, I think Congress giving 
us statutory relief or discretion, at least, in the conduct of 
mandatory hearings, I think, would be very helpful.
    I think certain amount of discretion with regard to the 
reviews that are conducted by our advisory committee on reactor 
safeguards would also create some efficiencies.
    And beyond that, there is a question about whether 
companies that manufacture microreactors or even small reactors 
have the authority to manufacture fully and do some limited 
testing before shipping to the end user. So there might be a 
benefit to creating some clarity in that area to enable reactor 
manufacturers to do limited testing in-house before shipping to 
the final user.
    Mr. Veasey. Yes, thank you very much. My time is expired.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. I will 
go to Mr. Palmer from Alabama for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Palmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Nuclear energy has the potential to transform our energy 
production. We need affordable energy, but we also need clean 
energy, but we desperately need reliable energy. And I think 
nuclear energy can provide that.
    And one of the things that I try to point out to people, 
particularly with next-generation nuclear, you could site one 
next-gen nuclear facility on 640 acres of land to generate the 
same amount of power--or to have the same power generation from 
a wind farm would take 77,000 acres. That doesn't even take 
into account the enormous impact that it will have in terms of 
mining and the extraction of the various elements and 
components that you have to have to even begin to think about 
building a wind or solar farm.
    So Commissioner Caputo, today the NRC--and it is along the 
lines of what you were just talking about, I think--requires an 
environmental impact statement for every new reactor, even for 
reactors that are 1/100th or 1/1,000th the size of traditional 
reactors. Now, that seems like that is overly burdensome.
    So would--and I guess I would direct this to all of you. Do 
you commit to supporting changes to the NRC's regulations to 
allow the use of different types of environmental review, such 
as environmental assessments or categorical exclusions based on 
the actual environmental impact of a reactor?
    Ms. Caputo. Without seeing specifics or a specific 
proposal, I would generally look favorably on those types of 
activities----
    Mr. Palmer. OK----
    Ms. Caputo [continuing]. To streamline our environmental 
reviews. These reviews are--given that licensing is a major 
Federal action subject to NEPA. But within the bound of our 
authorities under NEPA, I would be interested in those kinds of 
proposals.
    Mr. Palmer. Well, in your testimony you mentioned the 
importance of agency innovating with an eye to the future.
    Ms. Caputo. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Palmer. And this is where I am on this, is looking at--
and I know it has been mentioned by a couple of my colleagues 
who have already raised this point about the fact that next-gen 
nuclear can recycle spent fuel rods. You can recover 96 percent 
of the recoverable usable material, and what is left can be 
used for other purposes. For instance, nuclear medicine.
    One of the things that I want to point out, we had a 
hearing in here and we had the director of the national nuclear 
laboratory. And I asked, if we went in this direction, 
considering that there's 39 States where we have--we are--we 
have spent nuclear fuel in storage, I asked had he run the 
calculations to determine how long we could operate our--power 
our country with the spent fuel rod, spent fuel. And he said 
that he had actually run the numbers.
    Do any of you have a--hazard a guess how long we could do 
that?
    Ms. Caputo. I think it is pretty hard to put a number on 
it. It depends on the type of reactor, as well. The numbers 
that you are using, 96 percent, 96 percent of it is reusable. 
But of that 96, there's only a couple percent that actually 
generates fuel----
    Mr. Palmer. Right.
    Ms. Caputo [continuing]. In a conventional reactor. So it 
actually has to be topped up with a little bit of fresh.
    But advanced reactors or fast reactors are able to harness 
the energy in the rest of the 96, and to even perhaps get rid 
of some of that 4 percent. So there is a higher efficiency. It 
would take a significant number of fast reactors to work 
through the spent fuel that we have currently, but that 
opportunity, I think, is there to work that off over a long 
period of time.
    Mr. Palmer. His response was he thought it would last 100 
years, which--I think that is part of what we need to take into 
account.
    And your point, too, you would have to have additional 
fresh fuel into the mix to make this work properly. But the 
point is that we can build these. They will have an operational 
life cycle of a minimum 40 years and could operate much longer 
than that. And they operate 24/7, providing reliable fuel. And 
they are only shut down when you are doing maintenance on a 
reactor.
    Ms. Caputo. If this was Dr. Gehin from Idaho National Lab, 
he might have talked about technologies that Idaho National Lab 
pioneered, which actually, through using a fast reactor, would 
consume most of the long-lived products in the fuel, generating 
a waste product which would decay below the level of natural 
uranium over a span of about 400 years. So the life span of the 
waste product itself that would come at the end of that process 
would be much, much shorter lived than what we currently face.
    Mr. Palmer. Yes.
    Well, Mr. Chairman, my time is expired. I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. I now go to Mr. Sarbanes 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you 
all.
    Chairman Hanson, I just wondered, before I get to my main 
question, if you could speak, if you are able to, to the safety 
activities that NRC has undertaken recently in Maryland around 
the safety of the Calvert Cliffs plant, and I would just be 
curious how that is going, in your view.
    Mr. Hanson. Congressman, I am sorry, I don't have a lot of 
the details in front of me on the specifics on Calvert Cliffs. 
I am happy to get back to you.
    Mr. Sarbanes. That would be great.
    Mr. Hanson. Or reach out to your office.
    Mr. Sarbanes. I appreciate it very much.
    Mr. Hanson. Yes.
    Mr. Sarbanes. So we have had a lot of discussion of the 
part 53 draft, and there's some concerns about the input and so 
forth that has happened around that. Could you just, for my 
benefit, because I think it has been assumed a lot in the 
conversation, describe what the--I think it is two frameworks 
are that are contained within the draft, A and B? What are 
they? What are the differences between the two? What are the 
implications of that for the process, going forward?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, I would be happy to. I will--and I will do 
it as briefly as I can.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Great, yes.
    Mr. Hanson. Framework A is based on--the industry developed 
what they call the Licensing Modernization Project, which is 
really where risk information takes kind of a leading role. You 
have got--you know, if you are a vendor, you have got a 
sufficient information about your design, you can conduct those 
risk analyses to identify the most safety significant aspects, 
and then present those to the NRC.
    In framework B it is a more traditional approach, like what 
we have in 50 and 52, but with a lot of the light-water-
reactor-specific elements kind of stripped out. It is more 
deterministic. It recognizes that, you know, maybe you don't 
have that super-detailed design or you don't have a lot of that 
extra scientific information, so we are going to build some 
extra either operational requirements or physical envelope 
around that reactor to ensure safety.
    There is a third little piece of that. It is kind of 
framework B light, which is really for microreactors, as well, 
in there.
    Mr. Sarbanes. OK. And can you describe where you think, 
ultimately, to the extent you can, this whole new frontier 
around advanced reactors is taking us?
    What is the portfolio going to look like between the more 
kind of traditional approach that we have seen in terms of 
nuclear capacity and the space that will now be occupied? And I 
assume it will be a growing space occupied by these advanced 
reactors. What does that look like, assuming, you know, all the 
regulations go the way they should, or you hope they do, and 
the trajectory rolls out over the next few years--10, 15, 20 
years?
    If you could look forward, what does the broad portfolio 
look like in terms of the relative, you know, participation of 
those two things?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, with the caveat that predicting the future 
is hard, as Yogi Berra said, I would say that we are likely to 
have a kind of a broad portfolio of different--of very 
different technologies--so a pressurized water reactor, a 
boiling water reactor, a high-temperature gas reactor, molten 
salt, et cetera, and then standardized designs in each of those 
fields that allows for kind of broader deployment.
    What we have in the--in this country right now with the 
initial fleet was we have a lot of pressurized water reactors, 
we have a lot of boiling water reactors, and every one of them 
is a little bit different, either in the aspects of the design 
or on the secondary side--the secondary side being, really, the 
electricity generation side.
    So I would see a real move to standardization, and that----
    Mr. Sarbanes. Right.
    Mr. Hanson. That, I think, makes the regulatory process 
substantially easier and more efficient as well.
    Mr. Sarbanes. OK. One other question: How does our progress 
in this regard compare to what is happening with peer nations 
around the globe? Do you see us moving in a way that 
demonstrates leadership here? Just describe the larger 
ecosystem in which you operate.
    Mr. Hanson. I think we do have some leadership, 
particularly in our partnership with Canada and the UK. I think 
the three of us are moving very closely together, deploying and 
evaluating similar kinds of technology.
    I think other countries are coming along, other allies--
France, Korea, Japan, et cetera. They are taking their time a 
little bit more and certainly engaging in some technology 
development efforts, but maybe are a little bit behind that. 
But I would say that the U.S. and these three key nations are 
in a leading role.
    Mr. Sarbanes. Great. Thanks very much.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. And I will now go to the 
Bluegrass State, Mr. Guthrie, for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you, I appreciate that, for recognizing 
the Bluegrass State. We are also an energy State, and so I 
wanted to ask a couple of questions--one for Commissioner 
Caputo and, Commissioner Wright, if you would add as well.
    So power providers in my district, you know, we are famous 
for coal, Kentucky has been,--Kentucky coal. They have started 
establishing nuclear energy generation. We are interested in--
and now that there is some switching to--or making some 
changes.
    But we are being quoted at--our providers--a 10-year 
timeline to get reactors online, including, like, small modular 
reactors.
    So, Commissioner Caputo, do you have any suggestions for 
cutting down the time it takes to get a new reactor online 
without compromising public safety? And it would be helpful if 
you could outline some of the key steps in the licensing 
process.
    And then, Commissioner Wright, if you would add to that, as 
well----
    Ms. Caputo. Sure.
    Mr. Guthrie [continuing]. It would be helpful.
    Ms. Caputo. One of the comments that staff and the 
Commission make prolifically is we really need to see complete, 
high-quality applications. To the extent that a licensee really 
strikes a balance between ensuring that we have all the 
information that we know, and that there is enough information 
for us to reach decisions, I think, is an important way to 
start.
    We also encourage preapplication engagement to more or 
less--particularly with novel technologies--acquaint us with 
the nature of what is going to be in the application when it 
comes forward and ensure that the design is well developed. 
This, I think, is a process that can be very beneficial. I 
think, in the case of the NuScale review that was mentioned 
earlier, this preapplication phase went on for 8 years. So I 
think it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the preapplication 
engagement that is going on is efficient and effective, but 
also on the applicant to ensure that they are well developed.
    From there we go into a review process, which, while we are 
aspiring to achieve 24 months, this would be a new mark for us. 
And so I think, once again, it is incumbent upon us to ensure 
that whichever process or whichever framework a licensee 
chooses, that the staff is operating with a sense of urgency, 
limiting any requests for additional information to the actual 
safety findings that need to be made, not just questions based 
on curiosity about furthering their understanding of a design, 
that we limit the nature of the work that we are doing to 
actually making a decision based on safety.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thanks.
    And Commissioner Wright, anything to add to that?
    Mr. Wright. Well, it is very important that, on our side, 
that we stay within that safety strike zone over home plate, 
that we don't go beyond reasonable assurance. Once it is 
established, it is established.
    I mean, there's some reviews that have to take place: aging 
management, you know, certain structures, components, safety 
systems, all that kind of stuff, and siting. There's ways that 
we have to do certain things. But early engagement is critical. 
And all of this, the more we get done ahead of time and the 
more we get to resolution, the quicker it happens.
    Mr. Guthrie. OK, thank you.
    And Chairman Hanson, you know, as I talked about us being a 
leading energy State, particularly in coal production, we have 
a lot of coal-fired plants, power generation. Some are 
transitioning. And so one of the--some of my folks in my area 
are talking about transitioning our coal power to particularly 
small nuclear, small modular reactors or to nuclear plants. 
Could you talk about some of the barriers in the NRC licensing 
process to converting old coal-fired plants into nuclear power 
plants?
    Mr. Hanson. Congressman, thank you. I am not sure I am 
aware of specific barriers. If you have got a site that has 
some infrastructure on it and is, you know, reasonably well 
characterized, I would expect that the environmental review and 
some other things can be actually more efficient than if you 
were doing something on a greenfield site. So I am not aware of 
specific barriers on that.
    Mr. Guthrie. So they are not treated different, a 
greenfield site and an existing power plant wouldn't be treated 
differently. It is--whatever the application is--and the safety 
that we talked--the steps we talked about is what is----
    Mr. Hanson. Yes.
    Mr. Guthrie [continuing]. Important. OK. Thanks for that.
    So Commissioner Caputo, you highlighted the importance of 
staff leaders who can innovate and cultivate a workforce and 
culture striving to ensure the mission of the NRC is carried 
out. What is the role of the Commission and the role of 
Congress to support this effort?
    And any other Commissioners could add in. So what is the 
role of yourself and ourselves to make sure you have the 
workforce you need?
    Ms. Caputo. I think part of it rests with the Commission in 
terms of the leaders within the agency that the Commission is 
responsible for selecting. But then, below that, I think it is 
incumbent upon the senior leaders in the agency to cultivate 
mid-career folks and give them, I think, particular leadership 
training to prepare them to move into senior roles.
    Mr. Guthrie. OK. Anybody else? I have a couple of seconds.
    Commissioner Crowell?
    Mr. Crowell. This is an incredibly competitive field right 
now, and so it is difficult for a Government agency to 
necessarily compete with the private sector for a limited pool 
of high-quality candidates.
    That being said, the mission of the NRC and the relevance 
of it to our--to, you know, solving contemporary issues today, 
I think, should be a draw for particularly a younger set of 
students.
    Mr. Guthrie. Thank you. And sorry, my interest here is 
absolutely here. I just want to say that there is another 
committee going on, as well, and I have to go back to that. So 
thank you for your time and effort.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Duncan. I thank the gentleman. And as an honorary 
Texan, I start to realize how many Texans we have on this 
committee. I will go to one now. Mr. Pfluger is recognized.
    Mr. Pfluger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you 
holding this hearing in the, you know, the spirit of energy 
security.
    And the ability to have affordable, reliable, dispatchable 
power is so important for us. And I will use an example. We 
recently took a trip where we looked at the ability of our 
European partners to have affordable, reliable energy, and they 
are split. You know, the further west you get, with the 
exception of France, they are turning away from nuclear power. 
The further east you get, closer to Ukraine, closer to the 
reality that geopolitically countries like Russia, Vladimir 
Putin, have used energy as leverage in conflict. The Czech 
Republic, Poland, and these types of countries are completely 
turning towards nuclear because they understand it.
    And you know, my concern--by the way, let me give a shout 
out to Abilene Christian University. The research that they are 
doing is just phenomenal. I am not too far away from them--
although not in my district, 90 miles south, is my hometown, 
and I am very proud of the work that they are doing.
    I am worried about keeping up with technology. And 
Commissioner Caputo, you put it very nicely, and you stated 
some hurdles that we have, and the emerging technologies and 
the ability for the NRC to keep up with those technologies.
    Do you think we are up for the challenge? Are we going to 
meet the speed of relevancy to compete worldwide?
    Ms. Caputo. I think, with increased innovation in our 
procedures and processes, with strong leadership and 
benchmarking and metrics to track our progress, I think those 
are key tools to doing exactly what you have asked.
    I think the expectations that Congress has put on us are 
very important. I certainly feel a sense of urgency for meeting 
that. I think one of the most compelling numbers that I have 
seen lately was just this week, where China and Russia together 
comprise 70 percent of the new reactor business happening in 
the world, and I think that is a very sobering statistic. And a 
lot of the attractiveness for doing business with those 
countries lies outside the regulatory realm and in financing, 
et cetera.
    So our piece of helping America be competitive strongly 
rests in safety, solely rests in safety. But the more we can do 
to create timely reviews and ensure that the world can see that 
the technologies we have have been approved by the regulator 
and put into operation, I think, builds confidence in countries 
that would do business with us that we really do have the best 
options in terms of technology and that they are proven by 
construction and operation here in the U.S.
    Mr. Pfluger. Well, I couldn't agree with you more. We need 
to export our technology, and we do it better, we do it more 
efficient. We just know this better than anybody else. And you 
do play a very important--not the entire role, but a very 
important role in this, and this committee under Chairwoman 
Rodgers' leadership is going to tackle the rest of those issues 
that are preventing us from delivering it here and having that 
affordable, reliable baseload power, but also getting it to our 
allies and partners like Poland, like the Czech Republic, like 
people who are right next to conflict zones or who know this 
business.
    Commissioner Crowell, you mentioned something that has me 
very concerned about the waste management site, WCS, doing more 
in Andrews County. And actually, I disagree with that. And I 
heard discussions about safety, and I have heard discussions 
about stakeholders.
    And Chairman Hanson, I am going to ask you a question here 
in a second, but I don't think that the process that we went 
through in Andrews County actually took into account 
stakeholder community interaction to the degree that it should 
have.
    We have low-level waste that has been there for a while, 
but the community there--and the fact that we have the most 
prolific oil and gas production region in the entire country, 
probably in the world, I think, deserves a permanent solution. 
We don't need an interim solution. And I know this committee 
has been asked about that here.
    Chairman Hanson, do we have a permanent solution in mind? 
Because that part of the world, we have to be very careful 
about where we are putting high-level nuclear waste. And I 
personally am not in agreement with doing more, as was 
suggested. We need a permanent solution.
    Mr. Hanson. Yes. Thank you, Congressman. I certainly 
understand the concern of communities who may be hosting 
interim storage facilities about those being de facto permanent 
facilities. And so part of the overall policy need in the U.S. 
and for Congress and other parts of the executive branch is to 
formulate that policy, that permanent solution that then the 
NRC can come in and evaluate the safety merits of that 
particular solution.
    Mr. Pfluger. We would like to see that. It is very 
important to my district. It is very important to that area of 
Texas, that--the State of Texas has spoken loud and clear about 
its view on not having that as a permanent site. And a 99-year 
lease is not interim, in my opinion. That is very much a 
permanent thing.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. I appreciate the gentleman. I now go to Mr. 
Fulcher from Idaho.
    Mr. Fulcher. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And to the committee, this has been an educational hearing 
for me. And something kind of impressed me a few minutes ago. 
And I looked up the mission statement that you operate on, and 
I am abbreviating, but basically it says to license, to 
regulate, to protect public health and safety. There is nothing 
in there about--anything about efficient development or use.
    Mr. Hanson, you said a few minutes ago it is part of your 
principles. It is not part of your mission. So if I got to ask 
a question, is any kind of efficiency or development important 
to you? Is that part of what you do? And if so, give me an 
example.
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, it really is. I mean, we--you know, on 
offices all over the building we have posted our principles of 
good regulation, and not only what the words are, but what they 
mean underneath. I think a good example of efficiency is the 
Kairos construction permit that we just issued--that we are 
issuing today, the safety evaluation on that. We did that 3 
months ahead of schedule. We were able to track our progress on 
that and identify and resolve the safety-relevant issues very 
efficiently.
    Mr. Fulcher. OK. So in my State of Idaho, we have got the 
Idaho National Lab. Ms. Caputo, I understand you spent some 
time, or you worked there at some point in time. In discussions 
with them and stakeholders, there was three suggestions that 
were brought forth that we attempt to try to promote, and I 
will just summarize them. I can go into detail if you like, but 
you will probably recognize them all.
    Number one is the removal of mandatory, uncontested--the 
mandatory, uncontested hearing requirement, which believes--
they believe would save up to about 6 months.
    Number two would be removal of a contested hearing on 
environmental topics. The specific one has to do with the NEPA 
review, which turns into a series of lawsuits, lawsuits, 
lawsuits, the analyze-paralyze point of things, or at least 
restructure that so that the contested hearing on the 
environmental is at least different. But that is the second 
recommendation.
    And I am going to ask Ms. Caputo to comment on this, and 
then the Chairman or anybody else afterwards, as well. But Ms. 
Caputo, because of your connection with INL.
    The third one was simplify the contested hearing process, 
which currently, as described by the AEA, goes into great 
detail, and potentially the restructure to where it was more 
like a legislative hearing process than its current structure.
    Those are the things which, quite frankly, doesn't do a lot 
of--change the responsibility of your Commission, as I 
understand it. This is all stuff that can be done, process-
wise.
    Could I ask you, Ms. Caputo, what do you think of those 
recommendations? Are they good, are they not? And if so, why or 
why not?
    Ms. Caputo. Well, I definitely agree with the first one. I 
think the devil is in the details on the second two. I think 
there is probably opportunity there, but the details matter. 
And as long as we are meeting our statutory requirements under 
NEPA, to the extent that we can reduce the timeframe through 
streamlining our processes, I would certainly be interested in 
that.
    I would also like to respond to your initial question. I 
think, you know, the Chair--I agree with the Chairman about the 
principles of good regulation. I quote those frequently. I 
think they are really important guideposts for the agency. But 
I also think that we need to do more within the agency in terms 
of creating an expectation and setting objectives to achieve 
more efficient business processes.
    Mr. Fulcher. OK, thank you for that. I have only got a 
minute left, and I want to give Mr. Hanson at least an 
opportunity to talk to this too.
    But in 2008, the State Senate--I remember INL coming in, 
and the State--and the contractor saying, ``We are just around 
the corner on the SMR, we are just around the corner.'' It was 
2023, and we are just around the corner. So we are not making a 
lot of progress.
    I look at your mission, and I see the best thing you can do 
to fulfill your mission is to make sure that we are not 
efficiently developing or using. Mr. Hanson, your comments?
    Mr. Hanson. You are talking about back in 2008?
    Mr. Fulcher. I am talking about we are not making progress, 
at least at the rate where we could be. And I think part of it 
could be the mission that you are carrying out, which is the 
best way to protect public health and safety is not to develop 
and not to use. So we are not. And I would like your comment on 
it.
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, I----
    Mr. Fulcher. How about those recommendations? We have only 
got a few seconds.
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, I don't think we should be--and I have 
said multiple times--we shouldn't be an impediment to the 
deployment of new nuclear. There are other factors out there, 
economic supply chain and other kinds of issues that impact the 
marketplace in the U.S.
    Mr. Fulcher. Mr. Chairman, it appears to me the Commission 
is doing exactly what their mission says they should do, and 
that doesn't include any kind of efficient development or use.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. I now go to Mr. Dunn 
for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Dunn. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I also want to 
thank you for the opportunity to waive on to this hearing 
today.
    As my colleagues have mentioned, nuclear energy plays a 
critical role in American energy security and reliable 
generation of power. This subcommittee is conducting extremely 
important work, and I appreciate the opportunity to join you.
    As you know, Turkey Point is located on the southern tip of 
the Florida peninsula. This is a facility that is critical for 
electrical generation grid stability in southern Florida. The 
geography of the area surrounded by water on three sides 
affords limited connectivity with the national electric grid. 
There really aren't any redundant sources of electricity 
available locally.
    The continued operation of Turkey Point is critical to 
protect--to powering South Florida families and businesses and 
maintaining the electric grid in Florida. While other sites in 
the United States may have other options, South Florida simply 
doesn't have one they can turn to. So continued delays in 
reviewing and processing the Turkey Point license renewal--
renewal--is creating significant uncertainty with no readily 
available alternatives for power generation.
    There is no doubt that Turkey Point is crucial to ensuring 
energy reliability for Florida. However, in 2022, the NRCC, 
under then-Chairman Boran, upended the NRCC regulatory process, 
forcing Turkey point into a new subsequent license renewal 
process.
    This is not a new plant. It has been operating for over 50 
years in Florida, providing clean and reliable power. And 
keeping it running is incredibly important to Floridians. Last 
week, the NRCC again changed the process for Turkey Point, 
delaying it by at least 4 months.
    Gentleman, this is unacceptable. It is imperative that we 
have regulatory certainty, especially when it comes to our grid 
security and reliability.
    Chairman Hanson, has the NRCC considered the impact this 
delay will have to grid reliability in Florida?
    Mr. Hanson. Congressman, the license renewal for the plant, 
I believe, is--the current license is out into the 2030s at 
this point. So we are talking about the renewal now. The plant 
continues to operate. There is no immediate impact to the grid 
in South Florida. And I would expect that review to--I am not 
sure of the specific delays. I would be happy to get back to 
you----
    Mr. Dunn. Yes, I--it is not the impression that I am 
getting from our power generators in Florida.
    So another question: What actions do you think you can take 
going forward to make sure the relicensing decisions get back 
on schedule, since you don't know they are off schedule?
    We need to follow up with each other on this, because this 
is a point of some pain and contention.
    Mr. Hanson. Thank you. No, I think we should--we can and we 
should get more efficient on subsequent license renewals as we 
go through these. And I do agree that we need to risk-inform 
that license renewal review process.
    Mr. Dunn. Did you have some input?
    Ms. Caputo. Yes. I won't comment on Turkey Point in 
particular, because it is a subject of an ongoing adjudication. 
But in general, when it comes to subsequent license renewal, 
the process at Turkey Point is in, license extensions 
fundamentally hinge on aging management, and the aging 
management programs have been established and in place for 
decades, and we have significant experience with them. So----
    Mr. Dunn. We are under the impression you keep changing the 
rules of the game.
    Ms. Caputo. That was on the environmental review side. I 
believe personally that going forward with subsequent license 
review, given this experience and the established timeframe 
that these aging management programs have been in place, we 
should be able to achieve significant efficiencies in 
subsequent license renewals.
    Mr. Dunn. Well, I would certainly like to see that happen.
    Mr. Chairman, what I am looking for is a commitment that--
no more delays in relicensing this plant as long as it is 
performing as per specs.
    Mr. Hanson. I am happy to commit to no additional delays.
    Mr. Dunn. Thank you, sir. You may expect to be hearing from 
other members of the Florida delegation, I am sure.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back now. Now I will go to 
Mr. Carter from Georgia.
    Mr. Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for 
allowing me to waive on, and thank all of you for being here. 
This is extremely important.
    Full disclosure: I am a big advocate of nuclear energy. As 
all of you know, the State of Georgia just started up two 
reactors--started up one and about to start up another one. We 
are very proud of that. We feel like it is safe, it is secure, 
it is reliable, it is clean. It just--we are just very proud of 
that. And I am very, very happy that my State continued on with 
that, albeit through, obviously, as you are aware, very--a lot 
of obstacles. But nevertheless, we got there.
    I am also encouraged by recent steps that the NRC has 
approved, and that is the first advanced SMR nuclear design and 
breakthroughs in fusion. All of those are encouraging to me. So 
I am excited, to be quite honest with you, about what the 
future holds.
    And I see Europe, and I have been to Europe, and I have 
been with the Conservative Climate Caucus and witnessed what I 
have seen over there. Unfortunately, they have--to me, they 
have made some serious errors in that they have allowed their 
policies to get ahead of their technology. And a lot of the 
countries over there--not all of them, but a lot of them--have 
closed down their nuclear plants, and now they are having to 
revert back to coal and to other forms of energy that they 
didn't want to have to use as a result of letting their 
policies get ahead of their technology.
    But France is a leader in the space. We know that. France 
is committed to nuclear. So I am excited about that. And 
Finland just finished Europe's largest nuclear reactor. So--
giving them some independence from Russia, and that is 
certainly something that we have got to be aware of on the 
world stage, is our reliance on Russia and China.
    One of the things I wanted to talk about is a bill that 
Representative Scott Peters, a Democrat, and I, a Republican, 
have, a bipartisan bill, obviously, and it is called the Global 
Nuclear Energy Assessment and Cooperation Act. And this is a 
bill that will take a multipronged approach to promoting 
nuclear energy around the world.
    First of all, it will prohibit the import of fuels from 
adversarial nations like Russia and China. And we do need to 
have energy independence. And I am--I think this is a good move 
on our part.
    Secondly, introduces a program, the International Nuclear 
Reactor Export and Innovation Branch, that the NRC Commission 
to--would have to focus on international nuclear efforts, 
including training and sharing expertise with our allies. We 
need our allies in this area, and I think you all--I hope you 
all--recognize that and agree with that. It would inspire 
coordination, research, and development of the U.S. and our 
allies so we can create a safe and secure world and have energy 
independence without having to depend on our adversaries.
    So I wanted to ask you, Commissioner Hanson, there is a 
growing appetite for nuclear power around the world. And 
clearly, we would much rather help provide our allies than 
Russia and China, who will use them as leverage. And we have 
witnessed that with Russia already. How does having a robust 
international market for nuclear technologies benefit the 
American nuclear industry?
    Mr. Hanson. Yes, thank you, Congressman. Let me just say we 
are working closely with our allies on this. My phone is quite 
literally ringing off the hook for folks who want to come and 
interact with the NRC on U.S. technology. And we are providing 
the kind of training and assistance that you mentioned in our 
bill.
    I think, as we think about the market pull for standardized 
designs in reactors, having multiple areas of deployment, 
whether that is, you know, you combine--if you think about the 
GE BWX 300, that being deployed both in the U.S. and in Canada, 
well, that contributes to the economy of scale that makes that 
deployment very economical.
    Well, you combine that then with what the Poles are looking 
at--I am going to meet with my--and sign an agreement with my 
Polish counterpart tomorrow morning, actually, to continue our 
cooperation there. Then that is an additional market pull that, 
again, increases the economics of that, makes the reactors 
ultimately, I think, cheaper for us domestically but also then 
extends our influence.
    We know that deploying reactors around the world is a 100-
year relationship. I think it is important to the----
    Mr. Carter. So I don't want to put words in your mouth, but 
it sounds to me like you feel like the NRC plays an important 
role in facilitating this.
    Mr. Hanson. I have advocated that the NRC should be part of 
the value proposition in U.S. nuclear----
    Mr. Carter. Commissioner Wright, do you want to comment on 
that?
    Mr. Wright. I mentioned earlier I was in Romania when the 
NuScale announcement was made and was visiting with them, and 
they need our help. And we have got to be timely and----
    Mr. Carter. We need them.
    Mr. Wright. We do.
    Mr. Carter. We need each other.
    Mr. Wright. Yes, we do. And in fact, there was talk that 
NuScale might be done there before it was built here, and that 
we would be learning from each other----
    Mr. Carter. Good, good. Well, thank you all. And please, 
look at this legislation because it is with the best of 
intentions--and of course, I know about intentions.
    But nevertheless, we need to have energy independence. And 
nuclear energy is one of the ways that we can have that. And 
again, I couldn't be prouder of the State of Georgia for what 
we have done with our nuclear reactors.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
    Mr. Duncan. The gentleman yields back. And seeing there's 
no further Members wishing to ask questions, I want to thank 
all the witnesses and the Commissioners for being here today 
for your answers, your comments, your statements.
    As you see, on both sides of the aisle we are very 
interested in the propagation of nuclear power across the 
country to meet Americans' energy needs. We are going to 
continue to press forward, continue the oversight, but continue 
to work with NRC for the future of nuclear power in this 
country.
    And so, pursuant to committee rules, I will remind Members 
that they have 10 business days to submit additional questions 
for the record. And I ask that witnesses submit their responses 
within 10 business days upon receipt of the questions.
    And with that, thank you once again, and we will stand 
adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 1:22 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
