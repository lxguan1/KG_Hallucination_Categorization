                                      Committee on Finance,
                                                    Washington, DC.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM 
             OREGON, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE

    The Chairman. The Finance Committee will come to order. In 
recent memory, the Finance Committee has a proven record of 
working together, Democrats and Republicans, to solve big 
national challenges. Recently, we helped more Americans save 
for a dignified retirement. We cut taxes for families and small 
businesses. We updated the Medicare guarantee with the CHRONIC 
Care Act. We made progress on helping Americans get mental 
health care when they need it. And we passed the historic 
Family First Act with groundbreaking new policies to promote 
kinship care.
    I strongly believe the next opportunity for a big, 
bipartisan initiative is affordable housing. Few things unite 
Americans quite like the feeling that the rent is too damn high 
or saving for a down payment is a pipe dream. This is an issue 
in all 50 States: in big urban downtowns, medium-sized cities, 
in the suburbs, even in smaller communities and rural areas.
    Let's look at what 5 years of rent increases have done in a 
handful of cities relevant to this committee. In my hometown of 
Portland, data from Zillow shows the average monthly rent 
jumped by $335, nearly 23 percent; Charlotte, NC, $558 increase 
or 46 percent; Memphis, TN, a $428 increase or nearly 50 
percent; Boise, ID, a $639 increase, sending monthly rates 57 
percent higher.
    The outlook isn't much better for people looking to buy a 
home, particularly young people looking to buy a first home. 
According to a new report from the National Association of 
Realtors, the share of sales going to first-time home buyers 
fell last year to the lowest level on record. Whether it's 
unaffordable rents or unattainable mortgages, oftentimes it is 
Blacks and Latinos who are hit the hardest. So how should 
Congress go about solving this challenge?
    For a long time, you were pretty much breaking the rules if 
you said you had some supply-side ideas. I want everybody to 
know I'm a supply-sider when it comes to housing, colleagues. 
We have to create more housing supply.
    Now, for many years Senator Cantwell has been the champion 
of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, what's known as LIHTC. It 
is the most successful Federal program for affordable housing 
that there is. The bill she and Senator Young have put forward, 
the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act, would expand 
LIHTC to create 2 million new units nationwide.
    Yesterday, Senator Cardin and Senator Young introduced the 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act, which is all about giving a 
private investment boost for housing in blighted and struggling 
neighborhoods that need it most. I am pleased to be a cosponsor 
of both of their bills. They're both priorities that we include 
in a comprehensive bill I've offered called the DASH Act, the 
Decent, Affordable, and Safe Housing for All Act. I am 
reintroducing DASH today.
    Another component of DASH is what I have named the Middle-
Income Housing Tax Credit, so we would have LIHTC in America, 
but for firefighters and nurses and teachers and all these 
hard-hit middle-income folks we'd have MIHTC. And I've heard so 
often at home, particularly in Portland, but all around the 
State, how important middle-income housing is.
    America has fallen behind in building housing for decades, 
and the housing shortage has extended into the middle class, so 
I want to see middle-income housing supplement low-income 
housing, what's known as LIHTC. If a given State housing agency 
wants to use its MIHTC credits for low-income housing, my bill 
says it could allow those resources into LIHTC.
    And I'd just like to say, colleagues--and we're going to be 
talking, I think, a lot about this--it's my view that in 2023 
providing the States with this kind of flexibility is 
absolutely essential to increasing housing supply where it is 
needed most. You can't talk now about housing without 
addressing homelessness, a priority in the DASH Act.
    It's clear that those experiencing homelessness need more 
help than they're getting. Furthermore, building more 
affordable housing today is going to reduce homelessness 
tomorrow, which would prevent a lot of individual suffering and 
save taxpayers' dollars.
    I know we're also going to talk about the importance to 
keep pushing State and local authorities to cut back on the 
thicket of zoning rules that get in the way of building the 
housing that is so essential. This is another area Senator 
Crapo and I have talked about, essentially all these areas 
where there's an opportunity for bipartisan agreement in the 
tradition of those several bills that I talked about in my 
opening statement. These restrictive zoning laws can hurt local 
economies--and what is even worse, they often amount to a back-
door method of segregation.
    So, there's lots for the committee to talk about today. My 
view is, along with mental health care, rural health, and a 
number of other topics, affordable housing is one of the areas 
where this committee, as has been our tradition, can come 
together in a bipartisan way and make real progress.
    [The prepared statement of Chairman Wyden appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Senator Crapo?

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE CRAPO, 
                   A U.S. SENATOR FROM IDAHO

    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and you 
have well laid out the issue today. I appreciate not only your 
focus on this issue and supply-side solutions, but the fact 
that you recognized the bipartisan work that we do in this 
committee and identify this as one of the key areas where we 
ought to be able to accomplish similar solutions.
    When this committee held a hearing on housing last summer, 
we had just learned that consumer price inflation had spiked to 
9.1 percent, the highest in more than 40 years. The shelter 
component of the consumer price index was up 5.6 percent 
relative to a year earlier, and rents were up by nearly 6 
percent.
    Unfortunately, for renters and potential homeowners, the 
mislabeled Inflation Reduction Act did nothing to address 
inflation and rising costs, but is in fact projected to 
exacerbate inflation in the near term. As the Federal Reserve 
attempts to control price growth with interest rates hikes, 
mortgage rates have hit highs not seen since the 2008 financial 
crisis and are now hovering at 6.5 percent, slowing investment 
in the housing market and pricing many buyers in Idaho and all 
across the country out of the market.
    January's overall consumer price inflation is still 
significantly above normal, hitting 6.4 percent annually. 
Shelter accounts for over half of the core increase, up 7.9 
percent over the last year. Inflation is also eating away at 
the value of wages. Real hourly earnings have declined 1.8 
percent. Across the country, Americans are faced with 
unaffordable housing. Specifically, lower-income Americans are 
facing a shortage of about 7 million affordable homes, and the 
supply of affordable housing continues to fall short of demand, 
with the gap increasing every year.
    One tax tool used to address the supply shortage and 
incentivize builders to create affordable homes is the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC. It is responsible for 
generating a majority of all affordable rental housing created 
in the United States today and generally enjoys bipartisan 
support in Congress. Several members of this committee have 
been working across the aisle to find affordable housing 
solutions.
    Senator Wyden has very well described those efforts. Again, 
these proposals include changes to LIHTC and new tax 
incentives. Senators Young and Cantwell, as well as several 
other members, are working to reintroduce the Affordable 
Housing Credit Improvement Act, which would bolster LIHTC for 
developing and preserving affordable housing.
    Senators Young and Cardin introduced the Neighborhood Homes 
Investment Act, which would create a Federal tax credit to 
finance home building and rehabilitation in urban and rural 
neighborhoods. Other Finance Committee members have expressed 
interest in addressing the affordable housing supply shortage, 
including one of our newest members, Senator Blackburn. And 
obviously, as he indicated, our chair, Senator Wyden, has 
introduced the Decent, Affordable, and Safe Housing for All (or 
DASH) Act, which brings the concept of middle-income housing 
tax credits into play. I thank you all for your hard work.
    Targeted tax policies such as LIHTC are an important part 
of solving housing affordability and supply issues, but we must 
also address the drivers that are raising the cost of housing 
generally. When input and regulatory costs are high, LIHTC is 
less effective. Zoning laws and regulatory barriers are often 
uncoordinated, unnecessary, or overly cumbersome, and can 
ultimately work against the goal of providing affordable 
housing by creating excessive development costs.
    States and localities with the most restrictive zoning laws 
and regulatory barriers often have the most severe shortages in 
affordable housing. As a result, Federal, State, and local 
leaders must work together to reduce regulatory barriers, and 
they should look to success stories around the country.
    In Houston, local leaders reduced the minimum lot size from 
5,000 to 1,400 square feet. After initial success, the reform 
was expanded to cover the entire city. Due in part to the 
ability for small-lot construction, Houston's median house 
price is below the national median. Further, it is estimated 
the average Houston household benefited from this reform by 
roughly $18,000.
    In order to make it economically viable to build across 
price points in the market, these supply-side factors need to 
be addressed. Overall tax costs, regulations, supply chain 
bottlenecks, and financing expenses all enter into investment 
decisions. Overall, there is no better cure to housing 
affordability than a healthy, thriving economy. The pro-growth 
policies in Republicans' 2017 tax reform led to one of the 
strongest economies in decades: low unemployment, a low poverty 
rate, strong wage growth, high median incomes, increased 
investment, and record Federal tax revenues.
    We should preserve these policies and explore additional 
opportunities to promote growth, increase investment, and 
encourage research and development in the United States. I look 
forward to discussing with today's witnesses ways to ensure 
that affordable housing is accessible and that the American 
dream of home ownership remains attainable.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Crapo appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Crapo, and I especially 
appreciate the fact that, as we get out of the gate in this new 
Congress, on housing we've got a lot of opportunities to bring 
the committee together in our long-time tradition.
    Let me introduce our witnesses. Our first witness will be 
Ms. Denise Scott. She's president of Local Initiatives Support 
Corporation, where she has investments nationwide, with over 3 
decades of experience in community development. She's also a 
member of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York and has taught at Columbia University.
    Next, I'm pleased that we've got our colleague from 
Washington, who is noted for and has been a long-time advocate 
of these crucial issues, and she's going to introduce our next 
witness, Steve Walker.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                 A U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and 
Senator Crapo for having this important hearing and for all the 
work last year when we engaged in conversations, both on the 
Chips and Science Act and year-end packages to try to get the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit addressed, and I look forward to 
working with you this year.
    We're here today to listen to Steve Walker, who's executive 
director of the Washington State Housing Finance Commission and 
he has been working on affordable housing projects for 30 
years. In 1996, he joined the Washington Housing Finance 
Commission and oversaw the financing of affordable apartments 
and projects for families, and became their executive director 
in 2019.
    As you both mentioned, the shortage of 7 million rental 
homes nationwide is extremely important for low-income renters. 
And last week the Washington State Department of Commerce 
reported that our State will need to add 1.1 million homes over 
the next 20 years, and more than half of those must be 
affordable for residents at the lowest income levels to meet 
our population growth.
    I can't tell you how astounding that is just to hear, 
because we already knew in Washington that we need an 
incredible investment in workforce housing. I think, if 
anything, our committee could address the challenges that our 
economy faces by making sure that we have workforce housing to 
make sure that people can afford to live where the jobs are. 
And that is part of the efforts in the expansion of Chips and 
Science, or just in general, as our economy returns.
    So together--you mentioned our colleagues, Senators Young 
and Blackburn and myself, continuing to work on this 
legislation. I look forward to working with both of you, but 
Mr. Steve Walker will address the Low-Income Housing Tax 
Credit, tax-exempt Private Activity Bonds, and how they've 
played a crucial role in providing housing to millions of 
families.
    So, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cantwell. And you're spot-
on about the urgency of this workforce issue. I was home for 
town meetings recently--got some more coming up this weekend--
and when I walked into a room where I expected a host of kind 
of economic issues I'd heard before, I was told by school 
officials that school districts are having to actually buy 
houses--buy houses--so they can make them available to their 
teachers. So the urgency you have stressed is spot-on.
    We're very pleased that the committee is going to be joined 
by Sharon Wilson Geno, president of the National Multifamily 
Housing Council. She also brings an extensive background: three 
decades working various areas of housing law. She also teaches 
courses on housing law at George Washington and Georgetown.
    Next is Mark Calabria. He's a senior advisor at the Cato 
Institute. He served as Director of the Federal Housing Finance 
Agency, as Chief Economist to Vice President Pence, and as an 
aide to the Banking Committee here in the Senate.
    Garrett Watson is a senior policy analyst and modeling 
manager at the Tax Foundation, where he conducts research on 
Federal and State tax policy.
    Ms. Scott, we're glad you're here, and we'll begin with 
your testimony.

STATEMENT OF DENISE SCOTT, PRESIDENT, LOCAL INITIATIVES SUPPORT 
                CORPORATION (LISC), NEW YORK, NY

    Ms. Scott. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm 
really pleased to be here. Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member 
Crapo and members of the committee, I'm honored to join you 
this morning to discuss the urgent need to expand our Nation's 
affordable housing supply and the measures this committee must 
take to address the housing crisis.
    My name is Denise Scott, as you heard, and I work for LISC, 
one of the largest nonprofit housing community development 
organizations in the country, and we're also a certified CDFI. 
And I thank you, Senator Crapo, for joining Senator Warner in 
founding the Senate's Community Development Finance Caucus. 
LISC has offices in over 38 urban markets, stretching from 
Richmond to Toledo, Houston, and Seattle. And we also have a 
rural program reaching 2,000 rural counties in 49 States and 
including Puerto Rico.
    If there is one unifying truth across all these markets, 
it's that the lack of housing supply is hampering the ability 
of families of modest means to achieve financial stability. 
Nearly half of all renters are cost-burdened, meaning that rent 
eats up at least 30 percent of their monthly income; and one in 
four renters pays more than 50 percent of their income in rent, 
leaving little money available each month for groceries, 
medicine, child care, and other basic necessities.
    And it's not just the lowest-income populations that are 
struggling, as you have heard, although they are feeling the 
greatest pain. We are also hearing from municipalities around 
the country that they're having difficulty housing teachers and 
firefighters and health-care workers. And we know that an 
inadequate supply of quality, affordable housing in many rural 
communities is hampering their ability to attract employers.
    In addition, historic home prices since the pandemic have 
combined with high interest rates and limited supply to keep 
home ownership out of reach for far too many families. This is 
effectively shutting down the main path to wealth across 
generations, particularly households of color. The good news is 
that this committee has under its jurisdiction powerful tools 
to address the housing crisis and there is bipartisan support 
to do so.
    First and foremost, the committee can enhance the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit. The Housing Credit is the Nation's 
most successful housing tool. It has been responsible for the 
production of most of the country's affordable housing, and 
more than 50 percent of the households in tax credit properties 
are extremely low-income families.
    Congress could spur the creation of over 2 million more 
rental units over the next decade by enacting the Affordable 
Housing Credit Improvement Act, bipartisan legislation 
introduced last session by Senators Cantwell and Young; and by 
restoring the 12.5-percent increase to the formula to the 
allocated tax credits--an increase that was enacted through 
bipartisan legislation in 2018, but expired in 2021.
    As detailed in my testimony, the committee could consider 
other measures to improve the program that emphasize long-term 
preservation of affordability, including the Qualified Contract 
and the right of first refusal provisions. In addition, 
Congress can pass the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act, which 
would create 500,000 new homes over the next decade. This 
bipartisan legislation, just introduced by Senators Cardin and 
Young, would attract private capital to support investments in 
single-family homes in rural and urban communities suffering 
from displacement and high vacancies.
    In these communities, the cost of developing and 
rehabilitating homes often exceeds the value of the homes. The 
Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit fills the gap between the cost of 
construction and the value of the property. It would therefore 
fill a void in our affordable housing tax financing ecosystem, 
providing an effective and necessary tool for revitalizing and 
repopulating communities, while also providing affordable home-
ownership opportunities for first-time, first-generation home 
buyers.
    In closing, there is a supply gap of approximately 3.8 
million homes in this country, more depending on how you count. 
And this gap is only likely to grow in the near term in light 
of high interest rates and the spike in the cost of 
construction. Enacting both the Housing Credit Improvement Act 
and Neighborhood Homes will spur the production of 2.5 million 
housing units over the next decade, cutting into a sizable 
portion of that supply gap and getting us much closer to 
ensuring that all families in this country are able to enjoy 
the health, well-being, and financial security that an 
affordable home provides. We just need Congress to act and to 
act quickly.
    Thank you, and I'm happy to answer any questions that you 
may have.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Scott appears in the

    The Chairman. Thank you very much, Ms. Scott.
    Mr. Walker from the Northwest.

STATEMENT OF STEVE WALKER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WASHINGTON STATE 
            HOUSING FINANCE COMMISSION, SEATTLE, WA

    Mr. Walker. Good morning. Thank you for convening this 
hearing, Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo. And thank 
you, Senator Cantwell, for your years of steadfast leadership 
in affordable housing. It's an honor to be here. My name is 
Steve Walker. I currently have the privilege of serving as the 
executive director of the Washington State Housing Finance 
Commission.
    I am a public servant with the charge of meeting my State's 
affordable housing challenges, and our number one challenge is 
the lack of enough decent, affordable apartments that low-
income folks can reasonably afford. My peers, the officials who 
run their own State housing finance agencies, would say the 
same thing.
    The Housing Credit program is our Nation's most effective 
tool. It's not the only tool, but it is the most effective tool 
for this challenge: building affordable housing. And the truth 
is that the private sector simply cannot and does not produce 
apartments at rents that low-income folks can afford.
    Low-income folks include people like baristas and warehouse 
workers, bank tellers, teachers, and retired seniors. In 
Washington State, as in many others, the shortage of housing 
has caused rents to rise so far out of proportion to incomes 
that thousands of families, especially families of color, are 
being pushed further and further away from their jobs and from 
their communities in search of affordable rents.
    Rents take up a larger and larger part of the household 
budget. Those who are struggling can easily fall into 
homelessness, and they do, at rates that we have not ever seen 
before; yet the majority of apartments coming online today, 
almost anywhere you look, are only affordable to the top of the 
market. Simply providing rental vouchers, as some have 
suggested, would do nothing to change this dynamic.
    We need to produce affordable housing, and that's what the 
Housing Credit does. In fact, the credit is the only Federal 
program that makes it economically feasible for developers to 
do that. It made possible 3.7 million apartments for low-income 
households across the U.S., 130,000 in Washington State alone.
    As in other States, you will find these homes in urban, 
suburban, and rural neighborhoods in every part of Washington. 
They include family-sized apartments in our agricultural Yakima 
Valley, studio apartments in downtown Seattle and in Spokane, 
senior buildings with health-care clinics on site, and family 
buildings with child care on site.
    Many of you have seen these successes with your own eyes 
and have met residents who share how having a safe, affordable 
apartment has changed their lives. That is why the Housing 
Credit has earned so much support in Congress for nearly 40 
years, because members clearly see the benefit to their States 
and to their districts from this highly effective, proven tool.
    Literally, hundreds of Democrats and Republicans in both 
chambers have cosponsored bills to expand and strengthen the 
program; 252 members in the last Congress alone. Because the 
Housing Credit is working, we simply need more of it. 
Unfortunately, in the last few years we've gone the other way--
for example, letting the temporary increase to the credit 
lapse.
    The good news is that Senator Cantwell from my State--along 
with Senator Young, Senator Blackburn, and Chairman Wyden--is 
poised to reintroduce the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement 
Act. Cosponsoring this bill is the single most important thing 
each member of this committee and every member of the Senate 
can do to support affordable housing in your State.
    I ask that you support complementary legislation. Chairman 
Wyden, Senator Cortez Masto, Senators Cardin and Young have 
introduced legislation that would support both affordable 
rental housing and affordable home ownership. Because safe, 
affordable housing is the most important foundation that 
families and communities can have, I urge you to support the 
Affordable Housing Credit and ensure that all communities 
throughout our country can build on this foundation.
    Thank you for this opportunity to testify.

    The Chairman. Thank you very much.
    Next is Ms. Geno.

     STATEMENT OF SHARON WILSON GENO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL 
          MULTIFAMILY HOUSING COUNCIL, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Geno. Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, members of 
the committee, thank you for the privilege of testifying on 
behalf of the National Multifamily Housing Council and the 
National Apartment Association.
    My name is Sharon Wilson Geno, and I'm the president of 
NMHC. For more than 30 years, NMHC and NAA have partnered to 
provide a single voice for the American apartment industry that 
provides apartment homes for 38.9 million Americans, accounting 
for almost one-third of the U.S. housing stock and contributing 
$3.4 trillion of economic value to our economy annually.
    America is facing a housing affordability crisis without a 
doubt. While challenges differ from community to community, 
many families, seniors, and people with disabilities are unable 
to rent homes due to increased costs driven by a lack of 
supply, barriers to development, and regulatory burdens. The 
total share of cost-burdened households--those paying more than 
30 percent of their income--has increased dramatically over the 
last several years as wages have not kept pace with costs, 
while others are priced out of communities all together.
    Put simply, we have a housing supply shortage. And while 
it's taken decades to get to this point, it will take time to 
reverse. We must begin addressing this issue today. NMHC and 
NAA estimate the U.S. needs to build 4.3 million more apartment 
homes by 2035 to make up for decades-long underbuilding to meet 
future demand and avoid increasingly expensive housing.
    We have kicked the can down the road long enough. We urge 
Congress to act on a variety of legislative proposals that will 
generate housing resources for Americans of today and tomorrow. 
The apartment industry stands ready to help meet the rising 
need for attainably priced rental housing, but we cannot do it 
alone. It requires strong partnership between the public and 
the private sectors.
    There is no magic silver bullet here, but a multifaceted 
approach can be effective in easing current market conditions. 
On the tax policy front, we strongly recommend passage of the 
Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act of 2021, as this 
bipartisan bill would increase the availability of Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credits to develop nearly 2 million homes, and 
would help across the U.S. in rural, urban, and suburban 
communities.
    In addition to the acute need for low-income housing, 
affordability also threatens the middle-income tier, including 
teachers, firefighters, nurses, and police officers. That group 
has an increasing percentage of folks who are cost-burdened 
right now--up to 26 percent of that population.
    We urge Congress to finance an additional 344,000 
affordable homes by enacting Chairman Wyden's proposed Middle-
Income Housing Tax Credit, which builds off the success of the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.
    Additionally, NMHC and NAA support proposals that would 
build on Senator Tim Scott's Opportunity Zones proposal, as 
well as Senator's Stabenow and Brown's legislation to encourage 
adaptive reuse of underutilized commercial space. While tax 
laws would help spur development and preservation of affordable 
housing, we must also deliver short-term solutions and enhance 
assistance for residents who are struggling. This includes 
increasing the supply of section 8 housing choice vouchers, as 
well as other supports for families in need.
    Regulatory obstacles at all levels of government also 
prevent us from delivering housing our country so desperately 
needs. NIMBYism and antiquated and discriminatory zoning laws 
make it difficult for developers to develop in many communities 
across the country, thereby impeding our ability to increase 
supply.
    There are a number of proposals to cut some of the 
regulatory red tape in the administration's Housing Supply 
Action Plan issued last May. These efforts, among other things, 
would reward jurisdictions that have reformed zoning and land 
use policies with higher scores in certain Federal grant 
processes and deploy new financing mechanisms to build and 
preserve more housing where financing gaps currently exist.
    Access to stable quality housing in communities of choice 
has been proven time and time again to be critical to achieving 
economic stability, positive health outcomes, educational 
attainment, good nutrition, and other indicators. For that 
reason, it has always been a bipartisan issue. For the sake of 
the residents who live in rental housing today and those who 
don't have access to it, we urge you to work across the aisle 
with urgency to enact these proposals and others described in 
our testimony.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to hearing the 
committee's questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Geno appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you for finishing with urgency, because 
that's what we're trying to convey.
    Dr. Calabria?

  STATEMENT OF MARK A. CALABRIA, Ph.D., SENIOR ADVISOR, CATO 
                   INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, DC

    Dr. Calabria. Thank you, Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member 
Crapo, and distinguished members of the committee. Thank you 
for the invitation to appear at today's hearing.
    Too many working families face significant housing cost 
burdens. The dramatic increase in mortgage rates, along with 
inflation and building and materials costs, have created 
historic price pressures. Let me also say, while I come from a 
Banking Committee background, I've always been impressed with 
the Finance Committee's commitment to housing.
    I will note we have the unique advantage that the chairman 
and ranking member of Banking are also members of Finance, so 
perhaps we can not only have something bipartisan, but bi-
committee working across housing issues. I think this is 
particularly important, because the development of assisted 
housing has become so overly complex, with multiple layers of 
subsidies, different rules, different application cycles.
    For instance, most tax credit developments are often used 
in conjunction with non-tax subsidies such as HOME or CDBG. 
Considerable expense is incurred coordinating, combining these 
various subsidies. Perhaps you would like to think about it 
this way. I'm suggesting we put a few lawyers out of work and 
maybe streamline some of these programs so we can actually 
deliver those benefits to the renters themselves.
    So I would really encourage any changes to the tax credit 
to be coordinated with other housing programs under the 
jurisdiction of the Banking Committee, particularly section 8, 
which is widely used by tax credit renters. I would also urge 
the committee to take a broader perspective of where we may be 
in the multifamily construction cycle. To quote a recent 
Freddie Mac report, multifamily is at an inflexion point.
    The bulk of evidence suggests the national rental market 
has been softening, and we may be entering an actual oversupply 
of multifamily--I do want to emphasize an oversupply at these 
price points; not a structural oversupply, but more a cyclical 
oversupply. And while of course forecasting is always 
difficult, most indicators suggest that rents will decline over 
the next 12 to 18 months. So, I would just urge some 
cautiousness to thinking about adding stimulus to additional 
construction at a time when we are likely passing the peak of 
this cycle.
    The primary drivers, of course, of housing costs nationally 
are land cost, labor costs, material costs. And I would really 
urge Congress--perhaps out of the jurisdiction of this 
committee--but one area where Congress can make a really big 
difference is to convert federally held land into land that 
could be used to develop housing. I would urge members to take 
a look at the model that's been used in Nevada. Las Vegas would 
be considerably more expensive if we did not have former 
Senator Reid to thank for helping convert Federal lands to 
developed lands--again, outside the jurisdiction of this 
committee, but an important ability to add supply to the 
marketplace.
    A little bit back to the jurisdiction of this committee, I 
think we can make a big difference in material costs if we can 
make some differences and resolve some of our trade disputes, 
particularly with Canadian lumber and aluminum. And while I 
would mostly recommend caution at this point in the cycle, if 
the committee were to revisit the legislative framework for the 
tax credit, I would make the following recommendations.
    First, I would make the tax credit look a little bit more 
like HUD's HOME program. The purpose for this is that HOME 
offers a wide variety of uses. It can pay for security 
deposits, it can pay for rental assistance; and really keep in 
mind, while we do have a national housing crisis, every market 
is different.
    And to me, the more flexibility we can have for local 
market conditions, the better in terms of meeting needs on the 
ground. And so that's just an important consideration, from my 
perspective. I also want to first commend the number of State 
housing finance agencies that go above and beyond the Federal 
income targeting requirements in the tax credit, but my view is 
I think we can make additional success in helping prioritize 
those families most in need.
    And while of course there are rental burdens across the 
income spectrum, those at the bottom are so severely out of 
line with those in the middle or the top. I would urge the 
committee, for instance, to consider the addition of a sub-goal 
of having a certain percentage of units going to households 
under 30 percent of area median income.
    As one of the Banking Committee staffers responsible for 
drafting and negotiating the 2005 reauthorization of the 
Violence Against Women Act, I do want to be very clear that I'm 
disappointed in Treasury's slow movement in meeting its 
obligations under VAWA in response to tax credit properties.
    Let me also say there are a large number of rental units 
outside of the footprint of the tax credit, and we have a large 
number of vacant properties. So one of the things I would 
lastly suggest is, let's ask about how we get all of these 
small properties--half of renters live in units and properties 
under five units. How do we start bringing them into the cycle? 
And one thing I would suggest is we directly allow, say, the 
first $500 in monthly rent to be tax-free so as to encourage 
those subsidies beyond the traditional tax credit, higher-
density properties.
    Again, I thank you for your time this morning and look 
forward to your questions and comments.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Calabria appears in the 
appendix.]
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Mr. Watson?

STATEMENT OF GARRETT WATSON, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AND MODELING 
            MANAGER, TAX FOUNDATION, WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Watson. Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, 
distinguished members of the Senate Finance Committee, thank 
you for the opportunity to provide testimony on how to improve 
tax policy to increase affordable housing supply and serve 
working families. I'm Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst of 
the Tax Foundation, where I focus on how we can improve our 
Federal tax code.
    Today I'll recommend ways to improve the Low-Income Housing 
Tax Credit, known as LIHTC, to ensure that it is effective at 
providing affordable housing to low-income Americans. I'll also 
discuss how broader improvements to the tax code, such as 
providing better cost recovery for residential structures, 
would be an effective way to grow the supply of affordable 
housing.
    We should consider three big picture points when evaluating 
the effectiveness of LIHTC as a tool to help working families 
and low-income households. First, while LIHTC has helped expand 
housing affordability, the credit's administration could be 
improved. More detailed information could be provided on the 
credit's effectiveness, as recommended in a 2018 report by the 
Government Accountability Office.
    Notably, GAO recommends that policymakers designate an 
agency to collect data to better understand project development 
costs. Such data would help inform future reform efforts, 
ensuring agencies impose limits on costs, root out fraud, and 
reform often opaque and discretionary credit allocation 
processes.
    The data we have so far, for example, shows that 
developments supported by the credit can suffer from higher 
than average constructions cost. A 2017 GAO study, for example, 
found that only 30 percent of allocating agencies at the State 
level put limits on development costs. That potentially 
undercuts the credit's efficiency.
    While the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
provides valuable project-level data, additional data such as 
information on fees paid to developers and syndicators, as well 
as outcomes for properties and tenants over time, will be 
valuable for assessing LIHTC.
    Second, it's important to evaluate LIHTC's broader policy 
effectiveness before considering options to expand LIHTC. One 
area of concern is how much of LIHTC's benefit goes to low-
income households. Several studies have found that between one-
third and three-quarters of the subsidy provided by LIHTC does 
go to low-income households, while the rest accumulates to 
other stakeholders in the process, such as developers and 
investors.
    Similarly, LIHTC projects can tend to be located in higher-
poverty neighborhoods, which deprives tenants of the benefit of 
living in places with more opportunity and more amenities.
    Finally, many of LIHTC's administrative challenges are 
rooted in using the tax code to tackle important social 
problems that may be outside the proper scope of the tax 
system. The array of programs that we have supporting housing--
ranging from Federal grants, tax credits for historic 
rehabilitation, and tenant-facing assistance--all overlap with 
LIHTC, both in their policy goals and benefiting stakeholders.
    That overlap can make it harder to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the credit compared to alternatives such as 
housing vouchers, an option considered by CBO and many others 
going back decades. In addition to LIHTC, a supplementary 
approach to expanding the supply of affordable housing is to 
reduce the tax burden of investment in housing.
    One way to reduce that tax burden is increasing or 
improving the cost recovery of structures in the Federal tax 
code. Currently, investors in residential structures must 
depreciate those structures over periods of up to 27\1/2\ 
years, which limits the economic value of depreciation 
allowances.
    Ideally, all investments should be fully and immediately 
deducted from taxable income, but this can pose a challenge for 
structures that create a net operating loss, given the large 
size of that investment. One solution is to provide neutral 
cost recovery, which adjusts depreciation deductions to 
maintain their value in real terms. This would improve the 
economic incentive to invest in structures, expand the housing 
supply, while also avoiding the challenges posed by fully 
expensing those types of investments.
    According to the Tax Foundation's estimates, providing 
neutral cost recovery to residential structures could lead to 
the construction of up to 2.3 million additional housing units 
in the long run, lower construction costs by about 11 percent, 
and raise long-run economic output by 1.2 percent.
    Pairing better cost recovery with efforts to improve land 
use and zoning rules at the State and local levels, as has been 
already mentioned today, would magnify the positive effects of 
both LIHTC and neutral cost recovery. Reforming LIHTC and 
providing neutral cost recovery for residential structures are 
just two important steps that policymakers can take to ensure 
the Federal tax code is not a barrier to solving America's 
affordable housing challenge.
    Thank you, and I look forward to answering any questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Watson appears in the 
index.]
    The Chairman. All right. Thank you all. You all have been 
very helpful.
    Let me begin, if I might, and I'm going to ask this of you, 
Ms. Geno, because I was struck--Dr. Calabria says we're passing 
through a cycle. Basically, ``All you Congress folks shouldn't 
get too worked up, because we're passing through a cycle.''
    Now, I've had the honor to represent Oregon for a while in 
the U.S. Congress. I have never in my time in public service 
seen school districts having to buy houses to rent to their 
employees because the housing crunch is so serious. So I think 
it is kind of disconnected from the facts to say that we're 
passing out of a cycle. And I want to follow up on a point I 
heard you make, because your views--and particularly 
representing such a major business association--are very 
valuable.
    I gather you think that the number of firefighters and 
middle-income people who are--I guess the technical housing 
jargon for it is ``cost-burdened''--is increasing, and is not 
increasing by a modest amount. It's increasing in a significant 
way. So, can you sort this out, because what you said surely 
doesn't seem to me like we're passing through a cycle. I think 
your comments reflect what I'm hearing in town hall meetings, 
what my colleagues are hearing, which is that middle-income 
people--and I just hate the idea of a policy debate that would 
pit the needs of middle-income people against the needs of low-
income people. My goodness, that's the last thing we need in 
America. We've got to get shelter to people who need it. So 
tell us your assessment of how serious the situation is for the 
missing middle; let's refer to it that way.
    Ms. Geno. Sure. I appreciate your question. And I agree, in 
part, with my colleague Dr. Calabria's assessment: there are 
parts of the real estate segment that are passing through a 
cycle, mostly on the higher end of the income scale. We are 
seeing a supply of housing that had been delayed due to COVID 
that will be coming on the market in 2023.
    We're already seeing rents start to come down in that 
segment as it's pushing down the line. But to your point, 
Senator, there is simply not enough at the low- and middle-
income levels. We are not building for those components, other 
than housing that is being supported by the Low-Income Housing 
Tax Credit. And what happens often in this case--and I've 
operated this housing before--is that as families start to have 
the opportunity to save a little bit because they've been 
supported through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit or some 
other subsidy and they're moving up the economic scale, they 
get priced out of those markets.
    That happens to families that are taking advantage of job 
opportunities. It happens sometimes to veterans whose benefits 
just exceed a qualifying income level. It happens sometimes to 
seniors who have a small pension from a prior job opportunity, 
but their pension has not kept pace with the cost of housing. 
So, for those kinds of groups, there really is no support, and 
the Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit would truly provide an 
opportunity to create housing for those groups of people.
    The Chairman. So your judgment, again, is this question of 
being cost-burdened is basically you can't afford to start 
becoming part of the American dream. I mean the American dream 
has always been to work hard and play by the rules and get that 
first home and get started. And unless I'm missing something, 
your testimony indicates that that problem is getting more 
serious. It is more serious today than it was before.
    And yes, I'm sure that some people can still get housing, 
but I appreciate your making the case for the missing middle 
because, based on what I hear at home, so many people who work 
hard want to have a chance. That's one of the reasons we give 
the tax break for your first home. They want to make a 
difference.
    One question, if I might, very quickly for you, Mr. Walker. 
The DASH Act closes some pretty serious loopholes. We closed 
the Qualified Contract and right of first refusal loopholes in 
order to protect low-income housing long-term. How important is 
that?
    Mr. Walker. Well, I'll start by saying ``very important,'' 
and I appreciate you putting a bright light on it. The right of 
first refusal, both of these are long-existing parts of the 
statute that was created in the mid- to late 80s, and what we 
have seen is, we've seen some bad behavior--some ambiguities in 
both the statute and some imprecise language in the partnership 
agreements.
    The right of first refusal, which was anticipated when 
there was a nonprofit partner alongside the investor owning and 
operating these properties--at year 15, the investor would 
quietly exit under a formula. And the behavior that we are 
seeing is that either that investor--or actually an investor 
that has stepped in the shoes of that investor--getting close 
to that 15th year, is starting to really jam the exit strategy 
and trying to extract quite a bit of capital out of the deal. 
And the effect of that is either litigation--which is very 
expensive and jeopardizes both the nonprofit operator and the 
property itself--or simply having to acquiesce to those 
demands, which again jeopardizes the property and ultimately 
puts at risk the residents for whom the property is intended to 
be----
    The Chairman. My time is up, but obviously we're also 
concerned about it in the context of the trend of private 
equity firms acquiring housing and taking advantage of these 
loopholes, so I appreciate your response.
    Senator Crapo?
    Senator Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And, Dr. Calabria, industry's decision to invest in new 
housing is the culmination of many factors we've discussed 
today: input costs, impact on the return of investment, along 
with rent and sales prices. Regulations, taxes, and financing 
are all components of the calculation.
    Dr. Calabria, how does the overall state of the economy 
impact the decision to invest, and how can Congress support 
housing affordability without contributing to inflationary 
pressures?
    Dr. Calabria. Thank you, Senator Crapo. That's a terrific 
question, and let me emphasize, to clarify something Senator 
Wyden raised. Just because you may be in a cycle doesn't mean 
you don't do anything. It just means you may do something 
different. When we tend to see changes in the cycle, we tend to 
see shifts where income burdens--people lose their jobs, people 
suffer income losses, and so you may have a different style of 
support in a weaker economy than you would have in a booming 
economy.
    But I do think we need to be concerned about--go back to 
Econ 101. Since the number one constraint structurally in the 
housing market is a lack of supply, we need to be cautious 
about adding demand subsidies that simply run up prices, which 
is how we've gotten the inflationary pressures we face today. 
So we need to be cautious about how we think about this in an 
economic sense so that we're actually achieving our objectives.
    Senator Crapo. Well, thank you very much.
    And, Mr. Watson, as mentioned in your testimony, LIHTC is 
an important tax tool to encourage investment in affordable 
housing. However, as you noted, there are ways to improve this 
credit and its administration and oversight. Could you just 
give us a review of the specific recommendations you have to 
improve the credit's efficiency that Congress should consider 
in future LIHTC legislation?
    Mr. Watson. Thank you, Senator, for that question. I think 
one major theme when looking at credit effectiveness is, we 
really need to have a clear understanding of the baseline--from 
the data--of how the credit is doing and how it's actually 
connecting the credit with outcomes for low-income tenants and 
for folks who own those developments. And so, I think we have a 
good base with what HUD is already collecting. There's a lot of 
great information there that has been leveraged in research and 
elsewhere, but we can really build on that, I think, by 
providing more granular data to be able to answer some of these 
questions about how the credit is doing and building on either 
reform efforts considered now or reforms in the future to 
ensure that we're maximizing the amount of benefit that's 
actually going to those tenants, rather than all the folks who 
are in that process who are necessary, but could be doing a 
better job of passing through more efficiently.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
    And, Ms. Geno, do you believe that addressing affordable 
housing supply requires pro-growth tax policies more generally, 
in addition to housing-specific initiatives? And if so, can you 
discuss some of the recent proposals before Congress in the tax 
arena that could actually negatively impact the supply of 
affordable housing?
    Ms. Geno. Sure. So absolutely, the private market simply 
cannot afford to provide housing in the amounts that we need it 
in the lowest-income tiers and also in the middle-income tiers. 
So those tax incentives are incredibly useful. I was looking at 
some recent data from HUD that $8 billion annually is generated 
from the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit in budget authority. 
That is critically important to offsetting what the true cost 
of developing that housing is and making it affordable for 
folks who need it.
    Senator Crapo. And so, are there tax policies that you've 
seen proposed here in Congress that could actually undercut 
that?
    Ms. Geno. Well certainly, anything that's going to adjust 
the tax rates will make a difference in the use of the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit. We saw a little bit of that happen 
when the corporate tax rate was adjusted downward. Now the 
market has adjusted for that, but we're not seeing the full 
value of what the tax credit could be and could generate now as 
we had previously before the corporate tax rate dropped. So 
that is one issue that does impact the Low-Income Housing Tax 
Credit.
    Senator Crapo. All right. Thank you.
    And finally, Mr. Walker, aside from the increases to LIHTC, 
are there any reforms to the program that would be helpful to 
you and fellow State housing authorities in administering the 
credit?
    Mr. Walker. Thank you for that question. I think stepping 
back and looking for opportunities to improve a 40-year-old 
program is always important to do, and Congress has done that a 
few times over the years. I think there's legislation speaking 
to the student rule to recognize that folks living in credit 
housing often need to go back to school or retool their skills. 
And so, both HUD and the credit have two different definitions 
of the student rule.
    I think there's been testimony today about bringing things 
into alignment, but opening up that is an example of how we can 
improve the program. So I think there are always opportunities 
to look at doing that. Right now, because it's such a proven 
tool, I think the opportunity on the table is to make it the 
power tool that it needs to be.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you. I see my time is up.
    The Chairman. Tools and power tools. Okay. Thank you.
    Senator Stabenow?
    Senator Stabenow. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking 
Member. Such an important topic.
    I was not long ago up in Traverse City, MI meeting with 15 
different chambers of commerce all across northern Michigan. 
The number one priority was housing, and for so many reasons. I 
mean, we can see this, whether it's in Detroit or northern 
Michigan or any part of our State certainly.
    I do have a question, Ms. Geno, that relates to where we're 
going after the pandemic as it relates to remote work because, 
on top of everything else, we are seeing certainly different 
ways in which people want to work, which creates challenges, 
underutilized office buildings, but also opportunities to 
convert some of those buildings to residential, as you know, 
and create more housing.
    And so, to capitalize on this, I appreciate your mentioning 
our bill, the Revitalizing Downtowns Act, which would create a 
tax credit to help convert commercial buildings into affordable 
housing and mixed-use properties. So I know that your Housing 
Council recently released an in-depth report on the feasibility 
of converting commercial real estate to multifamily and that 
you detail many of the challenges of that. So I wonder if you 
might describe some of the biggest obstacles to doing that and 
also speak to how tax policy could address some of these 
obstacles and how we can capitalize on the opportunity to 
create more affordable housing through this process?
    Ms. Geno. Sure. Thank you for that question. The National 
Multifamily Housing Council in partnership with the Urban Land 
Institute, as you mentioned, recently issued a study. It's 
really a case study report on different ways that developers 
have been able to convert office properties to multifamily 
residential.
    There is opportunity to do that. The challenges include, in 
some cases zoning, in some cases just the way the buildings are 
constructed. A lot of office buildings are not constructed for 
residential use. Therefore, the cost of doing those 
conversions, which could be critically important to the 
revitalization of communities downtowns, may be cost-
prohibitive.
    That's why the tax incentive is very important. This is not 
just about creating housing, which is a really important 
component, but it's also about revitalizing communities that 
are going to need that economic support. Our organization and 
NAA look forward to working with you and your staff. We think 
there are some opportunities to even expand and grow that, 
ensuring that REITs can use those tax incentives, and ensuring 
that shopping malls and other retail uses can be converted. We 
look forward to working with you.
    Senator Stabenow. Well, thank you so much. And we really 
are at a point where we need to be leaning in on all of these 
changes and creating opportunities, whether it's big cities or 
small towns, and we really need to be doing that. I look 
forward, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, to working on this 
particular policy of how we do this kind of conversion.
    And then quickly to Ms. Scott, I think it's so important 
we're talking about the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and the 
fact that it has produced over 4 million affordable housing 
units and housed 8 million low-income families. I wonder if you 
might talk a little bit more about the connection, not only of 
housing, but the connection between housing and jobs and what 
access to affordable housing means to families and their 
ability to find and maintain a job?
    Ms. Scott. Thank you, Senator, for that question. I think 
this is a very important issue, and I would approach it from 
two angles. First of all, that stable housing provides for 
families the opportunity to achieve tenure in jobs that they 
have. Many employers are telling us that they're having 
difficulty maintaining a workforce that's housed unstably, that 
people have to move around frequently and so they're unable to 
move up in the jobs that they have.
    Another side of the jobs issue is that the housing 
production actually creates jobs, both short-term and long-term 
jobs. And the numbers are something we could give you, share 
with you, but it's substantial in terms of the volume of 
activities that housing production produces. So it's both the 
individual family that benefits, but it's also the broad 
economy that is benefiting from the production of housing.
    Senator Stabenow. Okay.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Stabenow.
    Senator Grassley is next.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I'm going to start out with Ms. Geno. At my request, the 
Government Accountability Office issued two reports on the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit. Their reports found there is a 
minimum of Federal oversight of the program and lack of quality 
data. As a result, it was difficult to evaluate efficiency and 
effectiveness of the program.
    To address this, the Government Accountability Office 
recommended designating HUD to assist IRS in oversight of the 
program and to collect project cost data. Would you support HUD 
being designated as a joint administrator to the program, and 
if not, what would you recommend to be done to increase Federal 
oversight and ensure data collection necessary to evaluate the 
program?
    Ms. Geno. Well, thank you for that question. I believe a 
lot of data is actually already collected, but it's collected, 
to your point, at the State level with the State housing 
finance agencies. There isn't a centralized funnel on all of it 
for the Federal Government to take a look at it. I would 
suggest continuing to work with those State agencies in 
partnership with them to be sure that those data points are 
collected at the Federal level, through the Internal Revenue 
Service and/or through HUD. The data that HUD has collected, I 
think, has been effective. The National Council of State 
Housing Finance Agencies also has a series of best practices 
for State housing finance agencies to report data, and 
following those, I think, would also be an effective tool.
    Senator Grassley. Okay.
    Dr. Calabria, you expressed concern that this tax credit is 
too focused on large, multiunit structures in urban areas. In 
my home State of Iowa, we have many small towns and rural 
communities that are sorely in need of housing. In fact, I 
don't know how many times I hear this when I'm going around in 
my county meetings, particularly from employers that are 
looking for more employees, and housing is an impediment. How 
could the tax credit be improved to better serve the needs of 
suburban and rural communities?
    Dr. Calabria. Great question, Senator. As I mentioned, 
about half of renters live in properties with under five units, 
so again, the average tax credit is for about 40 units. So one 
option would, of course, be a set-aside for a certain number of 
units. You could require that a third of tax credit dollar 
volume goes to either units under 20 or 10. I mean, this is 
certainly something where you can look at where the touch point 
is, but I think ultimately--and again, I don't want to dismiss 
the efforts that housing finance agencies are taking, but I 
think, at this point, having a set-aside for smaller properties 
is appropriate.
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Watson, one recommendation you made 
to increase available housing at lower costs was to shorten the 
cost recovery period for residential structures. Specifically, 
you expressed support for providing neutral cost recovery. Can 
you elaborate on what you mean and how it would work?
    Mr. Watson. Thank you, Senator, for the question. So, under 
neutral cost recovery--it effectively is emulating providing 
the full value of the depreciation deduction for those types of 
investments. Because right now, when you make that investment 
and you have this deduction against your income because you 
have that big expense, you could take that over 27 years. And 
both because of inflation and because the value of a dollar is 
higher now than it would be in the future, the real value of 
those deductions is eroded.
    Of course, we saw this through other types of investments 
by just allowing folks to immediately expense those 
investments, as was done with the bonus depreciation measures 
adopted in 2017. That's really hard to do with structures, 
given how large they are. And there's concern about--for 
example, we tried this in the early 80s, and there were some 
distortions in the market.
    Neutral cost recovery is a way to get around that by just 
allowing for an adjustment to preserve the real value of those 
deductions without needing to expense them. And that would of 
course increase the incentive to invest and preserve the value 
of those deductions over time.
    Senator Grassley. Dr. Calabria, although there are housing 
shortages across the country, it's clear that some States and 
localities are doing worse than others. Governments and States 
like Iowa have encouraged development in the construction 
sector. One town like Pella, IA has even gained national 
recognition for private efforts to increase housing 
availability. However, other areas have gone the other 
direction and increased barriers to building or renovating 
homes.
    Federal programs do have an impact, but it is ultimately 
these local decisions that have the greatest effect. What 
should State and local governments do to ensure that our 
Federal housing programs work as intended and bring down the 
cost of housing?
    Dr. Calabria. That's a great question, Senator, and I think 
we should commend those States that are making progress. I 
think just this week Washington State, for instance, made a 
change--or at least the Senate made a change--to its 
environmental approval process for housing. Obviously, 
Minnesota has made a number of changes. There have been great 
examples of where States have been leaders, and I think many 
other States should follow those examples.
    Senator Grassley. Okay.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Okay. Thank you, Senator Grassley.
    Senator Johnson would be next.
    Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Full disclosure: I'm not a real fan of using the tax code 
to socially and economically engineer. I think we oftentimes do 
far more harm than good, and I want to lay out an example. In 
Milwaukee--for Mr. Watson, because you kind of touched on 
this--there was a great program, this was a number of years 
ago, called the ACTS, ACTS, Housing program.
    There was an opportunity, because there were all these 
homes built in the 20s, 30s, wonderful construction, but they 
were in foreclosure. And so this program could buy these homes, 
literally for a few thousand dollars. Then, working with the 
banks making low-interest loans available to low-income 
individuals, literally, for 30, 40 thousand bucks, they could 
renovate a home, put a lot of sweat equity in--and it worked 
great.
    I mean, they were cutting their rental payments by hundreds 
of dollars a month. It was a great program working. When I 
visited them a couple years ago, they were complaining that 
these tax credits, Federal tax credits going in the pockets of 
developers, were causing developers to dramatically increase 
the cost of that housing. And that was going to mean more 
gentrified neighborhoods, and all of a sudden, they couldn't 
buy these homes. It was really hampering a really successful 
program. That's just one example.
    But I want to focus my questions on, I think a statement 
that Ms. Geno made about how we simply can't--the market simply 
can't supply low-cost housing. Why? Again, I see the cost. 
You've got land. You've got labor. You've got construction. 
Let's go through that. I mean, for example, in Wisconsin the 
average cost for a family home is somewhere around 250,000 
bucks.
    With the trade wars, the cost of lumber was a year or so 
ago--$35,000 was the increase per new home construction. The 
lack of workers--so again, Mr. Calabria, can you just talk 
about those factors? What is government potentially doing that 
is making it impossible for the marketplace, which should not 
be impossible?
    Dr. Calabria. I very much share your frustration, Senator. 
Let's set aside the number of households that would have zero 
or near zero income, who can't afford anything--and we'll come 
back to them--but the reason the market is not filling the 
needs of affordable housing is because we aren't letting it. 
And we need to remove those barriers, predominately at the 
State and local level, some at the Federal level.
    And then for those households that could not afford it 
because their income is zero or near zero, we could----
    Senator Johnson. Let's zero in on those barriers. I mean, 
how much do we drive up construction costs by all of the 
environmental regulations we've put on products, driving up the 
cost of a washing machine or a range or whatever? Again, the 
trade wars and driving up the price of lumber--can you 
specifically talk about how government drives up the cost of 
every component of construction?
    Dr. Calabria. So, a recent National Association of 
Homebuilders study, I think done in association with Sharon's 
organization, found that the cost of regulation was about 40 
percent of the cost of development of multifamily housing. 
Personally, I think that's probably an underestimate in terms 
of taking zoning into account. But we can see----
    Senator Johnson. Put that in dollar terms: 40 percent. So, 
if a standard multi is a million bucks, I mean that's $400,000 
added cost that wouldn't have to be there. Now some of those 
regulations may be necessary; you know, maybe the cost of some. 
I'm not sure all.
    Dr. Calabria. I think a good way of looking at this is, we 
can see very similar units in places like Texas that are built 
for $200,000 that in places like California may even approach 
$1 million, as you've mentioned. So there are places where 
we've shown that you can build houses, and you can build them 
affordably. You can be accessible. We know how to do this.
    Senator Johnson. So again, just for ease of calculation, 
let's say a million-dollar piece of property, if the cost of 
regulation is $40,000, what is the benefit of a tax credit, Mr. 
Watson?
    Mr. Watson. So, clearly the low-income tax credit and these 
other credits are just offsetting some of these regulatory 
costs.
    Senator Johnson. That's the point I'm trying to make here. 
We're a dog chasing its tail.
    Mr. Watson. Exactly.
    Senator Johnson. We're causing the problem, driving up the 
cost by 40 percent, and then we're offering what percent relief 
from that burden? That's the question I'm asking. Can you put a 
percentage to it?
    Mr. Watson. I'm not sure there's a strict percentage. I 
think you mentioned this is not only that there are the 
regulatory and these other costs, material costs, but we really 
should be talking policies that magnify that. I think you 
mentioned the trade war being one, and others that are just 
going to erode the value of the credit. And I think the zoning 
issue is really important too because--and Dr. Calabria said 
this--the supply is constrained. That may actually magnify the 
amount of the benefit that's just going to the developers and 
not to the low-income housing.
    Senator Johnson. So it's extremely important to put numbers 
to this so we can understand the root cause so, again, we're 
not chasing our tails. And again, the root cause is regulation 
increasing this, trade wars, a worker shortage. We need to 
focus on all that. And by the way, a simpler and more rational 
tax code would also reduce costs for people as well. So, rather 
than make it more complex--add another barnacle under the ship 
of the state, slow it down even further--we ought to talk about 
scraping the barnacles off.
    Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Johnson.
    Senator Carper is next.
    Senator Carper. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Welcome, one and all. 
Welcome to Delaware. It's an outpost here. [Laughter.] Thank 
you for joining us. Thank you for your interest in housing 
people in this country.
    I'm a recovering Governor, and some of my colleagues are 
also recovering Governors. And I know when I was Governor, we 
created something called the Family Services Cabinet Council 
with about seven different departments of State government that 
focused on helping families, strengthening families, and one of 
those was our State housing authority.
    We focused for 8 years on trying to make home ownership a 
priority and a possibility for all kinds of people. I think 
when I stepped down as Governor, in terms of the level of home 
ownership, I think we might have been number one, and I'm very, 
very proud of that.
    There's a great scripture in the Bible. I think it's in 
Matthew: ``When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was 
naked, did you clothe me? When I was thirsty, did you give me 
to drink? When I was a stranger in your land, did you welcome 
me?'' It doesn't say anything about ``when I didn't have a 
house to live in or I was living in somebody's apartment or I 
was living under a bridge or in a car,'' but I think the 
inference is the same: did we do anything about it?
    And it's not just on the Federal Government. It's not just 
our responsibility. It's not just on the State Governments or 
county or local governments. It's not just the nonprofits. It's 
not the church community. It's really all of us. This is a team 
sport and a shared responsibility, and part of that 
responsibility is ours. And everything I do, everything we do, 
I know we could do better.
    The Constitution of our country, which Delaware was the 
first State to ratify, starts off with a preamble that says, 
``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more 
perfect union''; that's what it says. ``We the people of the 
United States, in order to form a more perfect union,'' and our 
founding fathers knew everything they did, we could do better, 
and we know the same is true today. So hopefully, this hearing 
today--and I commend the chairman and ranking member for 
putting this together.
    This is a topic for me and a whole lot of folks that I 
represent--and others my colleagues do. I think in Delaware 
we've made a fair amount of progress in recent years, including 
investing some $78 million from the American Rescue Plan in 
affordable housing. While these investments are a big step 
forward, I continue to hear from communities in Delaware--and 
actually outside Delaware--that need us to do a bit more. And 
I'm encouraged that there's bipartisan support on this 
committee, as there are on many issues, to tackle this 
challenge.
    We ought to figure out what works and do more of that. When 
I was Governor, I was chair of the National Governors 
Association. We had an entity within the NGA called Center for 
Best Practices. We used to share ideas with one another, steal 
ideas from other States that worked. Fortunately, we have a 
number of proven tools to address those challenges, including 
tax incentives, including grants, and other financing options. 
And these tools often complement each other, working hand in 
glove to support new housing construction.
    I have a question for--and I hope I don't screw up your 
name, Ms. Geno. Has your name ever been mispronounced?
    Ms. Geno. Just once or twice.
    Senator Carper. Okay. How about today? Hopefully not.
    You, Ms. Geno, and also Ms. Scott: what are some of the 
existing gaps in financing the development of affordable 
housing, and what types of Federal investments will give us the 
best, if you will, bang for our bucks to address this 
challenge? Ms. Scott, do you want to go first?
    Ms. Scott. Sure. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Carper. Where are you from, Ms. Scott?
    Ms. Scott. New York.
    Senator Carper. Welcome.
    Ms. Scott. Thank you. Not far from you.
    Senator Carper. Good. That's true.
    Ms. Scott. In terms of the gaps, I think the biggest gap--
we've talked about it--is our inability to achieve 
affordability across a broader spectrum of people, and that the 
range of families that are experiencing unaffordability is 
growing. And so, all of the housing programs--the tax programs 
and the other housing programs--that exist that provide for 
subsidies, for tax credits, and all of that are necessary. But 
in addition to everything, we also have the growing concern 
today about the rising cost of construction, the cost of labor; 
you've heard the list of things. And so I think what we need to 
do is to find ways to really increase the value of the credit 
and make sure that we can really reach more households. I think 
the best programs, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, CDGB and 
HOME, and a host of other programs like that are providing the 
kind of resources we need. It's just that the scale of the 
problem is significant, and so we end up with the gaps that 
we're talking about in our ability to achieve the greater 
outcomes that we're looking for.
    Senator Carper. Okay. Thank you.
    Ms. Geno, please; same question.
    Ms. Geno. Again, I agree with Ms. Scott's response. I've 
been at this for 30 years, and I wish we'd found the magic 
bullet already, but we haven't.
    Senator Carper. Would that be since birth? [Laughter.]
    Ms. Geno. Hardly. But we need every tool in the toolbox and 
more of them. And given your experience as Governor, I'm sure 
you know that all markets are different. Even within the 
smaller State of Delaware, a number of the housing markets are 
different. So, the ability to have different tools--both 
subsidy tools as well as tax tools as well as, to Dr. 
Calabria's point, the ability to be flexible about local and 
State regulation--is critical. All those things need to be 
available, and we need to piece them together in different 
communities to make them work for people who need housing.
    Senator Carper. Good.
    Mr. Chairman, my time is up. Can I have 15 seconds to just 
say one other thing? One of the things we did in Delaware when 
I was the Governor is, our State housing authority said for 
folks who were on welfare and went to work and started making 
money, that they did not have to pay taxes on the beginning of 
their earnings. That went into a separate fund. They could use 
that money for down payments on either an apartment to move 
into or a house to buy. So that's just one of the many ideas 
that I think are worth pursuing.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Carper, for your help 
today with very good proposals.
    Senator Cardin?
    Senator Cardin. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I just 
really want to underscore the point that we do not have enough 
stock of affordable housing. Supply and demand issues--it's 
just not affordable. So, I first want to thank you, and I want 
to thank Senator Young and Senator Cantwell on the Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credit. It's an extremely important tool. It's the 
strongest tool we have to date, but in and of itself, it's not 
enough. So it's usually combined with Historic Tax Credits or 
some other stakeholders' investments in order to move forward 
with an affordable housing plan in our communities.
    So I know in Maryland, we've been able to use the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credits, the Historic Tax Credits. We've had 
philanthropic help, the nonprofit community, all combined in 
order to deal with affordable housing in our communities. But 
one of the things we could do is try to preserve communities so 
that we can maintain affordable housing that's commensurate 
with the income of the people who live in that community, and 
that's been a challenge.
    That's why I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank Senator Young 
in regard to the introduction of the Neighborhood Homes 
Improvement Act, because it is aimed at those areas where we 
have strong neighborhoods, we have the incomes of that 
neighborhood, of the people who live there, are not adequate in 
order to renovate or to construct or to buy homes in that 
community. So the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act is aimed at 
dealing with that.
    So, Ms. Scott, if I might, I'm going to start with you. 
Tell me how you think such an appraisal gap credit can help in 
regard to maintaining the strength of communities and dealing 
with the wealth gap that we have here in America.
    Ms. Scott. Thank you. Thank you, Senator, and thank you for 
your sponsorship of Neighborhood Homes. The bottom line is 
that, in the communities that we're talking about, the cost to 
build far exceeds the value in the market, and so there's just 
no way to get at building these homes without addressing the 
gap. And so the credit enables us to do that.
    This credit will enable us to probably build, reconstruct, 
and rehab about 500,000 homes over the next decade. That's a 
big deal in these communities where lower-income families will 
benefit--both urban and rural communities. And many of these 
neighborhoods are already suffering from the blight of vacancy 
and dilapidated homes, so it will go a long way to improve 
conditions in the neighborhood.
    We estimate about $125 billion of total development 
activity. That's going to help in terms of local economy, $26 
billion in Federal tax revenue, and another $12 billion in 
State and local government revenue. So this credit is going to 
spur the market and then generate tax revenue across the layers 
of government.
    Senator Cardin. I thank you for that.
    I want to talk a little bit about the wealth gap, because 
home ownership is one of the areas that we deal with in trying 
to reduce the wealth gap in this country. Tell us how home 
ownership can help us deal with the wealth gap by preserving 
communities?
    Ms. Scott. Right. Well, as we know, housing is the primary 
source of wealth building for generations. And for many of the 
families who cannot afford a home, they don't have any other 
opportunity, unless you own a business, in order to generate 
wealth. So enabling first-time home buyers, first-generation 
home buyers, many of whom are in Black and Latino communities--
the tax credit is really aimed at the census tracts that in 
many cases are majority minority communities, and so it will 
also attract, we believe, families from those census tracts who 
would benefit from this credit and be able to buy a home.
    Senator Cardin. I want to move to a second subject which 
deals with the urgency of action by Congress. And I appreciate 
so many of my colleagues who have legislation here. I can tell 
you, the waiting lists in Maryland are long for affordable 
housing. The options are not really bright today. So, anyone on 
the panel, talk about the urgency of us dealing with these 
issues. We missed an opportunity in the last Congress. How 
urgent is it for Congress to strengthen the tools?
    Ms. Geno. I'm happy to take that on, Senator. Again, coming 
out of COVID, we really put a spotlight on the importance of 
housing, for health and for all sorts of other outcomes. People 
are still struggling now, and it takes a long time to put these 
deals together. I worked on them for many years as a lawyer 
myself. You have to start today in order to get housing built.
    Frankly, if you enacted this bill today, it would take 3, 
4, 5 years to truly see the housing on the ground to serve 
residents. We know we're already falling behind, so if we don't 
act very quickly to bring more resources to the table, we're 
going to fall even further behind in the future. And the 
population of our Nation is still growing. We are 
anticipating--we're at 330 million Americans today. We're going 
to be at 400 million Americans by the middle of this century. 
They all need to live somewhere, so we really need to start 
this now.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Tillis is next.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to 
the witnesses for being here. I hope you're not as cold as I 
am, but I suspect a couple of you are. Mark, it's good to see 
you. I thank you for the work you did at FHFA, and I appreciate 
you being here today.
    I had the opportunity to really start getting my 
understanding of what you need to do to build affordable 
housing back in my time in the Statehouse, and we made some 
progress. The progress we made there was always balanced 
between tax incentives, but also a very healthy focus on 
impediments to affordable housing. First among them are 
regulations.
    I remember vividly a town in my legislative district. I 
spent 45 minutes of an hour-long meeting talking about 
affordable housing and then they shifted to agenda item 2, and 
it was to authorize their local government to mandate sprinkler 
systems in all single-family dwellings. I said, ``Guys, we just 
spent 45 minutes talking about affordable housing and you've 
just proposed something that would increase the cost of an 
affordable home by 10 to 15 percent. How does that work?'' So 
that didn't happen.
    But when we're talking about--and I think the chairman and 
this committee had a lot of opportunities for proposals in the 
last Congress to come together and really make headway here. 
But I, for one, think if we want a good, strong bipartisan, 
bicameral outcome, we have to get to the point of recognizing 
that there are regulations that are either outdated or need to 
be modernized. To what extent--Mr. Watson, I want you to opine 
on this. Anyone can. To what extent do we think, Dr. Calabria, 
we need to have that balanced approach for anything we do here? 
If we do tax incentives, are we really doing something that's 
going to provide a sustainable, long-term opportunity for 
people in the affordable housing space?
    Mr. Watson. Yes. I was just going to add that part of this 
is, yes, there is a major risk that you're effectively pushing 
on a string if you only rely on tax credits because, similar to 
what was mentioned earlier, if you have regulations, if you 
have zoning restrictions, if you have other barriers, there's a 
higher risk that a lot of those credits will be----
    Senator Tillis. I'll give you another example. I want you 
all to continue to answer. I want to keep in my time. But I'll 
give you another example. The more recent promulgation of WOTUS 
is far better than where it started, but I talked to bipartisan 
groups and county commissioners most recently over the last 
month who say that it's going to be a real problem for 
development. And if you think about the development of certain 
properties, it may even be disproportionately so for ones that 
would make projects work.
    So, I think I hear agreement here. If we want something 
where we're not coming back every Congress and having the same 
discussion, we need to come up with a more rational, 
sustainable framework, and I think then that requires a look at 
regulations. Not to get rid of them. You want them to be safe. 
You want them to be environmentally sound, but I think there's 
a lot of work we can do there.
    One question, and, Dr. Calabria, do you have something to 
add?
    Dr. Calabria. I was going to say part of the process is 
just getting certainty. I mean, the worst example of this may 
be the environmental review process in California, where you 
can be fully entitled to the land. You can be zoned. You can 
set up all of these things and then you have year after year of 
it being litigated. And so again, we can debate what the right 
zoning should be for a certain area. We can debate how to 
protect the environment, but I think what developers need most 
is knowing there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
    Senator Tillis. Right. And I, for one, think that Federal 
funding and Federal support should go to the jurisdictions that 
have proven responsibility on regulatory execution. We're not 
going to have enough money to address it nationally. So, if 
certain States and local jurisdictions want to overregulate and 
make the barriers to affordable housing high, then until we 
have all the money that we need for everybody who requests it, 
we should put a priority on jurisdictions that are getting it 
right, managing all the right outcomes for safety, health, but 
getting it right. And I already see with the CHIPS Act--I voted 
for the CHIPS Act, $52 billion.
    Now, we've got guidance put out by the Department of Labor 
that's going to discount that $52 billion by a double-digit 
percentage because of structural costs. Those are the things we 
need to avoid when we get to a bipartisan outcome, and I think 
we will.
    Mr. Watson, if you could, just tell me a little bit about 
LIHTC and how we can do a better job of balancing urban and 
rural areas. I'm a 50/50 State. I've got the problems of big 
cities and the problems of rural areas. What do we need to do 
there? Thank you.
    Mr. Watson. Yes, I would echo a lot of what Dr. Calabria 
had said earlier about how we need to create incentives for 
providing LIHTC for smaller unit sizes. There should be more 
accommodating to rural areas. I think that would be helpful.
    Going back to the data side of things, I think if we get 
more information from HUD--or if they come in and be more of an 
active participant in some of these things--that would also 
help us understand where those disparities may lie across 
different localities. I think it was a really great suggestion 
made earlier to try to bring in State FHAs and others who may 
have that data and information so that we can come to some 
conclusions about what the right policy recommendations are to 
help rural areas.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. Senator Tillis, before you go, I'm very 
interested in your ideas for cleaning out needless red tape and 
just bureaucratic water torture to me. I mean, it just goes on 
and on. The challenge, of course, is nobody wants Federal 
zoning. In other words, nobody wants to say, ``Hey, let's write 
a whole bunch of rules for America here.''
    Senator Tillis. Nor do I.
    The Chairman. Nobody wants to go there, so I look forward 
to your ideas and suggestions. Thank you.
    Okay; Senator Hassan is next.
    Senator Hassan. Well, thank you, Mr. Chair. And to you and 
Ranking Member Crapo, thank you for holding this hearing. And 
thanks to all the witnesses for being here.
    Ms. Geno, I want to start with a question for you. In New 
Hampshire, I hear from families about the burden that rising 
housing costs have had on their ability to live and work in our 
State, and it also, obviously, hurts businesses. The story I'm 
hearing repeatedly right now is, ``We've made an offer to a 
really valuable recruit to come into the State and work for our 
business, and they not only can't afford a place to live, they 
can't find a place even if they could afford it.''
    So, part of the reason that we're seeing rising housing 
costs in New Hampshire and around the country is obviously a 
lack of supply, and that's why additional Federal support for 
programs to support housing construction, like the Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credit, is critical. Can you discuss how States can 
use programs like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to address 
the shortage of workforce housing?
    Ms. Geno. Sure. We talked earlier about the MIHTC proposal 
that Chairman Wyden has introduced. And that really is an 
important tool to capture that group that doesn't qualify for 
the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit and is trying to move up the economic 
scale, but whose wages are not keeping pace with the increased 
cost of housing.
    Again, housing isn't the only sector of our economy that is 
experiencing incredible cost increases. Particularly since 
COVID, food, energy, and other sectors are seeing rising prices 
as well. We've seen those more in real time because they're 
implemented pretty quickly when those costs increase.
    In the housing sector, however, it's much more of a lagging 
indicator, particularly on the rental side and, in part, 
because people sign 1-year leases. They get renewed at 
different times. So, those costs from COVID are really just 
hitting our sector right now, and we need as many tools in the 
toolbox as we can have to develop and increase supply in 
communities--suburban, urban, and rural.
    Senator Hassan. Well, thank you.
    And I want to turn to the issue of rural housing now. And, 
Ms. Scott, I have a question for you, and I know Senator 
Grassley and I just heard Senator Tillis talk a little bit 
about it too.
    Ms. Scott, in your testimony you note that investment in 
quality housing not only supports families, but also 
strengthens the economy and supports employment. I hear from 
constituents all across my State, including those in rural 
areas like our north country, that expanding housing options is 
necessary to expand economic opportunity. How can we leverage 
the tax code and expand existing Federal housing programs to 
help make housing more affordable for rural families?
    Ms. Scott. Thank you, Senator, for that question. For one, 
we can provide a basis boost for the projects in rural 
communities. This would go a long way to help deals pencil out 
that currently do not. We can align the income limit 
requirements. There's a difference between the income limit 
requirements to rural communities between the Housing Credit 
and Private Activity Bonds, and that difference leads also to a 
gap in terms of how we can finance.
    And then lastly, I would say that providing the basis boost 
for projects serving Native communities would also help in 
terms of--we should require States, I think, to provide a 
selection preference that allows more projects to serve Native 
communities. When you combine fixes like that, I think we begin 
to get to addressing some of the gaps in providing housing in 
both rural communities and Native communities and the like.
    Senator Hassan. That's very helpful. Thank you.
    An additional question for you, Ms. Scott. In addition to 
increasing the supply of housing, it's essential that we 
provide additional support for families working to achieve home 
ownership. That's why last Congress I introduced bipartisan 
legislation which was called the Middle-Class Mortgage 
Insurance Premium Act to provide tax cuts for middle-class home 
buyers who use mortgage insurance. Can you discuss how mortgage 
insurance can make home ownership more accessible, and how else 
can we continue to cut housing costs for families?
    Ms. Scott. Sure. The issue there is that home buyers who 
can't afford the 20-percent down payment are required to 
purchase mortgage insurance, and that requirement prohibits a 
lot of families from actually going forward with home 
ownership. So, first-time home buyers, minority home buyers, 
those are the ones that we really, really want to focus on. And 
I think that, as noted earlier in the testimony, the gaps in 
terms of the limits in income and the limits in savings--this 
will help us to address that gap and make home ownership more 
available to many more families.
    This is also why we support increasing funding to other 
housing programs that can provide down payment assistance as 
well like, for example, CDBG and HOME, and the USDA Rural 
Housing Service single-family programs. So, we say combine all 
of those other resources to increase the availability of home 
ownership down payment assistance.
    Senator Hassan. Well, thank you very much. That's very 
helpful.
    And thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague.
    Here is where we are. I'm going to run and vote and then 
free Senator Crapo up, and I do have a family commitment at 
noon that I can't break. So we'll go with Senator Cantwell, and 
then we'll go with Senator Young. With a little bit of luck, 
others will come in after they vote, but it's going to be a 
little bit of a juggling act. And Senator Crapo and I will call 
some audibles.
    Senator Cantwell?
    Senator Cantwell. Did my colleague, Senator Young, want to 
go?
    Senator Young. I'm prepared to. Thank you. Thank you, 
Senator Cantwell.
    Senator Cantwell. I'm yielding to my colleague who is 
working so diligently with me to get an increase in the tax 
credit.
    Senator Young. Thank you to the great Senator from the 
State of Washington with Hoosier roots. I appreciate that.
    I mean, this is a timely hearing, and I've enjoyed working 
with Senator Cantwell and others, and I look forward to working 
with the ranking member on housing affordability challenges. I 
dare say we're in the midst of a national crisis right now. I 
mean, we've experienced consumer inflation across a number of 
areas in the economy in recent years, but this is one that 
really, going back to when I entered the U.S. House of 
Representatives in 2011--as I travel around the State of 
Indiana, I've heard a lot about housing affordability.
     I've tried to trace the roots and primary drivers of this 
challenge, and they are manifold. It's labor challenges. Many 
contractors who went out of business during the financial 
crisis a number of years ago still haven't come back. 
Oftentimes we have input challenges, on and on and on, but by 
any stretch, this is a market failure. Yes, I used the term 
deliberately, but I also use it carefully. After study, it's 
pretty clear we have a market failure, some of which has been 
the result of government failures or government excesses, 
whether it was through the over-subsidization of mortgages, or 
zoning or land use policies over the years, but in the end, the 
market hasn't worked.
    So we can do that, I think, in some instances by, at the 
very least, shining a light on some of the government policies 
that distort markets and make affordable housing out of reach 
for some people. And I try to do that through my YIMBY Act, 
which through a light touch approach, would require localities 
to make clear when they are implementing land use and zoning 
policies which historically exclude certain peoples and/or 
drive up the cost of housing. So that's a priority.
    But what I'm most excited about today--and I know all of 
you want to hear about this--are some things that I am working 
on with my good friend from the State of Maryland, Senator 
Cardin. We have introduced legislation we are calling the 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act. Now, this is a 
reintroduction; Senator Portman collaborated with Senator 
Cardin on this legislation. But it would address the value gap 
between the cost of renovating a house and the market price in 
low-income census tracts.
    So, if you go through any major city in the United States, 
many small towns, you will see what is loosely called blight: 
unsightly homes. I've traveled around these neighborhoods, 
tried to figure out how we can make it economical to remove 
these homes to allow others to put others in their place or to 
renovate those structures. And Senators Portman and Cardin were 
able to crack that nut, and I'm carrying the ball this 
Congress.
    The NHIA will not only increase access to affordable 
housing, it will also increase jobs and provide economic 
development around the country. The estimated impact of this 
bill over 10 years in the State of Indiana alone is remarkable. 
Approximately 9,500 homes will be built or substantially 
rehabilitated, and about $2.5 billion of total development 
activity will occur in the State of Indiana alone over 10 
years.
    Over 16,000 jobs in construction or construction-related 
industries will be created; over $900 million in wages and 
salaries will be generated; and nearly $250 million in Federal, 
State, and local tax revenues and fees will eventuate if we can 
get this done, as I think we will this Congress.
    So, these are the sorts of things that I think we ought to 
be working on during a time of what is called divided 
government, but I see us coming together on important 
priorities like this that don't have a red or blue hue to them. 
And I thank all of you much for being here.
    And with that, I will just look forward to following up 
with our witnesses. I won't be asking any questions of you 
today. So, with that, thank you, Mr. Ranking Member.
    Senator Crapo. Senator Cantwell?
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Crapo. Thank you so 
much.
    I want to go back to this workforce housing issue that I 
brought up, and I know some of my colleagues did. This 
workforce housing--I'm hearing that hospitals are paying for 
affordable housing, that insurance--I see nods--insurance is 
paying for affordable housing, that people are finding it just 
better to build affordable housing than incur the cost of 
unhoused individuals.
    I also wonder if I could get people to comment on the fact 
that the LIHTC program is also so successful in rural areas 
that, even while it may make sense in Seattle that health care 
or insurance might pay for housing as a better way to deal with 
the population, we're also seeing the need for affordable 
housing in rural economies, and that's why this legislation on 
increasing the tax credit is so important. And the fact that in 
2018 we secured a bump that ran through 2021, but now is 
expired--what impact that is having? So, Mr. Walker, do you 
want to start and try to address those issues?
    Mr. Walker. Sure. I'd be happy to. Starting with the second 
one on the bump, that juiced the production at a very important 
time. And, as we've seen over the last handful of years related 
to the pandemic, we now have lost that 12-percent increase at a 
time when costs have gone way, way up in a short amount of 
time. So, we're playing catchup. We're trying to fill gaps in a 
lot of financed deals that can't either get off the ground or 
get completed without some additional funding. So, losing that 
12-percent could not have happened at a worse time.
    On your first question about rural areas, as has been 
discussed, rents are lower in rural areas--and the cost of 
materials is not much different--and so that creates a real 
paradigm and a challenge for developing in those communities. 
And the credit program, especially the 9-percent program that 
has a much larger equity component to it, is so key to 
addressing the affordable housing needs that are equally large 
in our rural areas.
    I might also add that what we are seeing converging and 
colliding really is, we need to produce new units. And as the 
credit program approaches 40 years old, we are also under a lot 
of pressure to get back to those older deals and preserve and 
do some rehabilitation and recapitalization work. So there are 
two pressures on every dollar of credit that we have available 
to us, both because of the success of the program and all the 
units that we have built, as well as the housing crisis that we 
are in right now--and needing to produce additional units, both 
in rural areas as well as our urban areas.
    Senator Cantwell. Does anybody else--Dr. Calabria, I see 
you and others nodding your head. I still don't feel like we've 
calibrated this issue so that everybody gets it. It is a supply 
issue. We are not keeping pace with demand. And to your point, 
Mr. Walker, we literally had supply come out of the system 
because it went to 
market-based rates on pressure, so what should we do? Yes, Dr. 
Calabria or Mr. Walker?
    Dr. Calabria. Thank you. I will maybe take a little bit of 
a different--yes, the tax credit is used in rural and suburban 
areas, but certainly, just looking at the distribution of the 
stock, there is still a heavily urban bias to the program. And 
again, as Mr. Walker alluded to, the economics of the program 
are harder in rural areas. That's absolutely true, and that's 
why I'm generally of the view that we probably should have a 
rural set-aside in the program to nudge housing finance 
agencies to do the projects that are harder there.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Mr. Walker?
    Mr. Walker. I don't think it's been acknowledged yet, and I 
think it's important to acknowledge that we have under-built 
for now 2-plus decades, and we are in a deep, deep hole at a 
time when the wealth gap is widening. And so this is a 
multifaceted challenge, and I would not say that the credit 
program is perfect, but it is very good, and the Credit 
Improvement Act, in particular when we think about rural areas, 
has a component of a basis boost in rural areas that is going 
to really help close the financing gap that presents itself in 
many of our rural areas.
    Senator Cantwell. How much have we under-built?
    Mr. Walker. I don't know how to put a figure on that. I 
feel like we're in such a deep hole that just seeing the break-
even point is really, really challenging. But I'd love to get 
back to you on that, if you would like.
    Senator Cantwell. We've asked this question of other 
witnesses. I've heard 300,000 units. I've heard different 
numbers. I think people have admitted that the downturn 
basically just kind of put a halt to a lot of things. And those 
were significant years where supply was not meeting the market 
demand, and then we've had other issues. So anyway, I'd like to 
get this number, because I think if we could show our 
colleagues exactly how much supply has not been put in to the 
system, then these other issues like you're saying--the 
pandemic and supply chains--we all know how much that increased 
cost of materials.
    And then you take out the one bump we were able to get, so 
yes, there's probably a huge swing in the amount of costs that 
are now making it more expensive, again tacked onto to this 
decade-plus where we didn't keep pace with supply. Then you can 
see really why we're in this hole, and I think that will 
motivate people.
    I'm very interested in looking at the rural credit issues; 
so, thank you.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
    Senator Warren?
    Senator Warren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    So, I'm going to pick up actually where Senator Cantwell 
left off, and that is, for decades the country has 
underinvested in our housing supply, and the data I see 
suggests we're now facing a shortage of as many 7 million 
affordable homes. But the bottom line is that we need more 
housing for everyone, for renters and first-time home buyers 
and veterans and people living with disabilities and families 
experiencing homelessness. You name it, we need more housing.
    So, tax policies can be a way to address housing shortages. 
The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit is not perfect, but it helps 
drive the development of affordable rental homes. But some of 
our tax policies may actually make the problem worse. Wall 
Street money managers have fanned out across the country buying 
and converting what little supply of affordable homes remain, 
and they get tax breaks to do that.
    Ms. Scott, you are an expert on community development, so 
let me start by asking you about the impact of more Wall Street 
investors moving into the housing market. Big corporate 
landlords, often acting through investment vehicles known as 
Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs, have bought up 
hundreds of thousands of homes across our country over the past 
decade.
    Now, some of these folks argue that REITs and other 
investors encourage investment in supply and neighborhood 
quality. Is that what you've seen?
    Ms. Scott. Thank you, Senator, for this focus in your 
question. We're not opposed to REITs, per se, but we are very 
concerned about the institutional investor in housing markets 
in our communities. LISC did a research paper focusing in on 
New York City that you may have seen. And in certain instances 
when these investors acquire properties, they refinance them so 
they're extracting money from the real estate and taking it out 
of the community rather than reinvesting it in the housing that 
they purchase.
    Oftentimes, we find that in the housing that has been 
purchased, the rents are increased and the existing tenants may 
even lose their housing. They may be evicted. We see that the 
quality of maintenance goes down, and overall there aren't the 
capital improvements.
    And on the single-family side, we see something similar 
happening, where these investors are snapping up homes to rent 
at much higher rates than the market has generally supported, 
and so you see less opportunity for first-time home buyers. 
This is the stock, and the community is being denied wealth. 
Wealth is coming out of the community. The housing is 
dilapidated, and oftentimes the institutional investors are not 
easily identified, and so it's not clear who the players are, 
where the money is coming from--and it's changing the face of 
many of our communities.
    Senator Warren. So that's a pretty grim picture about 
what's going on, and it's particularly alarming because, in 
2021, investors bought up one-quarter of all single-family 
homes that were on the market. And no surprise, the places 
where the biggest of these investors went--those that owned 
thousands of properties--have been the places where home prices 
have increased the most.
    Now, these same biggest investors are collecting record 
profits while they are subsidized by government financing and 
tax breaks. So, I just want to take a quick look at these tax 
breaks.
    Mr. Watson, we're going to be limited on time, so let's see 
if we can do these as true/false. You are an expert on Federal 
tax policy at the Tax Foundation. Let's just talk about a few 
of the tax breaks. Wall Street investors have exploited them to 
hoover up homes, make the supply crisis worse, and drive up 
costs for families. True or false?
    Many REITs are billion-dollar companies, including some of 
the biggest corporate landlords in the United States: 
Invitation Homes, American Homes 4 Rent, and Mid-America 
Apartments. But they generally do not pay corporate income tax 
if they meet certain conditions; is that right? True or false?
    Mr. Watson. If they deduct it from their income, they would 
not.
    Senator Warren. True. Okay.
    So, let's do another. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allows 
investors to deduct 20 percent of their pass-through business 
income, such as dividends they might receive from REITs. True 
or false?
    Mr. Watson. True.
    Senator Warren. True. All right.
    Let's keep going here. I like the way you're doing this. 
The CARES Act allowed all business losses to be carried back 
for 5 years. True or false?
    Mr. Watson. That's true.
    Senator Warren. That's true. And that change resulted in 
billions of dollars in tax benefits that went largely to the 
wealthiest in the country, including Wall Street real estate 
investors.
    So let's do one more. Real estate investors can avoid 
paying taxes on profits from the sale of a property if those 
profits are used to buy another property, a process known as 
like-kind exchanges. True or false?
    Mr. Watson. That's true.
    Senator Warren. Okay. This loophole is expected to provide 
investors with $134 billion in tax breaks over the next 10 
years. I just want to say our tax policies reward giant real 
estate investors who raise fees, jack up rents, and evict 
families. Americans are already suffering from severe lack of 
affordable homes, and any taxpayer money spent on housing 
should go toward fixing the problem, not making it worse.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Warren, because of her collegiality, 
we will have Senator Brown, then we will have Senator Cortez 
Masto. And then we're going to wrap up because I have to deal 
with William Peter Wyden, age 15, in a couple minutes. Okay.
    Senator Brown?
    Senator Brown. Is he a relative of yours?
    The Chairman. Yes; a son.
    Senator Brown. I knew that.
    Senator Cortez Masto, thank you for your graciousness.
    Dr. Calabria, good to see you again. Glad you're here. 
Thank you.
    Ms. Scott, in this committee and the Banking and Housing 
Committee, we've heard time after time how difficult it is for 
first-time home buyers and families to find a place they can 
afford. Yesterday I joined Senators Cardin and Young and Wyden 
and Warner in reintroducing the Neighborhood Homes Investment 
Act. I know Senator Cardin and Senator Young raised this with 
you earlier.
    Ms. Scott, how would the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act 
help expand the supply of safe, affordable homes and open up 
home-ownership opportunities for families in Ohio and across 
the country?
    Ms. Scott. Thank you, Senator, for this question. 
Essentially, what the credit is going to do is to enable us to 
build housing, because we'll be able to fill the gap between 
what it costs to build and what the home is actually valued at. 
In the communities that you're referring to, in Ohio for 
example, the value of the home is less than the cost of the 
construction. So once we close that gap, we get to a place 
where we can build more homes. We expect that we can build 
another 500,000 new homes under this program over the next 10 
years. And the Neighborhood Homes credit is targeted to census 
tracts that will assist many low-income families and minority 
families, both in urban and rural communities.
    Senator Brown. Thank you.
    Mr. Walker, last Congress I introduced the bipartisan 
Housing for Homeless Students Act with my colleague from Ohio, 
Senator Portman, and Senator King of Maine. This bill ensures 
that students and veterans who have experienced homelessness 
are eligible to reside in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, LIHTC, 
funded affordable housing while pursuing an education full-
time.
    Currently, these students are not eligible for LIHTC-
financed housing. This creates a Catch-22 for students forced 
to make an untenable choice between a roof over their heads and 
full-time status. What would it mean to students and veterans 
experiencing homelessness to be eligible for affordable housing 
through LIHTC while pursuing their education, and would 
streamlining the student rule also make LIHTC easier to use?
    Mr. Walker. Thank you for the question, and thank you for 
your leadership on this issue. I think the student rule is a 
concept of decades ago, and I think both the credit program--my 
experience is that we can improve on that by opening up the 
housing that we are creating for students, whether they are 
homeless students or students of families that have experienced 
homelessness, or whether they're working families that are 
having to retool for industry changes.
    We've learned as we've gone, and both your legislation and 
the Credit Improvement Act include some modifications to really 
reconcile the shortcomings of limiting access to the affordable 
housing that we're creating for students.
    Senator Brown. Thank you.
    And back to you, Ms. Scott. I want to follow up a bit on 
Senator Warren's questions and comments. We've seen what 
institutional out-of-State investors are doing to communities 
in Ohio and everywhere else. My office is inundated with 
complaints from Ohio renters, from local officials who see 
investors jacking up rents, filing eviction after eviction, 
letting homes fall apart to the point where they're 
uninhabitable. Your comment about the renovation costing more 
than it's worth is particularly incisive, I think. How are 
these investors affecting renters, aspiring homeowners, and 
their communities? Talk a bit more about that, if you would.
    Ms. Scott. So essentially what happens here is, especially 
on the single-family home-ownership side, this housing is swept 
off of the market as a resource for first-time home buyers, 
first-generation home buyers. The prices, if they are on the 
market for sale, are at a much higher rate than the market can 
bear, than the families can pay, and so we're basically losing 
inventory that is affordable in these markets. And then we're 
also having the negative impact of the inventory that stays as 
rental that is, as I said, dilapidated, oftentimes not kept up, 
and so it's a problem that crosses multiple layers of housing 
inventory.
    Senator Brown. Thank you.
    One of my favorite religious philosophers, Rumi, once said, 
``In generosity in helping others, be like a river,'' and 
that's what Senator Cortez Masto is. So thank you for yielding 
for a moment.
    The Chairman. And I thank my colleague, who also is going 
back to the Banking Committee, but it is a committee that also 
works very extensively on housing issues, so we're very glad to 
be able to be partners.
    Senator Cortez Masto?
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thanks to 
everybody here. It is just appropriate we're having this 
conversation right across the way from the Chair of the Federal 
Reserve. This is a question I asked him--about housing and the 
impact the Federal Reserve is having on access to housing.
    Mr. Walker, let me start with you. And thank you for 
including your support of my bill, the Affordable Housing Bond 
Enhancement Act, in your opening statement. This legislation 
that I've introduced will expand the supply of affordable homes 
and improve access to home ownership for low- and moderate-
income home buyers and improve our mortgage revenue bonds and 
Mortgage Credit Certificate program.
    Among other things, it raises the home improvement limit 
from $15,000 to $50,000, allows refinancing, and simplifies the 
Mortgage Credit Certificate calculation. So my question to you, 
Mr. Walker, is, how would this legislation help working 
families buy and sustain home ownership?
    Mr. Walker. Well, today's marketplace emphasizes the 
importance of mortgage revenue bonds and Mortgage Credit 
Certificates by being able to provide lower cost to borrowing 
and helping folks who otherwise would not have the access to 
the dream of home ownership. And so, both of these tools are 
incredibly valuable, and I think your legislation helps to 
enhance these tools.
    Secondly, being able to improve homes, keeping people 
housed--people who have the opportunity to own a home, but are 
struggling to maintain that home--is an important component as 
well. And so, whether it's an elderly couple that needs to do 
some modifications to their existing home so that they can age 
in place--again, a very important component of our housing 
continuum.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, and I so appreciate the 
chairman and the ranking member having this hearing, because 
there are a number of things that we have introduced that can 
help not only the home-building side and the financing to 
pencil out, but on the home ownership and helping those who 
want access. And I'm hopeful after this--we do have this group 
of bills that we're putting forward that really are going to 
make a difference here. I hear it in Nevada so often, because 
we have affordable housing issues on so many levels.
    Dr. Calabria, it's good to see you again. Thank you. 
Congratulations on your new book that has come out.
    Dr. Calabria. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I look forward to reading it. Let me 
ask you this--and thank you for serving as the FHFA Director. 
In my research on the Federal Home Loan Banks, it has become 
clear that the Federal Home Loan Banks have access to the type 
of financing that affordable housing developers need: 
acquisition, construction, long-term low fixed-interest rates 
to finance multifamily housing developments; yet, this 
trillion-dollar system invested less than $3 billion in these 
types of investments, a fraction of the more than $300 billion 
in advances.
    And I think the FHL Bank advances could work very well with 
the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. I'm a supporter of the 
legislation there in so many other ways. So my question to you 
is, right now the FHFA is undertaking a review of these Federal 
Home Loan Banks, and I'm curious, as a former Director, about 
your thoughts on that. Is that appropriate? And then what 
should Congress be doing once the review is finalized?
    Dr. Calabria. Certainly, it is appropriate. I had actually 
started my own internal review on some of the Bank Act 
questions when I was there, and it's been almost 30 years since 
Congress made any real changes to the Federal Home Loan Bank 
system. So I think in a couple of months we'll see a report 
from the agency to Congress. Some of that will include 
congressional recommendations.
    Senator Brown left, but maybe he's still listening, and we 
can suggest that perhaps the Banking Committee should have some 
hearings on the system and look into it, but it is absolutely 
appropriate and timely.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. And for this reason--I've 
heard it from so many in my State around not just helping the 
homeowners, but this idea of putting together this financing. 
And I'm going to quote one of my State Senators: ``It's like 
lasagna. You've got to pull all these different pieces together 
to make it work, and each time it's going to come out maybe a 
little bit differently.''
    Our goal here is to give them enough tools to put that 
lasagna together, the ingredients that they need for that 
financing. There's so many different ways, and this is one of 
them. The Federal Home Loan Bank is an important part of it.
    I'm going to add one other thing that came up today, and I 
think it was Dr. Calabria who said this. In the West, a 
majority of the land is owned by the Federal Government. So, 
our local governments do not have the opportunity to own land, 
to say maybe we're going to provide this land at a cheaper rate 
for affordable housing. We have to go through the Federal 
Government to do so. There has to be a benefit for those of 
us--and believe me, there's bipartisan support for this--to 
identify Federal land in the West that can go for a cheaper 
rate to help us develop this affordable housing so it pencils 
out. So, I'm just going to put that word out there.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. I thank my colleague. I'm going to have to 
run, and Senator Menendez is going to wrap up, and I thank him 
for doing so.
    Senator Cortez Masto, as is usually the case, makes a good 
point. The ingredients are there. And to me, we've had a lot of 
good ideas here. I think there's a chance to build a really 
unique coalition here to deal with this. The only thing that's 
unacceptable to me is for this Congress to take a pass on 
housing. This is too urgent. It's too important, for all the 
reasons we've been talking about.
    Senator Menendez, thank you for making it possible to wrap 
up.
    Senator Menendez [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and 
your closing statement there is exactly my sentiment, so thank 
you very much.
    Allowing property taxes to be fully deducted has been a 
bedrock principle of our tax code. It rewards States that 
provide services like education, public safety, and 
transportation that improve the quality of life. The State and 
local tax deduction has been critical to ensuring housing stays 
affordable.
    Ms. Geno, your members that are C corporations are able to 
fully deduct State and local taxes at the entity level against 
their corporate taxable income; is that correct?
    Ms. Geno. Yes.
    Senator Menendez. If SALT was capped for these 
corporations, would that likely increase the cost for tenants?
    Ms. Geno. It could. And again, there's so many things that 
can be done on the State and local levels for support. But from 
a tax policy perspective, we're seeing State and local taxes 
increase dramatically in communities across the country, and 
that is an increasing problem that impedes multifamily 
development. Another thing that State and local governments can 
do--and the Federal Government can help incentivize--is for 
them to provide tax-
abatement opportunities for multifamily housing developments, 
particularly those that include affordable units.
    Again, Federal incentives for State and local governments 
to make those changes on the local level would truly help. 
We've seen that happen in certain communities across the 
country. More of that would be beneficial.
    Senator Menendez. I appreciate that. I mean, unfortunately 
what you described as a possibility is the unfortunate reality 
for middle-class homeowners in my State and many others. The 
2017 Republican tax law gutted this essential deduction, not 
for large corporations, but for families, forcing them to be 
double taxed and punishing States with progressive tax codes 
that choose to invest in their communities.
    New Jersey has some of the best schools in the Nation. It 
has a vast infrastructure system in terms of transportation. 
These are all elements that make it a desirable State to live 
in. Of course, you have to spend money on those investments, 
and gutting the State and local property taxes has been a 
consequence that attacks the very essence of making those 
investments.
    Even if you have an abatement, an abatement obviously 
foregoes a certain revenue at the municipal level, so the 
deduction would be able to help towards creating stability, and 
it has been essential for encouraging and preserving home 
ownership and wealth for Black and Hispanic homeowners. 
Historians like Andrew Kahrl at the University of Virginia have 
found Black and Hispanic households have been subject to higher 
property tax assessments than their White counterparts.
    The SALT deduction has been vital in providing relief from 
unjust tax assessments, which is why the NAACP passed a 
resolution in support of lifting the cap, so I'm going to 
continue to revisit this issue until we get it right.
    Now, one of the greatest challenges in the current housing 
market--I know there's been a lot of talk about LIHTC, but I 
just want to add my voice to it. There are simply not enough 
affordable rental homes being built, and according to Secretary 
Fudge, even before the pandemic, we had a shortfall of 7 
million affordable homes for low-income renters.
    So as a Nation, we have to find ways to build more 
affordable homes, and part of that solution should come from 
our new investments. But we also need to make maximum effective 
use of existing tools, such as the bipartisan Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credit, which subsidizes the creation of 100,000 
units of affordable housing a year, but I think it has the 
potential to do even more.
    Ms. Geno, what would it mean for the development of new, 
multifamily buildings if Congress increased the LIHTC value and 
the total amount of credits as outlined in the Affordable 
Housing Credit Improvement Act?
    Ms. Geno. Current estimates are that it would increase the 
value of the tax credit to create almost 2 million new homes, 
but again, as we stated earlier, we have to start today. There 
is a real urgency in moving this legislation forward. We are 
already losing ground. And if this legislation were passed 
today, it would take 3 years to see the benefit. So we need 
those additional 2 million homes, but it's going to take a 
minute to get there.
    Senator Menendez. Now, tax credits like LIHTC are vital in 
increasing the supply of affordable housing, but developers 
first need to obtain funding, financing to start construction 
and build homes. So institutions like Community Development 
Financial Institutions that deliver capital to communities 
where affordable housing is most needed, in my view, are a 
critical element of the housing ecosystem.
    Ms. Scott, can you talk about how CDFIs like yours support 
the development of affordable housing in underserved 
communities?
    Ms. Scott. Yes, Senator; thank you for this focus. The most 
important thing, I think, that the CDFIs are doing is really 
providing capital at the early stage of development when it's 
almost impossible to get pre-development funding to even start 
a project and conceive of it. The CDFIs are lending--we're 
taking some of the biggest risks in the continuum of building 
housing, and it gets us to a place where developers can apply 
for credits and secure them and then oftentimes are even coming 
back for some financing from us in order to work alongside the 
credit and other financing.
    We're also sometimes filling gaps in terms of the timeline. 
Sometimes to preserve the integrity of the credit, we'll enter 
the tax credit deal before the credit flows, and that's another 
opportunity that enables a deal to go forward. We're also 
lending to borrowers, to developers that may not be able to 
secure conventional lending, and so that's another source of 
opportunity. So, I think the CDFI world is really providing a 
resource that's really helping to spur--I don't know the exact 
number or percentage of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit units 
that have been built by CDFIs or helped to be built by CDFIs, 
but that number is substantial. Without the CDFI community, I 
don't think we would see as much affordable housing production 
as we see now.
    Senator Menendez. You have a proven track record of 
delivering affordable housing development in underserved 
communities, which is why I led the effort to establish the 
CDFI Bond Guarantee Program, which enables CDFIs to execute 
large-scale development projects.
    My final question is, would you agree that expanded funding 
for CDFIs would help expand the building of affordable housing 
in places where it's needed the most?
    Ms. Scott. Simply put, Senator, yes.
    Senator Menendez. Okay. Sometimes ``yes'' is the strongest 
word. So I urge my colleagues to join me in strongly supporting 
funding for CDFIs as we deal with the 2024 appropriations.
    With that, on behalf of the chairman and the ranking 
member, thanks to all of you for your presence and information. 
For information of members, questions for the record will be 
due at 5 p.m. next Tuesday, March 14th.
    And with that, this hearing is adjourned. Thank you.
    [Whereupon, at 12:13 p.m., the hearing was concluded.]

              Additional Material Submitted for the Record

                              ----------                              


            Prepared Statement of Mark A. Calabria, Ph.D., 
                     Senior Advisor, Cato Institute
    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and distinguished members of 
the committee, thank you for the invitation to appear at today's 
important hearing.

    It has been a great privilege to get to know and work with many 
members of this committee during my own years of public service. 
Senator Crapo's work on reforming our mortgage finance system has been 
critical. Of course, Senator Brown's longstanding commitment to 
affordable rental housing has driven his tenure as Chair of the 
Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. I would also like to 
recognize Senator Scott's work on housing credit access and Senator 
Cortez Masto's work on the Federal Home Loan Banks. And last, but not 
least, my home State Senator Warner's work on mortgage finance reform 
has been an important contribution. While I haven't always agreed on 
the details, I have always been impressed with the sincere commitment 
of these, and other members, to address the pressing housing needs of 
our country.

    While my affiliation today is with the Cato Institute, any views 
expressed are solely my own. In addition, I have no financial 
interests, other than as a taxpayer, homeowner and concerned citizen, 
in the issues being discussed at today's hearing, and nor do I 
represent any interests that do.

    Let me also clearly state that neither the Cato Institute nor its 
scholars either endorse or oppose specific pieces of legislation. 
Accordingly, nothing in my prepared testimony or oral remarks should be 
interpreted to either support or oppose any particular legislation.

    The observations and statements made in my testimony are based not 
only on my years of public service, but also on my read of the relevant 
statistical series and academic research. Others may read the same 
research and reach different conclusions. I've attempted to limit any 
observations to those generally supported by multiple researchers and 
data series.

    Let me first state that too many working families face significant 
housing costs burdens. While I have never been shy when it comes to 
disagreeing with some of the more conventional approaches to housing 
assistance, my disagreement has been based in a concern that too many 
programs are inefficient, poorly targeted, and even occasionally 
counterproductive. It is not a disagreement over the importance of 
housing affordability. At the risk of overgeneralization, I believe 
that too often, too much of our housing subsidies have been captured by 
providers, and too little of the economic benefit not ultimately 
received by the intended families. I also remain concerned that too 
often subsidies are not focused on those most in need, this is 
particularly the case with housing, where despite the positive tax law 
changes in 2017, the bunk of the benefit of the mortgage interest 
deduction, for instance, is captured by wealthier households.

    Let me also emphasize that the best housing policy is a jobs 
policy. There is simply no greater force for housing affordability than 
broad-based economic growth. Efforts must be made to reduce the cost of 
housing, especially by reducing construction costs, but it is also 
critical we see strong inflation-adjusted income growth for working 
families. Future tax reform should be foremost focused on increasing 
wages.

    We must also recognize that the rental housing programs created in 
our tax code are often used by developers in conjunction with other 
non-tax subsidies. Considerable expense is incurred coordinating and 
combining these various subsidies. I would encourage any changes to the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) or related programs to be 
coordinated with programs changes in other programs. There is far too 
much complexity today in affordable housing development. We should work 
to reduce that complexity, not add to it.

    I would also urge the committee to consider where the multifamily 
rental market may be headed. To quote a recent Freddie Mac report,\1\ 
``Multifamily is at an inflection point.'' The bulk of evidence 
suggests that national rental market has been softening, with some risk 
of actual oversupply in multifamily rental housing. While forecasting 
is always somewhat difficult, most indicators suggest that rents will 
decline over the next 12 to 18 months. The committee should be cautious 
as to adding any additional stimulus to apartment construction when we 
are likely already passing the peak of this cycle.

outlook.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        america's housing market
    America contains just under 144 million housing units. Of these, 85 
million are owner-occupied and 44 million are renter-occupied. As of 
year-end 2022, we also had 14.5 million vacant housing units.

    Of those renter households, around 2.2 million receive a Federal 
housing voucher, usually under section 8, another 840,000 live in 
federally assisted public housing, and 1.4 million live in a federally 
assisted, but privately owned, unit, often a project-based section 8. 
Just under 1 million renters live in units covered by some sort of rent 
control or stabilization.

    Since January 2021, America has experienced a dramatic decline in 
housing affordability. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's national 
Home Ownership Affordability Monitor (HOAM) index,\2\ fell from 103.6 
in January 2021 to 64.7 in October 2022. The index, where higher 
numbers indicate more affordability, has modestly recovered to 69.6 for 
year-end 2022. The most recent HOAM index numbers are at their lowest 
level since before the 2008 crisis. The rate of decline for 2022 is 
unparalleled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ https://www.atlantafed.org/center-for-housing-and-policy/data-
and-tools/home-ownership-affordability-monitor.aspx.

    While the dramatic increase in mortgage rates has been the primary 
driver of the decline in housing affordability, high home prices 
coupled with weak real income growth have also added to declines in 
affordability. Similarly negative trends have occurred in the rental 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
market.

    Rental housing often conjures up visions of urban, high-density, 
apartment living. That vision fails to capture much of the character of 
renting. A third of rental housing is in the form of single-family 
units. Another fourth of rental units are in properties of under 10 
units. In fact, only about 12 percent of rental units are in the 
higher-density, 50 or more units, one generally finds utilizing the 
LIHTC. If we include single-family units, approximately half of all 
rental units are in properties of under 5 units.

    The percent of renters earning below the poverty line is only 
modestly lower for renters living in single-family detached housing (20 
percent) relative to renters overall, 22 percent of whom earn below the 
poverty line.

    Lack of affordable rental housing is sometimes viewed as an urban 
problem, yet according to the U.S. Census Bureau's Housing Vacancy 
Survey, suburban rental markets actually have tighter housing markets 
than those of central cities, 5.3 percent vacant compared to 5.9 
percent vacant for central cities.

    As Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies has noted, in recent 
years, new construction has predominately added to the stock of higher 
unit rental properties, while the number of lower unit properties, 
particularly those in the 2- to 4-unit range, have been on net leaving 
the housing stock.

    A pressing policy question should be how do we leverage the large 
portion of small units that typically fall outside the footprint of the 
LIHTC? This is a particularly pressing issue in rural and suburban 
communities.

    The ``good news'' is that after years of under-building, both 
single-family and multifamily construction is strong. The ``bad news'' 
is that we are almost certainly overbuilding in the multifamily market 
and are due for a sharp correction in the apartment market. Over the 
past year, multifamily housing starts have been at levels not seen 
since the early 1980s.
             primary causes of rental affordability burdens
    The primary drivers of housing costs nationally are land costs, 
labor costs/
shortages, and materials costs. To a lesser extent, issues related to 
construction finance are also adversely impacting housing 
affordability.

    Despite being a country rich in land, only around 2 percent is 
currently used for urban purposes. We, especially State and local 
governments, have made it increasingly difficult to use our vast land 
resources for housing. According to the National Association of Home 
Builders, regulation, mostly State and local, adds 40 percent to the 
cost of multifamily development.\3\

apartment-development-costs.

    There is perhaps little that Congress can really do to 
substantially change local land use rules, but we must at least 
recognize that local supply constraints can render useless many Federal 
attempts at affordable housing, and in some instances actually make 
them worse. When supply is relatively fixed or inelastic, do not apply 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
demand subsidies, as such only drives up prices.

    One area where Congress can make considerable progress, at least 
for a few States, is to convert federally held land into land that can 
be used to develop housing. The model used by Nevada, which is 80 
percent Federal land, to convert Federal land to developable uses 
should be a model for other States. If not for this mechanism, Las 
Vegas would be considerably more expensive. While few States have the 
degree of Federal ownership as Nevada, one of the least affordable 
housing markets, California, does have a Federal ownership of 45 
percent. Even a modest level of converting Federal lands in California 
to housing would make a massive difference in housing affordability. 
Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, New Mexico, and Washington 
State are prime examples of housing markets were much of the 
affordability problem could be solved by a Federal land to housing 
conversion. Of course, a large amount of that land would not be 
suitable for housing, but enough of it would be.

    In relation to materials costs, we can make a significant 
contribution to reducing construction costs by resolving many of our 
outstanding trade disputes. This is especially the case with Canadian 
lumber and aluminum. While we have witnessed dramatic declines in 
lumber prices relative to those of 2021 and 2022, lumber prices still 
remain above their long-run averages. Similar, aluminum is down 
significantly from its summer 2022 highs but still remain highly 
elevated relative to its long-run average.

    When thinking in terms of directing subsidies, I urge the committee 
to think clearly about which constraints are the most binding. If 
subsidies are not directed at those constraints, then one risks simply 
driving up the cost of the input in short supply. For instance, in a 
housing market with limited land availability, or as the economists 
would say an ``inelastic'' supply of land, then subsidies not directed 
at easing the supply of land will largely bid up the cost of land 
without increasing total units (housing) produced. For this reason, the 
typical use of demand side tax credits, such as the home buyer tax 
credit enacted in 2008 as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery 
Act, simply caused a short-term spurt in housing prices, that later 
reverted. While it was popular, it was a subsidy that was largely 
wasted.\4\ As economist Dean Baker noted, the 2008 buyer credit 
``delayed the deflation of the bubble, but did not stop it.''\5\ We 
should avoid similar gimmicks this time around.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ As a Brookings Institute paper concluded, ``we find evidence 
that the HERA home buyer tax credit, which essentially amounted to an 
interest-free loan, did little to stop the rapid deterioration of the 
housing market conditions after the bursting of the home price 
bubble,'' https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           excess complexity in affordable rental development
    The most prominent rental housing program in our tax code is the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). According to the U.S. Census 
Bureau's Rental Housing Finance Survey (RHFS), there are around 2.6 
million rental units currently in the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit 
program (about 5 percent of the total U.S. rental stock), representing 
over a little less than 60,000 properties, with an average of 40 units 
per property.

    LIHTC properties often receive additional subsidies. For instance, 
at least a third of LIHTC properties have at least five tenants 
receiving a section 8 housing voucher. A full fifth of tax credit 
properties have a third of their tenants on section 8 housing vouchers. 
A considerable amount of the ``affordability'' of these properties is 
mostly, if not exclusively, provided by the section 8 voucher program. 
Other subsidies include: 22 percent of tax credit properties have 
subsidized mortgage rates; a third of LITHC developments get either 
HOME or CDBG; about half get State low-income housing tax credit, and 
another third are getting some sort of local tax relief.

    If we could better streamline subsidies, my read of the literature 
is that we could reduce development costs somewhere between 2 and 10 
percent, depending upon locality. So not a silver bullet, but worth 
doing, as it would require no additional funding. Not surprising, legal 
fees are a big cost, as often each subsidy stream performs a separate 
legal review. There is little market discipline among these fees, often 
cost-plus. Developer fees in LIHTC are usually around 10-15 percent. 
This is much higher than for-profit, unsubsidized development. While 
some higher development fees are to be expected, given the complexity, 
I would urge the committee to either cap development fees or have 
Treasury promulgate a rulemaking on ``reasonable'' development fees for 
LIHTC developments.

    Another cost of subsidy-layering is that different subsidy 
application cycles can add time and delay. One approach would be to 
limit the use of other Federal subsidies on LIHTC developments, else 
the committee should explore avenues to better align or consolidate 
subsidy application cycles.

    Although complexity, and its additional costs, are one concern, I 
am also concerned that the extent of ``double-dipping'' in LIHTC 
development reduces the amount of subsidy available to non-LIHTC 
developments. One avenue to minimize the current incentives for double-
dipping is the approach of section 306 of last Congress's Cantwell-
Young bill (S. 1136) prohibition on local contribution requirements.

    In addition to the complexities of affordable housing development, 
the committee should also consider the tendency of LIHTC properties to, 
as author Richard Rothstein observed in his book Color of Law, 
reinforce existing patterns of segregation.\6\ In part this effect is 
driven by the urban bias in site location, which is, in part, 
influenced by the more difficult economics of multifamily development 
in rural and suburban areas, due to the typically lower project 
density.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       housing tax credit reform
    While I would mostly recommend caution at this point in the real 
estate cycle, if the committee were to revisit the legislative 
framework for the LIHTC, I would offer the following recommendations. 
First, make the LIHTC look at lot more like HUD's HOME program. HOME 
allows a wider range of uses, such as direct tenant-based assistance, 
so that the particular local market circumstances can be taken into 
consideration. Despite some convergence, housing conditions are still 
largely locally determined. I would particularly urge the committee to 
allow LIHTC funds to be converted into short-term tenant-based rental 
assistance.\7\ There are many families who do not need permanent or 
even long-term assistance, but rather only a short-term bridge during 
periods of financial distress.

    I commend those State housing finance agencies which add tighter 
income targeting requirements to their awarding of tax credits. That 
said, I believe the current Federal level income targeting requirements 
are insufficient to result in the prioritization of those families most 
in need. I am also concerned that recent efforts at ``income 
averaging,'' while reducing administrative burdens, will result in 
weaker targeting. For most areas, the median renter income is around 60 
percent of the overall median income, implying that full income 
averaging would result in almost no actual targeting. The committee 
should consider the addition of a subgoal of a certain percent of units 
going to households under 30 percent of area median income. The 
committee may also want to consider capping the percent of units that 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
can be occupied by households over 120 percent of area median income.

    As one of the Banking Committee staff responsible for the drafting 
and negotiation of the 2005 reauthorization of the Violence Against 
Women Act (VAWA) and its housing title, I remain frustrated at the slow 
movement on the part of Treasury in meeting their obligations under 
VAWA, in respect to LIHTC properties.

    One of the strongest, and most transparent, features of the LIHTC 
is its per-
capita allocation formula. I would strongly encourage the committee to 
resist any efforts to move to a different formula. We have repeatedly 
seen the perverse outcome in programs like CDBG that the allocation 
formula results in a disproportionate percent of funding going to the 
richest areas of our country, often rewarding local areas for choosing 
high housing cost policies.

    Progress has been made to broaden the ultimate investors in the 
LIHTC, but the program is still overly reliant on the banking industry. 
I will remind the committee that during the 2008 financial crisis, the 
market for tax credits largely disappeared when the banking industry as 
a whole become unprofitable. If we see a continued softening of the 
economy, it is highly likely that bank profitability will decline and 
the demand for tax credits will again fall.
                       broader rental tax reform
    As mentioned above, there are a large number of rental units in 
lower-density properties that will likely never be attractive 
candidates for the LIHTC, at least not under current rules. Also 
mentioned was the over 14 million vacant housing units in the United 
States. How do we better leverage the millions of lower-density units, 
while also attracting vacant unit onto the rental market? I would 
suggest the committee directly examine the tax treatment of rental 
income. A modest proposal would be to make the first $500 in monthly 
rental income tax-free. In many markets, that savings would be passed 
along to renters. It would also encourage vacant units to enter the 
rental stock. As I am concerned as to our long-term fiscal situation, 
which I believe is unsustainable, this change could be paid for by 
reducing the tax expensing of mortgage interest payments of rental 
properties.
                         other committee issues
    While somewhat tangential, I do want to take this opportunity to 
alert the committee to significant vulnerabilities in the REIT sector 
that were witnessed in March 2020. In particular, so-called mortgage 
REITs were a major source of fragility in our financial markets in 
March 2020, resulting in both assistance from FHFA and the Federal 
Reserve. A small handful of REITs have moved beyond acting as passive 
investment vehicles and have adopted active trading strategies, not in 
substance different from those that contributed to the failure of Bear 
Stearns. As I believe these activities represent a threat to financial 
stability and run counter to congressional intent, I would encourage 
the committee to investigate this issue. If interest, I would be happy 
to provide the committee with additional detail.
                              conclusions
    The housing market has been softening and will continue to do so 
for at least another 18 months. Rents and prices have weakened and will 
continue to do so. In fact, I believe we are closer to the beginning of 
this housing correction than to the middle or end. Accordingly, 
Congress should move slowly and cautiously when it comes to providing 
any additional stimulus to the housing market. Such will only delay the 
inevitable.

    Legislating is, of course, an often slow process and should focus 
primarily on longer-term issues. Despite the short-term outlook for an 
oversupply in multifamily housing, we still have longer-run cost 
pressures. We also have significant housing resources that are 
underutilized.

    As the most effective housing program is a jobs and incomes 
program, I would encourage Congress to approach changes to our housing 
tax provisions within the broader context of overall tax and housing 
reform. I would also encourage the committee to favor simplicity over 
complexity, and to expand the focus of the LIHTC beyond higher-density, 
urban projects.

     Questions Submitted for the Record to Mark A. Calabria, Ph.D.
                 Question Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo
    Question. Most of today's affordable housing is built using the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). However, we know that State and 
local regulatory barriers can prevent developers who participate in a 
LIHTC project from building at a desired pace.

    What are some regulatory reforms at the State and local level that 
should be enacted or encouraged as best practices to ensure quicker 
development of LIHTC projects?

    Answer. Streamlining the zoning process would be foremost, 
especially moving to a ``build-by-right'' framework, where builders who 
meet the local/State requirements are then entitled to build. While not 
the case in most jurisdictions, the worst building environments are 
those with multiple veto-points, where the builder lacks the certainty 
of whether a project can even be completed.

    I would also encourage jurisdictions to move from a single-limited 
use zoning model to the hierarchical model, where certain land uses are 
allowed in all zones. For instance, while a jurisdiction may not want 
to allow industrial or heavy commercial uses in a residential zone, it 
would allow residential, particularly multifamily development, to occur 
areas zoned industrial or commercial. Zoning should have built in 
flexibility that allows the property market to evolve without the need 
for constant updating of zoning maps.

    While I love my car as much, or even perhaps more, than the next 
person, local jurisdictions should examine, if not reduce or eliminate, 
unnecessary parking space requirements for new residential 
construction.

    In several jurisdictions, local and State prevailing wage 
requirements also add considerable expense to the construction of 
affordable housing. They may also extend development times as labor 
negotiations may leverage the urgency of the development process in 
order to extract concessions.

    I would highly recommend the committee and local jurisdictions to 
review the various options offered in Housing Reform in the States: A 
Menu of Options for 2023, by Salim Furth and Emily Hamilton at GMU's 
Mercatus Center. https://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/

           Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
    Question. What changes do you recommend the Federal Housing Finance 
Agency make to improve the ability of the Federal Home Loan Banks to 
safely enable their member institutions to invest in housing and 
community economic development?

    Answer. In order to assure that System advances are being used to 
support housing activity, I would suggest that FHFA examine the 
possibility of a more frequent asset test for System members. FHFA 
should also examine the FHLBanks' approach to managing concentration 
risk, as we have seen instances where a small number of advance 
borrowers constituted a large percent of advance activity at individual 
FHLBanks. FHFA should also review the FHLBanks' approach to accounting 
for interest rates risk in eligible collateral, such as mortgage-backed 
securities.

    FHFA should also examine any need for System consolidation. FHFA 
can reduce the number of FHLBanks to eight without congressional 
approval. FHFA can also rationalize the existing geographic footprint 
of the System. If feasible, FHFA should consider reducing the System 
from 11 to eight banks, and draw the boundaries in a more equitable 
manner than is currently the case. Congress may want to consider 
whether the System should be consolidated into less than eight banks.

    Question. When you were leading the Federal Housing Finance Agency, 
what efforts did you undertake to review the Federal Home Loan Bank 
System?

    Answer. I began an internal legal and program review of the System, 
which was ongoing when I left the agency. I also conducted internal 
resolution exercises on the System, so that in the event of the failure 
of a FHLBank, FHFA would be able to resolve that entity without any 
taxpayer assistance. Those exercises also allowed FHFA to clearly 
identity which other financial institutions would be adversely impacted 
by the failure of a FHLBank. The results were shared with FSOC and the 
relevant primary regulators. I understood the orderly resolution of a 
FHLBank would require the coordination of FHFA with other financial 
regulators. Hence, we began an interagency dialogue on those issues. I 
also began a process of visiting each of the System banks and speaking 
with their full board of directors, as well as visiting individual AHP 
developments. Unfortunately, COVID interrupted those visits.

    Question. What recommendations do you recommend Congress consider 
regarding the Federal Home Loan Banks?

    Answer. One of the most concerning aspects of the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Act is its allowance of FHLBs to hold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
mortgage-backed securities in unlimited amounts. Asset concentration 
risk is financial regulation safety 101, yet Congress has tied FHFA's 
hands in this regard. Such first creates a massive interconnectedness 
in our financial system. The very picture of systemic risk. Secondly, 
such allows the FHLBs to accumulate massive investment portfolios. Too 
much of the system has come to resemble a version of Bear Stearns: 
long-dated, interest-rate sensitive assets funded by short-term 
borrowing. This is a recipe for disaster. Congress should prohibit the 
system from holding any Fannie or Freddie debt, giving the system 5 
years to dispose of its current holdings. Congress should also 
explicitly limit the ability of the FHLBs to retain large investment 
portfolios. While large investment portfolios were initially grown to 
cover the system's REFCORP obligations, over time they have grown to 
provide an income source for dividends to members. In order to 
eliminate this incentive, Congress should either tightly cap or 
outright eliminate the System's ability to pay dividends.

    The advance activities of the FHLB system have come to be dominated 
the largest commercial banks. These institutions already have ready 
access to the capital markets, and hence, are not in need of access to 
the FHLB system. To keep the system focused on community institutions, 
Congress should limit System membership to depositories with under $10 
billion in assets (can be indexed to inflation, if so desired). Of the 
4,746 depositories currently insured by the FDIC, such a change would 
only exclude the largest 158 institutions from system membership.

    To further reduce confusion as to the nature of the System debt, 
Congress should subject System debt to the registration requirements of 
the Securities Act of 1933. This should not be disruptive, as most of 
the System's current debt would qualify as either private placements or 
for a shelf registration. Congress should also remove any other System 
exemptions from the securities laws and as well as ending any 
preferences for purchase by the Federal Reserve or Treasury.

    Congress should resist any calls to expand membership. In fact, 
Congress should tighten membership. First CDFI membership should be 
limited to those CDFI's that are insured depositories and regulated by 
the FDIC. Congress should also explicitly limit the loophole of 
``captive'' membership, where a larger company, such as a REIT, 
purchases an insurance company or CDFI, as an avenue for membership. 
Congress may also want to limit insurance company membership to those 
insurance companies that are subsidiaries of financial service holding 
companies.

    Lastly, rather than expanding the current Affordable Housing 
Program (AHP), Congress should eliminate AHP and substitute a direct 
fee on debt issuance. This fee would remit to the Treasury to be 
allocated by Congress for public purposes. The current AHP framework 
provides the appearance of meeting some vague public purpose without 
the reality. Congress should also reject any calls to expand the 
System's purposes. If interest groups would like to see an expansion of 
public spending on housing and community development activities, we 
have an entire Cabinet level department devoted to such, as well as 
activities at other agencies, such as the Commerce Department. Any 
additional funding should be provided via the congressional 
appropriations process, as so clearly intended under the Constitution.

                                 ______
                                 
                Prepared Statement of Hon. Mike Crapo, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Idaho
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You have well laid out the issue today. I 
appreciated not only your focus on this issue and supply-side 
solutions, but the fact that you recognized the bipartisan work we do 
in this committee and identified this as one of the key areas where we 
ought to be able to accomplish similar solutions.

    When this committee held a hearing on housing last summer, we had 
just learned that consumer price inflation had spiked to 9.1 percent, 
the highest in more than 40 years. The shelter component of the 
consumer price index was up 5.6 percent relative to a year earlier, and 
rents were up by nearly 6 percent.

    Unfortunately for renters and potential homeowners, the mislabeled 
``Inflation Reduction Act'' did nothing to address inflation and rising 
costs, but is in fact projected to exacerbate inflation in the near 
term.

    As the Federal Reserve attempts to control price growth with 
interest rate hikes, mortgage rates have hit highs not seen since the 
2008 financial crisis and are now hovering at 6.5 percent, slowing 
investment in the housing market and pricing many buyers in Idaho and 
all across the country out of the market. January's overall consumer 
price inflation is still significantly above normal, hitting 6.4 
percent annually. Shelter accounts for over half of the core increase, 
up 7.9 percent over the last year. Inflation is also eating away at the 
value of wages; real hourly earnings have declined 1.8 percent.

    Across the country, Americans are faced with unaffordable housing. 
Specifically, lower-income Americans are facing a shortage of about 7 
million affordable homes, and the supply of affordable housing 
continues to fall short of demand, with the gap increasing every year. 
One tax tool used to address the supply shortage and incentivize 
builders to create affordable homes is the Low-Income Housing Tax 
Credit (LIHTC). It is responsible for generating a majority of all 
affordable rental housing created in the U.S. today and generally 
enjoys bipartisan support in Congress.

    Several members of this committee have been working across the 
aisle to find affordable housing solutions. Senator Wyden has well 
described those efforts. Proposals include changes to LIHTC and new tax 
incentives. Senators Young and Cantwell, as well as several other 
members, are working to reintroduce the Affordable Housing Credit 
Improvement Act, which would bolster LIHTC for developing and 
preserving affordable housing. Senators Young and Cardin introduced the 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act, which would create a Federal tax 
credit to finance home building and rehabilitation in urban and rural 
neighborhoods. Other Finance Committee members have expressed interest 
in addressing the affordable housing supply shortage, including one of 
our newest members, Senator Blackburn. Additionally, Senator Wyden has 
introduced the Decent, Affordable, Safe Housing for All--or DASH--Act.

    Thank you all for your hard work.

    Targeted tax policies such as LIHTC are an important part of 
solving housing affordability and supply issues, but we must also 
address the drivers that are raising the cost of housing generally. 
When input and regulatory costs are high, LIHTC is less effective.

    Zoning laws and regulatory barriers are often uncoordinated, 
unnecessary, or overly cumbersome, and can ultimately work against the 
goal of providing affordable housing by creating excessive development 
costs. States and localities with the most restrictive zoning laws and 
regulatory barriers often have the most severe shortages in affordable 
housing as a result. Federal, State, and local leaders must work 
together to reduce regulatory barriers, and they should look to success 
stories around the country.

    In Houston, local leaders reduced the minimum lot size from 5,000 
to 1,400 square feet. After initial success, the reform was expanded to 
cover the entire city. Due, in part, to the ability for small-lot 
construction, Houston's median house price is below the national 
median. Further, it is estimated the average Houston household 
benefited from the reform by roughly $18,000. In order to make it 
economically viable to build across price points in the market, these 
supply-side factors need to be addressed. Overall tax costs, 
regulations, supply chain bottlenecks, and financing expenses all enter 
into investment decisions.

    Overall, there is no better cure to housing affordability than a 
healthy, thriving economy. The pro-growth policies in Republicans' 2017 
tax reform led to one of the strongest economies in decades: low 
unemployment, a low poverty rate, strong wage growth, high median 
incomes, increased investment, and record Federal tax revenues. We 
should preserve these policies and explore additional opportunities to 
promote growth, increase investment, and encourage research and 
development in the United States.

    I look forward to discussing with today's witnesses ways to ensure 
that affordable housing is accessible and that the American dream of 
home ownership remains attainable.

               Prepared Statement of Sharon Wilson Geno, 
            President, National Multifamily Housing Council
    For more than 30 years, NMHC and the NAA have partnered to provide 
a single voice for America's apartment industry. Our combined 
memberships are engaged in all aspects of the apartment industry, 
including ownership, development, management, and finance. NMHC 
represents the principal officers of the apartment industry's largest 
and most prominent firms. As a federation of 141 State and local 
affiliates, NAA encompasses over 95,000 members of all sizes 
representing more than 11.6 million apartment homes globally.

    We appreciate the Senate Finance Committee's continued focus on 
housing issues and, in particular, the rental housing sector and the 
many challenges that face our industry and its residents. As the 
committee conducts this hearing, we offer our perspective on efforts 
needed to promote workable and sustainable policies to address our 
Nation's housing challenges. Our ultimate goal is to be sure that 
apartment providers can meet long-term housing needs of the 38.9 
million Americans who live in apartment homes and continue to make 
significant contributions to the growth of our economy, which currently 
stands at $3.4 trillion annually.\1\<SUP>,</SUP> \2\

        the challenge: decades-long underbuilding has resulted 
                 in unaffordability in many communities
    There is no doubt that America is facing a housing affordability 
crisis. Challenges are different from community to community and State 
to State, but facts are facts. For decades, America has witnessed the 
escalating challenge created by demographic shifts, short-sighted 
public policy decisions, and economic changes culminating in the 
inability of an increasing number of families, seniors, and people with 
disabilities to rent, buy, or maintain affordable homes that meet their 
needs.

    Today, in more and more communities, hardworking Americans are 
unable to rent homes due to increased costs driven by a lack of supply, 
barriers to development, and regulatory burdens. The total share of 
cost-burdened households (those paying more than 30 percent of their 
income on housing) increased steadily from 28.0 percent in 1985 to 36.9 
percent in 2021 and is growing, while others have been priced out of 
communities altogether.\3\ This is not sustainable, particularly in a 
period of high inflation. Wage stagnation in conjunction with barriers 
to new supply--for instance, onerous regulatory hurdles, antiquated and 
often discriminatory zoning and land use policies at the local level, 
and NIMBYism (``the behavior of someone who does not want something to 
be built or done near where they live, although it does need to be 
built or done somewhere''\4\)--has led the Nation to this juncture. It 
has taken many decades to get to this point, and it will take time to 
reverse these trends, but it is critical that we start now to enact a 
number of different policies that will incentivize new housing 
production.

    In addition, more recent economic instability poses a serious 
threat to the ability of housing providers to leverage the private-
market capital necessary to generate needed housing. The Federal 
Reserve's rate increases have contributed to a period of economic 
volatility, which is driving up the cost of building new housing, 
discouraging new investment and pushing some in our sector out of the 
market altogether. According to NMHC's January 2023 Quarterly Survey of 
Apartment Market Conditions:\5\

          More than three-quarters of respondents (82 percent) 
        reported declining sales volumes from 3 months prior;
          Nearly two-thirds (63 percent) indicated equity financing 
        was less available; and,
          Fully 60 percent said it was a worse time for mortgage 
        borrowing compared to 3 months earlier.

    Further, we are still making up for lost housing not produced 
during the 2008 financial crisis. Thus, we do not have enough housing 
to keep up with demand. Research from NMHC and NAA estimates the U.S. 
needs to build 4.3 million more apartments by 2035 to make up for 
decades-long underbuilding, meet future demand, and avoid increasingly 
expensive housing.\6\

Rental Housing by 2035.'' (2022), https://weareapartments.org/pdf/NMHC-

pdf.

    While demand for apartments in recent months has softened as a 
result of economic uncertainty fueled by high inflation, we caution 
that this is only a short-term trend. We simply do not have enough 
homes to meet this long-term demand--this housing shortage is immense, 
widespread, and enduring. Some communities will see temporary softness 
for higher-income households in new Class A buildings, but these units 
will not filter down to the millions of lower- and middle-income 
households, unless those households choose or are forced to become more 
cost-burdened.
                     the solution: supply + subsidy
    It is imperative we keep building new housing despite this 
temporary demand lull if we want to avoid large rent increases in the 
future and have sufficient housing that meets the need of our growing 
population in the years to come. The apartment industry stands ready to 
help meet the rising need for attainably priced rental housing, but we 
cannot do it alone. It requires a strong partnership between the 
private and public sectors. First and foremost, we must seek solutions 
that support increased supply--at all price points. Without investment 
in our Nation's housing, we will continue to face housing instability 
and affordability challenges now and in the future. In addition to 
increased supply, we must also deliver short-term solutions to renter 
populations that need support. Increased subsidies and emergency 
housing support for those of modest means are critical to keeping 
struggling renters and their families afloat.

    While there is no one silver bullet, a multifaceted approach can be 
effective in easing current market constraints. As such, we believe the 
following actions will help further our shared affordability goals. 
These policy proposals are presented in two parts. The first considers 
tax policy proposals that are within the jurisdiction of the Finance 
Committee. The second provides analysis of actions that the broader 
Congress should consider.
             tax policy proposals to promote housing supply
    While it will take a variety of tax and non-tax approaches to 
increase supply, the rental housing industry believes tax policy can 
play a critical role in this regard. To this end, we strongly urge 
Congress to:

          Expand and enhance the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit;
          Enact the Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit to support 
        workforce housing;
          Enhance Opportunity Zones to incentivize the rehabilitation 
        and preservation of multifamily buildings;
          Encourage the adaptive reuse of underutilized commercial 
        properties into multifamily housing; and
          Promote the rehabilitation of multifamily housing located 
        near transit.

    Each of these proposals is briefly described in the pages that 
follow, and we note that many have bipartisan support.
Expanding and Enhancing the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit
    The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is a public/private 
partnership that leverages Federal dollars with private investment to 
produce affordable rental housing and stimulate new economic 
development in many communities. Between its inception in 1986 and 
2021, the LIHTC program has, according to the A Call To Invest in Our 
Neighborhoods (ACTION) Campaign, developed or preserved 3.74 million 
apartments, served 8.06 million low-income households, supported 6.08 
million jobs for 1 year, generated $239 billion in tax revenue, and 
produced $688.5 billion in wages and income.\7\ The LIHTC program 
provides critical support to the Nation's affordable housing production 
but could be made even more impactful.

    NMHC and NAA strongly support the Affordable Housing Credit 
Improvement Act of 2021 (AHCIA) (S. 1136/H.R. 2573). Introduced last 
Congress by Senators Cantwell, Young, Wyden, and Portman (and 
cosponsored by Finance Committee Senators Blackburn, Bennet, Brown, 
Cardin, Carper, Casey, Cortez Masto, Hassan, Menendez, Stabenow, and 
Whitehouse), this bipartisan bill would, among other provisions, make 
permanent the now-expired 12.5-percent increase in LIHTC authority for 
2018-2021 to enable the production of new units and further augment 
credit authority by 50 percent. Additionally, the bill would lower the 
private activity bond financing threshold to 25 percent from 50 percent 
required to receive the full amount of 4-percent Low-Income Housing Tax 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credits.

    In December 2022, it was estimated that over the 2023-2032 period, 
1.93 million additional affordable homes, housing 4.5 million low-
income people, could be financed across the United States and 
territories by AHICA provisions expanding LIHTC authority and reducing 
the Private Activity Bond financing threshold to 25 percent. Over that 
period, this enhanced financing could also create nearly 3 million 
jobs, more than $335 billion in wages and business income, and $116 
billion in tax revenue.\8\

    Finally, we would encourage the Finance Committee to consider 
increasing the Private Activity Bond volume cap to enhance the 
utilization of 4-percent Low-
Income Housing Tax Credits. According to March 2023 data by Tiber 
Hudson and Novogradac, 18 States and Washington, DC, are 
oversubscribed. Authorizing these States to issue additional Private 
Activity Bonds would enable the financing of additional 4-percent LIHTC 
projects.\9\

 Enacting the Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit (MIHTC) to Support 
        Workforce Housing
    Housing affordability is an issue threatening the financial well-
being of both 
middle-income and low-income households across the Nation. According to 
the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Market Absorption, the median asking 
rent for apartment units completed in the third quarter of 2022 was 
$1,805, a 27-percent increase from the same period in 2017.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ U.S. Census Bureau, Survey of Market Absorption.

    For a renter to afford one of those units at the 30 percent of 
income standard, they would need to earn at least $72,200 annually. 
Moreover, the share of apartment households making between $30,000 and 
$74,999 with at least moderate housing cost burdens rose from 45 
percent to 53 percent, while the share with severe burdens rose from 9 
percent to 13 percent.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ NMHC tabulations of American Community Survey microdata.

    Furthermore, based on 2021 American Community Survey data, we 
estimate that more than a quarter (26 percent) of middle-income renter 
households (81-100 percent of HUD Area Median Income) were cost 
burdened in 2021. This amounts to more than 1.2 million households.\12\

    Accordingly, this is an issue impacting those workers who comprise 
the very fabric of strong communities nationwide, including teachers, 
firefighters, nurses, and police officers whose wages are not keeping 
pace with costs. Tax policies to spur the production of multifamily 
housing targeted to middle-income Americans should be a part of any 
legislation that seeks to address housing affordability on a 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
comprehensive basis.

    We urge Congress to enact the Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit 
(MIHTC) that Senate Finance Committee Chair Wyden introduced last 
Congress as part of the Decent, Affordable, Safe Housing for All (DASH) 
Act (S. 2820) to address the shortage of workforce housing available to 
American households. Estimates indicate the proposal could finance 
344,000 affordable rental homes over 10 years while also creating 
560,400 jobs and generating over $63.4 billion in wages and business 
income.\13\

income-housing-tax-credit-would-finance-344000-affordable-rental-homes-
households.

    Designed to complement the successful LIHTC program, the MIHTC 
program would enable State housing agencies to issue credit allocations 
to developers that would subsequently be sold to investors. Investors 
would receive a dollar-for-dollar reduction in their Federal tax 
liability over a 15-year period, and developers would invest the equity 
raised to build apartments. The equity raised would cover 50 percent of 
the cost of constructing qualifying units. A development project 
eligible for MIHTC would have to set aside 60 percent of units for 
households earning 100 percent or less of Area Median Income and must 
be kept affordable for up to 30 years.
 Enhancing Opportunity Zones to Incentivize Rehabilitation of Housing 
        Units
    Under the leadership of Senators Tim Scott and Booker and enacted 
as part of tax reform legislation in 2017, Opportunity Zones are 
designed to provide tax incentives for investments in distressed 
communities. Opportunity Zones hold great promise for the development 
of multifamily housing.

    While we expect the Opportunity Zones program to be beneficial in 
spurring the production of new multifamily housing, the program could 
be improved with respect to incentives for the rehabilitation and 
preservation of existing multifamily units. Current regulations work 
against using this program to rehabilitate properties for affordable 
housing since the developer must double their basis in the property 
without consideration of the cost of land. In many cases, such 
significant renovation is unnecessary to preserve buildings and units 
that might otherwise be lost to obsolescence.

    Congress should leverage the Opportunity Zones program to promote 
the rehabilitation and preservation of multifamily units and, thereby, 
positively address the shortage of apartment units. NMHC and NAA 
recommend that Congress consider statutory modifications to reduce the 
100-percent basis increase excluding land necessary to qualify a 
multifamily rehabilitation project for Opportunity Zone purposes. It is 
noteworthy that to qualify for an allocation under the LIHTC, owners 
must commit to rehabilitations valued at the greater of: (1) 20 percent 
of adjusted basis of a building; or (2) $6,000 ($7,900 in 2023 as 
adjusted for inflation) per low-income unit.
 Encouraging the Adaptive Reuse of Underutilized Commercial Properties 
        into Multifamily Housing
    Given the Nation's shortage of affordable rental housing, many are 
considering turning unused and underutilized commercial real estate 
structures, including offices, hotels, and retail spaces into housing. 
Not only would such repurposing help address the Nation's housing 
supply challenge, but it would also create jobs and boost local 
property tax revenues.

    A segment of commercial real estate space could potentially be 
available to be converted into housing. According to a February 2023 
study by the Urban Land Institute's Center for Real Estate and 
Economics and Capital Markets and sponsored by the NMHC Research 
Foundation and the Urban Land Institute's Terwilliger Center for 
Housing, Behind the Facade: The Feasibility of Converting Commercial 
Real Estate to Multifamily, ``JLL Research found that between the onset 
of the pandemic and the second quarter of 2022, buildings delivered in 
2015 or later had 86.8 million square feet of net absorption, while 
pre-2015 buildings had net negative absorption of 246.5 million square 
feet. Almost 80 percent of the negative net absorption was in buildings 
delivered in 1980 and earlier.''\14\

Land Institute, 2023, pg. 5, https://www.nmhc.org/globalassets/
research--insight/research-reports/conversion/behind-the-
facade_conversion-report.pdf.

    Changing consumer preferences and online shopping are also changing 
the real estate landscape. Estimates show between several hundred 
million and 1 billion square feet of surplus and obsolete retail space. 
Slower post-pandemic business travel is also challenging a portion of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
the Nation's hotel stock.

    Unfortunately, converting commercial real estate into housing can 
be extremely challenging and can be more complicated than typical 
ground-up development. Costs associated with property acquisition and 
conversion, including addressing structural building issues (e.g., 
beams, columns, ceiling heights, utilities, and floor layouts), can 
quickly add up and make the difference between a viable or unfeasible 
project. This is in addition to other barriers that may arise, 
including permitting, zoning rules, and NIMBYism.

    A Federal tax incentive to encourage property conversions would be 
greatly beneficial in helping to overcome these obstacles and spurring 
additional housing supply. In addition, it would help revitalize 
distressed commercial property and stabilize the surrounding 
communities. Notably, Senator Stabenow, joined by Senator Brown as a 
cosponsor, last Congress introduced the Revitalizing Downtowns Act (S. 
2511) that would provide a 20-percent tax credit to convert office 
buildings into other uses, including residential use. This Congress, 
Representative Gomez has introduced this legislation (H.R. 419) in the 
House of Representatives.

    The multifamily industry is interested in working with Congress on 
this type of proposal but would like to see it modified to, among other 
things, enable other types of commercial properties (e.g., shopping 
centers and hotels) to qualify for the tax incentive; ensure REITs 
could utilize the benefit; and clarify that the credit does not reduce 
other tax benefits including the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.

    Additionally, the multifamily industry would encourage Congress to 
explore whether tax-exempt Private Activity Bonds could be used as a 
means of promoting adaptive reuse. Housing finance agencies could issue 
such bonds to help facilitate adaptive reuse of underutilized 
properties, particularly in areas that have a plan to track 
discriminatory land use policies as envisioned by the Yes In My 
Backyard Act (YIMBY) Act (S. 1614/H.R. 3198) introduced last Congress 
by Senators Young and Schatz and Representatives Kilmer and 
Hollingsworth and strongly supported by NMHC and NAA.
 Promoting the Rehabilitation of Multifamily Housing Located Near 
        Transit
    NMHC and NAA strongly support bipartisan legislation that would 
provide a new tool aimed at encouraging greater community development 
and inclusive neighborhood revitalization. Introduced last Congress by 
House Ways and Means Committee member Blumenauer and cosponsored by 
committee members Kelly, Kildee, and LaHood, the Revitalizing 
Economies, Housing and Business Act (REHAB Act) (H.R. 1483) provides:

          A 15-percent tax rehabilitation credit for buildings that 
        are more than 50 years old, not certified historic structures, 
        and are within one-half of a mile of a public transportation 
        station;
          Expanded credit eligibility to include building expansion on 
        the same block; and
          A bonus credit of 25 percent for expenses related to public 
        infrastructure upgrades and rent-restricted housing.
          additional recommendations for congress to consider
    While changes to tax laws are especially important to spurring 
affordable housing, the multifamily industry also urges Congress to 
consider additional proposals and issues relative to the production of 
multifamily housing. Specifically, we urge Congress to consider 
proposals that:

          Lower regulatory hurdles;
          Ease construction costs and delays;
          Deploy the Housing Supply Action Plan (e.g., reward 
        jurisdictions that have reformed zoning and land-use policies 
        with higher scores in certain Federal grant processes and 
        deploy new financing mechanisms to build and preserve more 
        housing where financing gaps currently exist);
          Reform and fully fund the section 8 Housing Choice Voucher 
        Program; and
          Sustain funding for Federal housing support and 
        affordability programs.
Lower Regulatory Hurdles
    Regulatory, administrative, and political obstacles at all levels 
of government prevent us from delivering the housing our country so 
desperately needs. Yet, even in communities that want new rental 
housing development, there are numerous barriers that can drive up 
costs or halt development altogether.

    These costs and barriers can account for an average of 40.6 percent 
of multifamily development costs further impacting affordability--
according to research released by NMHC and the National Association of 
Home Builders (NAHB).\15\ This research illustrates how unnecessary and 
duplicative regulation can negatively impact developing housing that is 
affordable. Although smart regulations can play an important role in 
ensuring the health and well-being of the American public, the NMHC-
NAHB research found that many regulations can go far beyond those 
important goals and impose costly mandates on developers that drive 
housing costs higher, including via NIMBYism.

Development, https://www.nmhc.org/globalassets/research--insight/
research-reports/cost-of-regulations/2022-nahb-nmhc-cost-of-
regulations-report.pdf.

    NIMBYism and antiquated, discriminatory land use policies coupled 
with onerous local requirements (like building code provisions that 
have nothing to do with health or safety, land or infrastructure 
donation requirements, and ill-fitting transportation and parking 
mandates) add to project costs and, ultimately, the rents American 
families pay. Three quarters of respondents to the NMHC-NAHB research 
reported they had encountered NIMBY opposition to a proposed 
development. This added an average of 5.6 percent to the total 
development cost and delayed the completion of those developments by an 
average of 7.4 months.\16\

    Easing regulations could go a long way to address the housing 
affordability challenges faced by communities across the Nation, 
especially at a time of high inflation and other cost of living 
challenges. It is important to keep in mind that rental housing 
requires significant operating expenses to maintain quality. According 
to research by NAA, only 9 cents of every dollar of rent goes back to 
the owner as profit, including the many apartment owners who are 
themselves small businesses and rely on this revenue to make ends 
meet.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

dollar_of_rent_2022.pdf.

    We urge Congress to redouble its efforts to incentivize States and 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
localities to:

          Reduce barriers to housing production and rehabilitation;
          Streamline and fast track the entitlement and approval 
        process;
          Provide density bonuses and other incentives for developers 
        to include workforce units in their properties;
          Enable ``by-right'' zoning and create more fully entitled 
        parcels;
          Defer taxes and other fees for a set period of time;
          Lower construction costs by contributing underutilized 
        buildings and raw land; and
          Encourage higher-density development near jobs and 
        transportation.

    NMHC and NAA strongly support the Yes In My Backyard Act (S. 1614/
H.R. 3198), introduced in the last Congress by Senators Young and 
Schatz and Representatives Kilmer and Hollingsworth and due to be 
reintroduced in the 118th Congress. This legislation requires 
recipients of Community Development Block Grants to provide information 
on how they are reducing local barriers to housing development. This 
will focus attention on the critical issue of enabling greater 
development of housing across the country.

    Policymakers, at all levels of government, should also avoid the 
lure of ``quick fix'' regulations such as rent control or similar rent 
stabilization laws that do nothing to address the underlying supply 
shortage. Such policies do not create a single additional home and 
eventually harm the very people they purport to help by discouraging 
new apartment housing construction and limiting the financial resources 
owners have to maintain existing communities. Also, rent control 
proposals are not targeted at those most in need of affordable housing, 
thus incentivizing those who could otherwise afford an unrestricted 
unit to remain in place. Past experiments with rent control have been 
shown time and time again to result in unhealthy conditions and 
deteriorating neighborhoods.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expansion on Tenants, Landlords, and Inequality: Evidence from San 
Francisco, American Economic Review 2019. https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/
pdfplus/10.1257/aer.20181289.

    Notably, NAA conducted interviews with professionals who own, 
manage, or develop rental housing properties in Santa Barbara/Santa 
Ana, CA, Portland/Eugene, OR, and St. Paul, MN, and garnered findings 
buttressing the conclusion that rent control policies negatively impact 
investment in existing and future multifamily housing.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ One of the key findings from that research was that owners and 
operators reported that their plans to invest in or develop the market 
dramatically shifted after rent control laws were put into effect: more 
than two-thirds of housing providers have reduced or expect to reduce 
development or investment plans as a result of rent-control policies; 
and over half have considered selling off properties. This is clearly 
seen when building permit applications dropped by 80 percent in St. 
Paul when its rent-control initiative passed during a period where 
building permits were increasing significantly elsewhere around the 
country. Additionally, NAA's interviews reveal that the majority of 
housing providers have had to or expect to defer maintenance and 
improvement projects in jurisdictions where rent control is enacted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ease Rising Construction Costs and Delays
    As we look for solutions to the Nation's housing supply challenges, 
we must also recognize the immense, practical pressures on apartment 
development and construction that impact our ability to deliver new 
housing units. Following extreme, 
pandemic-fueled volatility in product costs, supply chain stability, 
and staffing constraints, the apartment construction and renovation 
pipeline has seen some moderation, yet continues to face difficult 
conditions. Eighty-four percent of respondents reported construction 
delays in NMHC's December 2022 Quarterly Survey of Apartment 
Construction and Development Activity. Fifty-seven percent reported 
experiencing repricing increases in projects at an average rate of 8 
percent. The availability of construction financing, or lack thereof, 
continues to be of primary concern, as 29 percent of respondents cited 
this as a contributing factor to delayed starts. Additionally, 30 
percent of respondents attributed delays to materials sourcing and 
delivery challenges.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ https://www.nmhc.org/research-insight/nmhc-construction-
survey/quarterly-survey-of-apartment-construction-development-activity-
december-2022/.

    Apartment builders and developers also continue to see escalations 
in materials costs and mixed labor conditions. The prices of a range of 
critical building materials and equipment continue to rise, including 
exterior finishes and roofing, electrical components, appliances, and 
insulation. In addition, 36 percent of respondents reported that 
construction labor costs increased more than expected during Q4 2022, 
up from 21 percent in the previous quarter. Forty-six percent of 
respondents said that costs increased as expected, while only 5 percent 
said costs did not increase, down from 11 percent in September.
Deploy the Housing Supply Action Plan
    We applaud the Biden administration for recognizing the Nation's 
critical shortage of affordable housing and developing the Housing 
Supply Action Plan, a comprehensive package of regulatory and 
legislative measures to address the supply demand imbalance.

    We urge Congress to work with the administration to implement 
provisions in the Housing Supply Action Plan issued in May 2022 that 
aim to address the myriad challenges to the development of new housing, 
such as:

          Reward jurisdictions that have reformed zoning and land-use 
        policies with higher scores in certain Federal grant processes, 
        for the first time at scale;
          Deploy new financing mechanisms to build and preserve more 
        housing where financing gaps currently exist;
          Expand and improve existing forms of Federal financing, 
        including for affordable multifamily development and 
        preservation; and
          Work with the private sector to address supply chain 
        challenges and improve building techniques.

    While we support the administration's Housing Supply Action Plan 
and worked in good faith with the administration on its Resident-
Centered Housing Challenge (both NMHC and NAA made commitments as part 
of the Challenge), we are concerned the recently released White House 
``Blueprint for a Renter's Bill of Rights'' will create potentially 
duplicative and confusing Federal regulations that interfere with State 
and local laws meant to govern the housing provider and resident 
relationship. These efforts will do nothing to address the Nation's 
housing shortage or households that are struggling financially and 
could, in fact, discourage much-
needed private-market investment in new housing construction.
 Reform and Fully Fund the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program
    As the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us, the most valuable short-
term policy solution to the housing affordability crisis is rental 
assistance. The section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program has long 
served as America's primary method for aiding 2.1 million low-income 
households with rental assistance and has helped millions of Americans 
find homes in communities near good schools, jobs, and transportation 
services. Critical reforms to the program are urgently needed to expand 
private industry participation and improve housing opportunity for 
millions of American families.

    The section 8 program has additional untapped potential to help 
address our Nation's affordable housing needs. Unfortunately, the 
program has also been plagued with a flawed and inconsistent funding 
system that has undermined private-sector confidence in the program. 
The program's potential success is also limited by too many inefficient 
and duplicative requirements, which prevent private housing providers 
from being able to accept vouchers.

    Despite previous congressional and administrative attempts at 
improving the program, it remains overly burdensome. Our groups, once 
again, call on Congress to pass the Choice in Affordable Housing Act of 
2023 (S. 32), introduced by Senators Coons and Cramer. The legislation 
empowers public housing authorities (PHAs) to offer incentive payments 
for housing providers that operate in areas of opportunity; creates 
security deposit assistance to cover repairs and damages and to help 
participants better manage their risk; enables PHAs to hire ``landlord 
liaisons'' to improve communication and finally, would importantly 
streamline the costly and time-
consuming property inspection process.

    While more can certainly be done to reform the section 8 program, 
the Choice in Affordable Housing Act is a critical step for Congress to 
take to expand housing options to American families in need of housing 
that is affordable.
Sustain Funding for Federal Housing Support and Affordability Programs
    Alongside inadequate funding and bureaucratic barriers in the 
section 8 HCV program, for too many years, Federal funding for one of 
the primary housing programs serving low-income households has been 
virtually flat or declining. This has translated into waiting lists for 
support that can last years, pushes too many Americans into substandard 
housing that only exacerbates housing and racial inequities, and harms 
the economic potential of individuals and their overall communities.

    For decades, we have advocated for increased funding for multiple 
critical programs that focus on housing affordability, (in addition to 
the section 8 HCV program), such as Project Based Rental Assistance 
(PBRA), Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD), Homelessness Programs, 
HOME, and Community Development Block Grants (CDGB), the Housing Trust 
Fund, FHA Multifamily Programs, Rural Housing Programs, and others.

    Programs like section 8 and PBRA allow low-income families to rent 
market-rate housing, taking advantage of the broad offering of 
privately owned and operated properties in a given market. Programs 
like HOME, CDBG, FHA Multifamily and Rural Housing programs allow 
developers to address financing shortfalls often associated with 
affordable housing properties and stimulate meaningful development and 
preservation activity as a result. Homelessness Assistance Programs 
provide funding to serve individuals and families across the Nation who 
are affected by homelessness, while section 811 and 202 programs 
provide assistance for elderly and persons with disabilities. These 
programs, in totality, are some of the most effective and proven means 
to increase housing supply across the Nation, assist our most 
vulnerable families find stable housing and are worthy of bipartisan 
Congressional support.
                               conclusion
    On behalf of the multifamily industry and the millions of family, 
single, senior, student, veteran, and disabled households we serve, we 
applaud the committee's efforts to explore solutions to the Nation's 
most significant housing challenges. The increased supply of 
multifamily rental housing at all price points in all markets will play 
a vital role in promoting economic growth, encouraging household 
stability for all American households, and we look forward to working 
together as legislation to further these efforts is considered.

               low-income housing tax credit (lihtc)
    The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is a public/private 
partnership that leverages Federal dollars with private investment to 
produce affordable rental housing and stimulate new economic 
development in many communities. Between its inception in 1986 and 
2019, the LIHTC program has according to the ACTION Campaign financed 
3.7 million apartments and served approximately 8 million households. 
This development has supported 5.68 million jobs for 1 year while 
generating $643 billion in wages and business income and $223 billion 
in Federal, State, and local tax revenues.

    Under the program, State housing agencies issue credit allocations 
to developers who then sell the credits to investors. Investors receive 
a dollar-for-dollar reduction in their Federal tax liability over a 10-
year period, and developers invest the equity raised to build or 
acquire apartments. This equity allows apartment firms to operate the 
properties at below-market rents for qualifying families. LIHTC-
financed properties must be kept affordable for at least 30 years.

    The LIHTC has two components:

          A 9-percent tax credit that subsidizes 70 percent of new 
        construction and cannot be combined with any additional Federal 
        subsidies.
          A 4-percent tax credit that subsidizes 30 percent of the 
        unit costs in an acquisition of a project and can be paired 
        with additional Federal subsidies.

    Given the Nation's severe shortage of affordable housing, Congress 
in recent years has enacted significant improvements to the LIHTC 
program. In December 2020, Congress established a minimum 4-percent 
credit rate, akin to current law's minimum 9-percent credit rate--so 
that investors may derive its full value. Under prior law, the 4-
percent credit rate floated and was worth considerably less due to low 
interest rates. Additionally, in March 2018, rightly increased LIHTC 
authority by 12.5 percent for 2018-2021. Congress also sensibly 
authorized income averaging so that LIHTC could serve a wider array of 
households.

    Congress should continue to invest in the LIHTC's success by making 
permanent the expired increase in program authority effective in 2018-
2021, as well as further augmenting credit authority by 50 percent. 
Additionally, Congress should lower the bond financing threshold to 25 
percent from 50 percent to receive the full amount of 4-percent Low-
Income Housing Tax Credits.

    The LIHTC has enjoyed broad bipartisan support over the years, and 
Congress sensibly preserved it in the 2017 tax reform bill. It should 
now be strengthened to meet the continued need for affordable housing.

                    middle-income housing tax credit
    The Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit (MIHTC) is a proposal to 
establish a 
public/private partnership that leverages Federal dollars with private 
investment to produce rental housing affordable to our Nation's 
workforce.

    Designed to complement the successful Low-Income Housing Tax Credit 
(LIHTC), the MIHTC program would enable State housing agencies to issue 
credit allocations to developers that would subsequently be sold to 
investors. Investors would receive a dollar-for-dollar reduction in 
their Federal tax liability over a 15-year period, and developers would 
invest the equity raised to build apartments. The equity raised would 
cover 50 percent of the cost of constructing of qualifying units. A 
development project eligible for MIHTC would have to set aside 60 
percent of units for households earning 100 percent or less of Area 
Median Income (AMI) and must be kept affordable for up to 30 years.

    Housing affordability is a significant challenge facing many 
American families. The U.S. needs to build 4.3 million more apartments 
by 2035 to meet the demand for rental housing. This includes 600,000 
units (total apartments) to fill the shortage from underbuilding after 
the 2008 financial crisis. Underproduction of housing has translated to 
higher housing costs--resulting in a decline of 4.7 million affordable 
apartments (monthly rents less than $1,000) from 2015-2020.

    Affordability challenges are not unique to households receiving 
Federal subsidies. In fact, solidly middle-income households are facing 
constraints. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Market 
Absorption, the median asking rent for apartment units completed in the 
third quarter of 2022 was $1,805, a 27-percent increase from the same 
period in 2017. NMHC calculates that for a renter to afford one of 
those units at the 30 percent of income standard, they would need to 
earn at least $72,200 annually. Thus, this issue impacts those 
supporting the very fabric of communities nationwide, including 
teachers, firefighters and nurses.

    The Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit would help build housing that 
is affordable to a wide range of income levels at a time such housing 
is increasingly difficult to afford.
                             adaptive reuse
    Given the Nation's shortage of affordable rental housing, many are 
considering turning unused and underutilized commercial real estate 
structures, including offices, hotels, and retail into housing. Not 
only would such repurposing help address the Nation's housing supply 
challenge, but it would also create jobs and boost local property tax 
revenues.

    A large portion of commercial real estate space could potentially 
be available to be converted into housing.

    According to a February 2023 study sponsored by NMHC and the Urban 
Land Institute's Terwilliger Center for Housing, JLL Research shows 
that between the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the second quarter 
of 2022, office buildings delivered in 2015 or later absorbed 86.8 
million square feet of space. In contrast, pre-2015 office buildings 
had net negative absorption of 246.5 million square feet, 80 percent of 
which was attributable to buildings delivered in 1980 and earlier.

    Changing consumer preferences and online shopping are also changing 
the real estate landscape. Estimates show between several hundred 
million and 1 billion square feet of surplus and obsolete retail space. 
Slower post-pandemic business travel is also challenging a portion of 
the Nation's hotel stock.

    Unfortunately, converting commercial real estate into housing can 
be extremely challenging and more complicated than typical ground-up 
development. Costs associated with property acquisition and conversion, 
including addressing structural building issues (e.g., beams, columns, 
ceiling heights, and floor layouts), can quickly add up and make the 
difference between a viable or unfeasible project. This is in addition 
to other barriers that may arise, including permitting and zoning 
rules.

    A Federal tax incentive to encourage property conversions would be 
greatly beneficial in overcoming these obstacles and spurring 
additional housing supply. In fact, research commissioned by NMHC/NAA 
shows that the Nation will need to build 4.3 million new apartment 
homes by 2035.

    In addition to ensuring a Federal tax incentive is sufficiently 
robust to account for barriers to property conversions, NMHC/NAA 
encourage policymakers to structure a tax incentive to enable:

          All types of commercial property (e.g., offices, retail, and 
        hotels) to qualify for conversion;
          REITs, which own approximately 15 percent of U.S. commercial 
        real estate, to utilize the incentive;
          Other tax incentives, such as the Low-Income Housing Tax 
        Credit and energy tax benefits, to be used in conjunction with 
        the incentive; and
          Government buildings to qualify for conversion.

                       permitting and starts
    During the December 2022 Construction Quarterly Survey, 84 percent 
of respondents reported experiencing construction delays over the last 
3 months. Of those experiencing delays, 84 percent reported 
experiencing permitting delays, and 79 percent reported delays in 
starts. These numbers are fairly similar to those reported last 
quarter, indicating that delays are still a common feature of the 
current development environment.

    Respondents experiencing delayed starts were mostly likely to blame 
permitting, entitlement, and professional services as a cause (46 
percent of respondents, down from 54 percent in the previous quarter). 
Economic uncertainty was cited as the second most common cause for 
delays with 39 percent of respondents reporting. Although this is down 
from 41 percent in the previous quarter, it still indicates that 
Federal monetary policy is influencing the industry at large.

    Additionally, the availability of construction financing, or lack 
thereof, continues to be of primary concern, as 29 percent of 
respondents cited this as a contributing factor to delayed starts. 
Finally, 30 percent of respondents attributed delays to materials 
sourcing and delivery.

    Over the past 3 months, how long, on average, have municipalities 
reported it would take before you receive building permits?

    Thirty-eight percent of respondents reported jurisdictions imposing 
additional project requirements unrelated to actual project 
construction, down from 39 percent in the previous quarter. Most 
notably, respondents mentioned affordability requirements with some 
also citing public infrastructure improvements and open space 
preservation.
                         materials and pricing
    Overall, 76 percent of respondents reported experiencing deals 
repricing over the last 3 months. Of those respondents, 57 percent 
reported that they have experienced deals repricing up, down from 76 
percent of respondents who said the same in September. Of those 
experiencing repricing, either up or down, respondents reported an 8 
percent average increase over the last 3 months, down from 9 percent in 
the previous quarter.

    Respondents reported an average drop in lumber prices for the third 
straight quarter, down 5 percent over the last 3 months. Prices for 
other essential products continued to see increases. Over the last 3 
months, respondents reported a 9 percent average increase in the price 
of exterior finishings and roofing, a 13-percent increase in electrical 
components, a 9-percent increase in appliances, and a 9-percent 
increase in insulation, all larger increases than reported during the 
previous quarter.

    A sizeable portion of respondents reported using alternative brands 
or suppliers to mitigate price increases and supply shortages for 
exterior finishes and roofing (46 percent) as well as for appliances 
(30 percent). For the second straight quarter, respondents reported 
utilizing escalation clauses at lower rates than in the previous 
quarter for all materials. However, unlike the previous quarter, 
respondents reported utilizing design changes much less frequently over 
the last 3 months for all materials. Additionally, the share of 
respondents who reported that this question did not apply to them 
increased significantly for both insulation (an increase from 15 
percent to 32 percent) and lumber (17 percent to 30 percent).

    To gain further understanding of other materials of issue, 
respondents were asked about a more extensive list of common products 
and materials used in development, seen in the table below. As supply 
chains recover, respondents reported using fewer alterations for all 
products compared to last quarter except for copper and brass mill 
shapes and exterior finishes.

                          labor and logistics
    Almost two-thirds of respondents (64 percent) reported construction 
labor availability to be roughly the same as it was 3 months ago. Only 
10 percent of respondents reported construction labor to be more 
available compared to 3 months ago, down from 11 percent in September, 
while 21 percent of respondents reported construction labor to be less 
available, down from 32 percent. All of this might suggest that the 
tight construction labor market is still gradually easing.

    However, 36 percent of respondents reported that construction labor 
costs increased more than expected during Q4 2022, up from 21 percent 
in the previous quarter. Forty-six percent of respondents said that 
costs increased as expected, while only 5 percent said costs did not 
increase, down from 11 percent in September.

    Overall, there was no indication that developers are shifting 
greater attention to any one particular market in search of more 
projects. 46 percent of respondents said that the question was not 
applicable to them, up from 44 percent last quarter. However, 7 percent 
of respondents did say they were seeking out more projects in the 
Southeast (Atlanta, Charlotte, Orlando, etc.) and Southwest (Phoenix, 
etc.). Respondents commonly mentioned cities such as Charlotte, 
Raleigh, Tampa, Nashville, Phoenix, and Las Vegas as places of 
increased interest.

    When asked about regions where they are no longer seeking projects, 
51 percent of respondents said that the question was not applicable to 
them. A small portion of respondents (6 percent) said they were no 
longer seeking out projects in the southwest coast (LA, San Diego, 
etc.) and a select few (4 percent) said the same about the northwest 
coast (San Francisco, Seattle, etc.).
                section 8 housing choice voucher program
    The section 8 housing choice voucher program has long served as 
America's primary method of rental assistance. Funded by the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development and administered by local 
public housing authorities, the program provides subsidized rents for 
qualifying low-income families in private rental housing, including 
apartments.

    This public-private partnership has the potential to be one of the 
most effective means of addressing our Nation's affordable housing 
needs and supporting mixed-income communities. However, the program's 
potential success is limited by too many inefficient and duplicative 
requirements, which discourage private providers from accepting 
vouchers. These include a required three-way lease between the 
provider, resident and the public housing authority; repetitive unit 
inspections; resident eligibility certification; and other regulatory 
paperwork. Collectively, these make it more expensive for a private 
owner to rent to a section 8 voucher holder.

    The program has also been plagued with a flawed and volatile 
funding system that has undermined private sector confidence in the 
program. With Congress focused on austerity measures, insufficient 
funding is expected to be worse in the near-term budget cycles. Common-
sense reforms that could help control costs, improve the program for 
both renters and property owners, and increase private housing 
participation include: putting a reliable funding formula in place; and 
further streamlining the property inspection process.

    It is also imperative for lawmakers to reinforce the voluntary 
nature of the program. Congress specifically made participation 
voluntary because of the regulatory burdens associated with it. 
However, State and Federal Government are enacting laws that make it 
illegal for a private owner to refuse to rent to a section 8 voucher 
holder. Recent examples include ``source of income discrimination'' 
provisions passed by a number of cities. While often well intentioned, 
such mandates are self-defeating because they greatly diminish private-
market investment and reduce the supply of affordable housing.

                                 ______
                                 
        Questions Submitted for the Record to Sharon Wilson Geno
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Mike Crapo
    Question. According to your organization, the National Multifamily 
Housing Council, ``like-kind exchange rules play a crucial role in 
supporting the multifamily sector.'' Since the hearing, the Biden 
administration released its Fiscal Year 2024 budget, which includes a 
proposal to restrict like-kind exchanges.

    Can you describe the impact this proposal would have on the supply 
of affordable housing?

    Question. The Fiscal Year 2024 budget proposal would sharply 
curtail like-kind exchanges by limiting deferral of gain to $500,000 
for single taxpayers and $1 million for married taxpayers filing a 
joint return. This proposal would be devastating on investment in 
multifamily housing, especially affordable rental housing, at a time 
when we need more resources to meet the need for housing. Enacting this 
proposal at this time would be particularly damaging to the multifamily 
capital markets, given the high interest rate environment that is 
already making it challenging to finance new multifamily housing 
building. The like-kind exchange provision's incentive to invest in 
rental housing is particularly critical given research commissioned by 
NMHC and NAA that shows the Nation will need 4.3 million new apartments 
by 2035. Disrupting the capital markets with a significant change in 
tax policy will interrupt new multifamily construction starts and put 
us even further behind in meeting the need for new apartments.

    Like-kind exchange rules play a crucial role in supporting much-
needed investment in the multifamily sector by encouraging investors to 
remain invested in real estate while still allowing them to balance 
their investments to shift resources to more productive properties, 
change geographic location, or diversify or consolidate holdings. 
Without like-kind exchanges, property owners are deterred for tax 
reasons from selling assets that are in need of capital investment. 
Exchange rules allow those owners to transfer the property to new 
owners who can invest the necessary capital to revitalize the asset. 
Thus, like-kind exchange rules facilitate job-creating property 
upgrades and improvements while also ensuring units are preserved and 
not lost from the affordable housing stock. Enacting the budget 
proposal could also result in owners needing to raise rents 
significantly in order to offset the tax consequences and otherwise 
meet their obligations to their lenders and investors.

    In addition, like-kind exchanges are an especially important tool 
for preserving and generating new affordable housing where other 
incentives do not assist. For example, tax incentives like the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit do not apply to land acquisition costs. 
However, section 1031 can enable investors to acquire land for the 
development of new housing, thereby making building affordable units 
more financially feasible.

    Finally, it should be noted that like-kind exchanges benefit other 
commercial real estate segments, including office buildings and 
senior's housing, while generating substantial economic activity. In 
fact, according to May 2022 EY research, Economic contribution of the 
like-kind exchange rules to the US economy in 2021: An update, like-
kind exchanges are a significant contributor to U.S. economic activity. 
In fact, businesses that use like-kind exchanges in 2021 supported 
447,000 jobs while generating $19.4 billion in labor income. Moreover, 
suppliers to entities using like-kind exchanges supported 529,000 jobs 
and $29.1 billion in labor income. On a combined basis, like-kind 
exchanges supported 976,000 jobs, $48.6 billion in labor income and 
generated $97.4 billion in value added to the U.S. economy.

    Question. The Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) serves as a surtax 
on small businesses. The Biden administration's Fiscal Year 2024 budget 
also includes a proposal to subject active business income to the 
surtax.

    Can you explain how expanding the NIIT to include active investment 
income would result in higher rents?

    Answer. The Fiscal Year 2024 budget proposal to subject active 
business income to the Net Investment Income Tax while also raising the 
tax rate to 5 percent would be extremely detrimental to the multifamily 
industry. Assuming the qualified business income deduction expires at 
the end of 2025 and that the Fiscal Year 2024 budget proposal to 
increase the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6 percent and this 
proposal are enacted, the top marginal income tax rate on active 
business income would rise from 29.6 percent to 44.6 percent. This 
would be a staggering 50.7-percent tax increase. In addition, the top 
capital gains rate would soar and more than double from 20 percent to 
44.6 percent under the Biden administration's budget. Both of these 
proposals would significantly reduce investment returns and, therefore, 
incentives to invest in multifamily housing. The reduction in 
investment returns would likely not be borne solely by owners and 
investors. Instead, these tax increases would, in many cases, be passed 
on to residents in the form of higher rents. Finally, it must be noted 
that a tax increase of this magnitude would result in less after-tax 
income available to maintain and upgrade multifamily properties. Tax 
policy should be focused on promoting capital investment and housing 
supply.

    Question. In response to the shortage of affordable housing, some 
States and cities have enacted rent control measures. These approaches 
vary, but they limit a property owner's ability to respond to market-
based rents.

    What effects do these policies have on the quantity and quality of 
housing in tight rental markets?

    Answer. Rent control policies have been proven repeatedly to 
diminish both the supply and quality of multifamily housing. At a time 
that research from NMHC and NAA shows the Nation will need 4.3 million 
new apartments by 2035, rent control is particularly pernicious and 
would actually exacerbate our Nation's housing affordability challenge. 
Indeed, rent control does not create a single additional home and 
eventually harms the very people it purports to help by discouraging 
new apartment housing construction and limiting the financial resources 
owners have to maintain existing communities. Also, rent control 
proposals are not targeted at those most in need of affordable housing, 
thus incentivizing those who could otherwise afford an unrestricted 
unit to remain in place. Past experiments with rent control have been 
shown time and time again to result in unhealthy conditions and 
deteriorating neighborhoods. Research has also found that rent control 
and stabilization efforts deflate property values for surrounding 
homeowners and in turn, tax revenue to states and local communities 
resulting in fewer resources to support schools and other community 
infrastructure investments.

    To provide additional details on these conclusions, I am attaching 
a study completed by the NMHC Research Foundation, The Impacts of Rent 
Control: A Research Review and Synthesis, which examines the research 
literature underpinning these findings.

    I would also add that Lee Seltzer of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York in February 2023 issued a revised staff report, Financing 
Constraints and Maintenance Investments: Evidence from Apartments, that 
is instructive. The paper concludes, ``more financially constrained 
buildings incur more code violations.'' Significantly, based on his 
review of the impact of rent control and rent stabilization programs in 
New York City, Seltzer finds ``code violations increase for affected 
buildings relative to controls, and the effect is concentrated among 
more financially constrained buildings.''

    Finally, NAA conducted interviews with professionals who own, 
manage, or develop rental housing properties in Santa Barbara/Santa 
Ana, CA, Portland/Eugene, OR, and St. Paul, MN, and garnered findings 
buttressing the conclusion that rent control policies negatively impact 
investment in existing and future multifamily housing. One of the key 
findings from that research was that owners and operators reported that 
their plans to invest in or develop the market dramatically shifted 
after rent control laws were put into effect: more than two-thirds of 
housing providers have reduced or expect to reduce development or 
investment plans as a result of rent control policies; and over half 
have considered selling off properties. This is clearly seen when 
building permit applications dropped by 80 percent in St. Paul when its 
rent control initiative passed during a period where building permits 
were increasing significantly elsewhere around the country. 
Additionally, NAA's interviews reveal that the majority of housing 
providers have had to or expect to defer maintenance and improvement 
projects in jurisdictions where rent control is enacted.

    The bottom line is that rent control both constrains housing supply 
and reduces investment in rental housing, harming residents.

                                 ______
                                 
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse
    Question. Rhode Island college graduates of the class of 2020 
graduated with an average of $36,791 in outstanding student loan debt. 
At the same time, the National Association of Realtors reports that 
housing affordability reached the worst level on record in the fourth 
quarter of 2022. Last Congress, I introduced several bills to ease the 
burden of student loan debt, including canceling student loans for 
front-line health-care workers and teachers.

    For those with tens of thousands--and in some cases hundreds of 
thousands--of dollars of student loan debt, how does their debt affect 
their ability to buy a home or afford rent?

    Answer. I would like to answer your first two questions together as 
they relate to one another. The costs of repaying student loans and 
child care can undoubtedly impact the ability to afford rent or 
purchase a home. While I am not an expert on either child care or 
student loan policy, I can say that Congress should focus on policies 
to boost the supply of multifamily housing. More multifamily housing 
would translate into additional housing units that individuals and 
families can rent at a price they can afford. This, in turn, would 
leave individuals and families with added financial resources to 
finance the costs of student loans, childcare, and other priorities.

    Research from NMHC and NAA estimates the U.S. needs to build 4.3 
million more apartments by 2035 to make up for decades-long 
underbuilding, meet future demand, and avoid increasingly expensive 
housing. It is imperative we build this housing, which would better 
guard against large rent increases in the future, as we would have 
sufficient housing that meets the needs of our growing population in 
the years to come. The apartment industry stands ready to help meet the 
rising need for attainably priced rental housing, but we cannot do it 
alone. It requires a strong partnership between the private and public 
sectors. First and foremost, we must seek solutions that support 
increased supply--at all price points. Without investment in our 
Nation's housing, we will continue to face housing instability and 
affordability challenges now and in the future. In addition to 
increased supply, we must also deliver short-term solutions to renter 
populations that need support. Increased subsidies and emergency 
housing support for those of modest means are critical to keeping 
struggling renters and their families afloat.

    Question. Over the past 2 decades, the growing cost of child care 
has outpaced inflation. Child-care costs for Rhode Island families can 
now reach more than $10,000 per year annually for each child, and many 
families now are paying nearly 30 percent of their incomes on child 
care. At the same time, the National Association of Realtors reports 
that housing affordability reached the worst level on record in the 
fourth quarter of 2022. Indeed, according to HousingWorksRI, there are 
currently no communities in Rhode Island where families earning the 
State's median income or less can afford to buy a home, and there's 
only one community--Burrillville--where Rhode Islanders can affordably 
rent.

    How does the high and growing cost of child care affect families' 
ability to buy a home or afford rent?

    Answer. Please see response to question above.

    Question. Rhode Island is the 2nd-densest State in our Union, 
second only to New Jersey.

    For States like mine, where people live in much closer proximity to 
each other than elsewhere in the Nation but which still have a housing 
shortfall, what are the best practices and reforms for encouraging 
affordable housing development while still preserving livable 
communities and local character?

    Answer. The most effective way to address our Nation's housing 
shortage of housing is to significantly increase housing supply. 
Research from NMHC and NAA estimates the U.S. needs to build 4.3 
million more apartments by 2035 to make up for decades-long 
underbuilding, meet future demand, and avoid increasingly expensive 
housing. While I certainly appreciate concerns about preserving the 
local character of communities, without adequate housing supply, 
communities simply cannot support job creation and economic growth. 
Without such job creation and economic activity, communities will 
simply not realize their full potential in our Nation's dynamic 
economy. Thus, communities should adapt to current realities and do all 
that is possible to provide safe and decent housing to all residents at 
a price they can afford.

    A number of States are currently considering or have enacted new 
legislation designed to make the development of more housing units 
easier, incentivize affordable housing development, and prevent the 
implementation of rent control by local communities that will exclude 
those that cannot access housing, including seniors, blue-
collar workers, and people of color. The States of Florida, Colorado, 
and New York currently are contemplating various legislative proposals 
designed to support public-private partnerships that would incentivize 
increasing housing supply, while considering the different local 
conditions that vary from community to community.

    Question. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit is one of the primary 
Federal programs for creating and preserving affordable housing units. 
In Rhode Island, nearly 70 percent of new affordable units are financed 
using LIHTC. Last Congress, I cosponsored Senator Cantwell's Affordable 
Housing Credit Improvement Act, which would make a number of changes to 
LIHTC to further incentivize the building of affordable housing.

    How would the bill bolster our affordable housing supply, and are 
there improvements to the program that weren't included in the bill 
that the Senate should consider?

    Answer. The Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act (AHCIA) would 
boost affordable housing supply through two primary provisions. First, 
it would make permanent the now-expired 12.5-percent increase in Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) authority for 2018-2021 to enable the 
production of new units and further augment credit authority by 50 
percent. Second, the bill would lower the Private Activity Bond 
financing threshold to 25 percent from 50 percent required to receive 
the full amount of 4-percent Low-Income Housing Tax Credits.

    These two provisions in AHCIA would have a significant impact on 
the ability of the LIHTC program to deliver affordable housing. In 
December 2022, Novogradac estimated that over the 2023-2032 period, 
1.93 million additional affordable homes, housing 4.5 million low-
income people, could be financed across the United States and 
territories. by AHICA provisions expanding LIHTC authority and reducing 
the Private Activity Bond financing threshold to 25 percent. Over that 
period, this enhanced financing could also create nearly 3 million 
jobs, more than $335 billion in wages and business income, and $116 
billion in tax revenue.

    In terms of improvements to the LIHTC program, we would be happy to 
discuss options in a number of areas, but most significantly, we would 
support increasing the Private Activity Bond volume cap to enhance the 
utilization of 4-percent Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. According to 
March 2023 data by Tiber, Hudson, and Novogradac, 18 States and 
Washington, DC, are oversubscribed. Authorizing these States to issue 
additional Private Activity Bonds would enable the financing of 
additional 4-percent LIHTC projects. Additionally, Congress could 
consider exempting from the bond cap multifamily bonds used to 
rehabilitate existing Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties. This 
would be beneficial in preserving existing affordable housing units 
that are aging out of affordability restrictions.

    Finally, I would add that Congress should look to other tax 
incentives to boost the supply of multifamily housing. In particular, I 
would urge Congress to:

    (1) Enact the Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit to support workforce 
housing that Senate Finance Committee Chair Wyden has introduced as 
part of the Decent, Affordable, Safe Housing for All (DASH) Act (S. 
680) to address the shortage of workforce housing available to American 
households. Estimates indicate the proposal could finance 344,000 
affordable rental homes over 10 years while also creating 560,400 jobs 
and generating over $63.4 billion in wages and business income;

    (2) Enhance Opportunity Zones to incentivize the rehabilitation and 
preservation of multifamily buildings. In this regard, Congress should 
consider statutory modifications to reduce the 100-percent basis 
increase excluding land necessary to qualify a multifamily 
rehabilitation project for Opportunity Zone purposes; and

    (3) Encourage the adaptive reuse of underutilized commercial 
properties into multifamily housing. Notably, Senator Stabenow, joined 
by Senator Brown as a cosponsor, last Congress introduced the 
Revitalizing Downtowns Act (S. 2511) that would provide a 20-percent 
tax credit to convert office buildings into other uses, including 
residential use. This Congress, Representative Gomez has introduced 
this legislation (H.R. 419) in the House of Representatives. The 
multifamily industry is interested in working with Congress on this 
type of proposal but would like to see it modified to, among other 
things, enable other types of commercial properties (e.g., shopping 
centers and hotels) to qualify for the tax incentive; ensure REITs 
could utilize the benefit; and clarify that the credit does not reduce 
other tax benefits including the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.

    Additionally, the multifamily industry would encourage Congress to 
explore whether tax-exempt Private Activity Bonds could be used as a 
means of promoting adaptive reuse. Housing finance agencies could issue 
such bonds to help facilitate adaptive reuse of underutilized 
properties, particularly in areas that have a plan to track 
discriminatory land use policies as envisioned by the Yes In My 
Backyard (YIMBY) Act (S. 1614/H.R. 3198) introduced last Congress by 
Senators Young and Schatz and Representatives Kilmer and Hollingsworth 
and strongly supported by NMHC and NAA.

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
    Question. Later this spring, Senator Cantwell and I will be 
reintroducing our Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act (AHCIA), 
which includes key production provisions that will help affordable 
housing production across the country. Additionally, the bill will 
enact a rural basis boost of up to 30 percent, expanding the equity 
available to finance important affordable housing developments in areas 
where production has been difficult, including so many rural Hoosier 
communities that many of my constituents are proud to call home.

    Can you explain how this basis boost proposal, and other important 
provisions of the AHCIA, can help address these challenges?

    Answer. The rural basis boost proposal would help boost rural 
housing production through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit by 
increasing the amount of tax credits and resulting equity financing 
dollars that can flow to such projects. Put simply, the increase in 
basis translates into eligibility for additional credits. These credits 
then offset production costs and, thereby, enable the production of 
additional affordable multifamily housing units. NMHC and NAA strongly 
support this proposal and look forward to working with you to ensure 
that the tax credit works in all areas across the Nation, including 
rural areas where it can be more difficult to build housing, so that 
all families can find safe and decent housing at a price they can 
afford.

    In terms of producing affordable housing more generally, the 
Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act (AHCIA) is absolutely 
essential to enact, and the multifamily housing is grateful that you 
and Senator Cantwell will be reintroducing it later this spring. We 
strongly support this bill.

    AHICA would boost affordable housing supply through two primary 
provisions. First, it would make permanent the now-expired 12.5-percent 
increase in Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) authority for 2018-2021 to enable the 
production of new units and further augment credit authority by 50 
percent. Second, the bill would lower the Private Activity Bond 
financing threshold to 25 percent from 50 percent required to receive 
the full amount of 4-percent Low-Income Housing Tax Credits.

    These two provisions in AHCIA would have a significant impact on 
the ability of the LIHTC program to deliver affordable housing. In 
December 2022, Novogradac estimated that over the 2023-2032 period, 
1.93 million additional affordable homes, housing 4.5 million low-
income people, could be financed across the United States and 
territories by AHICA provisions expanding LIHTC authority and reducing 
the Private Activity Bond financing threshold to 25 percent. Over that 
period, this enhanced financing could also create nearly 3 million 
jobs, more than $335 billion in wages and business income, and $116 
billion in tax revenue.

    Question. I know you have experience working with veterans through 
your work with Volunteers of America.

    Can you please discuss the impact the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit 
has on safely housing and providing needed services for veterans?

    Answer. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) plays a 
significant role in providing quality housing to our Nation's veterans. 
In many cases, veterans can use Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing 
(VASH) vouchers to secure residency at LIHTC properties. These vouchers 
ensure veterans can find housing and receive critical case management 
and clinical services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs. I 
would note that Congress's enactment of so-called income averaging that 
enables the LIHTC program to serve individuals earning up to 80 percent 
of area median income was a critical step in enabling veterans using 
VASH vouchers to secure housing at LIHTC properties. Prior to that 
change, many veterans did not qualify for LIHTC housing because their 
incomes exceeded statutory limits.

    Finally, I would note that the Affordable Housing Credit 
Improvement Act includes a proposal that would provide a basis boost 
for LIHTC projects serving extremely low-income households. Under this 
proposal, LIHTC projects with at least 20 percent of units serving 
households earning no more than 30 percent of area median gross income 
or whose income does not exceed the Federal poverty line, would be 
eligible for 150 percent of basis with respect to that portion of the 
project. This proposal would be beneficial in ensuring that veterans 
without VASH vouchers, among others, could secure housing at LIHTC 
properties.

Introduction

Rent control laws limit the amount of rent a landlord can charge, 
either by setting a rent ceiling and/or by limiting rent increases. The 
latter approach is sometimes referred to as a rent stabilization 
policy. Most rent control or rent stabilization policies also set rules 
for the conditions under which a landlord can evict a tenant.

Many policies allow landlords to petition for greater rent increases if 
they make significant improvements to the property. New York City's 
rent control and rent stabilization laws are well known, but rent 
control has also been adopted in cities in California, New Jersey, 
Massachusetts, Maryland, and in the District of Columbia. There are 
initiatives underway presently to expand rent control in California 
(where rent control was restricted in 1995 by the Costa-Hawkins Rental 
Housing Act) as well as Illinois, Washington, and Oregon.

Renewed interest in rent control is a reaction to growing housing 
affordability challenges across the country and in high-cost coastal 
markets, in particular. As rents continue to rise, rent control is 
being advocated by some as a mechanism to help mitigate the rental 
affordability challenge and make it easier for lower-income individuals 
and families to find housing they can afford in high-cost regions.

Imposing limits on rents would seem to be a logical way to keep housing 
costs low for people who need affordable housing. However, there are 
significant problems associated with rent-control programs. Economists 
nearly universally agree that rent ceilings reduce the quantity and 
quality of housing and that even more moderate forms of rent 
stabilization have efficiency challenges and negative housing market 
impacts.\1\

This report synthesizes the empirical research on the effects of rent 
control and rent stabilization on individual renters and communities, 
building on prior evaluations of the rent-control literature.\2\ This 
report does not include a review of every rent control study. Rather, 
the research included in this review includes only empirical studies of 
rent control and rent stabilization programs in the U.S. Theoretical 
studies were excluded, as were studies that simply provided a 
descriptive analysis of a rent-control program. Non-U.S. studies were 
excluded with the presumption that housing markets and housing policy 
are substantially different in other countries that have implemented 
rent control. The vast majority of the studies included in this 
synthesis were published in peer-reviewed journals, though other 
studies (e.g., consulting reports) were included if they met the other 
criteria.

The earliest study included in this synthesis was published in 1972 and 
the latest was released in 2017. The reviewed research includes case 
studies of programs in a single market--New York, Boston, Los Angeles, 
San Francisco, Santa Monica, Washington, DC--as well as fewer studies 
that take a cross-sectional approach across markets. Most of the 
research employed various multivariate statistical techniques, while a 
small handful of studies were able to take advantage of a policy change 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
that created a natural experiment (see Table 1).

What Is Rent Control?

Rent control often refers to laws that set caps on rents, while rent 
stabilization generally refers to policies that regulate how often and 
how fast rent levels can increase.\3\ Generally adopted at the 
municipal level, rent control laws often are coupled with rules related 
to tenant eviction and to exceptions to the rent levels or increases 
under certain circumstances. New York City has the most established 
rent-control laws, but there are currently rent-control policies in 
place in communities in California, New Jersey, Maryland, and the 
District of Columbia.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Policies are sometimes referred to as ``first-generation'' and 
``second-generation'' rent control to distinguish between stricter 
programs with rent caps and more moderate programs that regulate rent 
increases and provide tenant protections. In this paper, the term 
``rent control'' is generally used to refer to both types of programs 
unless otherwise specified.

Local rent control or rent stabilization polices can vary on different 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
dimensions:

      Regulation of rent level or rates of rent increases and how 
these levels or rates are set;
      Types of residential buildings or units subject to rent control, 
based on the age or size of the building, and, consequently, what share 
of the locality's rental stock is subject to rent control;
      Rules on rent changes upon a tenant vacating a rent-controlled 
unit (i.e., vacancy allowances/vacancy decontrol policies); and
      Eviction rules that outline the circumstances under which 
landlords of rent-
controlled buildings can turn out a tenant.

The variation in rent control and rent stabilization policies has 
important implications for understanding findings from the research on 
policy impacts and for generalizing specific findings to other existing 
and potential rent control policies. Market conditions also matter when 
measuring the effects of rent control or rent stabilization, as does 
the length of time the law has been in place. Furthermore, rent control 
is one of many different forms of regulation that can impact housing 
supply and price, and sometimes it can be challenging to isolate rent 
control's impact.
Key Findings
Even with these caveats, there are several clear and consistent 
findings about how rent control laws impact residents, landlords and 
local housing markets:

    1.  Rent-control and rent-stabilization policies do a poor job at 
targeting benefits. While some low-income families do benefit from rent 
control, so, too, do higher-income house-holds. There are more 
efficient and effective ways to provide assistance to lower-income 
individuals and families who have trouble finding housing they can 
afford.

    2.  Residents of rent-controlled units move less often than do 
residents of uncontrolled housing units, which can mean that rent 
control causes renters to continue to live in units that are too small, 
too large or not in the right locations to best meet their housing 
needs.

    3.  Rent-controlled buildings potentially can suffer from 
deterioration or lack of investment, but the risk is minimized when 
there are effective local requirements and/or incentives for building 
maintenance and improvements.

    4.  Rent-control and rent-stabilization laws lead to a reduction in 
the available supply of rental housing in a community, particularly 
through the conversion to ownership of controlled buildings.

    5.  Rent-control policies can hold rents of controlled units at 
lower levels but not under all circumstances.

    6.  Rent-control policies generally lead to higher rents in the 
uncontrolled market, with rents sometimes substantially higher than 
would be expected without rent control.

    7.  There are significant fiscal costs associated with implementing 
a rent-
control program.
Impacts of Rent Control
The research on rent control and rent stabilization programs has 
examined the effects of those regulations in several different areas:

      Targeting Housing Benefits: How well do rent-control policies 
assist the individuals and families most in need of affordable housing?

      Allocation of Existing Housing Units: Do rent-control policies 
lengthen tenancy duration? Do they create a mismatch between units and 
households?

      Maintenance and Building Quality: Does rent control lead to a 
decline in building maintenance and lower building quality?

      Housing Availability: Does rent control reduce the overall 
supply of rental housing?

      Rent Levels: Are rents of controlled units lower than market-
rate rents? Does a shortage in housing supply caused by rent control 
lead to higher rents in the uncontrolled market?

      Fiscal Impacts: Do rent control policies lead to lower levels of 
property tax revenue collected by the municipality? How substantial are 
administrative costs associated with rent control laws?

      Homelessness: Does rent control increase homelessness as a 
result of reduced housing supply?

The following review assesses the research evidence on each of these 
issues.

Targeting Housing Benefits

Hypothesis: Limiting rent levels or rent increases under a rent-control 
law allows lower-income individuals and families to gain access to 
housing they can afford in high-cost housing markets. Depending on how 
it is implemented, a rent-control strategy can create and preserve 
mixed-income neighborhoods and can help promote racial and economic 
integration.

Alternative: Because rent control creates a limited pool of below-
market units, the law creates a system where landlords are incentivized 
to exercise greater control over tenant selection. Landlords of rent-
controlled buildings could make units more readily available to 
households with particular characteristics (e.g., higher-income 
households, households without children) or prospective tenants who can 
pay a fee to apply for rent-controlled units. As a result, rent control 
may not meet the needs of individuals and families most in need of 
affordable housing.

Overview of Findings: Rent-control and rent-stabilization policies do a 
poor job at targeting benefits. While some low-income families do 
benefit from rent control, those most in need of housing assistance are 
not disproportionately the beneficiaries of rent control. Furthermore, 
rent control generally does not lead to more economically and/or 
racially integrated neighborhoods.

Implications: Rent control/rent stabilization is not an efficient 
mechanism for helping lower-income households access affordable 
housing. There are more effective ways to provide assistance to lower-
income individuals and families who have trouble finding housing they 
can afford. For example, researchers point to increasing the number of 
Federal housing vouchers and expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax 
Credit (LIHTC) program as more promising ways to create more affordable 
housing options.
Research Findings on Targeting Housing Benefits
Research demonstrates that New York City's rent-control and rent-
stabilization laws are administered indiscriminately and benefits from 
the programs tend to be quite small and poorly targeted. Based on the 
research reviewed, the inefficiency in targeting benefits in New York 
has increased over time.

Using data from 1968,\4\ Gyourko and Linneman (1989) found some poorer 
individuals were benefiting from New York City's rent-control program; 
however, there was no evidence that the program successfully targeted 
those most in need, so benefits of rent control were also enjoyed by 
higher-income households. Using the same data, Olsen (1972) came to a 
slightly different interpretation, demonstrating that renters who lived 
in rent-controlled apartments had significantly lower average incomes 
than those in uncontrolled units. However, Olsen (1972) concluded that 
there was significant variation in the distribution of the benefits of 
rent control and that New York City's program was ``a poorly focused 
redistribution device.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ The New York Housing Vacancy Survey (NYHVS) was administered in 
1968 and 1981 and provided detailed data on residents of rent-
controlled, rent-stabilized, and uncontrolled units. Therefore, a 
number of studies of NYC's rent control programs use 1968 or 1981 data. 
The NYHVS currently is administered by the U.S. Census Bureau every 3 
years to comply with New York State and New York City rent regulation 
laws.

Looking at data between 1965 and 1968, Ault and Saba (1990) found that 
residents of rent-controlled apartments tended to be more likely 
minority and elderly--two groups a rent control policy could want to 
target. However, over time, they found that the benefit of the rent-
control subsidy in New York City was greater for higher-income 
households than for lower-income or minority households. Furthermore, 
renters with similar needs or characteristics were very unlikely to 
receive similar levels of benefits under New York City's rent-control 
law, indicating that the program did a poor job of targeting 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistance.

These early studies of New York generally provide evidence from the 
city's rent-
control law, adopted in the 1940s, rather than the later-implemented 
rent-stabilization law. Using 1981 data, Linneman (1987) also concluded 
that both the city's rent-
control and rent-stabilization programs were targeted haphazardly, 
benefiting some low-income households, particularly seniors, but 
generally doing a poor job at directing housing benefits to those most 
in need. Early (2000) used data from 1996 and confirmed not only that 
rent control and rent stabilization in New York City were poorly 
targeted, but also that the city's laws induced landlords to change the 
way they recruited tenants, giving preference to older and smaller 
households. This observation that older households (i.e., seniors) and 
smaller households (i.e., households without children) were preferred 
by landlords of rent-controlled properties was also made by Linneman 
(1987), Gyourko and Linneman (1989), and Ault and Saba (1990).

While New York City's rent-control history is unique in many ways, the 
lack of efficient targeting of the potential benefits of a rent-control 
program is observed in other communities. In the Boston metropolitan 
area, Sims (2007) found that in the late 1980s and early 1990s, lower-
income households were not well served by rent-control programs. 
Specifically, he found that about a quarter (26 percent) of rent-
controlled units were occupied by tenants with incomes in the bottom 
quartile while 30 percent of rent-controlled units were occupied by 
tenants in the top half of the income distribution. Navarro (1985) had 
come to a similar conclusion about rent-control programs in the Boston 
area, examining data from the 1970s.

In her study of Washington, DC's rent-control policy, where about two-
thirds of the stock was under control during the 1980s, Turner (1990) 
concluded that DC's rent-control policy did not benefit renters 
efficiently or equitably. In particular, the policy benefited renters 
who remained in their units a long time (including affluent renters) 
and did not provide assistance to recent or frequent movers (including 
poor individuals and families at risk of homelessness) who were unable 
to pay the above-market rents landlords could charge upon a tenant's 
departure.

A benefit of a rent-control policy could potentially be an increase in 
economic and racial integration if lower-income households are able to 
access housing in higher-income neighborhoods. However, there is scant 
evidence of this benefit in the empirical research. Glaeser (2002) 
examined whether rent control increased residential integration in 
eight cities with rent control in California and in seven cities with 
rent control in New Jersey. In rising cost regions, such as those in 
California, rent control did increase lower-rent housing options; 
however, the occupants of rent-
controlled units in California and the beneficiaries of living in 
higher-opportunity neighborhoods tended to be seniors rather than 
families with children. In New Jersey, where housing markets were on 
the decline, rent control was actually associated with increased 
economic segregation in municipalities.

Using earlier data from 1979 and 1987 to evaluate Santa Monica's rent-
control policy, Levine, Grigsby, and Heskin (1990) found the city's 
rent-control program did provide benefits to low-income households in 
the city, finding no evidence that the city's rent-control policy 
provided a disproportionate benefit to middle- and higher-income 
households. However, there was no impact on economic or racial 
integration in the community as a result of rent control.

Sims (2011) examined whether rent control in Cambridge, MA increased 
economic and racial segregation and found that rent control appeared to 
increase the share of minority residents in the city, but it was 
associated with a decrease in the proportion of very low-income 
residents. Sims (2011) concluded that the modest impacts on racial 
integration in Cambridge were overshadowed by the increases in economic 
segregation in the community.

Allocation of Existing Housing Units

Hypothesis: Rent control acts as a price control, which limits the 
overall supply of housing and does not allow units to be allocated to 
the residents who would benefit most since price cannot be used to sort 
renters into different units. Renters who gain access to rent-
controlled apartments stay in those units longer than they would in a 
market-rate unit, even if the unit is no longer appropriate for their 
household (e.g., too big or too small, based on changes in household 
composition).

Overview of Findings: Residents of rent-controlled units are less 
mobile than residents of uncontrolled housing units, and the benefit of 
living in a rent-controlled unit causes tenants to remain in their 
units longer than they would without rent control, leading to a 
mismatch in unit type or size and the need of the household.

Implications: Reduced mobility caused by rent control may limit the 
availability of so-called ``family-sized'' units (i.e., units with 
three or more bedrooms) if tenants of rent-controlled units remain in 
units after children have moved out on their own. There could also be 
instances of housing overcrowding if residents of rent-controlled units 
stay in homes that are too small as their family grows (e.g., after the 
birth of a child or when a relative moves in). Reduced mobility 
associated with rent control could have other impacts.

Tenants of rent-controlled units may be less likely to change jobs or 
may be more likely to endure long commutes because they do not want to 
move into a new unit. Rent control may induce people to put off home 
ownership and to remain renters longer to take advantage of below-
market rents. Finally, when residents of rent-
controlled buildings stay in their units as their incomes increase, 
rather than move into units with higher rents, the result is a 
reduction in the supply of affordable housing available to those with 
lower incomes.
 Research Findings on Allocation of Existing Housing Units
Studies on rent control and rent stabilization in New York City 
consistently demonstrate that these policies have been associated with 
reduced residential mobility and a significant ``mismatch'' between 
tenants' housing needs and the characteristics of the units. Gyourko 
and Linneman (1989) used 1968 data to examine the distributional 
consequences of rent control in New York City, demonstrating that New 
York City's rent-control policy led to longer tenures and lower 
likelihood of home ownership among tenants in rent-controlled units. 
Ault, Jackson, and Saba (1994) also examined 1968 data and estimated 
that the typical rent control tenant remained in his or her unit about 
18 years longer than an otherwise identical tenant in an uncontrolled 
unit.

Other research in New York City attempted to differentiate the 
residential mobility impacts of rent control versus the more moderate 
rental stabilization program by using later data. Using data from 1981, 
Linneman (1987) compared length of tenancy among residents living in 
uncontrolled units with tenancy among those living in units under the 
city's rent-control law and units subject to the city's later-enacted 
rent stabilization law.

Residents of strictly controlled rental units received significant 
rental subsides relative to those of the stabilized and uncontrolled 
sectors, and that subsidy led to these renters remaining in their units 
significantly longer than they would otherwise be expected. But 
Linneman noted that there was no significant difference in the tenancy 
durations of residents of rent-stabilized units and uncontrolled units. 
At the time of the data collection (in 1981), New York City's rent-
stabilization policy had only been fully implemented for 7 years (since 
1974), which may partially explain why no difference between tenants of 
uncontrolled and rent-stabilized units was found.

Nagy (1995) also compared residential mobility between renters living 
in rent-
controlled units and rent-stabilized units using data from 1978 and 
1987 (between 4 and 13 years after full adoption of rent stabilization 
in New York City). He found that tenants of rent-controlled units were, 
in fact, significantly less mobile than those living in rent-stabilized 
units; however, the differences were not so clear after accounting for 
the differences in the socioeconomic characteristics of the two types 
of renters. For example, renters living in rent-controlled units were 
more likely to be White and older compared to rent-stabilized renters, 
and those characteristics themselves are associated with reduced 
mobility.

Rappaport (1992) examined the effects rent control had on the 
probability of rental vacancies and occupant turnovers in New York 
City, which is a slightly different way of looking at residential 
mobility and length of tenure. She found that compared to uncontrolled 
units, a rent-controlled apartment was about 8 percent less likely to 
turn over in a 3-year period.

Lower levels of residential mobility and longer tenures in current 
units suggest that tenants of rent-controlled units would be more 
likely to live in housing that is not optimal either in terms of size 
or amenities. Using data from the 1990 Census and comparing the New 
York City apartment market to comparable areas that had not adopted 
rent control, Glaeser and Luttmer (2003) found that between 15 and 21 
percent of New York City apartment renters lived in larger or smaller 
units than they would if they were living in a city without rent 
control or rent stabilization (with the range depending on whether unit 
size was measured by rooms or bedrooms). The authors cautioned that in 
New York City there also is a ``housing misallocation'' among both 
renters in uncontrolled buildings and owners when compared to other 
markets, suggesting that the New York City market may be generally 
inducing misallocation of units.

In 1994, San Francisco adopted rent-control protections for small 
multifamily housing (four units or less) built prior to 1980. Diamond, 
McQuade, and Qian (2017) compared outcomes for tenants and landlords of 
small pre-1980 buildings and post-1980 buildings to estimate the impact 
of rent control on residential mobility. The authors found that 
residents of rent-controlled buildings were between 10 and 20 percent 
more likely to stay in their current unit over the study period, with 
the effects significantly stronger among older households and among 
households that already had a long tenure in their current unit, two 
groups that have lower levels of residential mobility even absent 
having access to a rent-controlled unit.

Washington DC's rent-control law was adopted in 1985 and applied limits 
on rent increases to all units in buildings built before 1975. In an 
evaluation of rent control in DC, Turner (1990) found that tenants of 
rent-controlled units moved less frequently than tenants of other 
units, concluding that the city's rent control program contributed to 
the very low rates of residential mobility observed in the city. Turner 
(1990) did not find evidence of reduced probabilities of home ownership 
associated with rent control in Washington, DC.

Krol and Svorney (2005) examined the impacts on residential mobility of 
rent-
control programs in New Jersey more implicitly by examining the links 
between length of commute and presence of rent control. Using data from 
the 1980, 1990, and 2000 censuses, the authors found a positive and 
statistically significant relationship between the presence of rent 
control in a city and commute times for workers who lived in those 
cities. The municipalities with the most restrictive regulations were 
associated with the longest average commute times. Krol and Svorney 
(2005) suggested that in New Jersey, a lack of household mobility was 
the driver of the longer commute times and concluded that the relative 
immobility of the population was the factor underlying the relationship 
they observed between rent control and commute times.

Maintenance and Building Quality

Hypothesis: Limiting rents through a rent-control or rent-stabilization 
law reduces the return on investments in rental housing and will cause 
landlords to choose to undermaintain their properties until the output 
of housing services (as measured by housing quality and amenities) 
declines to the level that is supported by the below-market rents.

Alternative: Even as rent control may limit landlords' desire to 
maintain their properties, other local ordinances that require 
landlords to maintain units to certain standards, to repay tenant 
maintenance expenditures, and/or to permit rent increases for well-
maintained or upgraded units could counteract the potential negative 
impacts on housing quality associated with rent control.

In addition, a rental subsidy in the form of rent control could 
encourage tenants to contribute to maintenance and upkeep, 
counteracting any possible deferred maintenance on the part of the 
landlord.

Overview of Findings: There is no clear association documented in the 
empirical research between rent control and building quality, 
particularly if other ordinances, requirements, or incentives are 
present to have landlords maintain buildings.

Implications: Rent-control laws in communities that have comprehensive 
requirements related to building maintenance may mitigate any potential 
negative impacts on housing quality. However, without appropriate 
incentives or requirements, landlords of rent-controlled buildings will 
be unlikely to make improvements to buildings. Furthermore, tenants of 
rent-controlled buildings may feel obligated to take on more 
maintenance responsibilities and costs, which ends up reducing the 
benefits of the rent-control subsidy.
Research Findings on Maintenance and Building Quality
Earlier studies of rent control in New York City did find a negative 
relationship between rent control and building quality, but researchers 
noted that it is difficult to isolate the rent control impacts since 
the law applied to older and often lower-
quality buildings. Using data from 1968, Gyourko and Linneman (1990) 
found that New York City's rent-control law had a large and significant 
negative impact on the quality of rental buildings, but the impact was 
primarily for non-high-rise buildings and buildings that were already 
in a state of disrepair when rent control was adopted. In the same 
study, Gyourko and Linneman (1990) provided modest evidence that rent 
control in New York City induced maintenance and upkeep on the part of 
individual residents of controlled units.

The relationship between rent control/stabilization and building 
quality in New York City is even less clear cut in later years. Moon 
and Stotsky (1993) offered mixed evidence that rent control led to a 
decline in housing quality in New York City over the 1978 to 1987 
period. While there was a possibility of the quality of rent-controlled 
units to decline over time, Moon and Stotsky (1993) found that 
maintenance and improvements occurred in rent-controlled buildings when 
other economic conditions were favorable to induce landlords to 
renovate. For example, if landlords were able to offer a payout to 
existing tenants and/or were able to capitalize on higher rents when 
existing tenants moved out, they could be incentivized to maintain 
their buildings. This research also found that longer-term tenants of 
rent-controlled units in New York City were incentivized to provide 
maintenance and upkeep of their property even if the landlord did not.

Rent control was ended in Massachusetts in 1995, and the termination of 
rent-
control laws in cities in the Boston metropolitan area provided a type 
of natural experiment to examine the impacts of rent control. While 
Sims (2007) primarily focused on impacts of rent control on housing 
supply, the findings from this research also suggested that in the late 
1980s and early 1990s, rent control in Boston was associated with 
modest deterioration in the quality of the rental housing stock without 
a counteracting tenant-supplied maintenance and upkeep. Similarly, 
while not the primary outcome analyzed in their evaluation of rent 
control in Los Angeles, researchers at RAND (Rydell et al. 1981) found 
evidence of deferred maintenance and upkeep in rent-controlled 
buildings.

However, after 15 years of rent control in Washington DC, Turner 
(1990), found no evidence of a decline in housing quality and, in fact, 
documented that units exempt from rent control in DC had more 
maintenance issues than rent-controlled buildings. She concluded that 
other local policies helped to ensure building quality in the city.

Looking across the country at other communities with rent control, 
Mengle (1985) attempted to examine the relationship between housing 
quality and rent control across eight metropolitan areas in the mid-
1970s, with a dataset that included four metropolitan areas where rent 
control was present and four where rent control was not present. While 
Mengle (1985) found evidence of reduced residential building quality in 
the metropolitan areas with rent control, it was noted that rent-
control laws varied considerably across municipalities in the study, 
but the model did not explicitly attempt to account for those policy 
differences or attempt to ascertain other regulations or ordinances 
that could incentivize building maintenance.

Housing Availability

Hypothesis: Regulations that limit rents could reduce the availability 
of rental housing in both the short and long term. Rent control could 
induce landlords of properties covered by the law to convert their 
buildings to condominium ownership, thereby taking rental units off the 
market. The supply of affordable rental housing could also be 
diminished if landlords redevelop their properties such that the new 
units are not subject to rent-controlled laws. Longer-term, while rent-
control regulations almost always exclude new construction, if rent 
control puts downward pressure on market rents or if developers fear 
that in the future new units will be subject to controls, they may not 
build new housing.

Overview of Findings: Rent-control and rent-stabilization laws 
generally led to a reduction in the available supply of rental housing 
because landlords were induced to convert their properties into 
condominiums or to redevelop into housing not subject to rent-control 
regulations. The impact of rent control on new construction is less 
clear-cut in the empirical research.

Implications: Rent control incentivizes landlords to convert their 
rental properties into condominiums, particularly when there is strong 
demand for and a lack of home-ownership opportunities in a community. 
New housing construction may be negatively impacted if developers are 
uncertain about future applications of rent-control and rent-
stabilization policies.
Research Findings on Housing Availability
While there is a substantial body of theoretical work on the 
relationship between rent controls and housing supply, there is 
surprisingly little empirical research on the impacts.

In a study of San Francisco over the 1995 to 2012 period, Diamond, 
McQuade, and Qian (2017) found that, overall, landlords with properties 
covered by rent control were more likely than other property owners to 
convert their units to condominiums or to redevelop their buildings, 
which reduced the supply of available rental housing in the city. 
Diamond, McQuade, and Qian (2017) estimated that the reduced supply of 
rental housing--in just this one segment of the multifamily housing 
stock; that is, properties with four or fewer units--led to a seven 
percent increase in city-wide rents.

Sims (2007) came to a similar conclusion in Boston. While he found no 
significant relationship between the presence of rent control and the 
level of new housing construction in the Boston area, rent control was 
associated with a shift from units offered as rentals to those offered 
as ownership, with landlords of rent-controlled buildings converting 
their units to condominium. In the Boston region, therefore, it was 
estimated that rent control kept thousands of rental units off the 
market.

In California and New Jersey, over the 1970 to 1990 period, Glaeser 
(2002) found mixed results on the relationship between rent control and 
housing supply. In California, the supply of housing in cities with 
rent control increased more slowly than it did in cities without rent 
control; however, the difference was not statistically significant 
until Glaeser (2002) controlled by initial city size. In New Jersey, 
there was a significant impact of rent control on the housing stock, 
with the overall supply of housing actually declining in cities that 
had adopted rent control. However, that effect disappeared when city 
size was controlled for. Thus, these findings suggest no clear-cut 
relationship between rent control and housing construction but also 
suggest that rent control impacts housing availability differently in 
different kinds of markets.

Rent Levels

Hypothesis: Rent control will keep rents of units in controlled 
buildings lower than market rents, but if rent control results in a 
decline in the rental housing supply, then rents for uncontrolled units 
will be higher than what they would be without a rent-control program 
in place.

Alternative: Depending on the vacancy decontrol policy, landlords of 
rent-controlled buildings could set initial rents higher than market 
rents to compensate for lower future rents allowed under rent control. 
Furthermore, tenants would be willing to pay higher rents initially if 
they knew that rent increases would be capped over time.

Overview of Findings: Units subject to rent control usually have rents 
that are lower than market rents, which provide a benefit to tenants of 
those units, often inducing them to stay longer than they would 
otherwise. However, when a rent-
control policy includes a vacancy decontrol or vacancy allowance 
condition, new residents of controlled units could actually pay more 
than market rates initially.

Rent-control policies generally lead to higher rents in the 
uncontrolled market, with rents sometimes substantially higher than 
would be expected without rent control (i.e., between 10 to 25 percent 
higher). Over time, if rent control does not apply to new construction, 
there is some evidence that the impact on uncontrolled rents 
diminishes.

Implications: Rent-control policies can hold rents of controlled units 
at lower levels and benefit some tenants, particularly those who do not 
move often. However, adopting a rent-control law will lead to rent 
increases in the unregulated market, which reduces the well-being of 
residents of uncontrolled units and can actually diminish the overall 
welfare of all residents. Attempting to moderate a rent-control policy 
by implementing a vacancy decontrol provision could actually increase 
the rents of controlled units in the short-term.
Research Findings on Rent Levels
There is general consensus that rent control policies without vacancy 
allowances do lead to lower rents for units in rent-controlled 
buildings. Gyourko and Linneman (1989) found that rent control resulted 
in significantly lower rents for controlled units. In fact, they 
estimated that the reduced rents created a substantial subsidy for 
beneficiaries of rent control, possibly as high as 27 percent of 
renters' total annual income. In a study of Los Angeles rent control 
over the 1969 to 1978 period, Fallis and Smith (1997) documented that 
rent control was, indeed, responsible for keeping the rents of 
controlled units low.

Newer rent-control and rent-stabilization policies typically have a 
vacancy decontrol or vacancy allowance policy that makes it more 
difficult to be certain that units in buildings subject to rent control 
will have below-market rents. Under New York City's rent-stabilization 
program, when a tenant vacates a unit, the landlord can reset the rent 
level, increasing it by up to 20 percent. Rent increases as allowed 
under the rent-stabilization policy then apply to this new, higher 
rent.

This vacancy allowance feature could result in some tenants of rent-
stabilized apartments paying higher-than-market rents, at least 
initially. Nagy (1997) found that in 1981, tenants of rent-stabilized 
units paid higher rents than did tenants of similar, uncontrolled 
apartments. However, tracking tenants over time, Nagy (1997) found that 
rent-stabilized tenants had below-market rents 6 years later (assuming 
they remained in the rent-stabilized unit.)

A bigger concern among policymakers has been whether adopting rent 
control will lead to increases of rents in the unregulated market, 
typically through a reduction in the supply of rental housing. Caudill 
(1993) analyzed the New York City rental market in 1968 and concluded 
that rents of uncontrolled units in the city were between 22 and 25 
percent higher than they would have been had rent control not been in 
place.

Early (2000) used New York City data from 1996 to demonstrate that rent 
control drove up rents of uncontrolled units in the city and that the 
increase in rents in the overall rental market actually made tenants of 
rent-controlled units worse off than they would have been if rent 
control had not been in place. Lower rents in the broader uncontrolled 
market would have given rent-control tenants more opportunities to live 
in a unit that was a better fit for their needs, and their overall 
utility would have been increased.

Fallis and Smith (1997) found that 2 years after the adoption of rent 
control in Los Angeles, uncontrolled rents increased more than three 
times faster than rent-
controlled units, and the researchers concluded that it was the rent-
control policy itself--and not other characteristics of the 
uncontrolled units or market--that led to the significantly greater 
rent increases.

In Boston, Sims (2007) documented a more complicated relationship among 
rent control, building quality, and rent levels to find that rent 
levels of unregulated units declined in buildings near rent-controlled 
buildings that were of lower quality.

There have been attempts to examine the link between rent control and 
market rents in cross-sectional studies. While there are unanswered 
issues related to the endogeneity between rising rents/rent levels and 
adoption of rent control, Malpezzi (1996) used data for 54 metro areas 
to demonstrate a positive, significant relationship between the 
presence of a rent-control policy and median rent in the metropolitan 
area. Early and Phelps (1999) examined the impact of rent control on 
uncontrolled rents in 49 metropolitan areas over the 1984 to 1996 
period.

Results from this analysis suggested a positive and statistically 
significant relationship between the presence of rent control and 
uncontrolled rents--specifically, the introduction of rent control 
increased median uncontrolled rent levels by more than 13 percent. 
However, if rent control did not apply to new construction, the effect 
diminished over time, and between 2 and 3 decades after adoption of 
rent control, there is no significant relationship between the presence 
of rent control and rent levels in the uncontrolled market. (Like other 
cross-sectional studies, there was no attempt in either of these two 
studies to account for the variability in rent-control programs and the 
fact that policies are often only in place in select municipalities 
within a region.)

Fiscal Impacts

Hypothesis: Because rent control limits investment return, and 
potentially building quality, it can also reduce the value of the 
property and, as a result, lower the amount of property tax revenue 
collected from the property owner. In addition, rent control increases 
public expenditures through administrative procedures to implement and 
oversee the rent-control program.

Overview of Findings: While there is very little empirical research on 
the topics, rent-control laws can reduce the amount of property tax 
revenue collected on rental properties and can be associated with 
fairly high administrative costs.

Implications: There can be significant costs to the municipality (and 
potentially to the State) of implementing rent control.
Research Findings on Fiscal Impacts
There is very little empirical research on the relationship between 
rent control and local property tax revenue. In his analysis of rent 
control in Cambridge, MA, Navarro (1985) concluded that the city lost 
out on between $5 and $10 million per year in property tax revenue as a 
result of lower property values induced by rent control. In New York 
City, a study conducted by the accounting firm Peat Marwick (1988) 
estimated that there was a loss in taxable assessed property values 
attributable to rent control at approximately $4 billion in the late 
1980s, which meant that the city lost out on an estimated $370 million 
annually in property tax revenue.

Rent-control regulations create administrative processes that would not 
be required without the law. As a result, there is a cost to the 
municipality (and potentially to a State) to implement, administer, and 
enforce a rent-control program. In Cambridge, Navarro (1985) estimated 
that the public costs to administer the city's rent-control program 
totaled about $40 per unit. Linneman (1987) concluded that the 
administrative costs associated with New York City's rent stabilization 
policy were ``substantial and inefficient.''

Homelessness

Hypothesis: Rent control reduces the availability of housing and, 
therefore, can increase homelessness in a community.

Overview of Findings: There is no consistent relationship observed 
between rent control and the prevalence of homelessness.

Implications: Given the complex causes of homelessness, a rent-control 
policy has an unknown effect on a community's homeless population, but 
if it reduces the availability of affordable housing in that community, 
the homeless population will be better served by programs that are more 
specifically targeted.
Research Findings on Homelessness
In a review of the relationship between homelessness and rent control 
in metro areas across the country, Honig, and Filer (1993) found no 
significant association either between the presence of a rent-control 
policy and homelessness or between rent control and incidences of 
overcrowding. Early and Olsen (1998) found that rent control was 
associated with decreased rental vacancy and increased rents, which 
could increase homelessness; however, they found that those potential 
effects were more than offset by other effects that decreased 
homelessness. Using 1990 data, Grimes and Chressanthis (1997) found a 
significant though very small impact of rent control on the level of 
homelessness, though as Gissy (1997) also concluded, it is possible 
that underlying factors related to both the likelihood of adopting rent 
control and level of homelessness could be an intervening factor 
explaining the relationship.

                                 ______
                                 
            Prepared Statement of Denise Scott, President, 
              Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC)
    Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the committee, 
I thank you very much for the opportunity to speak with you today, at a 
time when the Nation's affordable housing crisis continues to deepen, 
to discuss the critical role that Federal tax policy plays in 
supporting the development and preservation of affordable rental and 
home-ownership housing throughout the country. I recognize that the 
committee has a broad jurisdiction and will be addressing many 
important issues this Congress, and I applaud you for your focus on 
affordable housing so early in this legislative session.

    My name is Denise Scott, and I am the president of the Local 
Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC). LISC is a nonprofit housing and 
community development organization and certified Community Development 
Financial Institution (CDFI) with offices in 38 cities throughout the 
country, and a rural network encompassing 146 partners serving 49 
different States, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. LISC's work 
supports a wide range of activities, including affordable housing, 
economic development, building family wealth and incomes, education, 
community safety, and community health. LISC and its affiliates raise 
and deploy well over $2 billion annually in grants, loans and equity 
capital into distressed urban and rural communities. In 2022, this 
included over $1.2 billion of equity capital deployed by our 
affiliates, the National Equity Fund (NEF) and the New Markets Support 
Company (NMSC), utilizing Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits 
(Housing Credits) and New Markets Tax Credits (NMTCs), respectively.

    LISC believes that a safe, affordable home is one of the basic 
requisites of life--a key to individual health, well-being and 
financial security. We also believe that investments in quality, 
affordable housing have benefits that extend beyond the walls of a home 
and the experience of the people who live there to the community at 
large. It can stimulate spending and employment in the local economy, 
revitalize and bring revenue to the community, and build community 
wealth.

    In this testimony, I will discuss: (i) LISC's role in supporting 
affordable housing; (ii) the current state of the housing market; (iii) 
the unique and essential role of Housing Credits in increasing the 
supply of affordable rental housing, and steps Congress can take to 
strengthen the program; (iv) the need for Congress to enact the 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act; and (v) other actions Congress can 
take to spur responsible investments in affordable housing through the 
tax code.
            i. lisc's role in supporting affordable housing
    LISC provides support relating to all components of the affordable 
housing financing ecosystem. We raise capital and manage the assets of 
Housing Credit investment funds; provide training and technical 
assistance grants to nonprofit housing developers; provide debt capital 
for multifamily housing projects; administer off-
balance-sheet funds on behalf of municipalities, private-sector 
organizations and foundations; support single-family housing 
development and rehabilitation; and support rural housing initiatives, 
both single-family and multifamily.
Housing Credit Investments
    The National Equity Fund (NEF) is the largest nonprofit syndicator 
of Housing Credits in the country. NEF serves as the bridge between 
developers and Housing Credit investors--helping to place equity 
capital at tax credit properties throughout the country, managing 
investor funds, providing compliance monitoring services, and 
facilitating the transfers of properties to new ownership at the 
conclusion of the 15-year tax credit compliance period. Since its 
founding in 1987, NEF has invested more than $22.7 billion, which 
represents 231,500 new affordable homes for individuals, families, and 
communities in need across the country. In 2022, NEF deployed $2.1 
billion in affordable housing investments, including $1.2 billion in 
Housing Credit investments. NEF has also raised over $130 million in 
committed Opportunity Zone investments to support multifamily 
affordable housing.

    NEF is also an industry leader in creating targeted funds focusing 
on high-needs populations. Its ``Bring Them Homes'' initiative provides 
veterans of the U.S. military with high-quality affordable housing. 
Over the past decade, NEF has invested $800 million in 80 projects that 
provide a veteran's preference, alongside over $9 million of grant 
funding to help provide on-site supportive services. These combined 
efforts created and/or rehabbed nearly 13,000 units of affordable 
housing, including 7,500 units targeting veterans and veteran families. 
And in 2021, NEF raised more than $112 million to support its new 
Emerging Minority Developer Fund to empower the next generation of 
developers of color to overcome high barriers of access to Housing 
Credits.
Multifamily Housing
    LISC provides a range of grants, loans, and equity for nearly every 
aspect of development, from planning and acquisition to construction 
and renovation, to both nonprofit and for-profit developers. We offer 
technical assistance, data, and mapping tools to community-based 
organizations working to improve the supply and condition of affordable 
housing in their neighborhoods, helping to equip developers and small 
businesses with the resources they need to grow and thrive. We are 
intentional in our efforts to bring these resources to communities and 
businesses overlooked by conventional financing channels.

    Lending is an essential instrument in LISC's community development 
toolkit. As one of the largest CDFIs in the Nation, we work in 
partnership with local grassroots groups, for-profit developers and 
government agencies to finance programs and projects that will have a 
positive, long-term impact. LISC offers a wide range of loans, from 
pre-development to permanent financing, and we finance a variety of 
asset classes, from large affordable housing to community facilities to 
small business loans. In 2022, LISC closed over $360 million in total 
loan commitments, providing $131 million to 62 affordable rental 
housing projects and 14 affordable home-
ownership projects, supporting a total of 5,200 affordable homes.

    In addition, LISC's Loan Fund Management (LFM) group is charged 
with designing, launching, and managing successful place-based impact 
funds and innovative capital vehicles across the country. Created in 
2018 and operating under LISC's Strategic Investments arm, LFM is 
currently managing 10 funds with $865 million of assets under 
management and has closed close to 3,000 loans through the end of 2022. 
LFM is currently managing $620 million of investments in four place-
based affordable housing funds in the Bay Area, Charlotte, Dallas, and 
Detroit, which have collectively supported over 6,000 affordable 
housing units. LFM also invests in affordable housing projects through 
its national and regional funds, like the Black Economic Development 
Fund, which has supported over 1,000 units of affordable housing.
Single-Family Housing
    In addition to providing loans to support developers of single-
family homes in our communities, LISC has more recently developed a new 
product to support owner-
occupied home rehabs. Pioneered in 2015 by our Detroit LISC office, we 
are offering 10-year, interest-free loans ranging from $5,000 to 
$25,000 to complete home repairs, fix structural defects, and resolve 
health and safety issues such as lead, mold, and asbestos 
contamination. The Detroit program has provided $13.6 million in 
financing to 688 homeowners, 95 percent of whom are Black, and 71 
percent of whom are low-income households. The loan fund structure 
draws upon three sources of financing--CDBG funds, private loan capital 
and grant funding--and we are in the process of building out similar 
programs in Memphis and other cities across the country.
Rural Housing
    LISC has a strong commitment to improving rural communities and in 
1995, launched Rural LISC, a national program created to expand our 
reach beyond urban areas. Today, Rural LISC partners with 146 rural 
community-based organizations, including five financial intermediaries, 
helping each organization identify challenges and opportunities, and 
delivering the most appropriate support to meet those local needs. Over 
half of our partners provide housing assistance to the small towns they 
serve. LISC has renewed our commitment to rural communities through our 
Rural LISC Promise, our pledge to catalyze at least 20 percent of the 
community development impact that LISC makes, in any year, in rural 
communities.

    Our experience supporting local nonprofit housing organizations 
working in rural communities has shown us the importance of Federal 
affordable housing programs, including the Housing Credit. A recent 
survey of our Rural LISC partners indicated that Housing Credits are 
being utilized to finance 106 development projects in their pipelines, 
totaling more than 7,000 units.

    Many of our partners utilize Housing Credits to preserve and 
recapitalize U.S. Department of Agriculture's section 515 multifamily 
housing properties and for USDA section 514 and 516 farm labor housing. 
These resources are essential for preserving what is often some of the 
only affordable rental housing in small towns.
            ii. challenges in the affordable housing markets
    In the past few years, our Nation has experienced large swings in 
the housing market due to the economic impacts of the pandemic and 
consistent underproduction of housing supply. These impacts have been 
disproportionately felt by lower-income families and households of 
color, which experienced housing constraints before COVID. LISC has 
seen throughout our national footprint that the greatest housing 
challenges are primarily related to affordability, in both the 
multifamily and single-family markets.
Multifamily Housing
    The multifamily rental market has experienced historic rent growth, 
triggered by strong overall demand and low vacancy rates. Rents 
increased a record 11.6 percent at the end of 2021 and remained at an 
elevated pace during the first quarter of 2022.\1\ This was the largest 
year-over-year increase in 2 decades and more than three times the 3.2-
percent average annual rise in the 5 years preceding the pandemic.\2\ 
For the first time, the median asking rent in the 50 most populous 
metropolitan areas is more than $2,000.\3\ Rent growth has recently 
declined in response to the Federal Reserve's efforts to slow inflation 
by raising interest rates. By the end of 2022, rents were up three 
percent although it would take far more declines to counteract the 
overall historic gains.\4\

    These historic increases in rental housing costs have also occurred 
during years of higher multifamily construction costs, challenging 
affordable rental housing providers. The sector has experienced 
increased costs for construction materials, labor, insurance, and 
recently mortgage interest rates.\5\ The price of inputs to new 
residential construction (excluding capital, labor, and imports) was up 
20 percent year over year in February 2022.\6\ LISC finances affordable 
rental housing projects across the country, and in markets of all 
types, and has seen firsthand the additional financing gaps created by 
these inflationary pressures. These can threaten the likelihood of a 
project going to completion if additional sources of scarce affordable 
housing funding can't be secured.

    High rent burdens contribute to housing instability for underserved 
families. In no State, metropolitan area, or county in the U.S. can a 
worker earning the Federal or prevailing State or local minimum wage 
afford a modest two-bedroom rental home at fair market rent by working 
a standard 40-hour work week.\7\ In addition, nearly half of all 
renters are now considered cost-burdened since they spend at least 30 
percent of their income on housing.\8\ The unaffordability of the 
rental market also disproportionately harms Black and Latino households 
because they earn disproportionately less income than White renters and 
are more likely to be renters. Thirty percent of White households are 
renters, compared with 58 percent of Black households and 46 percent of 
Latino households.\9\

    While the most severe affordability challenges continue to be at 
the lowest end of the income spectrum, there have been growing 
challenges felt by middle-income households, particularly in high-cost 
markets. Our Nation's underproduction of housing is increasing housing 
affordability challenges for teachers, firefighters, nurses, and 
others. City leaders from across the country have shared with LISC 
their struggles with housing their municipal workforce, and related 
challenges in attracting talent to both public- and private-sector jobs 
due to inadequate supply of quality affordable housing. Renter cost 
burdens increased across all income levels in 2021, although they were 
the largest among middle-income groups.\10\ It is estimated that our 
Nation has underproduced on almost 3.8 million units of housing, which 
drives up housing costs and contributes to inflationary pressures for 
low- and moderate-income families.\11\

underproduction/.

    Relatedly, LISC is supportive of local efforts to reduce land use 
and regulatory barriers which restrict housing supply for low- and 
middle-income families and has seen these efforts in some of our local 
office markets, including Charlotte, Twin Cities, our offices in 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
California, and others.

    Lastly, we've also seen firsthand how increases in natural 
disasters fueled by climate change are impacting affordable housing 
properties and creating housing instability for low-income families. 
Research has shown that our Nation's affordable housing stock is at 
higher risks from disasters compared to other housing types.\12\ These 
disasters are also reducing our Nation's affordable housing supply and 
displacing residents from their communities.\13\ It can be difficult 
for owners to rebuild due to inadequate insurance and reserves, while 
low-income tenants have fewer financial resources to cope with the loss 
of their homes.\14\

Single-Family Homes
    Similar to the rental housing market, single-family homes have 
experienced historic price increases since the pandemic. Home price 
appreciation nationwide hit 20.6 percent in March 2022--topping the 
previous high of 20.0 percent in August 2021 and marking the largest 
jump in 3 decades.\15\ Home price increases have cooled since the 
Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, although prices generally 
remain high, and elevated interest rates make it more difficult for 
first time home buyers to purchase a home. Just 42.2 percent of new and 
existing homes sold between the beginning of July and end of September 
2022 were affordable to families earning the U.S. median income of 
$90,000.\16\ This was the second consecutive quarterly record low for 
housing affordability since the Great Recession.

    Home-ownership disparities between racial and ethnic groups 
stubbornly persist. In the second quarter of 2022, the home-ownership 
rate for White households was 75 percent compared to 45 percent for 
Black households, 48 percent for Hispanic households, and 57 percent 
for non-Hispanic households of any other race.\17\ These gaps in home-
ownership rates have changed little over the last 3 decades. In fact, 
the Black-White gap in home-ownership rates was the same in 2020 as it 
was in 1970, just 2 years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 
1968, which sought to end racial discrimination in the housing 
market.\18\ These disparities limit the ability of families of color to 
achieve their home-ownership goals and limits asset building 
opportunities, contributing to our Nation's racial wealth gap.

    Many communities have also been significantly impacted by real 
estate investors purchasing single-family housing properties for rental 
housing. Increases in 
investor-owned properties are associated with rising rental prices, 
particularly in the most affordable segment of the housing market. 
These investor purchases reached a record high in 2021,\19\ are 
geographically concentrated in the South and Southwest sections of the 
Nation and are primarily in low-cost neighborhoods with a majority of 
households of color.\20\ Between 2010 and 2021, the share of homes 
purchased by investors in majority Black ZIP codes has increased from 
13 percent to 30 percent; compared to increases from 7 percent to 12 
percent in other ZIP codes.\21\ LISC has seen the impacts of these 
practices in several of our local office markets, including Atlanta, 
Charlotte, Jacksonville, Phoenix, Detroit, and others. Increased 
investor activity has been linked with troubling property management 
practices and, as critically, it limits the ability of first time and 
minority families to purchase homes and build wealth.\22\

                  iii. affordable housing tax credits
Overview
    The Housing Credit is the Nation's most successful tool for the 
production and preservation of affordable rental housing, responsible 
for nearly all of the affordable housing built and preserved since the 
program's creation in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. There are two types 
of housing credits: those allocated by State agencies from their annual 
Housing Credit volume cap (the ``9-percent'' credit); and those that 
are utilized by States to accompany projects funded by multifamily 
Housing Bonds (the ``4-percent'' credit).

    The power of the program is that it is a private sector affordable 
housing development program, subsidized with Federal tax credits and 
administered by State housing finance agencies. Through each State's 
credit allocation process, developers are awarded Federal tax credits 
based on their ability to satisfy the affordable housing priorities 
identified by the State in its Qualified Allocation Plan. The public 
policy benefit of this approach is that it enables States to address 
their affordable housing needs by setting up a competition for the 
award of credits, ensuring that only the most capable developers (both 
for-profit and nonprofit) are selected.

    The results are impressive. The Housing Credit has produced just 
under 4 million affordable homes, serving more than 8 million 
households, supporting approximately 6 million jobs annually, and 
generating approximately $250 billion in taxes and $700 billion in 
wages and business income. The Housing Credit has been critical in 
helping approach the end of veterans homelessness, it has enabled the 
redevelopment of distressed public housing, has been a critical source 
of funding for elderly housing, and provided critically needed housing 
for the disabled. What's more, properties financed with the Housing 
Credit must remain affordable for a period of at least 30 years, and 
longer in certain States.

    The success of the Housing Credit program can be measured not only 
by the number of units of affordable housing it has produced, but also 
by the financial strength of the properties developed. According to 
periodic analysis by the national accounting firm CohnReznick, the 
cumulative rate of foreclosure on Housing Credit properties is lower 
than any other real estate asset class, well below 1 percent. This is a 
tribute to the quality of underwriting at the original financing as 
well as the multiple eyes on the development by the State housing 
finance agency, local governments, lenders, equity providers and 
developers.

    While development deals are complex, the essence of the Housing 
Credit is actually quite simple. Federal tax credits enable developers 
to raise equity capital from investors. Because the investor's return 
is generated primarily through the tax credits and associated losses, 
as opposed to income generated from the property, the developer can 
take on significantly less debt and thereby offer much lower rents. The 
Federal statute requires all subsidized Housing Credit units to be 
rented to tenants with incomes at or below 60 percent of area median 
income (AMI), with limited reach to tenants up to 80 percent of area 
median income (provided the overall average of the development is still 
at or below 60 percent of AMI), and the rents charged may not exceed 30 
percent of the applicable median family income.

    In practice, however, a significant percentage of Housing Credit 
units are rented and affordable to tenants with considerably lower 
incomes. According to recent HUD data on Housing Credit resident 
demographics, 53 percent of all households living in Housing Credit 
apartments are extremely low-income, meaning they earn 30 percent of 
AMI or less; and another 31 percent of households are classified as 
very low-income (earning less than 50 percent of AMI). This deep 
targeting is in large part due to the requirements in Federal law that 
creates a preference for developments that commit to deeper income 
targeting. The Housing Credit is best able to reach the poorest 
households when rental assistance is available, as the rents these 
families can afford to pay often cannot support basic operating costs, 
let alone debt service. LISC is supportive of efforts to increase 
rental assistance since only one out of four eligible households 
receive it, and since these resources are so critical for housing 
extremely low-income families.\23\

Current Challenges to Tax Credit Development
    In spite of its tremendous successes over a period approaching 4 
decades, the Housing Credit program faces serious challenges as the 
affordable housing community seeks to respond to the overwhelming 
shortage of affordable housing. In almost all areas of the Nation, we 
face a substantial supply-demand imbalance. As noted earlier, there is 
simply not enough affordable housing to serve families in need.

    This supply imbalance has been exacerbated by sharp increases in 
development costs throughout the United States. In a report issued last 
fall, the National Council of State Housing Agencies examined a number 
of their member housing finance agencies (HFAs) and found average 
construction cost increases of approximately 30 percent since the 
pandemic. This problem has been compounded by higher debt costs, which 
further exacerbate financing gaps. Because cost increases have been so 
rapid and unexpected across the board, a significant number of 
affordable housing deals had to be put on pause last year after 
developers received their credit allocations.
Recommendations for the Committee
    1. Restore the 12.5-percent increase to the formula for the 9-
percent credit allocation. In 2018, to help address the growing 
affordable housing shortage, Congress enacted on a bipartisan basis a 
12.5-percent increase in the State allocation formula for the 9-percent 
credit. This provision expired at the end of 2021, meaning that at a 
time when rents are skyrocketing and supply is limited, we are actually 
experiencing a cut to affordable housing production. At least 55,000 
shovel ready affordable homes are expected to remain unbuilt unless 
this provision is restored.

    2. Enact the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act (AHCIA). 
This legislation was sponsored by Senators Cantwell and Young in the 
last Congress (S. 1136), and we anticipate will be reintroduced 
shortly. The legislation garnered 43 Senate cosponsors in the last 
Congress, including 15 from the Finance Committee. We strongly support 
all two dozen of the provisions in that legislation, including:

          Increasing the 9-percent formula allocation by an additional 
        50 percent over the 2021 baseline figure, adjusted for 
        inflation. This additional allocation would increase affordable 
        rental housing production and preservation by about 300,000 
        more homes over a 10-year period.

          Lowering the threshold for the minimum amount of multifamily 
        Private Activity Bonds that must be used to finance a property 
        to be eligible for the 4-
        percent housing tax credit. The legislation would reduce the 
        minimum threshold from 50 percent of development costs to 25 
        percent. This would both facilitate property development and 
        have the indirect effect of expanding the private activity cap 
        by requiring less of it to be used for each Housing Credit 
        development. According to a 2021 estimate, lowering the bond 
        financing threshold from 50 percent to 25 percent could produce 
        or preserve about 1.5 million additional affordable rental 
        homes over a 10-year period.

          Creating additional basis boost. We support provisions 
        adding additional eligibility for more credits for units in 
        projects targeting extremely low-income families, for rural 
        projects, for projects serving Native American communities, and 
        also for certain 4-percent projects.

          Reducing regulatory and cost burdens on affordable housing 
        development by taking away the ability of local and other 
        elected officials to effectively veto affordable housing 
        development. There is bipartisan concern across the country 
        that local and State governments impose a variety of regulatory 
        burdens that impede housing development and add unnecessary 
        costs that price people out of rental markets.

          Simplifying and clarifying rules relating to resyndication 
        of LIHTC properties. In order to preserve older Housing Credit 
        properties, HFAs will sometimes provide a new allocation of tax 
        credits (called resyndication) so that the property can undergo 
        substantial rehabilitation and be put into a new 30-year 
        affordability restriction. The statute needs to be amended so 
        that investors that may have participated in the original 
        syndication of the credits will not be precluded from providing 
        new tax credit investments at the time of resyndication.

    3. Adopt policies to prevent the loss of existing affordable 
housing properties and resources. There are two issues with the Housing 
Credit program that we believe are critical for Congress to address, 
although they were not included in the AHCIA in the last Congress. 
These issues have been before Congress for several years, but enactment 
has been elusive in spite of the efforts of Chairman Wyden, most 
recently in the Decent, Affordable, Safe Housing for all Act, the DASH 
Act. The first issue is the Right of First Refusal in section 42(i)(7) 
of the code. The second issue is the Qualified Contract provision in 
section 42(h)(6)(E)(i)(II).

    Right of First Refusal. Current law permits Housing Credit limited 
partnership agreements to include a right of first refusal (ROFR) in 
the name of a qualified nonprofit organization, typically the sponsor 
of the property development. Because of ambiguities in the law, further 
reflected in imprecise language in partnership agreements, numerous 
legal disputes have arisen across the country, several resulting in 
drawn out litigation. This situation has been driven not by initial 
Housing Credit investors, but rather by outside capital that has come 
into the industry by buying up control of syndication funds and 
individual investor partnerships. The business purpose of these 
entities is to generate revenues by insisting on back-end cash payments 
from nonprofits as a condition to leaving the partnership. These legal 
disputes over the meaning of right of first refusal language have 
resulted in the unintended transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars 
from affordable housing properties, nonprofit affordable housing 
sponsors, and residents (subject in some cases to higher rents).

    We strongly urge the committee to pass legislation to address this 
issue, by permitting nonprofits to have a simple purchase option 
covering all of the assets of the partnership.

    Qualified Contracts. Under the Qualified Contract provision in 
section 42, owners are permitted to approach the HFA after year 14 and 
give the agency 12 months to find a buyer for the property at a price 
established in the statute. Since the statutory price is so high and 
bears no relationship to the fair market value of the property with the 
rent restrictions, HFAs are rarely able to secure a buyer--which then 
permits the owners to convert their Housing Credit properties to market 
rents after as little as 15 years of affordability. This loophole 
burdens low-income renters and frustrates congressional intent. While 
most HFAs require developers to waive their right to utilize a 
Qualified Contract at the time credits are awarded, too many do not 
require such waivers, especially in the 4-percent credit program.

    According to the National Council of State Housing Finance 
Agencies, more than 100,000 affordable housing units have been lost as 
a result of this. Closing the Qualified Contract loophole would not 
only protect lower-income residents, but it would also save the Federal 
Government money. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the 
provision in the Build Back Better bill would raise $468 million over 
10 years. We urge Congress to repeal the Qualified Contract provision 
as soon as possible.

    4. Exempt from a State's Private Activity Bond cap any bond 
authority used for the recapitalization and resyndication of Housing 
Credit developments. Each year, States receive a finite amount of tax-
exempt Private Activity Bond (PAB) authority to be used for certain 
eligible activities, including multifamily housing, lower rate 
mortgages for low- and moderate-income home buyers, industrial 
development, student loans, and other uses. In most States due to the 
significant need for affordable rental housing, a large majority of PAB 
authority is dedicated to multifamily housing bonds.

    Recently, more and more States have become bond cap-constrained, 
meaning that they have far more need for bond authority than what they 
have available to them under the PAB cap. Nearly half of States report 
being bond cap constrained, and others report that if trends continue 
as they have in recent years, they too soon will be bond cap 
constrained.

    With bond resources inadequate to meet the need, States are forced 
to make difficult decisions. One such decision is how much bond 
authority to commit to resyndication of older Housing Credit 
properties, as the more authority that is used for resyndication, the 
less that is available for new construction, for preservation of other 
aging affordable housing projects originally funded with legacy HUD 
programs, and for conversion of distressed public housing projects into 
privately managed housing under HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration 
(RAD) program.

    Given the need to rehabilitate older Housing Credit properties, and 
the public benefits associated with resetting the long-term 
affordability requirements of properties aging out of affordability 
restrictions, an exemption from the private activity bond cap should be 
enacted for multifamily bonds used to rehab existing Housing Credit 
properties.

    Notably, there is precedent for excluding certain activities from 
the PAB cap. Under current law, private activity bonds not subject to 
cap include bonds issued by 501(c)(3) institutions; as well as bonds 
used to finance airports, docks and wharves, government-owned solid 
waste disposal facilities, highway or surface freight transfers 
facilities, among other priority investments. Rehabilitation of 
affordable housing should also be a priority investment that is exempt 
from the Private Activity Bond cap.
                 iv. neighborhood homes investment act
    LISC, along with over two dozen other national organizations and 
trade associations focused on housing and community revitalization, is 
calling for the enactment of the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act 
(``Neighborhood Homes''), to be introduced in the 118th Congress by 
Senators Ben Cardin and Todd Young. This legislation has wide 
bipartisan support. Similar legislation introduced in the Senate last 
year was cosponsored by 24 Senators, including seven members of the 
Finance Committee. The companion bill in the House was cosponsored by 
109 Representatives in the 117th Congress.

    Neighborhood Homes addresses the need for revitalization and 
repopulation in rural and urban communities suffering from home 
foreclosures and vacant properties. Vacant properties inflict heavy 
costs on American communities: blight, crime, lowered home values, and 
decreased property tax revenue. There are mounting costs and 
difficulties associated with vacant and abandoned properties, 
especially when concentrated within neighborhoods. These neighborhoods 
are trapped in a cycle where low property values prevent the 
construction of new homes and the renovation of existing homes, and 
where the absence of these investments keeps property values 
unsustainably low.

    Similarly, rural communities that don't have a decent stock of 
single family homes have difficulty attracting employers to their 
region, creating additional headwinds for economic development and 
leading to further decline in population and home values.

    Neighborhood Homes is designed to attract private capital to 
support investments in single family homes in these communities--where 
the costs of developing and rehabilitating homes exceed the value of 
the home. Neighborhood Homes would provide the developer or investor 
with a tax credit to cover this ``value gap.'' The tax credit would 
work as follows:

          State allocating agencies (most likely the same State HFAs 
        that administer the Housing Credit) would be provided with a 
        per capital formula allocation Neighborhood Homes Tax Credits, 
        with smaller States receiving a minimum allocation.

          The credits would be awarded by the State agencies to 
        eligible entities through an annual competition. The eligible 
        entity would identify a strategy for developing or 
        rehabilitating properties in eligible communities, either for 
        new homes, existing owner-occupied homes, or for homes that are 
        vacant and will be brought to market.

          States would allocate only the tax credits reasonably needed 
        for financial feasibility, determined both at the time of 
        application and again when homes are sold or owner-occupied 
        rehabilitations are completed.

          The maximum value of the credit would be 35 percent of 
        construction, substantial rehabilitation, and building 
        acquisition and demolition costs in the case of for sale homes; 
        and 50 percent of eligible project costs in the case of owner-
        occupied rehabs.

          The maximum home sales price could not exceed four times the 
        area's median family income.

          The eligible entities would have 5 years to complete the 
        homes, and investors cannot claim the credits on a home until 
        the construction is completed and the home is occupied by an 
        eligible homeowner.

    Neighborhoods characterized by some combination of high poverty, 
low median family income and low home values would be eligible for 
investments. Neighborhood Homes Credit agencies would also have 
additional flexibility to serve rural communities, as well as 
communities impacted by natural disasters, that may not otherwise have 
qualified based on the initial Neighborhood Homes requirements.

    As noted above, Neighborhood Homes would fill the gap between the 
cost of construction and the value of the property, with the private 
market bearing construction and marketing risks--much as is done with 
the Housing Credit. However, the Housing Credit, which was designed to 
create affordable rental housing for low- and very-low-income families, 
cannot readily be utilized to support home-ownership housing. And while 
tax-exempt Private Activity Bonds and mortgage credit certificates 
(MCCs) do support home buyers by reducing mortgage interest costs, 
these incentives do not address supply-side development cost gaps.

    Neighborhood Homes would therefore fill a missing void in our 
affordable housing tax financing ecosystem, providing an effective and 
necessary tool for revitalizing communities and providing affordable 
home-ownership opportunities for first time and minority home buyers. 
Over the next 10 years, it is projected that Neighborhood Homes will 
result in:

          500,000 homes built or substantially rehabilitated.
          $125 billion of total development activity.
          861,000 jobs in construction and construction-related 
        industries.
          $56 billion in wages and salaries.
          $26 billion in Federal tax revenue.
          $12 billion in State and local government revenue.

    We therefore strongly urge Congress to pass the Neighborhood Homes 
Investment Act and thank Senators Cardin and Young for their leadership 
on this very important legislation.
        v. other related tax items the committee should consider

    In addition to the recommendations above pertaining to the Housing 
Credit and to Neighborhood Homes, LISC recommends that the committee 
consider other actions that can be taken to ensure portions of the tax 
code are better aligned to support affordable housing, including:

    1. Making the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program permanent.

    NMTCs are predominantly used to support commercial revitalization, 
businesses and community facilities in lower income communities, and 
are one of the most effective of all Federal economic and redevelopment 
programs--spurring over $120 billion of investments in distressed 
communities and creating over 1 million jobs to date. LISC has deployed 
over $1 billion in NMTC financing since the program's inception, and we 
have seen firsthand how our investments in businesses, commercial real 
estate, and community facilities have complemented our housing work and 
improved the lives of residents in our communities.

    Though NMTCs cannot be used to support residential rental 
properties, some NMTC investments have nonetheless supported housing 
activities--principally through investments in mixed-use commercial 
redevelopment projects that include on site housing, and to a lesser 
extent, home-ownership activities. According to the Treasury 
Department, NMTCs have helped to finance over 18,000 affordable homes.

    The NMTC program is set to expire in 2025. Congress needs to enact 
the New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act of 2023 (S. 234), which was 
introduced by Senators Cardin and Daines last month and already has 10 
other co-sponsors, including six others from the Finance Committee. 
This legislation would make the NMTC program permanent at $5 billion 
per year with annual inflation adjustments, and also allow it to be 
used to offset the Alternative Minimum Tax.

    2. Including restrictions to Opportunity Zone funding so that it 
doesn't support luxury housing or displacement of community residents.

    LISC supports the bipartisan Opportunity Zones Transparency, 
Extension, and Improvement Act (S. 4065) introduced by Senators Corey 
Booker and Tim Scott in the 117th Congress. We particularly appreciated 
the sunsetting of certain higher income census tracts, the requirement 
that Qualified Opportunity Funds report richer data to the Treasury 
Department, and the establishment of the State and Community Dynamism 
Fund. We welcome all of these improvements.

    However, we believe any future version of this legislation should 
also include guard rails to prevent Qualified Opportunity Funds from 
supporting luxury housing. High-end housing doesn't need Federal 
subsidies and may in some instances lead to the displacement of long-
time community residents who deserve to be able to stay in the 
community to enjoy the benefits of redevelopment. We would therefore 
encourage Congress to include affordability restrictions on multifamily 
housing properties financed by Opportunity Funds (for example, by 
requiring that at least 50 percent of the units must be affordable to 
low-income families, and that the remaining units must be affordable to 
families making less than 120 percent of AMI); and to incentivize 
localities to develop anti-displacement strategies in their Opportunity 
Zones, including through the submission of requests for funding under 
the State and Community Dynamism Fund.
                               conclusion
    There can be little doubt we are currently in an affordable housing 
crisis. Rents have been rapidly climbing, supply has been tightening, 
costs of construction have been increasing, and we have underproduced 
roughly 3.8 million homes. On the 
single-family side, home prices have cooled of late but still remain 
historically high, and elevated interest rates make it even more 
difficult for first-time home buyers to purchase a home. And sadly, 
home-ownership disparities between racial and ethnic groups stubbornly 
persist, with little gains made over the past 3 decades.

    The good news is that solutions are out there, and they have wide 
bipartisan support in Congress. Restoring the lapsed 12.5-percent 
increase to the formula allocation for the 9-percent Housing Credits 
and passing the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act will create 2 
million additional affordable rental homes over the next decade than 
would otherwise be built, while also supporting nearly 3 million jobs 
and bringing in $120 billion in additional tax revenue. Enacting the 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act will create 500,000 new starter 
homes, providing home-
ownership opportunities for first-time and minority home buyers while 
simultaneously repopulating and revitalizing under-resourced rural and 
urban communities.

    I thank you again for this opportunity to testify. I hope that the 
conversations we have today will bring us closer to enacting these 
critical housing bills and put us on a path to ensuring that all 
families in this country will be able to enjoy the health, well-being 
and financial security that an affordable home provides.

           Questions Submitted for the Record to Denise Scott
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse
    Question. Rhode Island college graduates of the class of 2020 
graduated with an average of $36,791 in outstanding student loan debt. 
At the same time, the National Association of Realtors reports that 
housing affordability reached the worst level on record in the fourth 
quarter of 2022. Last Congress, I introduced several bills to ease the 
burden of student loan debt, including canceling student loan debt for 
front-line health-care workers and teachers.

    For those with tens of thousands--and in some cases hundreds of 
thousands--of dollars of student loan debt, how does their debt affect 
their ability to buy a home or afford rent?

    Answer. The rise in student loan debt impacts access to affordable 
rental housing and home-ownership opportunities. Research has shown \1\ 
that a $1,000 increase in student loan debt lowers the home-ownership 
rate by about 1.8 percentage points for public 4-year college-goers 
during their mid-20s, equivalent to an average delay of about 4 months 
in attaining home ownership. The same research also indicates that 
higher student loan balances have an impact on credit scores, due to 
increased probability of student loan delinquencies, which makes 
obtaining a mortgage more difficult. According to the Urban 
Institute,\2\ as student loan debt has increased, the home-ownership 
rate has decreased for people ages 24 to 32, falling by 9 percentage 
points--nearly double the drop as that for the overall population. This 
has an impact on our Nation's racial home-ownership gap since Black 
students take on greater debt, hindering their access to home-ownership 
opportunities.

    \2\ https://housingmatters.urban.org/articles/how-student-loan-
debt-affects-racial-homeownership-gap.

    Higher amounts of student debt often cause these borrowers to rent 
for longer periods of time due to credit score challenges and 
insufficient resources to enter the housing market, including a lack of 
down payment and closing costs. As rental housing demand has risen, and 
outpaced supply, prices have increased. Census bureau data \3\ has 
shown that renters are more likely than homeowners to be cost burdened.

burden.html.

    Question. Over the past 2 decades, the growing cost of child care 
has outpaced inflation. Child-care costs for Rhode Island families can 
now reach more than $10,000 per year annually for each child, and many 
families now are paying nearly 30 percent of their incomes on child 
care. At the same time, the National Association of Realtors reports 
that housing affordability reached the worst level on record in the 
fourth quarter of 2022. Indeed, according to HousingWorksRI, there are 
currently no communities in Rhode Island where families earning the 
State's median income or less can afford to buy a home, and there's 
only one community--Burrillville--where Rhode Islanders can affordably 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rent.

    How does the high and growing cost of child care affect families' 
ability to buy a home or afford rent?

    Answer. The high cost of child care--which adjusted for inflation, 
has increased by 49 percent \4\ over the last 25 years--leaves families 
with less money to buy or rent a home and makes it very difficult to 
save money for home ownership or rent larger homes for their growing 
households. Research by the Department of Labor \5\ has documented that 
the cost of child care consumes a significant percentage of median 
family income across all care types, age groups, and county population 
sizes, making it challenging for families to accrue savings and more 
difficult for many working parents to reenter or remain in the 
workforce. The impact of the cost of care is felt most profoundly by 
women, and by low-income families whose child-care costs represent a 
greater proportion of their household income. Families that pay for 
care for multiple children have even greater expenses and effectively 
face even greater barriers to home ownership and rental affordability. 
These problems are compounded by insufficient Federal assistance for 
child care and affordable housing needs.

NDCP-final.pdf.

    Fortunately, there are ways that the Federal Government can begin 
to address the important linkages between child care and housing in 
order to improve the overall economic and social circumstances of 
families struggling to find affordable care. The development of 
affordable housing in high-need communities can be leveraged to 
increase access to quality care for children and families, most notably 
by constructing affordable housing that incentivizes center and home-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
based providers to ``co-locate'' on site.

    Additionally, we need dedicated, stand-alone Federal funding to 
support the acquisition, construction, and renovation of child-care 
facilities to help alleviate some of the cost burden shouldered by 
child-care providers seeking to serve additional families. Rhode Island 
has a model that could be replicated in other places to address 
facilities needs. LISC Rhode Island operates the Rhode Island Child 
Care and Early Learning Facilities Fund (RICCELFF)\6\--a public-private 
partnership designed to help child-care and early learning programs 
develop safe, high-quality learning environments--indoors and outdoors. 
As part of the Fund, LISC offers various opportunities for funding for 
planning, improvement and expansion of child care spaces.

    Question. Rhode Island is the second-densest State in our union, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
second only to New Jersey.

    For States like mine, where people live in much closer proximity to 
each other than elsewhere in the Nation but which still have a housing 
shortfall, what are the best practices and reforms for encouraging 
affordable housing development while still preserving livable 
communities and local character?

    Answer. Communities of all types desperately need additional 
affordable housing. There are numerous strategies for increasing 
affordable housing supply, including in older, higher-density 
communities. For instance, many localities provide modest density 
bonuses, which allow developers to build more units than normally 
allowed in exchange for committing a certain percentage as affordable. 
Other strategies include taking actions at the local level which reduce 
construction costs for affordable housing production, including 
expedited permitting, less parking requirements for developments near 
transit, tax abatements, and reduced fees. In addition, many 
municipalities are making it easier for homeowners to build accessory 
dwelling units (ADUs) or to subdivide lots to create more housing 
opportunities. These strategies work best through robust community 
engagement efforts.

    Something to watch at the Federal level is a new pilot program at 
HUD, called the ``Yes In My Backyard''\7\ initiative, that will provide 
$85 million in competitive grants to municipalities to encourage them 
to pursue innovative land use and zoning policies to promote the 
development of more affordable housing.

    Question. What programs are most effective for creative reuse of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
existing structures?

    Answer. Adaptive reuse of vacant and abandoned buildings is 
essential for revitalizing and repopulating communities, attracting 
commercial businesses, and increasing the municipal tax base for 
further investments in schools and public services. However, these 
types of projects tend to be more expensive than new construction 
projects, given that the buildings in many instances are older, need to 
be repurposed, and often have environmental remediation issues than 
need to be addressed. The Federal housing and community development tax 
credits have been essential tools in financing adaptive reuse housing 
properties. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, often used in 
conjunction with Historic Tax Credits, has proven to be a very 
effective source of financing for converting former industrial 
facilities, schools, hotels, and office space into affordable housing 
for low-income families. Similarly, New Markets Tax Credits, which can 
also be utilized in conjunction with Historic Tax Credits, have 
frequently been used to convert abandoned buildings into mixed use 
properties with housing built atop retail stores or community 
facilities.

    The National Equity Fund (NEF), LISC's tax credit syndication arm, 
is in the process of closing on a mixed use project that will support 
70 units of housing, including 55 units of LIHTC housing, across three 
adjacent properties in the Island Place Historic District along the 
Blackstone River in Woonsocket. All three buildings are former 
industrial buildings which were originally constructed in the late 
1800s and are now being converted to properties with affordable housing 
placed atop commercial facilities. The properties are very proximate to 
public transportation and other neighborhood amenities, and residents 
will be provided extensive supportive services including credit 
counseling, after-school programming, health referral services, and 
access to free or inexpensive high-speed Internet.

    Though not technically adaptive reuse, older apartment buildings 
can fall into such disrepair that the only way to restore the 
properties to productive use is through extensive and substantial 
rehabilitation. In these instances, Low-Income Housing Tax Credits are 
often paired with resources from the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development's HOME Investment Partnership Program, Federal Home 
Loan Bank Affordable Housing Program, city and State tax credit and 
loan programs, and private debt to renovate existing buildings. 
Developers will often build additional affordable multifamily housing 
units at these properties while they are undergoing renovation and 
rehabilitation, if financially feasible and allowed by local zoning.

    In Providence, LISC/NEF is helping to finance 36 units of LIHTC 
housing as part of 79 units of housing developed as part of the Joseph 
Caffey apartments and Jordan Caffey townhomes. This project is on the 
former site of Barbara Jordan Homes, a property that consisted of 26 
vacant and dilapidated homes that had gone into foreclosure in 2015 and 
had sat vacant since then. The 79 units will be spread among 11

    Question. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit is one of the primary 
Federal programs for creating and preserving affordable housing units. 
In Rhode Island, nearly 70 percent of new affordable units are financed 
using LIHTC. Last Congress, I cosponsored Senator Cantwell's Affordable 
Housing Credit Improvement Act, which would make a number of changes to 
LIHTC to further incentivize the building of affordable housing.

    How would the bill bolster our affordable housing supply?

    Answer. The AHCIA includes close to two dozen provisions that would 
enhance and improve the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. According to 
estimates provided by Novogradac and Associates,\8\ there are two 
provisions in particular that would create close to 2 million 
additional units of affordable housing over the next 10 years, helping 
to house close to 4.5 million people:

estimates-193-million-additional-affordable-rental-homes-could-be-
financed-if-lihtc.

    1. Lowering the bond financing threshold for 4-percent Housing 
Credits from 50 percent of project costs to 25-percent of project costs 
(section 313). State housing finance agencies (HFAs) can issue ``4-
percent credits,'' which typically cover about 25-30 percent of total 
financing costs, to help fill equity gaps in projects that are financed 
by Private Activity Bonds. However, by statue, HFAs can only issue 4-
percent Housing Credits to projects in which at least 50 percent of the 
costs are financed by Private Activity Bonds. In many instances, 
developers will seek bond financing even though it may be more 
expensive than other sources of debt solely because it will trigger the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
equity from the tax credits.

    A growing number of States have become ``bond cap-constrained'' in 
recent years, meaning they have more demand for affordable housing than 
they are able to finance with their existing PAB volume cap authority. 
Because of the high bond financing threshold, States are forced to put 
more of a scarce and needed resource into each individual property than 
what that property actually needs, just to unlock the full amount of 4-
percent credits. In effect, the 50-percent threshold limits States' 
ability to build and preserve affordable housing.

    By lowering the bond financing threshold from 50 percent to 25 
percent, States that are bond-constrained will now be able to use these 
scarce resources to finance additional housing properties and, as 
critically, supplement this financing with additional allocations of 4-
percent credits to those properties. It is estimated that this would 
result in an additional 1.48 million homes being produced over the next 
10 years.

    2. Increasing the formula for the 9-percent credit (section 101). 
States are allocated 9-percent credits based upon a per capita formula, 
with a minimum formula amount provided to States with smaller 
populations. This formula allocation was increased by 12.5 percent for 
each year from 2018-2021, but this increase has now expired. The AHCIA 
would permanently extend this increase, and also provide an additional 
increase to the formula of 50 percent, phased in over 2 years. It is 
estimated that this provision would result in an additional 450,000 
homes being developed over the next 10 years.

    Question. Are there improvements to the program that weren't 
included in the bill that the Senate should consider?

    Answer. Yes. As noted in our long form testimony, we believe that 
Congress can do more to help prevent the loss of existing affordable 
housing properties and resources. There are two issues in particular 
with the Housing Credit program that we believe are critical for 
Congress to address that were not included in the AHCIA in the last 
Congress. These issues have been before Congress for several years, but 
enactment has been elusive in spite of the efforts of Chairman Wyden, 
most recently in the Decent, Affordable, Safe Housing for all Act, the 
DASH Act. The first issue is the Right of First Refusal in section 
42(i)(7) of the code. The second issue is the Qualified Contract 
provision in section 42(h)(6)(E)(i)(II).

    Right of First Refusal. Current law permits Housing Credit limited 
partnership agreements to include a right of first refusal (ROFR) in 
the name of a qualified nonprofit organization, typically the sponsor 
of the property development. Because of ambiguities in the law, further 
reflected in imprecise language in partnership agreements, numerous 
legal disputes have arisen across the country, several resulting in 
drawn out litigation. This situation has been driven not by initial 
Housing Credit investors, but rather by outside capital that has come 
into the industry by buying up control of syndication funds and 
individual investor partnerships. The business purpose of these 
entities is to generate revenues by insisting on back-end cash payments 
from nonprofits as a condition to leaving the partnership. These legal 
disputes over the meaning of right of first refusal language have 
resulted in the unintended transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars 
from affordable housing properties, nonprofit affordable housing 
sponsors, and residents (subject in some cases to higher rents).

    We strongly urge the committees to pass legislation to address this 
issue, by permitting nonprofits to have a simple purchase option 
covering all of the assets of the partnership.

    Qualified Contracts: Under the Qualified Contract provision in 
section 42, owners are permitted to approach the HFA after year 14 and 
give the agency 12 months to find a buyer for the property at a price 
established in the statute. Since the statutory price is so high and 
bears no relationship to the fair market value of the property with the 
rent restrictions, HFAs are rarely able to secure a buyer--which then 
permits the owners to convert their Housing Credit properties to market 
rents after as little as 15 years of affordability. This loophole 
burdens low-income renters and frustrates congressional intent. While 
most HFAs require developers to waive their right to utilize a 
Qualified Contract at the time credits are awarded, too many do not 
require such waivers, especially in the 4-percent credit program.

    According to the National Council of State Housing Finance 
Agencies, more than 100,000 affordable housing units have been lost as 
a result of this. Closing the Qualified Contract loophole would not 
only protect lower-income residents, but it would also save the Federal 
Government money. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the 
provision in the Build Back Better bill would raise $468 million over 
10 years. We urge Congress to repeal the Qualified Contract provision 
as soon as possible.

    Question. President Biden has proposed a $15,000 Federal, 
refundable first-time homebuyers tax credit to assist low- and middle-
income families in purchasing their first homes. This tax credit would 
be advanceable, meaning that homebuyers would receive the tax credit 
when they make the purchase instead of waiting to receive the 
assistance when they file taxes the following year.

    Would you support such a program, and how would such a program 
ameliorate the difficulties families today are facing when buying a 
home?

    Answer. LISC supports more resources, including incentives in the 
tax code, that can support home-ownership opportunities for first-time 
and minority homebuyers. One of the biggest barriers to affordable and 
sustainable home ownership for low-income and BIPOC families is an 
inability to save enough for a down payment and closing costs. Small 
investments in down payment assistance support affordable home-
ownership opportunities for families that can afford a home mortgage 
but lack the wealth to get their foot in the door. The Federal 
Government's primary tool for supporting first-time homebuyers and 
those with lower incomes is through the Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA). The FHA insures private home mortgages and, importantly, 
requires a down payment of only 3.5 percent and allows for lower credit 
scores. Even with a low down payment requirement, many families 
struggle to pay these costs. And while HUD's Community Development 
Block Grant and HOME Investment Partnership programs can be used for 
down-payment assistance, these block grant programs are insufficiently 
funded and also utilized for many other pressing needs locally.

    LISC supports targeted down payment assistance programs so that 
more resources can be made available to support affordable home 
ownership for all creditworthy families. An advanceable credit as 
proposed by the Biden administration would be strengthened by targeted 
outreach and technical assistance to ensure that families are aware of 
this opportunity.

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
    Question. As you know, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) 
program is one of the most successful Federal housing programs. Since 
its creation, the LIHTC program has served over 8 million low-income 
households, supported 6 million jobs, and generated $239 billion in 
local, State, and Federal tax revenue. One of the facets of the LIHTC 
program that makes it so successful is the public-private partnership 
aspect.

    Can you please discuss the importance of this partnership in making 
the LIHTC program as successful as it is?

    Answer. We believe that first and foremost, the public-private 
partnership allows for more efficient and robust program oversight. 
Investors, with their own capital at risk, impose underwriting and 
asset management oversight. The investor due diligence leads to a more 
robust and efficient compliance monitoring system, and results in 
projects that are financially strong. This is likely the primary reason 
that Housing Credit properties far outperform other real estate 
classes,\9\ with occupancy rates topping 96 percent nationwide and a 
cumulative foreclosure rate of just 0.66 percent over the program's 
history.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ https://financialequity.net/publications/low-income-housing-
tax-credit-year-30-recent-investment-performance-2013-2014/.

    In addition, investors and developers--not taxpayers--assume the 
financial risks of these projects. If projects are not in compliance 
with statutory requirements, tax credits are forfeited back to the 
Treasury. In the case of the Housing Credit, investors cannot even 
begin claiming credits until the apartments are occupied by low-income 
families at affordable rents. This is in stark contrast to most Federal 
grant-making programs, in which grants are advanced and an agency must 
seek a return of funds (often after they are already spent) in the case 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
of program noncompliance.

    Question. My colleague Senator Cantwell and I are planning to 
reintroduce our Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act later this 
spring. Can you please describe the impact the AHCIA would have on the 
communities you serve?

    Answer. The AHCIA would have an incredible impact on the families, 
as well as the communities, that LISC serves.

    As noted in Harvard University's State of the Nation's Housing 
Report,\10\ data indicates that our Nation is in the midst of an 
affordable housing crisis. Rents increased a record 11.6 percent at the 
end of 2021 and remained at an elevated pace during the first quarter 
of 2022. This was the largest year-over-year increase in 2 decades and 
more than three times the 3.2 percent average annual rise in the 5 
years preceding the pandemic. At the same time, rising interest rates, 
post-COVID supply chain disruptions, and labor force shortages are 
significantly increasing the costs of housing production, and creating 
gaps in financing that threaten the ability to move forward with 
properties, including some properties that have already been awarded 
housing credits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/state-nations-housing-2022.

    The AHCIA would address issues related to increased rent and lack 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
of production in three fundamental ways:

    1. It would increase the formula for the 9-percent credit by 50 
percent, phased in over 2 years. Novogradac and Associates has 
estimated \11\ that this will lead to an additional 450,000 homes being 
developed over the next 10 years. As importantly, enacting this 
provision would immediately provide Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) 
with additional credits that, at their discretion, could be allocated 
to already approved projects in their pipeline that are experiencing 
unforeseen financing gaps or rising debt costs that could threaten 
project feasibility.

estimates-193-million-additional-affordable-rental-homes-could-be-
financed-if-lihtc.

    2. It would lower the bond financing threshold for use of 4-percent 
Housing Credits from 50 percent of project costs to 25 percent of 
project costs. By lowering the bond financing threshold, States that 
are bond constrained will now be able to use these scarce resources to 
finance additional housing properties and, as critically, supplement 
this financing with additional allocations of 4-percent credits to 
those properties. Novogradac estimates \12\ that this would result in 
an additional 1.48 million homes being produced over the next 10 years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ https://www.novoco.com/notes-from-novogradac/novogradac-
estimates-193-million-additional-affordable-rental-homes-could-be-
financed-if-lihtc.

    3. It would provide ``basis boosts'' to certain properties, 
including projects targeting extremely low-income families, rural 
projects, projects serving Native American communities, and also for 
certain 4-percent projects. This will enable HFAs to finance those 
properties that may not otherwise be financially feasible, given the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
rising costs of production.

    Beyond providing opportunities for stable and affordable housing 
for low- and 
extremely-low-income families, the Housing Credit has also proven to be 
a very effective tool for community revitalization. This is due in 
large part to a statutory preference for projects that contribute to a 
concerted community revitalization plan. As a result, many projects are 
now being evaluated by HFAs to determine whether they will contribute 
towards holistic community development, including, for example, through 
the adaptive reuse of vacant properties, co-location with community 
facilities, and location near transit hubs.

    For example, the National Equity Fund, LISC's tax credit 
syndication arm, helped finance Englewood Lofts, the adaptive reuse of 
an historic church originally built in 1895 in Indianapolis's Old 
Northside neighborhood. The building sat vacant for the last several 
years until the sponsor, Englewood Development Company, acquired it in 
2013. The property is part of the city's Old Northside Historic Area 
Preservation Plan, an effort to restore the community, which spans 
approximately 55 city blocks. The original elements of the building's 
facade were preserved while the interior was completely gutted and 
transformed into 15 one-bedroom residences configured in a combination 
of flats and lofts in addition to nine two-bedroom flats. Rents are 
affordable to families' earning 30-60 percent of Area Median Income, 
with 10 percent set aside for people with special needs. Huser 
SpecialCare, a family-owned provider of services for children and 
adults with developmental disabilities, provides referrals and a range 
of services tailored to the disabled residents including shopping and 
housekeeping assistance, in-home health care, fitness instruction and 
nutrition counseling.

    Question. I appreciate LISC's support of the Neighborhood Homes 
Investment Act (NHIA), which Senator Cardin and I recently introduced.

    Can you please describe the impact the NHIA would have on the 
communities you serve? Why is it important that we not only support 
affordable rental housing, but also affordable home ownership?

    Answer. Neighborhood Homes addresses the need for revitalization 
and repopulation in rural and urban communities suffering from home 
foreclosures and vacant properties. Vacant properties inflict heavy 
costs on American communities: blight, crime, lowered home values, and 
decreased property tax revenue. There are mounting costs and 
difficulties associated with vacant and abandoned properties, 
especially when concentrated within neighborhoods. These neighborhoods 
are trapped in a cycle where low property values prevent the 
construction of new homes and the renovation of existing homes, and 
where the absence of these investments keeps property values 
unsustainably low.

    Similarly, rural communities that don't have a decent stock of 
single-family homes have difficulty attracting employers to their 
region, creating additional headwinds for economic development and 
leading to further decline in population and home values.

    Neighborhood Homes is designed to attract private capital to 
support investments in single family homes in these communities--where 
the costs of developing and rehabilitating homes exceed the value of 
the home. Neighborhood Homes would provide the developer or investor 
with a tax credit to cover this ``value gap.'' We believe an incentive 
like Neighborhood Homes is critically needed now, to spur construction 
of starter homes in lower-income communities.

    LISC believes that it is critical to support home-ownership 
housing, as this is the primary path to wealth building in this 
country. It's noteworthy that close to two-thirds of NHIA eligible 
communities are majority-minority communities, creating an opportunity 
to significantly cut into the home-ownership gap. According to the 
Treasury Department,\13\ in the second quarter of 2022, the home-
ownership rate for White households was 75 percent compared to 45 
percent for Black households, 48 percent for Hispanic households, and 
57 percent for non-Hispanic households of any other race. These gaps in 
home-ownership rates have changed little over the last three decades. 
In fact, the same Treasury report noted that the Black-White gap in 
home-ownership rates was the same in 2020 as it was in 1970, just 2 
years after the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which sought 
to end racial discrimination in the housing market. These disparities 
limit the ability of families of color to achieve their home-ownership 
goals and limits asset building opportunities, contributing to our 
Nation's racial wealth gap.

        Prepared Statement of Steve Walker, Executive Director, 
              Washington State Housing Finance Commission
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the committee, 
thank you for this opportunity to testify on the vital role tax 
policy--specifically the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (Housing Credit) 
and tax-exempt private-activity Housing Bonds--play in combating the 
housing crisis that low-income working households face. These programs 
are by far the most important tools we have to increase the supply of 
affordable housing--both through new production and preservation--and 
help low- and moderate-income families become home buyers.

    I am Steve Walker, executive director of the Washington State 
Housing Finance Commission (WSHFC), which is the State of Washington's 
Housing Finance Agency (HFA). HFAs are State-chartered, mission-driven 
agencies that address the full spectrum of affordable housing need, 
from homelessness to home ownership. For more than 50 years, HFAs have 
played a central role in the Nation's affordable housing system, 
delivering more than $700 billion in financing to make possible the 
purchase, development, and rehabilitation of more than 8.1 million 
affordable homes.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ State HFA Factbook: 2021 NCSHA Annual Survey Results, The 
National Council of State Housing Agencies, 2022.

    On behalf of the HFAs' national trade association, the National 
Council of State Housing Agencies, I want to begin by thanking you, Mr. 
Chairman, for being a steadfast champion of the Housing Credit and 
Housing Bonds for many years. We particularly appreciate your vision 
for solving the affordable housing crisis, as outlined in the Decent, 
Safe, Affordable Housing for All (DASH) Act. I also want to thank you, 
Senator Crapo, for always being a supporter of State HFAs, and in 
particular for your support of tax-exempt Housing Bonds. Lastly, I want 
to acknowledge Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Todd Young (R-IN) for 
their leadership as the sponsors of the Affordable Housing Credit 
Improvement Act, passage of which is the most important thing Congress 
could do to address the imbalance between supply and demand for 
affordable rental housing.
         insufficient supply is our nation's most significant 
                      affordable housing challenge
    While the housing crisis is multifaceted, I am pleased this hearing 
focuses squarely on the biggest driver of that crisis: the inadequate 
supply of affordable rental and for-sale homes. This is certainly the 
case in Washington State where every part of our State--especially, but 
not only, the Seattle area--is experiencing unprecedented housing 
instability driven by a growing gap between incomes and housing costs. 
According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, our State would 
need to build almost 160,000 apartments just to fulfill today's 
immediate need for housing for the lowest-income families--to say 
nothing of those with higher incomes who are struggling to find 
appropriate housing.

    America has been in the midst of a housing crisis for a long time, 
but never has the need been more acute than it is today. In particular, 
and especially since the Great Recession when many developers left the 
industry, our Nation has drastically under-produced both rental and 
for-sale housing. We are currently seeing the repercussions of the 
extreme mismatch between supply and demand.

    Meanwhile, in the 2-year period from early 2020 to early 2022, the 
number of renter households grew by 1.1 million to 44.2 million.\2\ 
With rising interest rates and escalating home prices, would-be 
homeowners are stuck renting at the same time millennials, many of whom 
put off household formation, are now entering the rental market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ The State of the Nation's Housing 2022, Joint Center for 
Housing Studies of Harvard University, June 2022.

    The sheer number of new renters, without corresponding housing 
production, has driven historically low vacancy rates and skyrocketing 
rents, with rents in most major markets spiking by double digits 
between 2021 and 2022.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Ibid.

    Demand-side programs, such as Housing Choice Vouchers, and supply-
side programs, like the Housing Credit, play different and 
complementary roles in meeting affordable housing needs. Rental 
assistance works most effectively in markets with an adequate supply of 
quality housing and landlords willing to rent to voucher holders. Those 
well-supplied markets are certainly not to be found in Washington 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
State, or in many areas of the country.

    In fact, lack of supply has become a significant problem everywhere 
in urban, suburban, and rural areas. In Seattle, housing construction 
has lagged so far behind the growing population that rents have 
skyrocketed out of reach of all but the 
highest-paid workers. Families, especially families of color, have been 
pushed farther and farther out of the metro area in search of 
affordable rents. Suburban areas in turn are rapidly becoming less 
affordable, and rural areas also feel the pinch. Every part of 
Washington is experiencing similar dynamics. Unfortunately, a rental 
voucher is only helpful if a unit can be found.

    Instead, in these areas with tight housing supplies, programs like 
the Housing Credit are essential. They not only generally expand supply 
in tight markets, they also produce housing for households with special 
needs, build properties in areas experiencing job growth, recapitalize 
and preserve aging properties, and revitalize communities victimized by 
systemic racism.

    Ideally, both supply- and demand-side resources would be available 
as needed in communities across the Nation: supply-side programs to 
ensure we can build and preserve the housing we need, and demand-side 
programs so that the most vulnerable among us will not be rent-
burdened.
 the critical role of the housing credit and multifamily housing bonds
    There is a fundamental market failure when it comes to affordable 
housing supply. It simply costs too much to build housing to rent it at 
rates low-income people can afford absent a financial incentive such as 
the Housing Credit. Developers will tell you it is economically 
infeasible for them to build rental housing without the equity derived 
from the Credit unless they charge rents that are well out of the reach 
of low-income families.

    The Housing Credit and Housing Bonds are by far the state HFAs' 
most essential production tools. The Credit is a highly successful 
public-private partnership that draws on state HFAs' sophisticated 
underwriting, asset management, and oversight capacity, as well as 
private-sector experience and investment. It is the most efficient 
means of increasing rental housing supply, while transferring risk to 
private-sector investors rather than taxpayers. Since the Credit's 
establishment in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, it has financed more than 
3.7 million affordable rental homes for low-income families, seniors, 
veterans, and those with special needs.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ State HFA Factbook: 2021 NCSHA Annual Survey Results, National 
Council of State Housing Agencies, 2022.

    In recent years, more than half of Housing Credit homes have been 
financed with the help of multifamily Housing Bonds, which trigger the 
4-percent Housing Credit. In Washington State, multifamily Housing 
Bonds play an even more outsized role as we have maximized this 
critical resource, partnering closely with both nonprofit and for-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
profit developers.

    Together, Housing Credits and Housing Bonds are helping low-income 
working families, seniors, people with disabilities, and those who have 
experienced homelessness. While the Housing Credit program generally 
serves low-income households earning 60 percent of area median income 
(AMI) or less, with congressional direction to serve the lowest income 
households possible, in practice the program reaches families with 
incomes much lower than its top-most statutory limits. In fact, 53 
percent of households living in Housing Credit apartments are 
extremely-low-income, meaning they earn 30 percent or less of AMI, and 
another 31 percent are very-low-income, earning between 30 and 50 
percent of AMI.\5\

    \5\ Tenants in LIHTC Units as of December 31, 2019, U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and 
Research.

    A study by Freddie Mac found that the average Housing Credit rent 
payment was 38 percent lower than the market-rate rent for a comparable 
apartment in an analysis of nine metropolitan areas across the Nation. 
This is certainly indicative of what we see in Washington. In December, 
we approved financing for several apartment buildings where the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
proposed rents were up to 60 percent lower than market rents.

    Moreover, the benefits of the Housing Credit go beyond the savings 
it provides to low-income households. Rigorous academic research has 
quantified many of these indirect benefits.

          Stanford researchers assessed the impact of the Housing 
        Credit and found ``an affordable housing development in a low-
        income area improves welfare by $23,000 per local homeowner and 
        $6,500 per local renter, with aggregate welfare benefits to

 the impact of rising costs on development of affordable rental housing
    Unfortunately, the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has 
made it even harder to produce rental housing. The costs of many 
commodities necessary for construction have gone up drastically, while 
supply chain disruptions create development delays that further 
increase costs, and developers struggle to find skilled workers and 
subcontractors.

    According to the National Association of Home Builders, since 
Spring 2020, prices have gone up for frame lumber by 25 percent, copper 
by 187 percent, aluminum by 72 percent, steel mill products by 79 
percent, plastic construction products by 55 percent, brick by 25 
percent, interior paint by 47 percent, and exterior paint by 62 
percent.\12\

    \12\ Data provided by the National Association of Home Builders to 
the National Council of State Housing Agencies.

    Some have criticized the Housing Credit by claiming that up-front 
costs for the program are higher than those for market-rate housing. 
However, a 2018 report by Abt Associates found that Housing Credit new 
construction between 2011 and 2016 averaged $190,804 per unit.\13\ Data 
from Dodge Data and Analytics on the multifamily market as a whole over 
the same time period suggests that the average per-unit cost for new 
construction was approximately $188,710.\14\

    Furthermore, affordable housing produced with the Housing Credit 
and other governmental programs has certain up-front development costs 
that market-rate housing does not have. Unlike market-rate developers, 
Housing Credit developers do not make a profit by charging high rents 
or by selling a property once it has appreciated in value. Instead, 
they are compensated for their work by receiving a developer fee, which 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
is factored into the total development cost on the front end.

    Affordable housing developments that have certain HUD financing may 
also be subject to prevailing wage requirements. Housing Credit 
investors also require reserves capitalized on the front end so that 
owners would be able to respond to maintenance and future operational 
needs over the affordability period. Sadly, neighborhood opposition to 
affordable housing in some locations can result in delays, leading to 
increased costs. These factors contribute to why a simple comparison of 
Housing Credit and market-rate development costs without context is not 
a reasonable analogy.
  congressional action is needed to address the rental housing crisis
    Despite the vast and growing need and the escalating costs of 
production, the Housing Credit has suffered a recent cut to resources. 
A hard-won increase in Housing Credit resources, which Senator Cantwell 
was instrumental in achieving in 2018, expired at the end of 2021. That 
means State HFAs have fewer Credits to provide to developers now, at a 
time when their costs have gone up substantially and demand is 
unprecedented.

    Costs are rising so quickly that projects in the pipeline often 
must be re-underwritten before completion, sometimes several times, to 
address financing gaps. This has caused tremendous problems as States 
and their developer partners try to find creative ways of filling these 
unexpected, gaping holes in project financing.

    In some cases, developers of projects that were initially provided 
Credits in prior years try to fill the gaps by asking for a subsequent 
allocation of Credits from the state's current-year authority. Even if 
this is possible, backfilling older deals means the State will have far 
less Credit authority with which to fund new proposals.

    Another reason cost increases are particularly problematic is that 
bond-financed projects risk missing the 50-percent threshold 
requirement for maximizing Housing Credit resources (discussed further 
below). With prices going up quickly, some projects risk failing this 
threshold test and thus failing to trigger the full amount of critical 
Housing Credit.

    The Federal Government has delayed far too long in taking the steps 
our Nation needs to address the housing crisis. We are now seeing the 
repercussions of that delay in rapidly escalating rents, and it is our 
most vulnerable residents who pay the price.

    The good news is, we know what works, and we have the right tools 
in hand. By far, the most impactful thing Congress could do to meet the 
need is to pass Senator Cantwell and Senator Young's Affordable Housing 
Credit Improvement Act (AHCIA). More than half of this committee 
cosponsored this legislation in the 117th Congress, and I urge all to 
do so upon its reintroduction this year.

    The AHCIA is comprehensive legislation that would expand and 
strengthen the Housing Credit. While it includes many policy changes--
some of which are no-cost, common-sense, good governance improvements 
based on over 3 decades of program administration--I'd like to focus on 
how the bill would expand the Housing Credit, as these are the 
provisions that add to supply.

    The AHCIA would make a significant increase in Housing Credit 
allocation authority for what we call the ``9-percent'' Housing Credit. 
The 9-percent credit is the component of the program that provides the 
more substantial subsidy to developments. These Credits are highly 
competitive, and States often use them to finance the most challenging 
and needed properties for the highest-risk populations. In Washington, 
we have prioritized this deeper-subsidy program for supportive housing, 
which provides both housing and essential services for the homeless and 
most vulnerable. This kind of housing supports special-need populations 
not only in Seattle but also in communities of every size across 
Washington. This is also the program most impacted by the expiration of 
the 2018 expansion to the program--which allowed us to build three more 
of these critically needed properties each year for which it was in 
place.

    The other major provision in this legislation that would 
substantially increase supply is the reduction of the bond financing 
threshold, sometimes called the 50-
percent test. For Washington, this is probably the most impactful 
action Congress could take to increase supply.

    To maximize the 4-percent credit equity available to an individual 
deal, developers must use multifamily bonds to cover at least 50 
percent of the development cost. That means to unlock the 4-percent 
credits, States need to make a significant investment of our Federal 
Private Activity Bond (PAB) cap in each development.

    In Washington State, we have long prioritized our Federal PAB cap 
for housing, using every dollar of this finite resource. Yet in our 
most recent competitive round for this funding, we received $1 billion 
in requests for shovel-ready housing projects, while having only $250 
million to allocate. This has become typical: over the past 5 years, 
three to four times as much bond authority has been requested as we 
could fulfill--all viable, fully ready housing projects that must wait 
on the shelf as construction costs continue to rise. More and more 
States are like Washington in this regard: according to research by 
Novogradac and Tiber Hudson, 18 States were oversubscribed for PAB cap 
as of March 2023.

    Covering at least 50 percent of a project's total cost with 
multifamily bonds, which contribute debt, makes no sense from a 
financing perspective. Because the project cannot support that much 
debt over the long run, the developer must refinance the project to pay 
off the bond debt to put in place permanent financing at a much lower 
debt level that the project can reasonably support. This practice is 
inefficient, adds cost, and prevents States from spreading bond 
resources to more quality affordable housing projects.

    If instead this bond-financing threshold was lowered to 25 percent, 
half the bond cap would be needed to access the same amount of Housing 
Credits for individual properties--effectively allowing us to double 
total Multifamily Bond production. According to an estimate by 
Novogradac, a reduction to a 25-percent threshold would finance 51,800 
additional affordable homes in Washington State over the 10-year period 
beginning in 2023. It is this type of common-sense reform to the 
Housing Credit and Multifamily Bond programs that will allow Washington 
and other States to dramatically scale production to address supply 
challenges.

    The AHCIA also includes other provisions that would increase 
production by providing basis boosts for properties in rural areas, 
those benefiting tribal populations, and those housing extremely low-
income households, as well as expanding the number of areas where basis 
boosts are allowed because the area qualifies as a Qualified Census 
Tract or Difficult Development Area. The AHCIA also gives States 
discretion to provide a 30-percent boost to 4-percent credit properties 
as needed for financial feasibility.
             protecting taxpayers' investment by combating 
                   threats to long-term affordability
    Without question, we need to build more affordable housing. But we 
also need to preserve the affordable properties in which the taxpayer 
has already invested through the Housing Credit and Multifamily Bonds. 
Housing Credit properties are expected to remain restricted for at 
least 30 years. However, there is a loophole in the law that allows 
owners to terminate the affordability restrictions any time after the 
15th year through a process called Qualified Contract.

    Under the Qualified Contract provision of the tax code, an owner of 
a Housing Credit property may, after Year 14, require that the State 
Housing Credit Agency find a buyer for the property willing to pay the 
Qualified Contract price to purchase the property. This request begins 
a 1-year period during which the State seeks a qualified buyer to 
purchase the property and maintain it as affordable for the duration of 
the extended use period. The required purchase price for a Qualified 
Contract, stipulated by section 42, was designed in 1989 to prevent 
backend windfalls to owners and investors by limiting them to an 
inflation-adjusted return on the original equity contribution at a time 
when the Housing Credit was an unproven and temporary program.

    In practice, Qualified Contracts have come to function as a nearly 
automatic affordability opt-out after just 15 years. This is because 
the Qualified Contract formula price in nearly all cases significantly 
exceeds the market value of the property as affordable housing. As a 
result, it is rare for the State to find a buyer willing to pay the 
Qualified Contract price. If the State fails to find a qualified buyer 
within 1 year, the property is released from the affordability 
requirements of the Housing Credit program. At that point, the owner is 
free to either sell the property at market value without any deed 
restrictions or continue to own the property and charge market rents 
after a 3-year rent protection period for existing tenants.

    NCSHA data indicates that the Qualified Contract process is 
resulting in the premature loss of approximately 10,000 units annually. 
As of 2021, more than 100,000 apartments nationwide had already been 
lost from the Housing Credit inventory before what would have otherwise 
been the full affordability period for those homes.

    Washington State has long had a policy of requiring owners to waive 
their right to a Qualified Contract as a condition of receiving Housing 
Credits, and thus my State has not lost units to Qualified Contracts. 
However, many of my colleagues did not put such policies in place until 
much later. Waiver requirement policies will not impact Qualified 
Contract losses until 15 years after they are adopted, which means many 
States are still losing Housing Credit properties to early termination 
due to the Qualified Contract loophole.

    Congress can prevent these losses now by closing this loophole in 
the law. Senator Wyden's DASH Act has included a provision that would 
fix this by eliminating the Qualified Contract provision in section 42 
for properties financed after the date of enactment and modifying the 
Qualified Contract price for existing properties such that it would be 
fair market value of the property, taking into consideration the 
property's deed restrictions. We strongly urge all members of the 
committee to support this change.

    Another essential step Congress can take to ensure long-term 
affordability of properties is to protect nonprofit sponsors seeking to 
exercise the right of first refusal in their partnership documents as 
allowed under section 42. This right has been challenged in recent 
years by some investors, primarily outside entities who have obtained 
control of investor partnerships from the original investors after all 
tax credits have been claimed. These entities--often called 
``aggregators''--demand a payoff not contemplated in the partnership 
agreement as a condition of exiting the partnership. This has led to 
scores of legal disputes and, in many cases, costly litigation.

    Nonprofits that do not have the financial wherewithal to fight the 
limited partner in court are forced to acquiesce to unexpected investor 
monetary demands which may undermine the long-term financial viability 
of the property or force the nonprofit to raise rents, decrease 
resident services, defer maintenance, or even sell the property to 
cover the pay-off.

    In Washington State, because of the significant rise in property 
values and thus the potential for profits, we represent a prime target 
for aggregators looking to quickly maximize profit from housing 
properties at the expense of serving residents and communities over the 
long term, not to mention protecting the assets our Federal investments 
have created. That's why we call on Congress to protect the nonprofit 
right of first refusal.

    Again, Senator Wyden has been a leader in rectifying this problem. 
His DASH Act would provide clarity to the tax code by defining 
``property'' to include all partnership assets, not just the physical 
structure of the development, and stipulating that, unless the 
partnership agreement provides otherwise, no offer from a third party 
is required to trigger the right of first refusal; limited partner 
consent is not required to exercise the right of first refusal; and the 
right of first refusal may be initiated by an offer from any entity, 
including a related party. Further, to improve this process in the 
future, the DASH Act would replace the right of first refusal with a 
purchase option for projects financed after the date of enactment. 
Again, I urge all committee members to support this change.
   the housing crisis is impacting home ownership opportunities, too
    Our Nation's critical affordable housing shortage is not limited to 
rental housing. According to a recent analysis by Freddie Mac, the 
United States would need to construct nearly 3.8 million for-ownership 
homes to meet demand.\15\ Insufficient supply has substantially 
increased sale prices of single-family homes, pricing many working 
families out of the market. Moreover, recent dramatic increases in 
mortgage interest rates have exacerbated affordability challenges. The 
average home payment for a new home buyer was up 68 percent year over 
year in the fourth quarter of 2022,\16\ putting home ownership out of 
reach for many households.

Pressure, Hannah Jones, Realtor.Com February 10, 2023.

    Another significant challenge facing low- and moderate-income 
households seeking to become homeowners is the lack of starter homes on 
the market. For some time, builders have reported that building smaller 
homes is cost-prohibitive, therefore most new construction is of larger 
luxury homes because that is the only way for developers to make the 
economy of scale work. The median sale price for a new home in 2022 was 
$455,800, a nearly 15-percent increase over 2021.\17\ Just 15 percent 
of new homes sold in January 2023 were priced under $300,000, compared 
to around 30 percent in January 2021.\18\ Moreover, development costs 
for single-family homes are also subject to the same market dynamics as 
multifamily production, including significant inflation of common 
construction materials, supply chain delays, and workforce disruptions.

    These market developments have made it harder to address the 
longstanding home-ownership gap between White households and households 
of color. At the end of 2022, 74.5 percent of White households owned 
their home, compared to 61.9 percent of Asian American households, 48.5 
percent of Hispanic American households, and 44.9 percent of African 
American households.\19\

    A recent study found that, in each of the Nation's 50 largest metro 
areas--including Seattle--African American residents own a 
disproportionately small share of homes compared with their 
population.\20\ One of the biggest factors historically preventing 
minority families from purchasing a home is a lack of accumulated 
wealth compared to White households, a legacy of our Nation's 
discriminatory redlining policies.

    The current surge in pricing has worsened these disparities by 
making it even harder for minority households to amass the necessary 
savings to pay for the up-front costs of purchasing a home. While State 
HFA down payment assistance programs offer an affordable and 
sustainable option for such borrowers, we need a more comprehensive 
solution that helps increase supply and improve other home-ownership 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
tools.

    A healthy and affordable home purchase market is crucial for 
economic growth. Home ownership is many working families' primary means 
of building generational wealth. Further, an active home purchase 
market would open up more rental opportunities for those wishing to 
rent as new home buyers leave their apartments.
        congressional action to address the needs of home buyers
    While addressing these issues will take concerted and multifaceted 
action, there are two legislative proposals the Finance Committee can 
take up in this Congress to expand the supply of affordable homes and 
improve access to home ownership for low- and moderate-income home 
buyers. These are the Affordable Housing Bond Enhancement Act and the 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act.

    I want to thank committee member Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-
NV) for introducing the Affordable Housing Bond Enhancement Act (AHBEA) 
in the last Congress. This important bill would enact simple and 
impactful improvements to two essential tax incentives that help first-
time low- and moderate-income home buyers: the Mortgage Revenue Bond 
(MRB) and Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) programs. NCSHA looks 
forward to the bill's reintroduction this year.

    MRBs historically have been HFAs' primary tool for financing low-
interest mortgages for low- and moderate-income home buyers. Investors 
are willing to accept a lower rate of return for Housing Bonds than 
they would get on other investments because the interest on the bonds 
is exempt from Federal income tax. The lower rate is then passed on to 
lower the interest rate paid by lower-income home buyers.

    In total, MRBs have helped more than 3.4 million working households 
become home buyers. The median income of MRB loan borrowers in 2021 was 
64 percent of the national median income. WSHFC utilized MRBs to help 
more than 400 Washington families achieve the dream of home ownership 
in calendar year 2021, supporting more than $103 million in loans for 
low- and moderate-income home buyers.\21\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \21\ State HFA Factbook: 2021 NCSHA Annual Survey Results, National 
Council of State Housing Agencies, 2022.

    In addition, HFAs can use their MRB authority to issue Mortgage 
Credit Certificates, which provide a nonrefundable Federal income tax 
credit for part of the mortgage interest qualified home buyers pay each 
year. State HFAs have used MCCs to provide critical tax relief to more 
than 386,000 families. WSHFC has issued MCCs to nearly 17,000 home 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
buyers.

    AHBEA would improve MRBs and MCCs by, among other changes:

          Increasing the MRB home improvement loan limit;
          Allowing MRBs to be used for refinancing loans;
          Providing HFAs additional flexibility in how they utilize 
        housing bond authority;
          Simplifying how a borrower's MCC benefit is calculated;
          Reducing the time period for the MRB and MCC recapture tax 
        from 9 years to 5;
          Extending the amount of time HFAs can use converted MCC 
        authority from 2 years to 4; and
          Allowing HFAs to reconvert MCC authority back into MRBs 2 
        years after the conversion, rather than one.

    This legislation is a cost-effective way to improve the MRB and MCC 
programs. I urge all committee members to cosponsor this legislation 
when it is reintroduced.

    Lastly, I'd like to express support for the Neighborhood Homes 
Investment Act (NHIA). In many census tracts and rural areas, 
developers cannot sell homes for what it costs to construct or 
substantially rehabilitate them, known as the ``value gap.'' This is a 
problem for which we currently do not have a solution. We need a new 
tool in our box.

    The NHIA would establish a new tax credit, the Neighborhood Homes 
Credit, modeled after the highly successful Housing Credit. It would 
incentivize developers to construct new or substantially rehabilitate 
housing by closing the value gap, up to 35 percent of eligible 
development costs. It is estimated that the equity raised by the 
Neighborhood Homes Credit would finance the building and substantial 
rehabilitation of 500,000 affordable homes for low- and moderate-income 
homeowners over the next 10 years.

    I encourage the committee to take up and advance both of these 
bills as quickly as possible.

    The housing crisis will not get better unless Congress acts. 
Enactment of the bills I've addressed in this testimony--the Affordable 
Housing Credit Improvement Act, provisions of the DASH Act that would 
close the Qualified Contract loophole and protect nonprofit housing 
credit sponsors, the Affordable Housing Bond Enhancement Act, and the 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act--would truly address the affordable 
housing crisis for both renters and homeowners. WSHFC and all HFAs, 
through our national association, the National Council of State Housing 
Agencies, urge the committee to act on these bills and Congress as a 
whole to enact them this year.

    Thank you for your commendable efforts to support affordable 
housing. I am honored to have had this opportunity to testify before 
the committee.

                                 ______
                                 
           Questions Submitted for the Record to Steve Walker
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
    Question. In your testimony you highlighted the importance of the 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act--legislation I reintroduced with my 
Senate Finance Committee colleague, Senator Cardin--in addressing the 
value gap between rehabilitation costs and home values.

    Can you please discuss further why this legislation is so critical 
and how this credit will build upon the important work done through the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program?

    Answer. Thank you for your leadership on the Neighborhood Homes 
Investment Act (NHIA), which would create a new tax credit tool 
designed to make it possible to revitalize thousands of communities 
across the nation. The NHIA would solve two of our most pressing 
housing and community development problems simultaneously.

    The first problem is an extreme shortage of starter homes in good 
condition. Home ownership is the primary means of building wealth and 
financial security for most families. Yet market-based forces in the 
current economic environment are such that it is often not financially 
feasible for single-family developers to produce or rehabilitate modest 
for-sale properties that most first-time homebuyers can afford. This 
means that many households are locked into renting when they are 
otherwise good candidates for home ownership, putting added pressure on 
the rental market.

    The second problem is one of neighborhood conditions in many areas. 
Across the nation, thousands of once-thriving communities now suffer 
from blight, vacancy, and abandonment because of dilapidated single-
family housing stock. This undermines neighborhood stability and the 
local tax base and makes it difficult for these communities to attract 
and retain working families. It also harms existing homeowners in these 
communities, often African American families, whose property values are 
tied to the degradation of their neighborhoods.

    This is why NCSHA and its HFA members strongly support the NHIA, 
which is designed to close the value gap to allow for reinvestment in 
chronically underserved communities, helping low- and moderate-income 
homebuyers and homeowners to improve property values and increase 
family wealth.

    The Neighborhood Homes Credit is modeled after the highly 
successful and proven Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (Housing Credit). 
Structured as a public-private partnership, the program would be 
administered by State HFAs, which have the capacity and experience to 
efficiently run such programs. Like the Housing Credit, HFAs would 
develop a qualified allocation plan for the Neighborhood Homes Credit, 
developers would apply for credit authority to attract investors, who 
would provide the equity needed to fill the value gap and jumpstart 
neighborhood revitalization. Those investors, and not the federal 
government, would assume the risk associated with the development.

    Question. As we continue to evaluate the ways State and local 
governments can assist in addressing the housing affordability crisis, 
one area of concern is overburdensome permitting restrictions that slow 
the supply of housing and drive up the market value of homes.

    Can you please discuss any work you have done in Washington to 
encourage State and local governments to streamline permitting 
restrictions?

    Answer. Several local jurisdictions in Washington have implemented 
innovative policies and taken actions to deal with housing 
affordability in their communities. Some examples include enacting a 
density bonus to encourage affordable housing development in 
Bellingham, waiving impact fees for affordable housing developments in 
Kirkland, and decreasing parking requirements to reduce construction 
costs in Bellevue and Renton.

    Additionally, Seattle has eliminated the lengthy design-review 
process for affordable housing to help streamline permitting. The goal 
is to assist in the production of low-income housing by exempting these 
projects from Design Review and allowing for a waiver of certain 
development standards for these projects. The impact accelerates the 
permitting of city-funded affordable housing projects, thereby reducing 
costs and decreasing the time needed for new affordable units to enter 
into service.

    This year's State legislative session (still underway) includes 
additional legislative efforts to address permitting restrictions. The 
following bills have all advanced out of house of origin:

          E2SSB 5045--Allows counties to offer to exempt the value of 
        the ADU (up to 30 percent of original structure) if it's rented 
        to a low-income household (up to 60 percent AMI) and charge no 
        more than 30 percent of the tenant's monthly income. Exemption 
        remains for as long as it's rented to a LI household.
          HB1110--Requires cities to allow for middle housing 
        (townhomes, 2-6plexes, cottage housing) in areas traditionally 
        dedicated to single-family detached housing that are close to 
        transit and served by urban infrastructure. Prohibits onerous 
        requirements on middle housing, allows for administrative 
        permitting review process and adds requirement of affordable 
        housing for certain additional units.
          SSB5235--Requires the consideration and utilization of ADU's 
        as a housing option within comprehensive planning. Requires 
        attached ADU's to have a substantial share within the other 
        housing unit and shared structural elements. Requires adoption 
        in next comprehensive plan and prohibits cities and counties 
        prohibiting ADU construction within urban growth areas as well 
        as imposing restrictions on ADU development or requiring 
        covenants or ownership requirements.
          ESSB 5466--Prevents city planning under the Growth 
        Management Act (GMA) from prohibiting multifamily residential 
        housing on parcels near transit station areas, where any other 
        residential use is permissible (with some exceptions). Also 
        prohibits city planning under the GMA from imposing a maximum 
        residential density in transit-station areas or requiring off-
        street parking in these areas, with some exceptions.

                                 ______
                                 
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse
    Question. Rhode Island college graduates of the class of 2020 
graduated with an average of $36,791 in outstanding student loan debt. 
At the same time, the National Association of Realtors reports that 
housing affordability reached the worst level on record in the fourth 
quarter of 2022. Last Congress, I introduced several bills to ease the 
burden of student loan debt, including canceling student loans for 
front-line health-care workers and teachers.

    For those with tens of thousands--and in some cases hundreds of 
thousands--of dollars of student loan debt, how does their debt affect 
their ability to buy a home or afford rent?

    Answer. Increasing student loan debt can impact consumers' housing 
options over both the short and long term. In the short term, it 
reduces the amount of income new graduates can use to pay for housing. 
This limits the options available to them as they search for their 
first apartment, and increases competition for more modestly priced 
units, increasing competition for the Nation's shrinking stock of 
affordable homes.

    In the longer term, high student loan payments make it difficult 
for household to save up to purchase a home. Student loan debt can also 
negatively impact consumers credit scores, which restricts the types of 
mortgage loans available to them.

    From a housing policy perspective, the most important step Congress 
can take is to help increase the supply of affordable homes by passing 
legislation such as the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act and 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act, as well as funding the HOME 
Investment Partnership program. All of these programs will bolster the 
supply of available homes, helping to reduce costs for all renters and 
homeowners.

    Another step Congress could take is to increase access to down 
payment assistance. State housing finance agencies (HFAs), including 
WSHFC here in Washington, administer robust down payment assistance 
programs to help credit-worthy households who can't afford to save up 
for a down payment assistance, either because of student debt 
obligations or other reasons, realize the dream of home ownership. In 
2021, HFAs provided down payment assistance to nearly 120,000 
homebuyers. WSHFC provided such assistance to more than 7,300 
Washington State families that year, accounting for 98 percent of 
program borrowers. We currently offer a variety of down payment 
assistance options, including five programs targeted to residents of 
high-cost jurisdictions in the State, such as Seattle and Clark County.

    Question. Over the past 2 decades, the growing cost of child care 
has outpaced inflation. Child-care costs for Rhode Island families can 
now reach more than $10,000 per year annually for each child, and many 
families now are paying nearly 30 percent of their incomes on child 
care. At the same time, the National Association of Realtors reports 
that housing affordability reached the worst level on record in the 
fourth quarter of 2022. Indeed, according to HousingWorksRI, there are 
currently no communities in Rhode Island where families earning the 
State's median income or less can afford to buy a home, and there's 
only one community--Burrillville--where Rhode Islanders can affordably 
rent.

    How does the high and growing cost of child care affect families' 
ability to buy a home or afford rent?

    Answer. As with student loan debt, any increase in household costs 
will reduce the amount of money available for families to spend on 
housing, reducing their options and increasing competition for more 
modestly priced homes. This underscores the need for Congress to 
support initiatives that will increase housing supply and expand access 
to down payment assistance.

    Question. Rhode Island is the 2nd-densest State in our Union, 
second only to New Jersey.

    For States like mine, where people live in much closer proximity to 
each other than elsewhere in the Nation but which still have a housing 
shortfall, what are the best practices and reforms for encouraging 
affordable housing development while still preserving livable 
communities and local character?

    Answer. One of the keys to the Housing Credit program's long 
success is how it has been used to build affordable homes that fit in 
with the local character of the community. Housing Credit properties 
come in all shapes and sizes. In some places the program finances 
larger multistory properties, in others, it finances garden-style 
apartments. In some communities, it is used to build townhouse style or 
even single family scattered site rental homes. Developers have great 
flexibility in how they design their projects to best meet the context 
of the surrounding neighborhood and are mostly limited only by cost-
effectiveness.

    Question. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit is one of the primary 
Federal programs for creating and preserving affordable housing units. 
In Rhode Island, nearly 70 percent of new affordable units are financed 
using LIHTC. Last Congress, I cosponsored Senator Cantwell's Affordable 
Housing Credit Improvement Act, which would make a number of changes to 
LIHTC to further incentivize the building of affordable housing.

    How would the bill bolster our affordable housing supply?

    Are there improvements to the program that weren't included in the 
bill that the Senate should consider?

    Answer. Thank you for your support of the Affordable Housing Credit 
Improvement Act (AHCIA), passage of which is the single most important 
thing Congress could do to address the severe imbalance between supply 
and demand for affordable rental housing. As I noted in my testimony, 
our Nation has drastically underproduced housing for decades, but 
especially since the Great Recession when many developers exited the 
industry. This has left us with a 7.3 million rental home shortage just 
for extremely low-income households (those at or below the Federal 
poverty level or earning no more than 30 percent of their area median 
income, whichever is greater). When combined with rental housing 
production needed to house other low-income households who earn just 
slightly more, the supply gap is staggering.

    While there are several proposals in the AHCIA that would bolster 
production, the two that have the most substantial impact are the 
increase in credit authority for the 9-percent component of the program 
and lowering the bond financing threshold from 50 percent to 25 percent 
for the 4-percent component of the program. Together, these two changes 
are estimated to finance 1.93 million additional homes between 2023 and 
2032, housing an additional 4.5 million people and generating nearly 3 
million jobs, more than $335 billion in wages and business income, and 
nearly $116 billion in tax revenue.

    The AHCIA is comprehensive legislation, and while the two primary 
production provisions noted above are the most essential for increasing 
supply, the bill takes a soup to nuts approach on program modifications 
that would strengthen its administration and improve program outcomes.

    That said, there are additional critical proposals before Congress 
that would greatly improve the Housing Credit that are not included in 
the AHCIA, but are in Senator Wyden's Decent, Affordable, Safe Housing 
for All (DASH) Act. The DASH Act would protect taxpayers' investment in 
Housing Credit properties by combating two threats to long-term 
affordability.

    First, the DASH Act would close the qualified contract loophole, 
which allows owners to terminate the affordability restrictions on a 
Housing Credit property long before the end of the property's 
affordability period. The qualified contract process is outlined in my 
written testimony; however, in summation, this practice has come to 
function as a near automatic affordability opt-out after just 15 years 
unless the owner has waived their right to the qualified contract, 
while Congress envisions this program as one that provides 
affordability for at least 30 years, and many States, including 
Washington, often require longer affordability periods than that.

    NCSHA data indicates that the qualified contract process is 
resulting in the premature loss of approximately 10,000 units annually. 
As of 2021, more than 100,000 apartments nationwide had already been 
lost from the Housing Credit inventory before what would have otherwise 
been the full affordability period for those homes.

    Second, the DASH Act would protect nonprofit sponsors of Housing 
Credit properties seeking to exercise the right of first refusal in 
their partnership documents as allowed under section 42. This right has 
been challenged in recent years by some investors, primarily outside 
entities who have obtained control of investor partnerships from the 
original investors after all tax credits have been claimed. These 
entities--often called ``aggregators''--demand a payoff not 
contemplated in the partnership agreement as a condition of exiting the 
partnership. This has led to scores of legal disputes and, in many 
cases, costly litigation, often undermining the long-term financial 
viability of the property or force the nonprofit to raise rents, 
decrease resident services, defer maintenance, or even sell the 
property to cover the payoff.

                                 ______
                                 
               Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell
    Question. As we discussed at the hearing, we have been facing the 
housing affordability crisis for too long--both in cities like Seattle 
and in rural areas. The pandemic and inflation have made it clear that 
it is beyond time that we take the necessary steps to truly address the 
housing supply problem.

    We all know a shortage of affordable housing is a crisis in every 
State--in fact, not one has enough affordable housing for the lowest-
income renters. Heightened demand for rental housing has made rental 
markets extremely tight, and new additions to the rental supply have 
not kept up with demand.

    You mentioned in the hearing that we have under-built housing for 
over 20 years. It clear that this housing supply shortage has only 
increased the cost of rent relative to median income.

    Between 2006 and 2015, the median income in Washington State 
increased three percent, but the median rent increased by 18 percent. 
Nearly 230,000 Washingtonians pay more than half of their monthly 
income on rent. Among extremely low-income renters in the State, 68 
percent pay more half or more of their monthly income on rent.

    Together with Chairman Wyden and Senators Young and Blackburn, we 
are working to take this issue head-on by expanding and strengthening 
the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) by reintroducing the 
Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act (AHCIA).

    As I mentioned in the hearing, I would like to determine just how 
much we have under built housing in recent decades because I think it 
can show exactly how much this is a supply issue. It is critical that 
we invest in LIHTC this Congress to address increasing housing costs 
and demand for affordable housing.

    Supply of affordable housing is not meeting market demand. How much 
have we under built affordable housing?

    Answer. According to research by the National Low Income Housing 
Coalition, our Nation has a shortage of 7.3 million rental homes 
affordable and available to renters with extremely low incomes, defined 
as those with incomes at or below either the Federal poverty level or 
30 percent of median income for the area in which they live. As 
staggering as this statistic is, it does not even reflect the need for 
affordable housing for other low-income households whose incomes, while 
not as low as those considered extremely low-income, are insufficient 
to afford rent on the private market.

    Washington State alone, according to a report released just last 
month by the State Department of Commerce, will need to add more than 1 
million homes in the next 20 years. More than half of these need to be 
affordable for residents at the lowest income levels. Based on census 
data and the Office of Financial Management's population projections, 
these final housing projections illustrate that Washington needs more 
than 50,000 new units annually to keep pace with expected population 
growth.

    Question. How far behind are we in terms of meeting rural housing 
need? Urban?

    Answer. The affordable housing supply challenges are not limited to 
any one type of area. The crisis spans urban, suburban, and rural 
communities in every State in the Nation. While I do not have a 
breakout of exactly how the supply needs can be divided across these 
differing geographies, I can tell you that we have underbuilt nearly 
everywhere.

    According to CohnReznick, the median physical vacancy rate of 
Housing Credit properties was just 2.5 percent. This is consistent with 
regular turnover of units, and essentially means properties are fully 
occupied. In my experience, these properties typically have long 
waiting lists because so many people need the lower rents they can 
provide.

    Question. In your testimony, you and Mark Calabria both spoke about 
the need to address the financing gap for rural areas, in particular. 
Can you expand on the nature of the challenges for affordable housing 
in rural areas?

    Answer. Financing affordable housing in any area with very low area 
median incomes is particularly challenging because Housing Credit rents 
and income limits are set based on the area median income (AMI). Lower 
AMIs result in lower rents and less cashflow. That means these 
properties can support less debt because cashflow may not be sufficient 
for debt service. Even operating costs can make properties cost-
prohibitive if cash flow is insufficient.

    According to research by the Housing Assistance Council, there were 
377 ``persistently poor counties'' in 2020 based on Census Bureau data. 
These are counties in which 20 percent or more of the population has 
lived in poverty over the past 30 years. Approximately 81 percent of 
these counties are in rural areas.

    A second challenge to financing affordable housing production in 
rural areas is the lack of economies of scale. Larger properties 
typically cost less per unit than smaller properties. However, rural 
areas, with their smaller populations compared to urban and suburban 
areas, typically cannot support very large properties.

    Your legislation, the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act, 
would make the Housing Credit a more effective tool in rural areas. 
First, it would allow States to provide a basis boost for properties 
located in rural areas. That would mean we could further reduce the 
amount of debt these properties must support. Second, it would make a 
technical change to the way income limits are calculated for bond-
financed properties in rural areas, expanding the pool of households 
eligible to live in in them, which helps to address the economies of 
scale challenges they face. (Congress made this change to the 9-percent 
program when it passed the Housing and Economic Recovery Act in 2008. 
Your bill provides parity between the 9-percent and 4-percent 
components of the program.)

    Housing supply challenges in rural areas are exacerbated by 
preservation needs, as much of the existing rental housing stock is 
old, sometimes substandard, and in desperate need of recapitalization 
and rehabilitation. There are over 1.5 million occupied substandard 
housing units in rural areas, and over 750,000 of those even lack piped 
water.

    At its peak in the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
subsidized the production of more than 30,000 units per year in rural 
communities. By 2011, when the last of the USDA construction loans were 
issued, that number had slid to less than 1,000 units. According to the 
Housing Assistance Council, an average of 2,000 units per year will 
leave the program between 2022 and 2027.

    With dwindling resources from USDA, rural areas are more and more 
dependent on the Housing Credit for both new production and for the 
preservation of older properties originally funded by USDA programs.

    Question. LIHTC is a critical tool for producing workforce housing. 
What would be the impact for employers and working families if we do 
not make critical investments in LIHTC?

    Answer. Thank you for this question, as you and I agree that 
households living in Housing Credit properties are largely working 
households. Those who do not work are often seniors on fixed incomes or 
those with severe barriers to employment who need housing and services. 
Too often the term ``workforce housing'' is used as a proxy for housing 
affordable only to middle-income families and above, but the 
implication is that poor people do not work, and nothing could be 
further from the truth. Often low-income households are working two or 
three jobs just to make ends meet.

    The availability of affordable housing is key to economic growth 
for any community, and something that employers consider when they are 
determining where to locate. When the local workers can't find housing 
they can afford, the entire community can suffer. If rents are too high 
near places of employment, low-income workers often must move further 
away and commute longer distances to work, impacting traffic congestion 
and quality of life for everyone. Businesses, like restaurants, child-
care centers, and those in the travel and tourism industry often have a 
hard time finding workers at all. And as workers spend more of their 
paychecks on housing, there is less available to them to spend on goods 
and services in the local economy.

    The AHCIA would give State HFAs the resources we need to build more 
affordable housing. Our process for selecting proposals for these 
finite resources can help us to incentivize siting of these properties 
in areas where there is economic growth and access to the amenities 
workers need.

    Question. As you are aware, housing supply shortages, higher 
interest rates, and increased costs of financing construction are 
driving up inflation. Increased lumber costs alone have added an 
estimated $7,300 to the average per unit construction cost, resulting 
in higher rents.

    At the same time, LIHTC allocations have declined with the 
expiration of the 12.5-percent allocation increase that I helped secure 
in 2018. I am concerned that, without increased investments in LIHTC, 
housing costs and shortages will continue to increase as the demand for 
affordable housing continues to outpace supply.

    The bipartisan AHCIA would not only increase affordable housing 
supply by over 2 million affordable rental homes over the next decade--
something that goes directly to the impacts of inflation and the 
increased costs our constituents are facing--it would also support 3 
million jobs, provide $345 billion in wages and business income, and 
generate $119 billion in tax revenue.

    We have seen time and time again how the AHCIA and LIHTC have 
helped ease the supply shortage in communities across the State of 
Washington.

    In Snohomish County, for example, where families often move to if 
priced out of neighboring King County, Housing Hope has continued to 
utilize the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to build 60 units of 
affordable housing, half of which are designated for families 
transitioning directly from homelessness.

    The other 30 units are permanently accessible for low-income 
families who will never pay more than 30 percent of their income on 
rent.

    It's critical to act on housing supply to make any meaningful dent 
on inflation--in particular, by increasing the supply of affordable 
housing. Housing costs are far too large of a component of the Consumer 
Price Index (CPI) to not act.

    From your experience as the Executive Director of the Washington 
Housing Finance Commission, what has been the impact of inflation on 
housing supply? How could the AHCIA help improve the situation?

    Answer. The current economic conditions are causing major 
challenges in the construction industry, not just for Housing Credit 
development but for all types of housing production, both affordable 
and market-rate, rental and for-purchase. Lumber is certainly one 
construction commodity that has seen severe volatility, but we also 
hear from developers about cost increases for everything from 
transformers to steel, to paint. Not only are we facing inflation, 
supply chain disruptions, and workforce shortages, but we face these 
challenges in an environment in which interest rates have been rapidly 
rising.

    Last summer, NCSHA commissioned an independent third-party study of 
cost increases in Housing Credit production since 2019. It found that 
nearly all deals awarded credit authority from 2019 through the summer 
of 2021 faced significant and unexpected cost increases after having 
been awarded credits. As a result, many--if not most--projects had to 
seek additional credit authority, soft funding, or other resources from 
HFAs and other funders to close the funding gaps. These cost increases 
were consistently about 30 percent over the originally anticipated 
project costs.

    The expiration of the 12.5-percent cap increase at the end of 2021 
came at the worst possible time, given these cost increases. Your 
legislation, by restoring the cap increase and building a 50-percent 
increase on top of it would give us the resources we need to keep 
building 9-percent deals.

    Another challenge associated with cost increases is that some bond-
financed projects may not be able to pass the 50-percent test because 
the amount of bonds initially authorized for the project no longer 
covers 50 percent of the total cost. This is devastating for a project 
and essentially means it will not be able to move forward. By lowering 
the 50-percent test to 25 percent, these projects will no longer be in 
jeopardy.

    Question. What other steps do you recommend Congress take to help 
address the inflated costs of affordable housing?

    Answer. I would suggest that Congress weigh in on regulatory issues 
such as the implementation of the new Community Reinvestment Act 
regulations under consideration, to impress upon bank regulators the 
importance of protecting Housing Credit investment in any new system of 
CRA regulation.

testimony on how to improve tax policy to increase affordable housing 
supply and serve working families. I am Garrett Watson, senior policy

Federal tax code.

    Today, I will recommend ways to improve the Low-Income Housing Tax 
Credit (LIHTC) to ensure it is effective at providing affordable 
housing to low-income Americans. I will also discuss how broader 
improvements to the tax code, such as providing better cost recovery 
for residential structures, would be an effective way to grow the

    LIHTC is the largest source of affordable housing financing in the 
United States, using about $13.5 billion in forgone revenue each year 
on average. LIHTC has supported the construction of more than 3 million 
housing units since its creation in 1986 through 2020.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We should consider three big-picture points when evaluating the 
effectiveness of LIHTC as a tool to help working families and low-
income households.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


    First, while LIHTC has helped expand housing affordability, the 
credit's administration could be improved. More detailed information 
should be provided on the credit's effectiveness, as recommended in a 
2018 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data and Oversight Would Strengthen Cost Assessment and Fraud Risk 
Management,'' Government Accountability Office, September 2018, https:/
/gao.gov/assets/700/694541.pdf.

    Notably, GAO recommends that policymakers designate an agency to 
collect data to better understand project development costs. Such data 
would help inform future reform efforts, ensuring agencies impose 
limits on costs, root out fraud, and reform opaque and discretionary 
credit allocation processes. The data we have so far has shown, for 
example, that developments supported by the credit tend to suffer from 
higher-than-average construction costs. A 2017 GAO study found that 
only 30 percent of allocating agencies at the State level put limits on 
development costs, potentially undercutting the credit's efficiency.\4\

Credits,'' Journal of Urban Economics 66:2 (September 2009): 141-49, 
and Garcia-Diaz, ``Low-Income Housing Tax Credit: Improved Data and 
Oversight Would Strengthen Cost Assessment and Fraud Risk Management.''

    While the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
provides valuable project-level data, additional data such as 
information on fees paid to developers and syndicators as well as 
outcomes for properties and tenants over time would be valuable for 
assessing LIHTC.\5\

Credit: Policy Issues,'' October 17, 2019, https://
crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11335.

    Second, it is important to evaluate LIHTC's broader policy 
effectiveness before considering options to expand LIHTC. One area of 
concern is how much of the LIHTC's benefit goes to low-income 
households. Several studies have found that between one-third and 
three-quarters of the subsidy provided by LIHTC goes to low-income 
households, with the rest accumulating to other stakeholders such as 
developers and investors.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Ed Olsen, ``Does Housing Affordability Argue for Subsidizing 
the Construction of Tax Credit Projects?'', American Enterprise 
Institute, March 24, 2017, https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/

Program?'', December 1, 2010, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/
10.1111/j.1540-6229.2010.00287.x.

    Similarly, LIHTC projects tend to be located in higher-poverty 
neighborhoods, depriving tenants of the benefits of living in places 
with more opportunities and amenities.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Congressional Research Service, ``The Low-Income Housing Tax 
Credit: Policy Issues''; A related policy concern is to what extent 
LIHTC crowds out development that would have happened absent the 
credit: a 2005 study found that 30 to 70 percent of LIHTC-supported 
housing would have been built without the program, a finding echoed by 
a separate 2010 study identifying similar displacement of private 
construction.

    Finally, many of LIHTC's administrative challenges are rooted in 
using the tax code to tackle important social problems that may be 
outside the proper scope of the tax system. The array of programs 
supporting housing, ranging from Federal grants, tax credits for 
historic rehabilitation, and tenant-facing assistance, all overlap with 
LIHTC both in policy goals and benefiting stakeholders. That overlap 
makes it harder to evaluate the effectiveness of the credit compared to 
alternatives, such as housing vouchers, an option considered by the 
Congressional Budget Office as far back as 1992.\8\

    \8\ Congressional Budget Office, ``The Cost-Effectiveness of the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Compared with Housing Vouchers,'' April 
1, 1992, https://www.cbo.gov/publication/16375.

    While it is important to consider options to improve LIHTC's 
administration, oversight, and efficiency, many challenges could be 
resolved by reconsidering whether the tax code is specifically the best 
place to support housing projects and low-income tenants.
  pro-growth tax policy as a tool to expand the supply of affordable 
                                housing
    In addition to reforms to LIHTC, a supplementary approach to 
expanding the supply of affordable housing is to reduce the tax burden 
on investment in housing. One way to reduce the tax burden is by 
improving the cost recovery of structures in the Federal tax code.

    Currently, investors in residential structures must depreciate 
structures over periods up to 27.5 years long, limiting the economic 
value of the depreciation allowances. Ideally, all investments would be 
fully and immediately deducted from taxable income, but this can pose a 
challenge for structures that create a net operating loss for investors 
given the large size of the investment.

    One solution is to provide neutral cost recovery, which adjusts 
depreciation deductions to maintain their value in real terms. This 
would improve the economic incentive to invest in structures, expanding 
the housing supply while also avoiding challenges posed by fully 
expensing such large investments.

    According to the Tax Foundation's estimates, providing neutral cost 
recovery to residential structures would lead to the construction of up 
to 2.3 million housing units in the long run, lower construction costs 
by about 11 percent, and raise long-run economic output by 1.2 
percent.\9\

for Improving the Tax Treatment of Structures,'' Tax Foundation, May 
19, 2020, https://taxfoundation.org/neutral-cost-recovery-for-
buildings/.

    Pairing better cost recovery with efforts to improve land use and 
zoning rules at the State and local levels would magnify the positive 
effect of neutral cost recovery.
                               conclusion
    Reforming LIHTC and providing neutral cost recovery for residential 
structures would tackle the problem of housing affordability in a 
complementary fashion. Neutral cost recovery expands housing supply and 
lowers the cost of construction and rents, which can help LIHTC fund 
more below-market-rate projects.

    These reforms are two important steps that policymakers can take to 
ensure the Federal tax code is not a barrier to solving America's 
affordable housing challenge.

          Questions Submitted for the Record to Garrett Watson
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
    Question. To effectively solve the housing affordability crisis, we 
must address burdensome local zoning and land use regulations which 
stifle housing production and drive up housing prices across the 
country. Therefore, I will soon reintroduce my Yes In My Backyard Act 
to encourage communities to cut these burdensome regulations and bring 
a new level of transparency to the community development process.

    Can you please discuss the negative impact restrictive zoning and 
land use policies have on effectively addressing the housing 
affordability crisis?

    Answer. Zoning and land use policies have significant effects on 
housing supply and affordability in the United States. For example, one 
study found that about 20 percent of the differences in housing growth 
between metropolitan areas are explained by differences in density

    In addition to driving up the cost of housing, restrictions to 
housing supply likely have broader economic harm by limiting the 
productivity of workers who would benefit from urban labor markets. One 
estimate suggests restrictions on housing supply could have lowered 
total U.S. economic growth by up to 36 percent between 1964 and 
2009.\2\

    Onerous zoning and land use rules reduce the effectiveness of tax 
incentives to expand affordable housing. The restrictions add financial 
constraints and veto points to block qualifying development, which 
reduce the number of viable projects for developers to pursue even with 
tax incentives. It is a missed opportunity and a waste of taxpayer 
resources if tax incentives merely blunt cost increases driven by 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
supply restrictions.

    Encouraging States and localities to streamline their land use and 
zoning rules complements efforts to expand affordable housing 
incentives and improve the tax treatment of investment in housing.

    Question. During the hearing, some of my colleagues raised concerns 
regarding data reporting and transparency in the administration of the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. I am interested in 
addressing those concerns when Senator Cantwell and I reintroduce our 
Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act (AHCIA) later this spring.

    Do you have any specific legislative solutions or suggestions to 
improve LIHTC's existing data reporting framework? What would you 
recommend Senator Cantwell and I focus on for reintroduction of the 
AHCIA?

    Answer. One way to improve Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) 
data collection would be to designate a specific agency to collect and 
maintain data on project costs from credit-allocating agencies. This 
idea is the top outstanding matter for congressional consideration 
recommended by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in their 2018 
report assessing oversight of LIHTC.\3\

Credit: Improved Data and Oversight Would Strengthen Cost Assessment 
and Fraud Risk Management,'' September 18, 2018, https://www.gao.gov/
products/gao-18-637.

    Credit-allocating agencies often provide data on project costs, but 
GAO reports that the lack of a coordinating agency to standardize data 
collection and maintenance results in ``inconsistent data quality and 
formats among allocating agencies.''\4\ Designating a specific owner 
for LIHTC data collection could help with analysis of cost drivers and 
help increase LIHTC's efficiency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ Ibid, 65.

    Once cost data is standardized and collected effectively, the 
effort could be expanded to include data on outcomes for properties and 
tenants over time, helping to ensure that LIHTC is meeting its ultimate 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
goal of providing affordable housing for low-income households.

                                 ______
                                 
                 Prepared Statement of Hon. Ron Wyden, 
                       a U.S. Senator From Oregon
    In recent memory the Finance Committee has a proven record of 
working together, Democrats and Republicans, to solve big, national 
challenges. We've helped more Americans save for a dignified 
retirement, cut taxes for families and small businesses, updated the 
Medicare guarantee with the CHRONIC Care Act, made progress on helping 
Americans get mental health care when they need it, and passed the 
Family First Act with groundbreaking new policies to promote kinship 
care.

    I strongly believe the next opportunity for a big, bipartisan 
initiative is affordable housing. Few things unite Americans quite like 
the feeling that the rent is too damn high, or that saving enough for a 
down payment is a pipe dream.

    This is an issue in all 50 States; in big, urban downtowns, medium-
sized cities, and in the suburbs--even in smaller communities and rural 
areas.

    Let's look at what 5 years of rent increases have done in a handful 
of cities relevant to this committee. In my hometown, Portland, OR, 
data from Zillow show the average monthly rent jumped by $335, nearly 
23 percent. Charlotte, NC: a $558 increase, or 46 percent. Memphis, TN: 
a $428 increase, or nearly 50 percent. Boise, ID: a $639 increase, 
sending monthly rents 57 percent higher.

    The outlook isn't much better for people looking to buy a home, 
particularly young people looking to buy for the first time. According 
to a new report from the National Association of Realtors, the share of 
sales going to first-time homebuyers fell last year to the lowest level 
on record. And whether it's unaffordable rents or unattainable 
mortgages, oftentimes it's Black and Latino families hit hardest.

    So how should Congress go about solving this challenge? For a long 
time, you were breaking the rules as a Democrat if you talked about 
supply-side ideas. But the fact is, there is no substitute for 
increasing the supply of affordable housing.

    For many years now, Senator Cantwell has been the champion of the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC. It's the most successful 
Federal program for affordable housing there is. The bill she and 
Senator Young have put forward, the Affordable Housing Credit 
Improvement Act, would expand LIHTC to create 2 million new units 
nationwide.

    Yesterday Senator Cardin and Senator Young introduced the 
Neighborhood Homes Investment Act, which is all about giving a private-
investment boost for housing in blighted and struggling neighborhoods 
that need it most.


    I'm a cosponsor of both of those bills, and they are both 
priorities in my comprehensive DASH Act, which stands for Decent, 
Affordable, and Safe Housing for All. I am reintroducing the DASH Act 
today.

    Another component of DASH is what I've named the Middle-Income 
Housing Tax Credit, or MIHTC. The idea behind MIHTC comes from 
conversations I've had many times with housing authorities and middle-
class Oregonians back home, particularly in Portland and Bend.

    Because America has fallen behind in building housing for decades, 
the housing shortage has extended into the middle class too. 
Firefighters, nurses, teachers, and their families are all finding it 
more and more challenging to cover rent and make ends meet. MIHTC would 
help fill that gap, and I want to emphasize, it would supplement LIHTC.

    If a given State housing agency wanted to use its MIHTC credits for 
low-income housing, my bill says it could plow all those resources into 
its LIHTC program. Providing the States with that kind of flexibility 
is key to increasing housing supply where it's needed most.

    You can't talk about housing without addressing homelessness, which 
is another major priority in my DASH Act. It's clear that people 
experiencing homelessness need more help than they're getting.

    Furthermore, building more affordable housing today will reduce 
homelessness tomorrow, which will prevent a lot of individual suffering 
and save taxpayer dollars.

    Members of Congress also need to keep pushing State and local 
authorities to cut back on the thicket of zoning rules that get in the 
way of building the housing Americans need. That's another area of 
bipartisan agreement, because restrictive zoning laws can hurt local 
economies, and even worse, they often amount to a backdoor method of 
segregation.

    So there's a lot for the committee to discuss today. My view is, 
along with mental health care, rural health, and several other topics, 
affordable housing is an area where this committee can bring together a 
bipartisan coalition for real progress.

    Every member has an interest in getting more affordable housing 
built back home. It's a priority that cuts across State lines and 
political lines, and it's clear there are already bold, bipartisan 
ideas on the table. So I look forward to our discussion.

                                 ______

The Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition (AHTCC) is a national trade 
association comprised of nearly 250 housing organizations advocating to 
expand and strengthen the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (Housing 
Credit), our nation's primary tool for financing affordable rental 
housing. We thank Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo and the Senate 
Finance Committee for holding this hearing highlighting our nation's 
urgent need for more affordable housing and the integral role of tax 
policy, particularly the Housing Credit program, in addressing this 
shortage. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our perspective on 
the importance of expanding and strengthening the Housing Credit to 
increase affordable housing production at a time when it is needed more 
than ever.

The need for affordable housing has skyrocketed--at the end of 2022, 
our country was 3.8 million homes short of meeting the housing needs of 
Americans overall,\1\ and 7 million homes short of housing to serve 
extremely low-income renters.\2\ The Housing Credit offers a highly 
successful solution with a proven track record to address this urgent 
issue. Since its inception in 1986, the Housing Credit has helped 
produce or preserve more than 3.7 million safe, decent, affordable 
rental homes for more than 8 million low-income Americans. The majority 
of the households served by the program (52.6%) are considered 
extremely low-income being at or below 30% of Area Median Income (AMI) 
and nearly 70% of the households served are at or below 40% of AMI.\3\ 
Despite the growing need for more affordable housing and the strong 
support for the program on both sides of the aisle, however, the 
Housing Credit is facing an unprecedented cut at a time when it is 
needed now more than ever before. Meanwhile, we are turning away 
shovel-ready developments; demand for the credit outstrips supply 2.5 
to 1 nationwide.

The Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act (AHCIA) is broadly 
supported legislation to expand and strengthen the Housing Credit. The 
AHCIA has had strong bipartisan support since it was first introduced 
in 2016, and in the 117th Congress the legislation was co-sponsored by 
over 200 members of the House, 44 members of the Senate, and nearly 
half of Congress at large. This legislation is expected to be 
reintroduced in both chambers this spring, and we're grateful to have 
the support of Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Todd Young (R-IN), 
Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) as the lead 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
sponsors on the Senate version of the legislation.

This legislation has become even more urgent as we have incurred a cut 
to affordable housing production at this time of unprecedented and 
growing need. A 12.5 percent Housing Credit allocation increase enacted 
in 2018 expired at the end of 2021, and state housing agencies have far 
too few resources available to sustain prior levels of affordable 
housing production. Though there was broad support to include the 
provision during negotiations surrounding year-end omnibus legislation 
last year (including a bipartisan letter from House lawmakers signed by 
54 lawmakers \4\), it has not yet been enacted and the timing could not 
be worse. Not only does the status quo need to be restored, as 
explained above, but an increase in the Housing Credit allocation as 
proposed in the AHCIA is critically needed to actually begin to tackle 
our nation's shortage of affordable housing.

The AHCIA also included a proposal to lower the 50 percent bond 
financing threshold for developments financed with private activity 
bonds (``50 percent test''), which would unlock Housing Credit equity 
to increase affordable housing supply further. This proposal also has 
broad bipartisan support and enacting these two priority proposals--
lowering the 50 percent and increasing the Housing Credit allocation--
would have increased affordable housing production by more than 2 
million additional affordable homes over the next 10 years \5\ than 
otherwise possible, while also supporting 3 million additional jobs 
annually.\6\ This also comes at a time when more than half of states in 
the country are nearing or have already hit their Private Activity Bond 
cap.

The AHCIA also contains other provisions that would further increase 
affordable housing production and preservation, allowing the Housing 
Credit to better serve Americans who are disproportionately impacted by 
the affordable housing crisis, including extremely low-income families, 
seniors and people with disabilities, veterans, and people experiencing 
homelessness or living in hard-to-reach rural areas. It would also 
remove barriers to affordable housing preservation and streamline 
program rules and promote efficiency. Passage of the AHCIA will also 
help address the urgent need for stable workforce housing in a broad 
range of areas of need, from cities to rural areas in need of farm-
worker housing while supporting economic growth and opportunity in 
communities nationwide. Investing in the Housing Credit is critical to 
addressing America's affordable housing crisis. Expanding and 
strengthening the Housing Credit by enacting the essential priorities 
discussed above will support the production of more affordable rental 
housing, and help Americans all across the country have safe, decent, 
and affordable places to call home. We urge you to support the AHCIA 
and to ensure that the bill's key provisions, particularly the 
proposals to increase the Housing Credit allocation and lower the 50 
percent test, are included in any tax legislation or other possible 
legislative vehicle that emerges this year. We thank you for your 
continued leadership and look forward to continuing to work with you 
and all the members of the committee on these priorities in the 118th

               Statement of Steve Beck, President and CEO

Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Committee, 
AHEPA Senior Living (ASL), a mission-driven nationwide provider of 
affordable multifamily senior living communities, commends the 
Committee for holding a hearing to examine the role of tax policy in 
increasing affordable housing supply and appreciates the opportunity to 
provide our perspective on this very important and timely topic.

We echo the strong support by senators on both sides of the aisle, and 
from certain witnesses, for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program 
(LIHTC). A model public-private partnership, LIHTC is our nation's 
primary tool for incentivizing and encouraging private investment in 
the production and preservation of affordable housing and vital to job 
creation. Since 1986, the affordable housing credit has leveraged 
billions in private dollars to build and preserve affordable housing in 
every single state. Furthermore, it represents a significant and cost-
effective investment in affordable housing for older adults. Of the 
Housing Credit's 3.5 million homes built and preserved since the 
program's inception, about 1.1 million Housing Credit homes are headed 
by older adults.

We also sincerely thank and applaud Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member 
Crapo, and several Senate Finance Committee members, for demonstrating 
the important need to strengthen the Housing Credit through the 
introduction, or pending introduction, of legislation. For example, 
when reintroduced, and if fully enacted, the Affordable Housing Credit 
Improvement Act (AHCIA) would support nearly three million jobs and 
generate $346 billion in wages and business income and nearly $120 
billion in tax revenue. AHCIA's enactment would lead to the production 
of an estimated two million more affordable homes.

We also applaud Chairman Wyden's reintroduction of the Decent, 
Affordable, Safe Housing for All (DASH) Act. This comprehensive 
legislation would, like AHCIA, expand the 9% Housing Credit and lower 
the financing threshold for private activity bond financing from 50% to 
25%. The DASH Act also would create other tax credit programs that 
support affordable housing.

Why the Housing Credit Is Important to Our Mission

We also want to convey the important role LIHTC plays in the production 
and preservation of affordable housing for older adults. Recent policy 
and administrative developments pertaining to the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development's Section 202 Supportive Housing for the 
Elderly program have made LIHTC even more vital to our mission.

Almost our entire affordable housing portfolio is comprised of 
affordable independent senior living communities administered by HUD's 
Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program. We manage 87 
HUD Section 202 properties in 19 states, totaling 4,467 units. We own 
six of the 87 properties. (Although not tax policy related, it should 
be noted that according to the American Association of Service 
Coordinators, taxpayers save 66% when older adults live independently 
with the assistance of a service coordinator as is the case with the 
202 program.)

In recent years, HUD has resumed issuing Notices of Funding Opportunity 
(NOFOs) that provide capital advances to nonprofits for the 
construction of new Section 202 units. These capital advance funds 
often must be augmented, or supplemented, with gap financing to help 
complete the capital stack. One key financing mechanism utilized to 
complete the stack is the Housing Credit.

      In September 2021, we were thrilled HUD awarded us two Section 
202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program grants, totaling $16.7 
million to support the development of new affordable seniors housing 
communities in Des Moines, Iowa, and South Bend, Indiana.
      The capital stack for each of these two deals will include 4% 
LIHTC financing.

Furthermore, As HUD Section 202 communities have aged, the ability to 
finance major renovations to preserve affordable housing for older 
adults, used to be a challenge. However, in the FY2018 Omnibus 
appropriations bill, Congress provided authority for Section 202 
communities with Project Rental Assistance Contracts (``202/PRACs'') to 
participate in HUD's Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD) to 
facilitate the preservation of these homes. This policy change provided 
HUD 202 PRACs with the ability to utilize RAD to access private capital 
for the rehab and preservation of our properties. Here, again, a key 
financing mechanism utilized in this process is the Housing Credit. 
Thus, will rely upon a strong Housing Credit to help us address our 
preservation needs.

      In fact, we have ``RAD for PRAC'' deals in the works for three 
properties in Montgomery, Alabama, and three properties in Mobile, 
Alabama--and they all involve 4% LIHTC.

Finally, the Housing Credit benefits the development of affordable 
assisted living communities. We proudly utilized LIHTC to bring 
affordable assisted living services to very low-income older adults and 
people with disabilities in Indiana. There, the Housing Credit played 
an important role with our efforts to expand our mission to include the 
development of four affordable assisted living communities, totaling 
532 units. Here, the Housing Credit was blended with multifamily 
housing revenue bonds to provide financing. Today, we own and manage 
all four properties, and we aim to grow the affordable assisted living 
model with the help of a strong Housing Credit, which is complemented 
with a state's strong Medicaid Waiver program.

Additional Examples

We are pleased to share a few more examples of how the Housing Credit 
has help us meet our mission.

The Housing Credit helped us to complete development of a HUD Section 
202 property in Ohio. By the time of the project's initial closing, it 
was advisable to utilize 4% Housing Credit bonds to augment the 
original grant provided in the HUD award to provide the upgrade needed 
for construction materials and to meet Greening Guidelines.

In 2014, we utilized the 4% Housing Credit and revenue bonds to rehab 
and add much needed common area space to two of our HUD 202 properties 
in Mobile, Alabama.

In Michigan, the 4% Housing Credit helped us to renovate a HUD Section 
202 property when it was blended with funding from the Michigan State 
Housing Development Authority.

The Need and Demand

We would be remiss if we did not share our experiences with the clear 
need and demand for affordable senior housing with the Committee. They 
demonstrate why strong tax incentives, such as LIHTC, are vital. When 
older adults do learn about our HUD Section 202 communities, they are 
oftentimes confronted with the harsh realities of lengthy wait-lists 
and wait times, unfortunately.

To demonstrate, our nationwide wait-list at our HUD Section 202 
communities is 4,760 submissions, an increase of 459 submissions since 
a year ago. Nationwide, we have 4,467 units. The wait time for our 
applicants range from six months to three years.

In addition to our alarming nationwide wait-list and wait times, here 
is what we are hearing from our professionals out in the field:

        Some inquiring people don't even request an application because 
        our waiting lists are too long. They want and need immediate 
        housing.

        The number of seniors unable to afford a safe place to live in 
        many areas will continue to rise. They are most often faced 
        with choosing between healthcare and paying rent.

Unfortunately, these sentiments expressed by seniors that amplify our 
wait-list and wait time statistics will continue as an increased demand 
in HUD-assisted housing, especially for the 202 program, is expected. A 
May 2020 Government Accountability Report (GAO) report on Rental 
Housing found, ``The late middle-aged group (50-64 years) experienced 
the largest estimated increase in the number of renter households--an 
increase of 4 million households--and accounted for more than half of 
the total increase in renter households from 2001 through 2017.''\1\ 
The GAO noted many of these households have not recovered from the 
financial crisis, and the GAO cited a Harvard Joint Center for Housing 
Studies report that this group has lower incomes and higher rentership 
rates than previous generations. Moreover, HUD's Worst Case Housing 
Needs 2021 Report to Congress found that 2.24 million very low-income 
elderly households have worst-case housing needs, paying more than 50% 
of their income in rent.\2\ Finally, a 2021 Urban Institute report 
predicts there will be 13.8 million new older adult households between 
2020 and 2040; 40% of which (5.5 million) will be renter households.\3\

Chairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and Senate Finance Committee 
members, AHEPA Senior Living thanks the Committee for the opportunity 
to share our views on how and why tax policy is important to affordable 
housing, specifically for our nation's older adults, through the HUD 
Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly program. We welcome the 
opportunity to work with the Committee to ensure older adults have 
access to the safe and dignified housing they need to age in place, 
live independently, and thrive; and the role tax incentives play in 
providing it. Thus, it is imperative that Congress pass bipartisan-
backed legislation such as the AHCIA that strengthens programs such as 
the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to help providers like us to meet the 
need and demand. Thank you.

      Professor Caroline Bruckner, Senior Professorial Lecturer, 
  Accounting and Taxation; Managing Director, Kogod Tax Policy Center

Chair Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, U.S. Senate Committee on Finance 
(the ``Committee'') Members and Staff, thank you for holding a full 
committee hearing on March 7, 2023, titled, ``Tax Policy's Role in 
Increasing Affordable Housing Supply for America's Working Families.'' 
My name is Caroline Bruckner and I am a tax professor on the faculty at 
American University Kogod School of Business. I also serve as the 
Managing Director of the Kogod Tax Policy Center (KTPC), which conducts 
non-partisan policy research on tax and compliance issues specific to 
small businesses and entrepreneurs. The KTPC's mission is to develop 
and analyze research and policy recommendations for tax-related 
problems faced by small businesses, and to promote public dialogue 
concerning tax issues critical to small businesses and entrepreneurs.

Since 2015, I have focused our research agenda, in part, on the tax and 
compliance issues impacting self-employed small business owners as well 
as the need for increased tax data transparency. In connection with the 
March 7th hearing, I wanted to raise two important issues that are 
relevant to the Committee's critical work on studying tax policy's role 
in increasing affordable housing for working families. First, more 
people are working from home--both as small business owners and 
employees. Second, tax expenditure policy discussions need to include 
inclusive tax data in order for the Committee to engage in effective 
policymaking and conduct proper oversight.

1. People Are Increasingly Working From Home

In recent years, more and more Americans are supplementing their 
incomes by working outside of traditional employment.\1\ This is a 
trend that tax data research has documented.\2\ Following the onset of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, private sector research has found that the trend 
for independent work has even accelerated. For example, in 2022, MBO 
Partners found that the number of independent workers, ``soared'' by 
26% to 64.4 million, which was up from 51.1 million in 2021. This 
notable increase followed 2021's ``unprecedented'' 34% year-over-year 
increase.\3\ In addition, a McKinsey report from last year confirmed 
that ``[i]n the latest iteration of McKinsey's American Opportunity 
Survey (AOS), a remarkable 36 percent of employed respondents--
equivalent to 58 million Americans when extrapolated from the 
representative sample--identify as independent workers.''\4\ But it's 
not just that more people are working independently, it's that more 
people are working from home. In fact, the latest U.S. Census data 
shows the number of people working from home tripled from 9 million in 
2019 up to more than 27 million in 2021. States with the highest 
percentage of home-based workers include Washington (24.2%), Maryland 
(24.0%), Colorado (23.7%) and Massachusetts (23.7%).\5\

Affordable housing tax policy needs to reflect these massive workforce 
changes. One tax expenditure the Committee should consider for 
improvement is the home office deduction, which has been a critical 
support for small, lower-income businesses. Tax data from 2018 found 
that ``about 70% of the home office deduction dollars went to 
businesses with annual receipts of less than $100,000.''\6\ At the same 
time, meeting the requirements of the home office deduction can be 
unnecessarily challenging for small business owners. For example, the 
deduction requires that, ``in all cases, a home office must be used 
regularly and exclusively to conduct business.''\7\ As a result, using 
dining room tables for work purposes during the day or ``spreading work 
out on the kitchen table does not qualify, even if it happens every 
day, because the area is not exclusively used for work.''\8\ Moreover, 
employees that work from home are denied any benefit of the deduction 
altogether in circumstances where employers provide ``access to 
suitable space on the employer's premises for the conduct by an 
employee of particular duties.''\9\

These kinds of limitations do not make sense given the Committee's 
goals of supporting small businesses and working families, and should 
be reconsidered specifically in the context for improving tax policy 
for affordable housing. Homes are no longer exclusively use for 
residential purposes. Millions of low- and middle-income Americans can 
and do work from home to start their side hustle or save on commuting 
costs or to spend more time with their families. As a result, the home 
office deduction can and should be improved to reflect the reality of 
how people work today.

2. The Ongoing Need for Tax Data Transparency

As this Committee has noted in prior hearings, the U.S. tax system 
reflects racial, ethnic and gender bias and ``adds to inequality in 
this country.''\10\ The pervasive nature of the bias in the U.S. tax 
system is compounded by the fact that for the most part, civil rights 
protections and data transparency guardrails that require federal 
agencies to collect data on beneficiaries of federally-funded programs 
don't expressly apply to ``tax expenditures'' (i.e., the special 
provisions that provide some taxpayers ``more favorable treatment than 
regular income tax'').\11\ In other words, civil rights laws don't 
mandate Treasury or IRS collect demographic data on who benefits from 
tax expenditures.\12\ So, for example, while federal and state housing 
agencies are required to track and publish data on the race, ethnicity, 
family composition, age, income, use of rental assistance, disability 
status, and monthly rental payments of households residing in low-
income housing tax credit properties,\13\ neither Treasury nor the 
Committee has any idea of what the equity implications are for the 
corporations that are profiting from them.\14\

expenditure related to rental housing is the low-income housing tax 
credit, with a tax expenditure estimate of $65.0 billion. Approximately 
$64.1 billion of the $65.0 billion is attributable to corporations.'').

In recent decades, Congress has increasingly turned to tax expenditures 
to deliver critical anti-poverty, health care or housing programming 
for taxpayers or to stimulate business activity through deductions for 
accelerated depreciation and individuals with business income. As you 
know, for budget purposes, tax expenditures are similar to direct 
spending programs that function as entitlements.\15\ However, the 
absence of inclusive demographic data on taxpayers that claim tax 
expenditures raises both equity issues and oversight challenges for 
Congress. How can Congress know if the programs funded through the U.S. 
tax code are working as intended if they don't track who benefits? How 
can the Committee effectively conduct its oversight function of these 
``entitlement'' programs absent inclusive tax data?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notwithstanding these challenges, legal researchers have been using 
data from the private sector and federal agencies--other than IRS--to 
estimate the discriminatory racial and gender implications for various 
tax expenditures.\16\ Economists and leaders on this Committee have 
been increasingly insistent on the need for additional research and 
demographic data on how taxpayers benefit from--or are penalized by--
different tax provisions and administrative policies.\17\ Recently, 
researchers at Treasury and IRS are stepping up and working to enable 
tax expenditure data transparency.\18\ However, Congress needs to do 
its part and incorporate and normalize the use of inclusive tax data in 
the legislative process. In connection with this, the Committee should 
work with Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation to include 
demographic distribution data when preparing estimates of housing tax 
expenditures in connection with the work on improving tax policy for 
affordable housing.

                    Statement of Michael G. Bindner

Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo, thank you for the opportunity 
to add to the record on affordable housing. This committee last held 
hearings on this issue in July 2022, The Role of Tax Incentives in 
Affordable Housing. The Ways and Means Committee also held hearings a 
week earlier, entitled Nowhere to Live: Profits, Disinvestment, and the 
American Housing Crisis. Rather than rehash these issues, I will simply 
serve the leftovers in an attachment and highlight a few points.

Point 1: Housing is primarily an income issue.

The best cure for housing affordability is higher income. The 
President's budget is on the right track regarding the Child Tax 
Credit. I would treble down on his amounts and distribute these funds 
through Old-Age, Survivors, Disability and Unemployment Insurance 
payouts or with wages. Note that dependent children would only get the 
$1000 per month CTC.

Adult and Emancipated Juvenile Students, from ESL to Associates Degree, 
should be paid for pursuing their educations at a minimum wage level of 
at least $10 per hour (which had been the Republican counter-offer to a 
$15 wage). Take the deal and plan on an increase to $12 or just to $11 
if the standard work week is cut to 28 hours--seven per day, not 
including lunch. Immigrant minors who have been trafficked to the 
United States and paroled to relatives or sponsors have had to go to 
work. Their only work should be education. No one should be brought in 
as a member of a permanent underclass!

The other income issue is how we distribute cost of living raises to 
government workers, beneficiaries, government contractors and in the 
private sector. While we cannot do much for the last one (except for 
offering paid education), the other three are firmly under government 
control.

The source of inequality, aside from abandoning the 91% top marginal 
tax rate, is granting raises at an equal percentage rather than by an 
equal amount. When this started, incomes were fairly equal, so it was 
not an issue. Fifty years later, the issue is huge, but not 
insurmountable.

From here on in, award raises on a per dollar an hour rather than on a 
percentage basis (or dollars per month or week for federal 
beneficiaries). Calculate the dollar amount based on inflation at the 
median income level. No one gets more dollars an hour raise, no one 
gets less dollars per hour in increases. Increase the minimum wage as 
above and consider decreasing high end salaries paid to government 
employees and contractors. Even without decreases, simply equalizing 
raises will soon reduce inequality. Why is this necessary?

Prices chase the median dollar. The median dollar of income is actually 
at the 90th percentile, rather than the 77th percentile (which is about 
where the median is). This strategy would reduce inflation in both the 
long and short terms.

Let me repeat this--prices chase income dollars, not income earners.

On the tax side, limit bracket indexing in the same manner--by dollars 
per bracket, not percentages.

Point Two: Abandon the idea of tax incentives for development.

Urban renewal, which relocates poor and largely non-white people, leads 
to redevelopment that chases the 90th percentile. The tax incentives in 
the President's budget are exactly the wrong approach. Instead, reform 
the entire tax system so that most families do not have to file income 
taxes. By most, I mean 99%.

If an asset value-added tax is adopted rather than capital gains taxes 
then other income taxes, taxes could be replaced with goods and 
services taxes on consumption and subtraction value-added taxes on net 
business receipts--so that wages and profits would be taxed at an equal 
rate, with higher income surtaxes for individuals who receive wages 
and/or dividends over the 90th percentile of income at graduated rates 
up to $450,000, with a top rate of 25% over the base rate.

Income over $500,000 would be taxed between an additional 5% up to an 
additional 25%, with tax prepayment being an optional bond purchase for 
years in advance. If enough people or firms shift from holding 
marketable debt to tax prepayments, the debt can be reduced more 
rapidly and interest costs saved.

Thank you for the opportunity to submit these comments. Please feel 
free to contact me further for more detailed discussions, especially 
regarding the automatic inequality sourced in bad math.

      ATTACHMENT--TAX INCENTIVES IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING, July 2022

HOUSING ISSUES

The Housing Market

Building scientist Belinda Carr highlights why the current economy is 
similar to 2005 in a recent YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=77g6jRBG1
cI&list=WL&index=4&t=570s. Her five main points against an actual 
housing shortage are:

    1.  Declining population growth: Low birth rate, higher death 
rates. Permits are meeting population growth rates.
    2.  People per unit has declined.
    3.  Number of rental units--large number of investor units, 
especially in minority neighborhoods. Investors driving out individual 
buyers.
    4.  Low interest rates have driven up prices, driving up investor 
incentives.
    5.  Mismatch of housing types and locations. The rise of remote 
work and possibility of large firms linking wages to housing prices if 
a recession occurs (because, as monopsonies, they can).

I recommend asking her for comments or testimony. At least circulate 
the YouTube link.

Her research is in keeping with other analyses, including my own, on 
the prospect of a housing recession.

Starting in 2009, properties that have been seized in foreclosure have 
been purchased with private equity and are so heavily leveraged that 
they cannot be sold until the holding company files for bankruptcy in 
the next Great Recession. See Homewreckers: How a Gang of Wall Street 
Kingpins, Hedge Fund Magnates, Crooked Banks, and Vulture Capitalists 
Suckered Millions Out of Their Homes and Demolished the American Dream 
by Aaron Glantz. The C-SPAN Book TV discussion with Mr. Glantz will 
give the committee a heads-up on what such testimony would include. See 
https://www.c-span.org/video/?465567-1/homewreckers.

The long and short of it is that many now have to rent or own leveraged 
properties. Our absentee landlords have cashed out and left servicing 
companies to bleed us dry. They essentially own us because we have to 
work harder and longer to have a place to live while those who have 
cashed out live in gated and high-end assisted living communities. In 
the last year, Exchange Traded Funds have been all the rage. Who wants 
to bet on where the latest pool of junk is hiding?

In 2008, the Troubled Asset Recovery Program was enacted, promising aid 
to homeowners. The next year, CNBC Rick Santelli had his ``rant of the 
year'' which put the kibosh on any aid to homeowners, although there 
was little appetite to provide it from the Larry Summers wing of Obama 
economic team anyway. They did, however, stay behind bailing out the 
holders of the bad paper.

Let us not repeat (or rather continue to repeat) the bad practices that 
left the economy in the doldrums. During the pandemic, the Federal 
Reserve has purchased bad paper, but without benefit to those whose 
debts are held in those bonds.

This time around, credit card balances and back rent should be forgiven 
when the Federal Reserve buys the bonds that hold the debt. Loans could 
also be written down, which would stop bondholders from benefiting from 
issuing bonds that should never have been issued in the first place. 
Renters of both commercial and residential property should be offered 
the chance to purchase their locations and homes, with assistance from 
Government Sponsored Enterprises, with their paper replacing the debt 
paper that has been securitized in Exchange Traded Funds.

ETFs may take a hit, but what was falsely sold as AAA paper would 
actually become what was sold. Bad landlords, and Glantz demonstrates 
that Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Ross truly are bad landlords, degrade 
properties so that the bonds that were issued for them to cash out are 
nowhere near the value at issue.

In 2009, the United States aided and abetted those who created the 
crisis. We are currently repeating the mistake. When the inevitable 
crisis occurs again, doing the right thing will also be the right 
medicine for the economy.

 The Opportunity Zone Program and Who It Left Behind (November 16, 
                    2021)

Opportunity zones are the flavor of the decade, proceeding from 
enterprise, urban renewal and the destruction of neighborhoods in order 
to bring Interstate Highways to cities.

Worse than redlining and segregation, urban renewal, which the civil 
rights community calls Negro Relocation. Hispanic neighborhoods are 
also suffering the same fate. Time and again, poorer residents are 
moved to the suburbs so that coffee shops, high end grocery stores and 
luxury apartments can be built for professionals, also known as the 
creative class. In short, young and middle aged white people with high 
incomes.

Developers bridge the gap between property acquisition and sale so that 
those who are displaced leave with lower payments while the developers 
benefit from any increase in property values. Such actions are why 
Henry George proposed pergovian land value tax, collecting 100% of land 
value each year and then distributing a citizens dividend to everyone 
(so that poorer people benefit from the price loss experienced by high 
end developers.

I usually do not endorse Georgism as the sole solution to inequality. 
Creating cooperatives that democratically give members control of the 
means of production, consumption, human services and finance is more my 
speed; but even I would have the cooperative pay a land value tax to 
fund services for those who continue to live in a Smart Growth area 
dominated by such a cooperative. It would continue to fund services 
after any relocation (unless families wish to join the cooperative.

In the interim, Opportunity Zone provision should be repealed. We need 
no more displacement from here on in. This Type of Tax Incentive Is 
Counterproductive.

Fair Housing Enforcement

There is a similar matter that needs mention--Fair Housing (especially 
considering recent campaign bloviating). In light of recent Supreme 
Court rulings including sexual orientation in sex for employment law--
there is no reason to believe that this revised definition does not 
apply to every part of the Civil Rights Act--as well as the Fair 
Housing Act.

Are civil penalties enough to force compliance? Experience shows that 
they do not. A former roommate, who got his Section 8 before I did, was 
exposed to possible discrimination couched in the language of credit. 
He complained to the Housing Office and the landlord caved in. This was 
2018 in liberal Montgomery County. The continued need for training by 
the Patricia Roberts Harris National Fair Housing Training Academy 
(where I also worked) is less anecdotal.

When I was the Ward 3 Community Relations Representative in the D.C. 
Office of the Ombudsman, we were given a talk by the Solid Waste 
Management office. Their motto was that there is no better education 
than a ticket. This would be equally true in fair housing, as well as 
all other civil rights enforcement. It is time to quit talking about 
reform and to actually start doing it.

Bias in Housing Policy

When dealing with federal housing, and income support in general, the 
desire for economic justice and environmentalism sometimes conflict. 
Anti-poverty programs are notorious for not funding those with the 
father in the home. This is the result of both racism and the desire to 
limit the number of clients. In short, the Zero Population Growth 
mentality has made it into housing and income support policy.

There should be no conflict here. The ZPG/racist and cost control 
arguments are simply unworthy of American Society, while being endemic 
within them. All people of good conscience should resist such nonsense 
and I will do so with my last dying breath.

Prior to the Wars on Drugs and on Poverty (the Poor?), the model for 
housing in modern America was the three bedroom house. This included a 
bedroom for parents, one for the boys and one for the girls. An oldest 
child may eventually get his or her own room at some point if there 
were a four bedroom or basement/attic space that could be used as a 
bedroom.

Aside from the war on the poor, there is no reason that publicly funded 
housing should have departed from this norm. This includes Section 8 
assistance. If public housing included three bedroom units, there would 
not be a drive toward driving families toward ownership that they 
cannot afford over the long term.

Federal low and moderate income housing, including the low income 
housing my family participated in during the 2000s, gave generous 
assistance to get us in, but was not adequate to keep us there. We 
mistakenly borrowed using a step-up mortgage. This would have been fine 
if the payment itself, rather than the mortgage rate, had ``stepped 
up'' by inflation each year. What we received was unsustainable, which 
ended in foreclosure, bankruptcy and divorce. I doubt we were the only 
ones. See the above discussion on the 2008 bailout for other 
difficulties which could have been dealt with via public policy.

Federal rental and purchase support should be two sides of the same 
program. As with Medicare, some participants should be dual eligible 
for both downpayment assistance and rental assistance. Indeed, everyone 
approved for one must be declared eligible for the other. If this were 
the case, my family may have stayed in more affordable housing.

The surest way to help federal housing beneficiaries escape the need 
for rental assistance, indeed any assistance--including bankruptcy 
protection--is to make sure that families have adequate incomes. The 
entire low income housing program--from mortgage subsidies to Section 
8, as well as most other statutory low income support benefits--could 
be decreased or curtailed with adequate support for families through 
adequate wages, training programs, child tax credits, and the other 
elements of the Build Back Better proposals.

Fix income inequality with higher minimum wages and child tax credits 
and the free market will respond to the real needs of families. Two 
parent families with more than two kids should be able to demand three 
bedroom apartments, all things being equal. End the bias against two-
parent families in current programming and creativity will take care of 
the rest.

INCOME SECURITY

It is time to end the two-tier economy. No one should have to work in 
what Michael Harrington called The Other America. With the end of 
welfare as we knew it, circumstances have actually gotten worse since 
Harrington's seminal work. The rise of delivery services, which require 
drivers to earn tips, and the gig economy, which prevents easy tipping, 
has made things even worse in the name of progress. We are working 
harder for less. This Committee can start the ball rolling to fix this.

Minimum Wage

The best option for food security and low income housing is to increase 
incomes by increasing the minimum wage and the child tax credit and 
indexing them to inflation.

Increasing the minimum wage to $10 wage should take effect immediately, 
phasing to $12. You can argue about a $15 or $18 minimum after the 
midterm elections. Higher minimum wages increase job growth, as lower 
wage employees spend every dime of the increase, as do higher wage 
workers below the middle-management level whose wages will also rise.

Provisions should also be included in law to hold franchisees harmless 
if minimum wage increases impact their own livelihoods. The conditions 
of franchise employment and agreement deserve attention as well in 
terms of agreed to standards, payment of franchise owners in low wage 
industries and the ability of workers to organize. If some firms decide 
to turn franchise employment into full-time employment, so much the 
better.

It is indeed a poor job where the physical productivity of workers in 
comparison with other factors is under this level, especially when 
child tax credits are excluded from the equation. The intermediate goal 
should be either a $12 minimum wage (so that it is comparable to the 
buying power experienced in 1965) or an $11 wage with a 32 hour work 
week.

The perception that doing the right thing makes a business non-
competitive is the reason we enact minimum wage laws and should require 
mandatory leave. Because the labor product is almost always well above 
wages paid, few jobs are lost when this occurs. Higher wages simply 
reduce what is called the labor surplus, and not only by Marx. Any CFO 
who cannot calculate the current productive surplus will soon be 
seeking a job with adequate wages and sick leave.

The requirement that this be provided ends the calculation of whether 
doing so makes a firm non-competitive because all competitors must 
provide the same benefit. This applies to businesses of all sizes. If a 
firm is so precarious that it cannot survive this change, it is 
probably not viable without it.

Childcare and Paid Leave

Childcare is best provided by the employer or the employee-owned or 
cooperative firm. On-site care, with separate spaces for well and sick 
children, as well as an on-site medical suite to treat sick employees, 
will uncomplicate the morning and evening routines. Making yet another 
stop in an already busy schedule adds to the stress of the day. Knowing 
that, if problems arise at a work-based daycare, they can be right 
there, will help parents focus on work.

Larger firms and government agencies can more easily provide such 
facilities. Indeed, in the Reeves Center of the District Government, 
such a site already exists. Smaller firms could make arrangements with 
the landlord of the building where offices or stores are located, 
including retail districts and shopping malls. For security reasons, 
these would only serve local workers, but not retail customers.

A tax on employers would help society share the pain for requiring paid 
leave. Firms that offer leave would receive a credit on their taxes 
(especially low wage firms). Tax rates should be set high enough so 
that.

Child Tax Credits

The Child Tax Credit should support the income of each dependent child 
at median wage levels and be fully refundable. If a parent participates 
in education and training, their child tax credit should be paid with a 
training stipend set to the minimum wage. Including these benefits with 
pay reduces the need for a $15 minimum wage. $12, which is in line with 
historical averages prior to 1965, should be adequate.

There are two avenues to distribute money to families. The first is to 
add CTC benefits to unemployment, retirement, educational (TANF and 
college) and disability benefits. The CTC should be high enough to 
replace survivor's benefits for children.

The second is to distribute them with pay through employers. This can 
be done with long term tax reform, but in the interim can be 
accomplished by having employers start increasing wages immediately to 
distribute the credit to workers and their families, allowing them to 
subtract these payments from their quarterly corporate or income tax 
bills.

Tax Reform

Tax reform will help both low wage and gig/1099/staffing services 
workers who are essentially full-time but are not treated as such. 
Because these ``vendors'' would have to pay the tax and receive the 
breaks, client firms would have the incentive to hire them instead.

Our tax reform plan, which was last adjusted on June 10th of this year, 
features a Subtraction Value-Added Tax. This tax can serve as an 
employer-based vehicle for distributing child tax credit, healthcare 
and childcare benefits.

The S-VAT could be levied at both the state and federal levels with a 
common base and tax benefits differing between the states based on 
their cost of living (which would be paid with the state levy). The 
federal tax would be the floor of support so that no state could keep 
any part of its population poor, including migrants. It is time to end 
the race to the bottom and its associated war on the poor.

Between the CTC and the Earned Income Tax Credit, the CTC is to be 
preferred. Applying for an EITC is part of why it is expensive to be 
poor. For most, outside help is needed to calculate it. Having to get 
such help is a ``poor tax.'' Our proposed changes to individual payroll 
taxes propose a way to end this credit while assuring adequate 
retirement savings and family income. The following paragraphs are an 
excerpt from our current tax reform plan.

Business Receipts Taxes. S-VAT is a vehicle for tax benefits, including

employee-directed contributions to the public or private unionized 
school of their choice or direct tuition payments for employee children 
or for workers (including ESL and remedial skills). Wages will be paid 
to students to meet opportunity costs.
      Most importantly, a refundable child tax credit at median income 
levels (with inflation adjustments) distributed with pay.

Subsistence level benefits force the poor into servile labor. Wages and 
benefits must be high enough to provide justice and human dignity. This 
allows the ending of state administered subsidy programs and 
discourages abortions, and as such enactment must be scored as a must 
pass in voting rankings by pro-life organizations (and feminist 
organizations as well). To assure child subsidies are distributed, S-
VAT will not be border adjustable.

The S-VAT is also used for personal accounts in Social Security, 
provided that these accounts are insured through an insurance fund for 
all such accounts, that accounts go toward employee ownership rather 
than for a subsidy for the investment industry. Both employers and 
employees must consent to a shift to these accounts, which will occur 
if corporate democracy in existing ESOPs is given a thorough test. So 
far it has not. S-VAT funded retirement accounts will be equal-dollar 
credited for every worker. They also have the advantage of drawing on 
both payroll and profit, making it less regressive.

A multi-tier S-VAT could replace income surtaxes in the same range. 
Some will use corporations to avoid these taxes, but that corporation 
would then pay all invoice and subtraction VAT payments (which would 
distribute tax benefits). Distributions from such corporations will be 
considered salary, not dividends.

Individual payroll taxes. Employee payroll tax of 7.2% for Old-Age and 
Survivors Insurance. Funds now collected as a matching premium to a 
consumption tax based contribution credited at an equal dollar rate for 
all workers qualified within a quarter. An employer-paid subtraction 
value-added tax would be used if offsets to private accounts are 
included. Without such accounts, the invoice value added tax would 
collect these funds. No payroll tax would be collected from employees 
if all contributions are credited on an equal dollar basis. If employee 
taxes are retained, the ceiling would be lowered to $85,000 to reduce 
benefits paid to wealthier individuals and a $16,000 floor should be 
established so that Earned Income Tax Credits are no longer needed. 
Subsidies for single workers should be abandoned in favor of radically 
higher minimum wages. If a $10 minimum wage is passed, the employee 
contribution floor would increase to $20,000.

Pro-Life Scoring

The following paragraphs should be familiar to members and staff. Now 
that Roe v. Wade has been overturned, they should be made available to 
everyone.

These reforms MUST be scored as pro-life legislation and be funded more 
broadly than the President has promised. Having served on the staff of 
a major abortion rights organization in the past, I can assure you that 
no such organization would ever oppose higher living standards for 
women and their families!

The chief obstacle for funding families is not the feminist movement. 
It is the so-called right to life movement who would rather women be 
penalized for having abortions than subsidized so that they are not 
necessary. Over the course of many decades, I have had conversations 
with conservative members of the pro-life community. When push comes to 
shove, they oppose the measures above because their objections to 
abortion are more about sexuality than the welfare of children.

In the pro-choice movement, many jump to the defend women's bodies 
argument before first addressing the need for adequate family income. 
Doing so now will shame the leadership of the pro-life movement into 
supporting these provisions to Build Back Better.

Many in the pro-life movement already do. Catholic Charities USA, 
NETWORK and the Catholic Health Association all stand with working and 
poor women. They must be very publicly leveraged to get the U.S. 
Conference of Catholic Bishops behind them as well--and to have the 
bishops insist that these measures be considered must-pass legislation 
for the computation of pro-life voting records.

Catholic members of Congress and the President should also lead on this 
effort. It is time to stop grandstanding on this issue. These measures 
must pass--and on a larger scale than provided for in Build Back 
Better.

    The Manufactured Housing Institute (MHI) is pleased to submit this 
statement for the record for the March 7, 2023, Senate Finance 
Committee Hearing on ``Tax Policy's Role in Increasing in Affordable 
Housing Supply for Working Families.''

    MHI is the only national trade association that represents every 
segment of the factory-built housing industry. Our members include home 
builders, suppliers, retail sellers, lenders, installers, community 
owners, community operators, and others who serve the industry, as well 
as 48 affiliated state organizations. In 2022, our industry produced 
nearly 113,000 homes, accounting for approximately 11 percent of new 
single-family home starts.

    MHI appreciates that Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo are 
holding this important hearing assessing the role of tax policies in 
increasing the supply of affordable housing. With our nation facing an 
affordable housing shortage, manufactured housing is one solution that 
can help address this need. Manufactured housing is the most affordable 
homeownership option available for low- and moderate-income families in 
America. The median household income of a manufactured home resident is 
around $35,000--while the median household income of a site-built 
homeowner is around $76,000. Commonly, manufactured homes are less 
expensive to own than renting.

    Manufactured housing is the most effective source of unsubsidized 
housing that serves low- and moderate-income families. Our homes are 
built in a controlled factory environment in accordance with a federal 
building code administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD). Unlike site-built homes, which are subject to 
numerous differing state and local regulations, manufactured homes are 
built to just one uniform federal preemptive code. In place since 1976 
pursuant to the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety 
Standards Act (MHCSS) of 1974, the HUD Code provides a single uniform 
regulatory framework for home design and construction of manufactured 
homes, including standards for health, safety, energy efficiency, and 
durability. This has enabled manufacturers to ship homes across 
interstate lines and achieve economies of scale that have brought high 
quality affordable homes to millions of people.

    As the Committee develops tax incentives to increase the affordable 
housing supply, we ask that you ensure that manufactured housing is an 
eligible form of housing under such incentives. With respect to 
specific proposals and programs, we offer the Committee the suggestions 
below.

    MHI continues to be very supportive of Chairman Wyden's proposal to 
create a first-time home buyer tax credit. The increase in mortgage 
rates over the last year has exacerbated homeownership affordability 
challenges. Adoption of this provision is potentially even more 
important than when the Chairman first proposed it.

    MHI also asks the Committee to explore ways to make current tax 
incentive programs more effective in generating investments for 
manufactured home communities. Manufactured home communities are a 
critical affordable housing model. Because of the financial and 
lifestyle benefits of owning a manufactured home versus the limitations 
that come with renting an apartment or buying a condominium or other 
site-built home, millions of individuals and families have chosen to 
live in land-lease manufactured home communities. There are more than 
43,000 land-lease communities in the country with almost 4.3 million 
homesites. Today, half of new manufactured homes are placed in land-
lease communities. Demand for living in land-lease manufactured home 
communities continues to rise because these communities provide an 
effective way for residents to become homeowners without the 
substantial barrier to entry posed by the down payment necessary for 
the purchase of land. In the aftermath of the pandemic, where families 
are seeking their own outdoor space and neighborhood amenities, the 
popularity of land-lease communities is growing, and occupancy rates 
are high.

    As the Committee analyzes the supply of affordable homeownership in 
America, we believe land-lease communities offer a positive example of 
what affordable housing should look like. Land-lease communities 
provide much more than affordable housing. They offer a sense of 
neighborhood and often feature a range of amenities--such as swimming 
pools, clubhouses, and playgrounds--and events and activities to 
support residents' sense of community. In active senior lifestyle 
communities, residents enjoy resort-style amenities and an array of 
planned events and activities. In all-age communities, neighborhood 
settings with playgrounds, sports courts, and clubhouses offer families 
a place to thrive. Many offer events and programming, including after 
school programs.

    In addition to high occupancy rates and increased demand 
demonstrating its attractiveness, the successful hybrid homeownership 
model of land-lease communities is also evidenced in consumer research 
that shows that residents who live in these communities are highly 
satisfied with their housing choice. U.S. Census data and independent 
research conducted by MHI shows that manufactured housing residents 
report high levels of satisfaction and that they are likely to 
recommend it to others. To read more about this research, please visit 
https://www.manufactured
housing.org/commresearchresults-2/.

    Many existing land-lease communities were built several decades ago 
and need an infusion of funds from new investors to address long 
neglected capital improvements like roads, sewer, and water. When 
properties are not being maintained, they are at risk for closure 
because adequate property standards are not being met. In addition, as 
surrounding property values rise, some localities are deciding to buy 
the land and use it for retail or other uses, removing a significant 
source of affordable housing.

    Opportunity Zone tax incentives can currently be used to make these 
critical investments. However, their use and availability for this 
purpose is very limited by the requirement that funds must be a 
reinvestment of capital gains from sales taking place within the 
previous 180 days. One option to facilitate more investments in 
affordable manufactured home communities would be for Congress to fund 
additional investments in high poverty Opportunity Zones. Such funds 
could be allocated to states, which would re-allocate and target their 
use to high priority activities within existing Opportunity Zones, 
including workforce housing through investments in manufactured home 
communities.

    A second option would be a narrowly targeted change to allow 
Opportunity Zone tax incentives within existing Opportunity Zones for 
investments in affordable manufactured home communities, 
notwithstanding the current restriction that this must be a 
reinvestment of a recent capital gains transaction.

    In addition to making Opportunity Zones more effective in 
supporting manufactured housing communities, we believe the Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credit program could also be improved to facilitate the 
preservation and development of manufactured home communities. Funding 
from the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) has not historically 
been directed toward the development or preservation of manufactured 
home communities. We ask the Committee to consider specifically naming 
development of and preservation of manufactured home communities as 
eligible activities under the program. Such provision should allow all 
eligible community owners to obtain financing to preserve manufactured 
home communities. This could be done as a part of the Committee's 
consideration of expanding the credit to increase affordable housing 
investments proposed by Senators Cantwell and Young in ``The Affordable 
Housing Credit Improvement Act,'' which MHI has endorsed.

    Finally, we would ask the Committee to consider incentives for the 
replacement of mobile homes with HUD Code manufactured homes. 
Manufactured homes built prior to 1976 are known as ``mobile homes.'' 
In June 1976, the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety 
Standards Act (also known as the HUD Code) went into effect, which 
established federal standards for manufactured housing design and 
construction, strength and durability, transportability, fire 
resistance, energy efficiency and quality. The HUD Code also sets 
performance standards for the heating, plumbing, air conditioning, 
thermal and electrical systems.

    Because mobile homes were not built to the HUD Code, many of these 
homes do not meet today's rigorous standards and owners of mobiles 
homes would benefit from replacing and/or retrofitting their current 
homes to HUD Code homes. However, owners of these homes are typically 
low- and moderate-income families that lack the resources of financing 
options to update their homes to meet today's construction standards. A 
tax incentive for repair or replacement could be very impactful to 
ensure people have access to resilient, efficient, and quality 
homeownership.

    Thank you for the opportunity to share our views on the important 
matter of preserving and increasing affordable housing across the 
country. Increased federal support for boosting the supply of 
manufactured housing will not only strengthen homeownership 
opportunities for millions of Americans but also provide more options 
to consumers hurt by unaffordable rents and the shortage of adequate 
housing options. Land-lease communities are critically important to the 
availability of affordable housing in America, and we look forward to 
working with you on ways to increase and preserve this attainable 
homeownership option for more families.

Re:  Tomorrow's Hearing: ``Tax Policy's Role in Increasing Affordable 
Housing Supply for Working Families''

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

I write to you today on behalf of the National Association of 
Federally-Insured Credit Unions (NAFCU) in conjunction with tomorrow's 
hearing, ``Tax Policy's Role in Increasing Affordable Housing Supply 
for Working Families.'' As you are aware, NAFCU advocates for all 
federally-insured not-for-profit credit unions that, in turn, serve 
over 135 million consumers with personal and small business financial 
service products. We would like to take this opportunity to highlight 
our support for the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act and Affordable 
Housing Credit Improvement Act, as these two pieces of legislation 
would help address America's housing affordability crisis and provide 
commonsense housing solutions for underserved communities. Credit 
unions continue to focus on serving rural, low-income, and underserved 
communities and increasing our presence in these areas.

The housing market is a critical aspect of our nation's economy, and 
the future availability of affordable housing is of great importance to 
our nation's credit unions and their 135 million members. In the years 
since the Great Recession and hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
it has become increasingly clear that the status quo is an 
unsustainable long-term option. Before, during, and after the financial 
crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, credit unions provided and continue to 
provide quality loans through solid underwriting practices, and we look 
forward to continue being a part of affordable housing solutions.

Neighborhood Homes Investment Act

In urban, rural, and all underserved areas, the absence of quality 
homes undermines both neighborhood stability and the opportunity for 
families to build wealth through homeownership. Too often the major 
impediment to building new homes or rehabilitating abandoned or 
deteriorated ones in these communities is that the cost exceeds the 
homes' market value upon completion. The Neighborhood Homes Investment 
Act would address this problem by providing a tax credit to cover a 
portion of the construction and rehabilitation costs of homes for 
owner-occupancy.

The new tax credits would be administered by state agencies through 
annual competitive application rounds. Tax credits would only be 
available for modestly priced homes in communities characterized by 
high poverty, low incomes, and low home values. The credits could not 
be claimed until the construction is completed, and the home is 
occupied by an eligible homeowner, and would only cover the difference 
between the eligible development costs and the final sales price. We 
ask for your support of this commonsense measure aimed at increasing 
accessibility and the volume of quality homes in underserved 
communities.

Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act

This bill would help address the affordable housing crisis by building 
or preserving an estimated two million additional affordable homes 
through an expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. 
Specifically, this legislation would increase the current annual Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit allocation by 50 percent, allow for a more 
efficient use of bond resources resulting in even more Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credit production and preservation, and boost resources for 
states to better serve rural, tribal, and underserved communities.

Since the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit's inception in 1986, it has 
been responsible for virtually all the production and preservation of 
affordable housing in the United States. NAFCU urges you to support the 
expansion of this tried-and-true method for increasing and preserving 
affordable housing.

We thank you for your leadership and appreciate the opportunity to 
share our thoughts on improving housing affordability. Should you have 
any questions or require any additional information, please contact me 
or Jake Plevelich, NAFCU's Associate Director of Legislative Affairs,

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

On behalf of the more than 1.5 million members of the National 
Association of Realtors<SUP>'</SUP>, thank you for holding the March 7, 
2023, hearing entitled ``Tax Policy's Role in Increasing Affordable 
Housing Supply for Working Families.'' Few issues in our Nation are 
more topical and urgent than finding effective ways to reduce the dire 
shortage of places for American families to live.

There is little or no debate around the question of whether the U.S. 
has a shortage of residential units. Rather, the question is how large 
the supply gap is. Estimates of the gap vary from about 3.8 million 
units to over 7 million.

But even if we could wave a magic wand and have this many additional 
housing units appear overnight, many experts believe we would still 
face an affordability issue. Thus, the number of additional homes 
needed to provide safe and affordable places to live for all who need 
and want them is likely a multiple of the numbers above.

Perhaps even more vital is the question of how best our national 
policies can be changed to begin to meet these needs. And specific to 
this Committee, how can tax policies be changed to incentivize the 
creation of more affordable housing units?

Realtors<SUP>'</SUP>, who consider the lack of supply of housing as an 
issue of the highest order, are heartened to learn that the lack of 
supply is recognized by members of the Finance Committee and other 
policymakers in Congress as a grievous problem. And we are also 
relieved to see that this recognition is bipartisan.

We urge you to consider the following ideas as components of an overall 
plan of Federal tax changes to incentivize the creation of more housing 
units for Americans:

      Enact tax credits to lower the cost of converting unused 
commercial real estate to residential units. These properties can be 
warehouses, offices, shopping malls, or even old schools. And they can 
be found in cities, suburban areas, as well as in small towns and rural 
parts of the Nation. Each residential unit thus created would assist 
with the housing shortage. And it would provide the additional bonuses 
of shoring up the commercial markets, boosting the economy and creating 
new jobs.
      Provide a capital gains tax rate reduction (perhaps 50 percent 
of the current rate) to owners of residential rental properties who 
sell a unit to a first-time buyer who will occupy it as their home. 
Some 10 million owner-occupied homes were purchased by investors of all 
types and sizes and converted to rentals in the wake of the housing 
crisis of 2008, significantly lowering the supply of available homes 
for purchase. This incentive could be limited to small investors, who 
still own the great majority of all rental homes. Because this would 
not require new construction, this idea could likely create new 
ownership opportunities for first-time buyers more quickly than any 
other incentive idea.
      Increase the exclusion on the gain on sale of a principal 
residence. Record jumps in home prices over the past few years has 
disincentivized older homeowners from selling their homes in order to 
move to smaller ones or to retirement facilities, simply because the 
resulting capital gains tax would leave too little to afford to replace 
the sold home. The result is that there are fewer homes available for 
younger or newer homeowners to move into, thus driving demand and 
prices even higher.
      Pass the Affordable Housing Tax Credit Improvement Act. This 
bipartisan legislation would improve the way the Low Income Housing Tax 
Credit works by increasing the credit allocation by 50 percent while 
making other improvements to what many regard as the most successful 
affordable housing program in the Nation's history. These changes are 
projected to provide over 2 million additional affordable homes over 
the next 10 years.
      Approve the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act. This legislation, 
which also enjoys broad bipartisan support, would make an appreciable 
increase in the housing supply over the next 10 years by mobilizing 
private investment to build or rehabilitate as many as 500,000 
affordable homes for moderate- and middle-income homeowners in 
distressed neighborhoods.

These tax incentive ideas would go a long distance toward creating a 
strong down payment on the new affordable residential units that we 
need to stave off an even deeper crisis of under-housed Americans.

Again, thank you again for holding this hearing and expressing publicly 
the urgency of these needs. We look forward to continuing to work with 
you and your colleagues on this most important issue.

Sincerely,

Kenny Parcell
2023 President

      Statement of Jeff Burum, Chairman of the Board of Directors

    On behalf of National Community Renaissance (``National CORE'') I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to submit this statement for the 
record for the March 7, 2023 Senate Finance Committee Hearing on ``Tax 
Policy's Role in Increasing Affordable Housing Supply for Working 
Families.''

    The construction of new affordable rental housing units is a 
significant challenge, necessitating entities like National CORE to 
obtain substantial amounts of equity from a range of sources, including 
federal sources such as housing tax credits and HUD HOME and CDBG 
funding. These challenges are particularly difficult in high-cost 
areas, such as California, where National CORE is active.

    I am writing to suggest the Committee explore opportunities to 
create targeted capital gains exemptions for long-time holdings of 
rental housing developments, contingent on donation of such properties 
to a non-profit affordable housing developer/owner that covenants to 
keep and maintain the housing units affordable for an extended period.

    An unutilized opportunity to more efficiently create affordable 
rental housing occurs when an owner of existing rental housing 
properties, where the owner has held the property for a long period of 
time, and currently has an exceptionally low tax basis, both because 
the property has appreciated and because the owner has taken 
significant deprecation. In such cases, it is common for older owners 
of such properties not to sell the properties, but instead wait to 
obtain the stepped-up basis at death, in order to avoid paying capital 
gains and recapture taxes.

    Our proposal would be to provide targeted tax relief from capital 
gains, including depreciation recapture. This would incentivize such 
owners to donate the property to a qualified non-profit affordable 
housing owner who agrees to keep the units affordable. We believe the 
tax costs would be very low or de minimis, because as noted above, 
owners in such situations typically do not sell these properties, but 
wait for the step-up basis.

    We note that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted a 
similar concept, creating a donation tax credit (DTC), similarly 
designed to incentivize donation of rental properties for affordable 
housing use. However, a federal tax incentive would be even more 
dynamic and broad-based.

    At National CORE, we have developed and modeled such tax incentive 
options at the federal level, and would be happy to discuss our 
findings with the Committee.

Chair Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the Committee, thank 
you for the opportunity to submit a statement for the record on the 
role of tax policy in increasing affordable housing supply.

The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) is dedicated to 
achieving racially and socially equitable public policy that ensures 
people with the lowest incomes have quality homes that are accessible 
and affordable in communities of their choice. NLIHC members include 
state and local affordable housing coalitions, residents of public and 
assisted housing, nonprofit housing providers, homeless service 
providers, fair housing organizations, researchers, faith-based 
organizations, public housing agencies, private developers and property 
owners, local and state government agencies, and concerned citizens. 
While our members include the spectrum of housing interests, we do not 
represent any segment of the housing industry. Rather, we work on 
behalf of and with low-income people who receive, as well as those who 
need, federal housing assistance, especially extremely low-income 
people and people who are experiencing homelessness.

Even before the pandemic, millions of extremely low-income households--
disproportionately people of color--were struggling to remain housed, 
always one financial shock away from falling behind on rent and being 
threatened with eviction and, in the worst cases, homelessness. On any 
given night, more than half a million people experienced homelessness, 
and millions more were at risk.\1\

Homelessness: 2021 Edition, retrieved from: https://

The underlying cause of America's housing and homelessness crisis is 
the severe shortage of homes affordable and available to people with 
the lowest incomes and the widening gap between incomes and housing 
costs. There is a national shortage of 7 million homes that are 
affordable and available to America's lowest-income renters--those with 
incomes less than either the federal poverty guideline or 30% of their 
area median income (AMI), whichever is greater. The severe shortage of 
affordable and available homes for extremely low-income renters is a 
structural feature of the country's housing system, consistently 
impacting people in every state and nearly every community.\2\

marginalized renters, including seniors, people with disabilities, and 
working families, can spend on housing. Despite the clear and urgent 
need, Congress only provides housing assistance to one in four eligible 
households.\4\

Without affordable housing options, 10 million of the lowest-income 
renter households pay at least half of their income on rent, leaving 
them without the resources they need to put food on the table, purchase 
needed medications, or otherwise make ends meet.\5\ Paying so much of 
their limited income on rent leaves the lowest-income families always 
one financial shock--whether from a sick child, broken-down car, high 
heating bill, or other unexpected expense--away from facing eviction 
and, in the worst cases, homelessness.

Now, renters are faced with increased inflation, higher rents, eviction 
filing rates that are reaching or surpassing pre-pandemic averages, 
and, in many communities, worsening homelessness. Rent increases are 
exacerbating our country's affordable housing crisis, pushing more 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
people into homelessness each year.

To help end our nation's housing and homelessness crisis, Congress must 
increase investments in long-term solutions to the underlying shortage 
of affordable, accessible homes and improve renter protections for the 
lowest-income people. This should include making rental assistance 
universally available to everyone in need, preserving and expanding the 
supply of homes affordable to people with the lowest incomes, 
preventing evictions and homelessness, and strengthening and enforcing 
renter protections. These solutions must be paired with reforms to 
break down barriers that prevent access to critical resources and that 
deepen racial disparities.

This year, the Senate Finance Committee has the opportunity to improve 
our nation's response to the housing crisis by expanding and reforming 
the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) so that it better reaches 
those households with the greatest, clearest needs. LIHTC is the 
primary source of financing for the construction and preservation of 
affordable housing. While it is an important resource, LIHTC, on its 
own, rarely builds or preserves homes affordable to households with the 
lowest incomes. To ensure that the tax credit program better serves 
people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, Congress should pair 
any expansion of LIHTC with key reforms, including those included in 
the bipartisan ``Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act'' (AHCIA) 
and other legislation.

Moreover, Congress should reject any proposal to create a new tax 
credit to build housing affordable to middle-income households, such as 
the proposal introduced by Chair Wyden. As outlined below, this 
proposal is misguided and wasteful, essentially subsidizing developers 
to build market-rate housing. To meet the housing needs of middle-
income households, Congress should instead incentivize or require 
communities to address zoning and land use barriers that restrict the 
ability of the private sector to build apartments, increasing rental 
costs for everyone. Limited federal resources should be directed 
towards those with the greatest and clearest needs, and for whom the 
private market on its own cannot build an operate homes affordable to 
them: extremely low-income households.

Underlying Causes of the Housing Crisis

Shortage of Affordable Housing for the Lowest-Income Renters
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the country was in the grips of a 
pervasive affordable housing crisis, impacting rural, suburban, and 
urban communities alike. An underlying cause of America's housing 
crisis is a market failure that results in a severe shortage of rental 
homes affordable to people with the lowest incomes. Nationwide, there 
is a shortage of 7 million homes affordable and available to extremely 
low-income renters, whose household incomes are at or below either the 
federal poverty guideline or 30% of their area median income (whichever 
is greater). For every 10 of the lowest-income renter households, there 
are fewer than four homes affordable and available to them.\6\

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]The shortage of affordable and available homes for the lowest-
income renters ranges in severity depending on state and congressional 
district, but there is no state or district with enough affordable 
homes for its lowest-income renters. For example, in Chair Wyden's 
state of Oregon, there are just two affordable homes available for 
every 10 of the lowest-income renter households. Ranking Member Crapo's 
state of Idaho faces a similar situation, with only four available 
homes for every 10 of the lowest-income renters.\7\

Systemic racism, past and present, has led to significant racial 
disparities in both renter demographics and adverse outcomes 
experienced by renters, such as cost burdens, evictions, and 
homelessness. The unaffordability of the rental market 
disproportionately harms Black and Latino households because they are 
more likely at all income levels to be renters: 30% of white households 
are renters, compared with 58% of Black households and 46% of Latino 
households.\8\

Moreover, renters of color are much more likely than white households 
to be extremely low-income renters. Twenty percent of Black households, 
18% of American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) households, 15% of 
Latino households, and 10% of Asian households are extremely low-income 
renters, compared to only 6% of white non-Latino households. Renters of 
color are also more likely to experience housing cost burdens than 
white, non-Latino renters. While 43% of white renters are cost-
burdened, 53% of Latino renters and 55% of Black, non-Latino renters 
are cost-burdened. Thirty-one percent of Black, non-Latino renters and 
28% of Latino renters are severely cost-burdened, compared to 22% of 
white, non-Latino renters.\9\

Nationwide, 10 million of the lowest-income renters pay at least half 
of their income on rent, leaving them without the resources they need 
to make ends meet. Housing cost burdens are concentrated among the 
lowest-income renters. Eighty-six percent of extremely low-income 
renters are cost-burdened, and 72% of extremely low-income households 
are severely cost-burdened.\10\ Research indicates that the lowest-
income households spend significantly less on other necessities--such 
as food, clothing, transportation, and healthcare--when they are forced 
to spend more than half of their income on rent and utilities.\11\

The Gap between Incomes and Housing Costs
A major cause of housing instability is the fundamental mismatch 
between growing housing costs and stagnant incomes for people with the 
lowest incomes. NLIHC's Out of Reach: The High Cost of Housing \12\ 
annual report estimates each locality's ``Housing Wage''--the hourly 
wage a full-time worker must earn to afford a modest apartment without 
spending more than 30% of their income on housing. In 2022, the 
national Housing Wage was $25.82 per hour for a modest two-bedroom 
rental home and $21.25 per hour for a modest one-bedroom rental home.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eleven of the 25 largest occupations in the U.S. pay a lower median 
hourly wage than the wage a full-time worker needs to earn to afford a 
modest one- or two-
bedroom apartment at the national average fair market rent. More than 
24 million people work in the five lowest-paying occupations--retail 
sales, food and beverage services, food preparation, home health aide 
and personal care services, and building cleaning. Workers in these 
occupations earn median wages that fall more than $6 short of what a 
full-time worker needs for a one-bedroom apartment.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ National Low Income Housing Coalition (2022), Out of Reach: 
The High Cost of Housing, retrieved from: https://nlihc.org/oor.

The average minimum wage worker must work 96 hours per week (nearly two 
and a half full-time jobs) to afford a two-bedroom rental home, or 79 
hours per week (two full-time jobs) to afford a one-bedroom rental home 
at the fair market rent. People who work 96 hours per week and need 
eight hours per day of sleep have around two hours per day left over 
for everything else--commuting, cooking, cleaning, self-care, caring 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
for children and family, and serving their community.

Low-wage workers are not the only renters who struggle to afford their 
housing. Housing is unaffordable for low-income families in a variety 
of circumstances. Three-quarters of the nation's 4.4 million senior 
renters with incomes less than 50% of AMI are housing cost-burdened. 
Over 2 million households are very low-income, have a disability, and 
are not in the labor force, with most of these households paying more 
than 30% of their income toward rent. Of the country's approximately 
850,000 very low-income householders who are single-adult caregivers or 
students, 93% are cost-burdened.\14\<SUP>,</SUP> \15\

Lack of Federal Resources
The shortage of rental homes affordable to the lowest-income people is 
caused by market failures and the chronic underfunding of solutions. 
Government intervention, in the form of subsidies, is necessary to fill 
the gap between what the lowest-income people can afford to pay and the 
costs of developing and operating rental homes. Congress has 
consistently underfunded housing subsidies such that only one in four 
households eligible for housing assistance receives any.\16\ Millions 
of families are placed on wait-lists for housing assistance, many of 
them faced with homelessness or overcrowding while they wait.\17\

Critically Needed Reforms to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

Deeper Income Targeting
To address America's housing crisis, Congress must prioritize federal 
housing investments to address the severe shortage of homes affordable 
and available to our nation's lowest-income and most marginalized 
households.

Despite the incredible need, the nation's primary source of financing 
to build and preserve affordable homes--LIHTC--is not sufficient on its 
own to build homes affordable to extremely low-income households. LIHTC 
is targeted to build homes affordable to households earning up to 50% 
or 60% of the area median income. As a result, extremely low-income 
households generally can only afford rent in a LIHTC development if 
they receive rental assistance. The majority (58%) of extremely low-
income renters living in LIHTC developments who do not receive rental 
assistance are severely cost-burdened, paying more than half of their 
limited incomes on rent.\18\ One emergency or unexpected expense could 
send these households into homelessness.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program by Looking at the Tenants? 
Housing Policy Debate, 23, 597-613, retrieved from: https://nlihc.org/
sites/default/files/Improving-Low-Income-Housing-Tax-Credit-Data-for-
Preservation.pdf.

To help increase the supply of deeply affordable housing for America's 
lowest-income households, Congress should include in any housing supply 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
tax legislation:

      A 50% basis boost for housing developments where at least 20% of 
units are set aside for households with extremely low incomes or those 
experiencing homelessness. This reform, as included in the Affordable 
Housing Tax Credit Improvement Act, would help facilitate the 
development of more affordable housing for populations with special 
needs, such as formerly homeless individuals and people with 
disabilities.
      A 10% set-aside of tax credits to help offset the costs to build 
these homes, as proposed by Chair Wyden (D-OR) in the ``Decent, 
Affordable, Safe Housing for All (DASH) Act.'' To ensure that more 
housing developments built using LIHTC serve extremely low-income 
households, Congress should set aside 10% of the program's resources 
for developments where at least 20% of units are set aside for 
households with extremely low incomes or those experiencing 
homelessness.
Improved Access in Rural and Tribal Communities
Likewise, rural communities face unique barriers to developing 
affordable rental homes, including lower incomes, higher poverty rates, 
and lack of access to private capital. Indigenous people have some of 
the worst housing needs in the U.S. They face high poverty rates and 
low incomes, overcrowding, lack of plumbing and heat, and unique 
development issues. Despite the growing need for safe, decent homes, 
however, federal investments in affordable housing on tribal lands have 
lagged for decades, particularly in more rural and remote areas. As a 
result, far too many rural families live in rental homes that are 
unaffordable or are in substandard condition. To address the 
significant housing needs for Indigenous people and those in rural 
America, Congress should include in housing supply tax legislation:

      Changes to designate tribal communities as ``Difficult to 
Develop Areas'' (DDAs). Most tribal areas do not qualify under current 
DDA standards. This reform, as proposed in the Affordable Housing 
Credit Improvement Act, would make housing developments in tribal 
communities automatically eligible for a 30% basis boost, making it 
more financially feasible for developers to build affordable homes in 
these areas.
      Changes to designated rural communities as ``Difficult to 
Develop Areas'' (DDAs), making housing developments in rural America 
automatically eligible for a 30% basis boost.
Preservation of LIHTC Developments
Congress must use LIHTC to ensure long-term affordability of LIHTC 
properties.

      Eliminate the ``Qualified Contract'' loophole from the LIHTC 
program, as proposed in the DASH Act. Under the Qualified Contract 
loophole, LIHTC owners can avoid federal and state affordability 
restrictions after just 15 years, rather than the 30-year minimum 
requirement. The QC loophole has led to a substantial loss of 
affordable rental homes, harming low-income residents and wasting 
scarce federal investments.
      Clarify and strengthen the ``right of first refusal'' (ROFR) for 
nonprofit owners, as proposed in the DASH Act. By statute, Congress 
provides nonprofit organizations with a ROFR to help facilitate their 
ability to purchase LIHTC developments. In recent years, some private 
investors have challenged the ROFR in hopes of preventing the 
preservation sale in order to raise rents or of extracting additional 
payments from the nonprofit. This puts the long-term financial health 
and condition of the properties at risk.
Other Needed Reforms
Other reforms are needed to provide greater oversight and transparency 
of LIHTC and ensure renter protections for those living in these homes.

      Provide HUD access to IRS data on LIHTC properties. HUD's LIHTC 
database, the primary data source about LIHTC properties, includes 
critical information needed to protect residents and preserve federal 
investments. However, the database is incomplete and some data points 
can be unreliable. While HFAs report critical property-level data to 
IRS, federal law does not allow IRS to share this data with HUD. 
Without more accurate and complete data, long-term tracking of LIHTC 
properties and the ability to preserve these homes is more difficult.
      Extend renter protections to tenants living in LIHTC properties. 
Tenants in LIHTC properties have few protections, placing tenants and 
applicants in a vulnerable position, as they may be evicted or denied 
admission for arbitrary or unlawful reasons.

Opposition to the Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit

During today's hearing, Chair Wyden may bring attention to his DASH 
Act. While some provisions in the DASH Act provide critically needed 
resources to help struggling households, other measures--such as a 
proposal to create a Middle-Income Housing Tax Credit (MIHTC)--are 
misguided and wasteful. NLIHC is eager to work with Chair Wyden, and 
the Finance Committee, and craft legislation to ensure that tax 
legislation addresses the needs of the lowest-income renters.

The DASH Act includes several housing provisions that would help 
address America's housing crisis. By fully funding rental assistance 
and investing robust resources in the national Housing Trust Fund, the 
bill would ensure that millions of households can afford their rent. 
The bill also includes an innovative proposal to create a new project-
based renters' tax credit that could be layered onto LIHTC to ensure 
that homes built with the tax credit are affordable to people living in 
poverty. Among other important reforms, the legislation would close 
loopholes in the LIHTC program that developers have exploited to 
convert federally assisted properties to market rate and prevent 
nonprofit organizations from preserving the properties as affordable.

NLIHC strongly opposes any efforts to create a tax credit for middle-
income households, as there is no sound rationale for using scarce 
federal resources for this purpose. The DASH Act would create a new 
federal tax credit to incentivize developers to build and preserve 
market-rate apartments--housing that is affordable to families earning 
100% or below of the area median income (AMI). Research shows, however, 
that middle-income families comprise less than 1% of those facing 
significant housing challenges, while 92.5% of these households have 
very low or extremely low incomes and would not be served by this new 
tax break for investors. At a time when there are more than four times 
as many homeless households as there are severely cost-burdened middle-
income renter households, we must target federal funding to where it is 
most needed: making homes affordable for the lowest-income and most 
marginalized people.

To address the housing needs of middle-income households, Congress 
should instead incentivize or require state and local governments that 
receive federal transportation and infrastructure funding to eliminate 
restrictive zoning rules that increase the cost of development, limit 
housing supply for all renters, and reinforce segregation and 
structural racism in housing and other systems. Local communities can 
and must do their part in eliminating the exclusionary zoning policies 
that put pressure on middle-income renters in a handful of metro areas.

Other Innovative Tax Approaches

To address the housing crisis, Congress should expand rental assistance 
to make it universally available to all eligible households in need. 
Making rental assistance available to all eligible households is 
central to any successful strategy for solving the housing crisis. 
Rental assistance is a critical tool for helping the lowest-income 
people afford decent, stable, accessible housing, and the program has a 
proven record of reducing homelessness and housing poverty. A growing 
body of research finds that rental assistance can improve health and 
educational outcomes, increase children's chances of long-term success, 
and advance racial equity.

The Senate Finance Committee should consider legislation to use the tax 
code to help bridge the gap between incomes and housing costs. NLIHC 
supports the creation of a renters' tax credit, like the programs 
proposed in both the ``Rent Relief Act of 2022'' (S. 4728, H.R. 8357) 
introduced in the 117th Congress by Senator Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and 
Representative Danny Davis (D-IL), and the ``Housing, Opportunity, 
Mobility, and Equity Act'' (S. 5228, H.R. 9466) introduced in the 117th 
Congress by Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Representative Jim Clyburn 
(D-SC).

A new, refundable tax credit could put more money in the pockets of 
families at a time when growing inflation is making housing even more 
unaffordable, particularly for people with the lowest incomes, who are 
disproportionately people of color. Based on the success of the Child 
Tax Credit, a renters' tax credit should provide monthly support to the 
lowest-income renters who spend at least 30% of their gross income on 
rent and utilities. Through this design, a renter's tax credit could 
help serve the three in four households eligible for rental assistance 
who are unable to receive assistance because of chronic underfunding by 
Congress.

Conclusion

Thank you again for the opportunity to submit a statement for the 
record for this hearing on tax policy's role in affordable housing. By 
holding this hearing, the Committee is taking important steps in using 
the tax code to increase housing supply. NLIHC will continue to support 
efforts to expand and reform the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit so that 
it better meets the needs of extremely-low income families. We look 
forward to working with members of the Committee to enact vital tax 
policy that improves families' access to affordable housing.

           Does Housing Affordability Argue for Subsidizing 
                the Construction of Tax Credit Projects?

    The low-income housing tax credit program (LIHTC) is the largest 
and fastest growing low-income housing program in the U.S. It 
subsidizes the construction and renovation of more units each year than 
all other government housing programs combined. The tax credits 
themselves involved new commitments of about $20 billion in 2021 (U.S. 
Congress, Joint Committee on Taxation, 2022, Table 4).\1\ However, 
these projects received substantial additional subsidies from federal, 
state, and local governments. The magnitude of these additional 
subsidies has not been documented for the entire country since the 
early years of the program (Cummings and DiPasquale 1999), but a recent 
study of tax credit projects in California indicated that the tax 
credits accounted for only half of total subsidies (Lang and Olsen 
2023).\2\ If this result applied to the entire country, the taxpayer 
cost of providing housing in projects that were allocated tax credits 
in 2021 would have been about $40 billion. Adding tenant rents to 
public subsidies yields a total cost of about $55 billion to provide 
housing in the projects approved in 2021 over their 30-year use 
agreements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The tax credits awarded in a year are claimed in ten equal 
installments. The amounts reported in this source refer to the amounts 
that will be claimed in a single year. These amounts must be multiplied 
by ten to obtain the total commitment.
    \2\  About half of the additional subsidies are rental assistance 
payments received by developers who have renovated older HUD and USDA 
housing projects that continue to receive deep subsidies from the 
programs involved.

    Proposed legislation \3\ in the Senate would greatly expand the tax 
credit program. This is billed as a solution to a housing affordability 
problem described in terms of the many families that devote a large 
fraction of their income to housing, and many argue that the expansion 
is necessary to house the homeless. Neither argument withstands 
scrutiny.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/1136.

    Building new projects is a very expensive solution to the housing 
affordability problem described. We don't need to build new housing 
projects to help families that spend a large fraction of their income 
on housing. They are already housed. If we think that their housing is 
unaffordable, the cheapest solution is for the government to pay a part 
of the rent. HUD's housing voucher program does just that at a much 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
lower cost than the tax credit program.

    Furthermore, it's neither necessary nor desirable to construct new 
units to house the homeless. The number of people who are homeless is 
far less than the number of vacant units--indeed, far less than the 
number of vacant units renting for less than the median rent. In the 
entire country, there are less than 600,000 homeless people \4\ on a 
single night, and because some are families with children and couples 
without children, less than 470,000 units are needed to house them. 
Although the vacancy rate is relatively low now, there are more than 
2.7 million vacant units \5\ available for rent. All homeless people 
could easily be accommodated in vacant existing units, and that would 
be much less expensive than building new units for them. The reason 
that they are homeless is that they don't have the money to pay the 
rent for existing vacant units. A housing voucher would solve that 
problem. A major HUD-funded random assignment experiment called the 
Family Options Study \6\ compared the cost and effectiveness of housing 
vouchers and subsidized housing projects for serving the homeless. 
Short-term housing vouchers were as effective and much less expensive 
than transitional housing projects.

Options-Study-Full-Report.pdf.

    The evidence indicates that the tenant-based housing voucher 
program is by far the most cost-effective approach to delivering 
housing assistance.\7\ The best study of HUD's largest program that 
subsidized the construction of privately owned projects indicated that 
the total cost of providing housing under this program was at least 44 
percent greater than the total cost of providing equally good housing 
under the housing voucher program (Wallace and others \8\ 1981). This 
translated into excessive taxpayer cost of at least 72 percent for the 
same outcome. It implies that housing vouchers could have served all 
the people served by this program equally well and served at least 72 
percent more people with the same characteristics without any increase 
in public spending.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Olsen (2008, pp. 9-15) summarizes the evidence, http://
eoolsen.weebly.com/uploads/7/7/9/6/7796901/final.olsenpaper-1.pdf.
    \8\ https://eoolsen.weebly.com/housing-policy-info.html.

    We don't have a cost-effectiveness study of this quality for the 
LIHTC program. The best national evidence available suggests that tax 
credit projects cost 16% more than the voucher program to provide units 
with the same number of bedrooms in the same metro area (GAO 2001).\9\ 
This is almost surely an underestimate because it omits some of the 
public subsidies to developers of tax credit projects such as land sold 
or leased to them by local public agencies at below-market prices, 
local property tax abatements received by some developers, and 
subsidies for renovating the projects during the initial use agreement. 
A recent study of the tax credit program in California revealed that 
the total taxpayer cost of providing housing in tax credit projects is 
at least a third greater than the cost of assisting the same families 
with standard housing vouchers (Lang and Olsen 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-01-901r.pdf.

    The best evidence available also indicates that occupants of tax 
credit projects capture a small fraction of the subsidies provided to 
developers. Burge (2011, p. 91) finds that the present value of the 
rent saving to tenants (the difference between the market rent of the 
unit and the rent paid by its tenant) is only 35% of the present value 
of the tax credits provided to developers. Combining this result with 
Cummings and Di Pasquale's finding that tax credits account for about 
two-thirds of development subsidies for tax credit projects leads to 
the conclusion that tenants capture at most 24% of the development 
subsidies. Combining Burge's result with Lang and Olsen's finding that 
tax credits account for only half of the taxpayer cost of tax credit 
projects leads to the conclusion that tenants capture only 18% of the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
public subsidies.

    A PBS Frontline documentary called Poverty, Politics, and Profit 
\10\ illustrates one of the reasons for this outcome, namely, LIHTC 
fraud. A follow-up piece \11\ with NPR, Department of Justice news 
releases,\12\ and articles \13\ in The Miami Herald provide more 
details. One investigation \14\ of several developers revealed excess 
subsidies of $36 million for 14 projects. Because subsidies are 
proportional to construction cost, developers have an incentive to 
overstate them. In the fraud uncovered in this investigation, the 
developer who was awarded tax credits persuaded contractors to provide 
inflated invoices for their work combined with kickbacks to the 
developers. Due to the difficulty of determining true construction cost 
and perhaps lax enforcement by some state housing agencies, developers 
succeed in greatly overstating them. The documentary indicated that the 
developer of one project overstated its development cost by 17%. 
Because the fraud involved is difficult to detect, the few cases 
uncovered so far are surely the tip of the iceberg. Recent 
investigations have uncovered fraud in Los Angeles,\15\ New York 
City,\16\ Dallas,\17\ and Maine,\18\ and other investigations \19\ are 
underway.

    The reasons for the excess cost of tax credit projects go beyond 
fraud. The program contains incentives that lead to housing with a low 
market value compared with its cost. Because the tax credit subsidies 
are proportional to construction cost and developers receive a 
substantial bonus for locating their projects in the poorest 
neighborhood, developers have an incentive to build expensive new 
buildings on inexpensive land. This is not done in the private market 
because the rents that tenants are willing to pay for these units falls 
well short of their cost. And due to the program's rent ceilings, 
owners have no incentive to provide routine maintenance.\20\ The 
developer cannot charge higher rents for better maintained units unless 
the market rent falls below the ceiling rent. In that event, the unit 
provides no subsidy to its tenant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \20\ The property's owner does have an incentive to make repairs 
that avoid major damage to the property because he or she will own it 
without restrictions at the end of the use agreement.

    Another reason for the excess cost of tax credit projects is the 
cost of soliciting subsidies from multiple sources and adhering to 
their restrictions. Developers are willing to incur the extra cost 
because it enables them to produce projects with higher market values 
and they own the project. Building a more expensive project also leads 
to higher developer fees. The cost of soliciting subsidies from 
multiple sources and adhering to their restrictions adds to the cost of 
the project beyond the cost of the inputs used to produce or renovate 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
housing.

    It's often argued that the large expense of subsidizing the 
construction of new tax credit projects is justified by low vacancy 
rates that prevent potential recipients from using housing vouchers. On 
this argument, subsidized construction is necessary to serve additional 
families in the tightest housing markets. Table 1 shows that the 
location of new tax credit projects is inconsistent with this 
justification. The construction of tax credit projects is not focused 
on metro areas with low vacancy rates. Over the decade studied, most 
tax credit units were built in metro areas with vacancy rates in excess 
of 8%. Almost 40% of all tax credit units were built in metro areas 
with vacancy rates greater than 10%. McClure (2019, Table 6) produces 
similar results at the census tract level. About half of tax credit 
units are in tracts with vacancy rates greater than 7% even though only 
42% of census tracts are in this category. Furthermore, new 
construction projects are not concentrated in census tracts with the 
lowest vacancy rates, and rehabilitation projects are not concentrated 
in tracts with the highest vacancy rates.

    Furthermore, low vacancy rates do not prevent potential recipients 
from using housing vouchers. Many are used in the tightest housing 
markets--more than 200,000 in the New York metro area, 100,000 in metro 
Los Angeles, and 50,000 in metro San Francisco. When the Housing 
Authority of the City of Los Angeles opened its voucher waiting list 
for two weeks in October 2022, about 223,000 families \21\ applied. 
This has happened throughout the country when voucher waiting lists 
have been opened to new applicants. Why would so many apply if housing 
vouchers could not be used?

homelessness.

    How are voucher recipients able to use vouchers in the tightest 
markets? Many families offered vouchers already occupy housing meeting 
the program's standards. We don't need vacant units for these families. 
They can participate without moving. Other families offered vouchers 
live in housing that doesn't meet program's minimum housing standards, 
but their landlords are willing to repair them to meet the standards in 
exchange for higher rents. In the tightest housing markets, it is more 
difficult for subsidized and unsubsidized families to find a unit 
preferred to their current housing. However, some families with and 
without vouchers do it. In some cases, voucher recipients find units 
that meet the program's minimum housing standards. In other cases, they 
find apartments that do not initially meet the standards but are 
upgraded to meet them. About half of the units occupied by voucher 
recipients have been repaired to meet the program's minimum housing 
standards (Kennedy and Finkel 1994). They did not meet minimum housing 
standards when first inspected but were repaired to meet them. The 
tenant-based voucher program substantially increases the supply of 
apartments meeting minimum housing standards without building new units 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
for the families involved.

    The Housing Assistance Supply Experiment of the Experimental 
Housing Allowance Program (EHAP) provides additional evidence on the 
ability of tenant-based vouchers to increase the supply of apartments 
meeting minimum housing standards.\22\ The Supply Experiment involved 
operating an entitlement tenant-based housing allowance program in two 
metropolitan areas for ten years. During the first five years of the 
experiment, about eleven thousand dwellings were repaired or improved 
to meet program standards entirely in response to tenant-based 
assistance (Lowry 1983, p. 24). This represented more than a 9 percent 
increase in the supply of apartments meeting minimum housing standards 
in these two metro areas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \22\ Olsen and Zabel (2015, pp. 903-904) provide a brief account of 
the experiment and its main results.

    Contrary to popular perceptions, programs that have subsidized the 
construction of privately owned low-income housing projects have had 
little effect on the size of the housing stock. The evidence indicates 
that these programs have crowded out unsubsidized construction to a 
considerable extent (Murray 1983, 1999, Malpezzi and Vandell 2002, and 
Eriksen and Rosenthal 2010). The most recent study finds that LIHTC has 
almost no effect on the number of units built. Tax credit projects have 
almost completely crowded out unsubsidized apartment buildings. The 
unsubsidized construction crowded out would not be housing built for 
low-income families. It would be built for families with higher incomes 
that are willing and able to spend more on their housing. However, when 
these middle-income families vacate their existing units to move into 
newly built housing, their existing units would become available to 
families with lower incomes. This is the normal mechanism through which 
the private market provides housing to low-income families (Rosenthal 
2014). LIHTC doesn't add to housing supply to any significant extent. 
Instead, it increases the number of low-income families living in newly 
built units and decreases the number of middle-income families living 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
in such units.

    Finally, evidence indicates that tenant-based vouchers lead to a 
larger increase in the number of occupied housing units than 
construction programs (Sinai and Waldfogel 2005). It's reasonable to 
believe that all subsidized housing programs lead to some increase in 
the number of occupied dwelling units by increasing the demand for 
distinct units. The offer of housing assistance of any type induces 
some individuals and families living with others to move to their own 
units. Abt (2006) indicates that about 26 percent of the families on 
the housing voucher waiting list were living with friends or relatives 
and 2 percent were living in a homeless shelter or transitional 
housing, and voucher usage resulted in corresponding decreases in these 
numbers. Since doubling up and homelessness are more common among the 
poorest families, the programs that serve them will have the greatest 
net effect on the number of occupied housing units. The voucher program 
serves somewhat poorer families than HUD's privately-owned subsidized 
projects and much poorer families than LIHTC (O'Regan and Horn 2013, 
Table 2).

    Given the available evidence on program performance, we should 
certainly not expand the tax credit program. The existing evidence 
argues for terminating it or phasing it out. If we want to serve 
additional families, we should expand the much more cost-effective 
housing voucher program. If the tax credit program is retained, 
Congress should insist on independent analyses of the highest quality 
that compare the cost-effectiveness of housing vouchers with the 
different types of low-income housing tax credit projects, including 
ones that renovate private and public housing projects built under HUD 
and USDA programs.

               Statement of Sam Landy, President and CEO

    I am pleased to submit this statement for the record for the March 
7, 2023, Senate Finance Committee Hearing on ``Tax Policy's Role 
Increasing in Affordable Housing Supply for Working Families.''

    I am submitting this statement in order to request that the 
Committee consider adoption of legislation to amend the existing 
Opportunity Zone statute to promote affordable workforce housing.

    I am the President and CEO of UMH Properties Inc., one of the 
premier owners and operators of manufactured home communities in the 
Nation. UMH Properties is publicly traded on the New York Stock 
Exchange. We currently own 135 manufactured home communities in 11 
states with approximately 25,700 developed homesites. Seven of our 
communities are currently located in Opportunity Zones. I have worked 
in the manufactured housing industry since 1985 and have been President 
of UMH Properties since 1994.

    UMH Properties has a 55-year history of providing quality 
affordable housing in manufactured home communities. Videos of our 
communities are available on our website and showcase the high-quality 
affordable housing that can be delivered through investment in 
manufactured home communities. We rent 1,000 sq. ft. three bedroom, two 
bath, modern, energy efficient, vinyl sided, shingle roofed homes on 
5,000 sq. ft. lots for $800 per month and up, to families with 
household income of $32,000 and up. We also sell both single section 
1,000 sq. ft. homes and 1,800 sq. ft. multi-section manufactured homes 
to people who buy the home and rent the lot. Those homes sell from 
$80,000 to $250,000 and have lot rents as low as $400 per month in our 
community.

    Manufactured housing is the most affordable homeownership option 
available for low- and moderate-income families in America. The average 
income of a manufactured home buyer is $35,000--while the average 
income of a home buyer buying a site-built home is over $100,000. 
Residents of manufactured home communities consist of people of all 
ages, family status, and incomes. We find that many residents seek 
manufactured housing based on the lower monthly payment derived from 
owning a financed manufactured home and renting a lot in a community as 
compared to owning land for the home and paying a mortgage and taxes on 
that land or renting an apartment or buying a house. Other residents 
use the proceeds of the sale of an existing home to pay all cash for a 
manufactured home and then only pay the lot rent. And other residents 
do not have the down payment or other ability to qualify for financing 
the purchase of a manufactured home and chose to rent the manufactured 
home. Further many people see themselves as needing a short term, less 
then three-year, affordable housing solution and see renting a 
manufactured home in a community as the best lowest cost solution. 
Since 2011 we have rented over 9,000 manufactured homes for monthly 
rent as low as $800 per month.

    Manufactured home communities--also known as land-lease 
communities--are a critical model for the delivery of affordable 
manufactured homes, 51% of new manufactured homes are currently being 
placed in manufactured home communities. There are more than 43,000 
land-lease communities in the U.S., representing almost 4.3 million 
homesites. These communities offer sites for families to place their 
manufactured homes, with professional management of the community and 
amenities that go with it.

    One of the greatest challenges facing older manufactured home 
communities is the need for an infusion of funds to address neglected 
capital improvements like roads, sewer, and water. UMH Properties has 
been highly successful in purchasing aging manufactured home 
communities in need of significant capital repairs--in order to 
modernize them and thereby protect the value of the investments of the 
manufactured homeowners living in those communities at affordable land 
lease rental rates. Further we add rental homes to fill the vacant lots 
in those communities and increase the supply of affordable work force 
housing in the community.

    These purchases and improvements of aging communities require 
significant investments. UMH Properties has a total market 
capitalization of approximately $2 billion, with gross revenue of over 
$190 million per year. UMH invests over $70 million a year in new 
rental homes and capital improvements to improve our manufactured home 
communities. These investments allow us to provide our residents with 
the highest quality affordable housing at the most reasonable rates. 
UMH shareholders include the pension funds that our residents have 
equity interests in.

    UMH has successfully renovated and upgraded seven manufactured home 
communities in opportunity zones and sees the brilliance of the idea of 
tax incentives attracting capital to previously underinvested areas of 
the country. UMH's experience in opportunity zones and renovating 
communities in Nashville and Memphis convince us that the concept of 
providing investors who make ten-year investments in affordable housing 
in opportunity zones with tax benefits results in the increased supply 
of badly needed affordable housing and further attracts employers and 
additional jobs and tax revenue to areas of the country that previously 
suffered from economic stagnation.

    UMH believes that the current opportunity zone fund law could be 
amended slightly so that far more meaningful investment is made in 
affordable housing in opportunity zones. Our experience is that the 
existing law inadvertently limits the pool of capital available to 
create affordable housing in opportunity zones by requiring those funds 
come from existing capital gains. That requirement is the basis for the 
criticism of the opportunity zone program only being available to the 
wealthy who have capital gains. We believe opening up affordable 
housing investments through opportunity zones to all investors will 
greatly increase the pool of capital flowing into opportunity zones to 
create affordable housing.

    It is our opinion that the greater the supply of funds invested in 
affordable housing in opportunity zones the quicker the area will 
become economically able to be self-sufficient from growing tax revenue 
that employers seeking the quality work force a supply of affordable 
housing will bring to the areas provide.

    We therefore seek removal of the existing opportunity zone 
requirement that investments be a reinvestment of funds from a capital 
gain realized in the preceding 180 days provided the investment is for 
affordable housing through manufactured homes in opportunity zones. 
With this amendment any funds invested in affordable housing in 
opportunity zones should receive a stepped-up basis if the investment 
is held for ten years or longer. Legislatively, this could be achieved 
in a simple manner, by creating a short new subsection in the statute 
that would grant authority for this. We have attached a draft of our 
proposal.

    With this change, we are confident that UMH Properties and other 
manufactured home community operators could access significant new 
investment funds to help build and modernize communities in opportunity 
zones nationwide that facilitate the most affordable housing option 
available, manufactured homes.

    This approach is narrow and targeted. It would not facilitate 
investments that could be criticized as deviating from the objectives 
and intent of the Opportunity Zone program. It is limited to 
investments that facilitate affordable manufactured housing- a high 
priority for Congress and the Administration and an important public 
policy objective.

    Finally, it would not allow investors to access the deferment and 
potential permanent elimination for capital gains that have already 
taken place. Since the latter is the most costly component of 
Opportunity Zone tax treatment and since the proposed flexibility is 
narrowly targeted to a specific limited activity, we believe the tax 
scoring cost of this provision would be very small, while the societal 
and economic benefits would be substantial.

    I also understand that inflation is currently creating hardship for 
some resident homeowners in manufactured home communities due to rent 
increases and I'd like to address that issue based on my 47-year 
experience in the industry. The solution to the problem regarding newly 
built communities is to follow the Florida policy of requiring a 
prospectus from the community owner disclosing all potential fees and 
rent increases before a person purchases a home or moves it into a 
community. That prospectus coupled with a long-term lease that matches 
the term of the loan on the home results in fairness for the community 
owner and the resident. In the case of UMH new home buyers are offered 
a long-term lease, usually 20-25 years, that allows rent increases of 
CPI or 5%, whichever is more, plus pass through of increases in water, 
sewer, garbage and taxes. This results in reasonable rent increases 
that cause minimal to no friction between UMH and our residents. Except 
for the 2009-2011 period anyone who bought a home from UMH was able to 
sell it for more than they paid us for it, provided they properly 
maintained it.

    Regarding existing communities there are laws on the books in most 
states prohibiting unconscionable rent increases. Further there is a 
covenant of good faith and fair dealing in all contracts. There are 
43,000 existing communities and I am certain the problems you hear 
about pertaining to rent increases are coming from a very small 
percentage of those communities.

    In closing, I thank the Committee for the opportunity to submit 
this statement and I would be happy to make myself available to 
Committee staff to discuss this initiative in more detail.

                                Appendix

Draft Legislative Language to Opportunity Zone Statute

26 US Code 1400Z-2 is amended by adding the following new subsection 
(and renumbering the subsequent subsections):

``(d) Additional Flexibility for Investments in Manufactured Home 
Communities

Investments in manufactured housing communities that meet all other 
requirements of this section shall be eligible for the tax treatment in 
subsection (c), notwithstanding a failure to meet the requirements of 
subsection (a)(1)(A) of having a gain during the 180-day period prior 
to such investment.''

Currently housing cooperatives are effectively excluded for the federal 
government's only significant support for affordable housing, the Low-
Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. This is because in LIHTCs 
currently require a syndication, usually 99.9% owned by a for-profit 
entity with significant taxable income, to own the project for the 
first 15 years, in order to take advantage of the tax credits. This 
partnership means that a participating housing co-op would only have a 
chance of truly owning the property after 15 years and the obstacles to 
cooperative ownership a bridge too far to call homeownership for most 
residents.

Direct Pay Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) for sustainable energy 
projects were included in the IRA (Climate Bill) that Congress recently 
passed. The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) had 
made the inclusion of Direct Pay tax credits their top legislative 
priority. With Direct Pay the electric co-ops can file tax returns 
directly with the IRS for refunds of these energy tax credits without 
having to partner with for-profit entities, through such vehicles as 
power purchase agreements, in order to take advantage of the federal 
incentives. Here is a link to an article on the importance Direct Pay 
from NRECA. At the bottom of the article is a video, https://
www.electric.coop/house-passes-direct-pay-incentives-for-co-ops.

If Direct Pay for LIHTCs was available, housing co-ops would, similar 
to the electric co-ops, be able to file tax returns with the IRS and 
receive refunds of the tax credits. This would provide much needed 
equity into projects. Also, many states require that projects they 
finance qualify for and receive LIHTCs, effectively excluding most 
housing co-ops.

One difference with Direct Pay, both for electric co-ops and if passed 
for housing co-ops, is that projects that might rely on tax credits 
would not be able to gain any value from depreciation costs, which is a 
significant part of the value in the syndication of tax credits. 
Therefore, a benefit from a federal standpoint is that the cost of 
these project would actually be less since there would be no additional 
forfeited federal tax revenue on these projects. A second benefit of 
this change is that no new federal budget authority (either expenditure 
or forfeited tax revenues) would be required since it would not call 
for an expansion of the LIHTC program. The final benefit for the 
federal government is that it would allow LIHTCs to be used to support 
permanently affordable housing rather than the current system which 
requires not only co-ops but also non-profits and governments to grant 
project ownership to for-profit entities in order to participate in the 
LIHTC program.

In summary, Direct Pay LIHTC would be a similar ``game changer'' for 
housing co-ops as NRECA envisions Direct Pay will be for electric co-
ops. With the support of other co-ops, the non-profit development 
community and local governments, we could see a new era for housing co-
ops.

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

U.S. Mortgage Insurers (USMI) appreciates the opportunity to submit 
this letter for the record for the Committee on Finance's March 7th 
hearing titled ``Tax Policy's Role in Increasing Affordable Housing 
Supply for Working Families.'' We are very pleased that the committee 
held a hearing on this important topic and USMI believes that there are 
tax policies that can be improved in order to help families achieve the 
American Dream of homeownership. More specifically, we strongly support 
the tax deduction for qualified mortgage insurance (MI) premiums and 
USMI encourages Congress to reinstate and enhance the impact of this 
important middle class tax deduction.\1\ Our industry applauds Senator 
Hassan for her work, including bipartisan legislation last Congress, 
the Middle Class Mortgage Insurance Premium Act of 2022 (S. 3590), to 
make the deduction permanent and expand taxpayer eligibility.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ 26 U.S.C. 163(h)(3)(E). The tax deduction currently does not 
apply to amounts paid or accrued after December 31, 2021.

USMI is a trade association comprised of the leading private MI 
companies in the U.S. and represents an industry dedicated to a housing 
finance system backed by private capital that enables access to prudent 
and affordable mortgage finance for borrowers while protecting 
taxpayers.\2\ Our member companies are focused on ensuring that home-
ready borrowers have access to affordable and sustainable mortgages 
within a well-functioning U.S. housing finance system. The private MI 
industry has a 67-year track record of underwriting and actively 
managing single family mortgage credit risk in order to facilitate 
access to low down payment conventional mortgages. Since 1957, private 
MI has helped more than 38 million families purchase a home or 
refinance an existing mortgage, including more than 1 million families 
in 2022 alone.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ USMI membership comprises: Enact Mortgage Insurance; Essent 
Guaranty, Inc.; Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation; National 
Mortgage Insurance Corporation; and Radian Guaranty, Inc.
    \3\ GSE aggregate data.

Low down payment mortgages are critical for many families, most notably 
first-time, lower wealth, and minority homebuyers, to secure mortgage 
financing. Affordability remains a persistent barrier to homeownership 
across the country due to rising interest rates, high home prices, and 
constrained housing inventory, and MI helps bridge the down payment gap 
for borrowers who lack the resources for large down payments. In 2022 
alone, nearly 2.5 million families obtained mortgages with some form of 
MI, including more than 1 million conventional mortgages with private 
MI, more than 850,000 mortgages insured by the Federal Housing 
Administration (FHA), and nearly 600,000 mortgages guaranteed by the 
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\4\ Further, the vast majority 
of borrowers with MI are first-time homebuyers, traditionally the 
driving force of the housing market. For purchase mortgages originated 
in 2022, more than 60% of mortgages with private MI, 80% of FHA-insured 
mortgages, and 50% of VA-guaranteed loans went to first-time 
homebuyers.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ GSE aggregate data, VA Lender Loan Volume Reports, and FHA 
Single Family Monthly Production Reports.
    \5\ GSE aggregate data and eMBS data.

In order to make homeownership more affordable, USMI has long supported 
the tax provision allowing a deduction for MI premiums paid in 
connection with a mortgage on a qualified residence. Since 2007, the MI 
Deduction has been a powerful tool in prudently promoting homeownership 
for low- and moderate-income (LMI) families. The provision has been 
extended several times with broad bipartisan support, including most 
recently in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020.\6\ 
During the time period when MI premiums have been deductible, the 
deduction was claimed over 43 million times by qualified homeowners for 
an aggregate $61.6 billion in tax deductions.\7\ For 2020, the most 
recent tax year for which detailed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data 
is available, nearly 1.4 million households benefited from the MI 
deduction, for an average tax deduction of more than $2,100.\8\

    \8\ Id.

However, two key aspects of the MI deduction diminish its 
effectiveness: (1) its temporary nature; and (2) its relatively low 
Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) phaseout and cap. Bipartisan legislation 
last Congress from Senators Hassan and Blunt, the Middle Class Mortgage 
Insurance Premium Act of 2022 (S. 3590), would have addressed both 
those shortcomings and expanded taxpayer eligibility by raising the 
income level at which the phaseout begins, specifically increasing the 
income phaseout trigger to $200,000 for joint filers and $100,000 for 
single filers. This would be the first AGI adjustment for the MI 
deduction since it took effect in 2007 and be a welcome statutory 
change to take into account the natural erosion of the reach of this 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
deduction with the passage of time.

The MI deduction is a sound and targeted tax policy that provides 
meaningful benefits to hardworking families across the country and 
should be a permanent part of the U.S. tax code. Homeownership remains 
the primary vehicle for families to enter the middle class and build 
long-term generational wealth, and the MI deduction is an important 
tool for policymakers to support homeownership opportunities for more 
Americans. In fact, data from the Federal Reserve indicates that the 
median net worth of a homeowner is more than 40 times that of a 
renter.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ Federal Reserve, 2019 Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF). The 
median net worth of a homeowner was $254,900 in 2019 dollars compared 
to $6,270 for a renter.

Senator Hassan's bill from last Congress is included as Annex A and on 
March 7, 2023 Representatives Buchanan and Panetta reintroduced 
bipartisan legislation, H.R. 1384, in the House of Representatives. In 
addition, a November 2022 letter from 14 housing organizations to the 
Committee on Finance in support of Senator Hassan's bill is attached as 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

USMI thanks you for devoting needed attention to the extremely 
important issue of housing, especially around tax policies that promote 
affordable and sustainable homeownership, and stands available as a 
resource to the committee. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss the 
MI deduction, a tax policy that has long enjoyed bipartisan support, 
and requests for additional information may be directed to Brendan

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

The undersigned organizations, representing a diverse coalition of 
stakeholders in the housing finance system of lenders, real estate 
professionals, homebuilders, mortgage insurers, and affordable housing 
advocates, are writing regarding the tax treatment of mortgage 
insurance premiums. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our 
collective perspective on this important tax provision and encourage 
congressional action to support existing homeowners and prospective 
homebuyers by modifying current law to make the mortgage insurance 
premium tax deduction permanent and increase its income phaseout. The 
tax deduction for mortgage insurance premiums has long enjoyed 
bipartisan support and, as Congress considers any year-end tax package, 
our organizations firmly believe this deduction is both good tax policy 
and housing policy.

Affordability remains a persistent barrier to homeownership across the 
country due to rising interest rates, strong home price appreciation, 
and limited housing supply.\10\ Since this time last year, the average 
interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has more than doubled 
and currently stands at nearly 7%,\11\ the most recent CoreLogic Home 
Price Index shows nationwide prices rose 11.4% from September 2021 to 
September 2022,\12\ and, while housing inventory has improved from a 
historical low point, the current 3.2 months of supply \13\ is still 
well below pre-pandemic and long-term historical levels. Despite these 
challenges, each year mortgage insurance helps bridge the down payment 
gap for millions of borrowers who lack the resources for a 20% down 
payment or have less than perfect credit. Low down payment mortgages--
including conventional mortgages with private mortgage insurance and 
loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and U.S. Department of 
Agriculture Rural Housing Service (RHS)--have proven critical for many 
first-time, low- and moderate-income (LMI), and minority homebuyers to 
secure financing and attain the American Dream of homeownership. Using 
low down payment mortgages allows families to buy homes sooner than 
they otherwise would be able and to reap the benefits of homeownership, 
including financial stability and building intergenerational wealth.

conventional loans with private mortgage insurance, nearly 1.4 million 
FHA-insured mortgages, and nearly 1.3 million VA-guaranteed 
mortgages.\14\ Further, the vast majority of borrowers with mortgage 
insurance are first-time homebuyers, traditionally the driving force of 
the housing market.\15\ Low down payment lending options are critical 
for these first-time homebuyers, as evidenced by the fact that in 
recent years approximately 80% of first-time homebuyers relied on low 
down payment options to purchase homes.\16\

Since 2007, the tax code has treated mortgage insurance premiums as 
qualified residential mortgage interest and they have been tax 
deductible, subject to an income phaseout for taxpayers with adjusted 
gross incomes (AGI) over $100,000 ($50,000 if single or married filing 
separately).\17\ During the time period that mortgage insurance 
premiums have been tax deductible, millions of LMI homeowners have 
benefited from this provision of the tax code. Based on the most recent 
estimate from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), more than 1.3 million 
households benefited from the mortgage insurance deduction for tax year 
2020 for an average deduction of more than $2,100.\18\ As you know, the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) \19\ modified numerous aspects of 
the tax code and doubled the standard deduction. Prior to the enactment 
of the TCJA, more than 4 million taxpayers claimed the deduction each 
year and the number of households eligible to benefit from the 
deduction are sure to increase upon the expiration of the TCJA 
individual tax policies at the end of 2025.

amount of $2,834,901,000.
    \19\ Pub. L. 115-97 (December 22, 2017).

Our organizations have long supported the mortgage insurance premium 
tax deduction as a means to support homeownership for LMI households, 
but two key aspects of the current tax code hamper its effectiveness: 
(1) its temporary nature; and (2) its relatively low AGI phaseout and 
status as the only itemized deduction subject to an AGI cap and/or 
phaseout. The current AGI phaseout represents a burdensome eligibility 
criterion for American families to claim the mortgage insurance 
deduction and many more hardworking families would benefit from a 
permanent extension that increases the AGI phaseout. The AGI cap has 
remained the same since the deduction took effect in 2007 and an 
increase is warranted to account for the natural erosion of the value 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
of the dollar with the passage of time.

Senators Maggie Hassan and Roy Blunt have introduced S. 3590, the 
Middle Class Mortgage Insurance Premium Act of 2022, and we encourage 
the Committee on Finance to consider this bipartisan legislation for 
inclusion in any final 2022 tax package. Thank you for your 
consideration of our recommendation that the tax deduction for mortgage 
insurance premiums be made permanent and that the AGI phaseout be 
increased. We welcome the opportunity to further engage on this 
important issue to support access to affordable and sustainable 
homeownership for American families.

Dear Chairman Wyden and Ranking Member Crapo:

In light of the Committee's March 7, 2023 hearing, Tax Policy's Role in 
Increasing Affordable Housing Supply for Working Families, attached 
please find Western Governors' Association Policy Resolution 2023-04, 
Housing Is Foundational to the Success of the West.

This policy resolution addresses the challenges of increasing the 
availability and affordability of housing in the West. It highlights 
the need to pass legislation lowering the threshold of Private Activity 
Bond financing from 50 percent to 25 percent, ensure that the Low 
Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program works more effectively for 
underserved communities, and review and adjust the formulas for the 
LIHTC Program.

I request that you include this document in the permanent record of the 
hearing, as it articulates Western Governors' policy positions and 
recommendations related to this urgent issue.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and your consideration of 
this request. Please contact me if you have any questions or require 
further information.

Sincerely,

Jack Waldorf
Executive Director

                     Western Governors Association

                       Policy Resolution 2023-04

           Housing Is Foundational to the Success of the West

A. BACKGROUND

1.  The West has undergone extraordinary growth in recent years. 
        According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the region has experienced 
        population growth of 9.2 percent from 2010 to 2020, the second 
        highest rate nationally, with more than 78 million new 
        residents. The three fastest growing states by percentage--
        Utah, Idaho, and Colorado--are all western states. In addition, 
        towns with less than 5,000 people in the Rocky Mountain and 
        coastal areas of the West have experienced the highest 
        nationwide population growth rates at 13.3 percent.

2.  The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated and spurred several noteworthy 
        trends. Over the past 10 years, moves to large and expensive 
        cities have plateaued in favor of smaller cities and suburbs. 
        The U.S. Census reports that while overall moving rates 
        continued to decline, starting in 2021, the West began to see a 
        dramatic increase in net migration to the region. During the 
        public health crisis, people fled big cities at increased rates 
        for less dense areas that offered warmer weather, more outdoor 
        recreation activities, and greater opportunities to safely 
        social distance as telework became the new normal and employees 
        were no longer tethered to a physical office. The Pew Research 
        Center estimated that 1 in 5 adults, especially young 
        professionals, relocated during the pandemic or know someone 
        who did.

3.  This growth in the West has led to housing shortages in communities 
        large and small. Shortages have been exacerbated by Great 
        Recession development delays and stops and a lack of workforce, 
        which have resulted in a housing slump and left communities 
        across the West struggling to keep up with demand and a near-
        record rise in the number of American homeowners. As the market 
        began to recover, the spread of COVID-19 hit builders with 
        similar issues, including supply chain delays and a workforce 
        deficit.

4.  According to the Federal Reserve, while home sales have boomed, the 
        number of active housing listings in January 2022 dropped to 
        its lowest in at least five years--60 percent below the number 
        on the market just two years previously--causing home sale 
        prices to skyrocket. Nationally, prices have increased by 
        nearly 20 percent, with the West seeing some of the greatest 
        increases.

5.  The West's natural beauty brings people from across the nation and 
        globe. While western states welcome the growth in remote 
        workers and visitors to tourism and outdoor recreation-based 
        economies such as resort towns and gateway communities, 
        unmanaged growth has caused ``big city'' issues for some areas. 
        Additionally, many residences have been converted into 
        temporary rental units through services like Airbnb and VRBO. 
        The unchecked proliferation of these rentals can heighten 
        housing shortages, drive costs higher, and diminish the 
        availability of places for residents and workers to call home. 
        Long-time community residents and workers are often forced to 
        move out of the communities they grew up in and are culturally 
        connected to, exacerbating disparities and making it difficult 
        for social services, businesses and government to retain and 
        attract employees from within the community. Rapid population 
        influxes also strain existing infrastructure and resources in 
        areas that already have limited planning capacities.

6.  Rural communities face unique challenges when addressing housing 
        issues. Construction costs in rural areas are often higher than 
        in urban areas and are further compounded by a lack of critical 
        infrastructure. There are limited numbers of investors and 
        contractors who are willing to mobilize or invest in small 
        communities, making the cost of new or improved housing too 
        high for middle-
        income residents. Rural areas can also lack access to lenders 
        and credit, which reduces funding for the production of new 
        units and the maintenance of existing housing stock. As a 
        result, a disproportionate amount of the nation's occupied 
        substandard housing is in rural communities. According to the 
        U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), approximately half a 
        million of its multifamily housing properties will need a total 
        of $5.6 billion in investments to maintain suitable living 
        conditions for residents.

7.  Despite a recognized need for more housing and housing of different 
        types, existing homeowners often oppose increasing the housing 
        supply in their communities, especially the construction of 
        denser housing. This opposition, and the signal it sends to 
        city leaders, zoning boards, and planning commissions, 
        represents a significant impediment to addressing the housing 
        shortage and can lead to restrictive local land use 
        regulations. Some western communities are addressing these 
        challenges in part through the development of communities that 
        combine housing of different types and sizes with commercial 
        properties in ways that promote affordability, walkability, 
        diversity of homeowner type, and a higher quality of life.

8.  In downtown submarkets and dense neighborhoods, apartment 
        absorption rates show that landlords are quickly leasing vacant 
        apartment units, driving strong rent costs. From October 2020 
        to October 2021, rental costs increased 15.9 percent, with the 
        median cost of advertised rentals rising to above $2,000 for 
        the first time. Rental occupancy, new lease signings, and lease 
        renewal rates show strong growth, indicating an increase in 
        rental demand across the market. The West plays a strong role 
        in this growth, with half of the top twenty predicted strongest 
        markets in 2022.

9.  All available data suggests that homelessness, including among 
        families with children, has risen during the current housing 
        crisis, likely attributed to surging rents, which compound 
        personal and societal causes of homelessness. Homelessness and 
        housing instability make it harder to find and keep a job, 
        treat or manage medical conditions, and learn in school. It 
        destabilizes communities and lowers outcomes across public 
        systems. No one institution can end this issue on its own.

10. Housing is foundational to economic development and community 
        vitality. In the long run, it is more cost effective for public 
        systems to house those in need with wrap around service. Models 
        like permanent supportive housing or transitional housing with 
        supportive services keep residents off the streets and provide 
        upstream interventions that lessen costs for justice and health 
        systems. The need for a greater diversity of housing options 
        goes beyond the obligation to treat people with dignity, as it 
        is also cost effective for governments.

11. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) and the Housing 
        Trust Fund are federal housing programs administered by the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HOME is the 
        largest federal block grant to state and local governments for 
        affordable housing. It provides formula grants for building, 
        buying, and rehabilitating affordable housing or direct rental 
        assistance to low-income households. The Housing Trust Fund 
        provides grants to states to develop and preserve affordable 
        housing for extremely low-income households. Although both 
        programs are administered by the same agency, they have 
        separate environmental review requirements. Some projects 
        utilize both programs, resulting in a taxing process that can 
        yield conflicting results.

12. Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 
        U.S.C. 1701u) requires recipients of HUD funding to direct 
        employment, training, and contracting opportunities to low-
        income individuals and the businesses that employ these 
        persons. Davis-Bacon and related acts require federal 
        government construction contractors on covered public buildings 
        and public works to pay the ``prevailing wage'' to laborers. 
        Applying Section 3 or Davis-Bacon to multifamily projects 
        significantly increases the administrative burden of projects. 
        In tight construction markets in the West, affordable 
        multifamily projects often struggle to find contractors willing 
        to accept the regulatory burden. These projects receive far 
        fewer bids than non-federal projects and frequently face higher 
        construction costs. An Oregon affordable housing cost driver 
        study found that prevailing wage determinations, some related 
        to Davis-Bacon, increased costs by 9 percent when controlling 
        for other factors.

13. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages on 
        single family homes, multifamily properties, residential care 
        facilities, and hospitals and is critical to sustaining and 
        financing affordable housing across the nation. However, it has 
        become increasingly arduous to work with FHA and its third-
        party contractor. A significant amount of time and effort is 
        expended on delinquency reporting, filing claims, and the 
        foreclosures process due to a lack of guidance, staffing 
        shortages, and antiquated technology. Applicants must navigate 
        multiple systems for delinquency reporting and filing claims 
        and interpret handbooks if they have questions, as FHA no 
        longer has state staff to consult and is frequently 
        unresponsive to requests for guidance.

14. FHA determines lending limits annually based on median house 
        prices, a percentage of the national conforming limit, and the 
        county in which the property is located. In rural areas and 
        non-disclosure states, there may not be current sales data or 
        information may not be public, which generally means loan 
        limits are not raised in spite of the fact that prices have 
        increased.

15. Private Activity Bonds (PAB) are used to develop affordable housing 
        and provide mortgages to low- and moderate-income home buyers, 
        allocated from the federal government with Congressionally set 
        caps. Many states in the West have hit their PAB cap, meaning 
        their ability to advance housing solutions and leverage state 
        and local funds is limited. Additionally, the PAB cap restricts 
        the use of the 4 percent Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) 
        because 50 percent of these developments must be funded with 
        PAB. States that invest state and local resources in housing 
        development are unable to fully leverage federal funds, 
        creating the perverse disincentive of limiting how much state 
        and local partners invest in housing.

16. The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, administered 
        by HUD, provides flexible resources to states and localities to 
        fund housing and economic development opportunities for low- 
        and moderate-income communities. For single-family residential 
        projects, HUD requires states and localities to identify all 
        properties for funding upfront and to work on them as a single 
        project, but this is an obstacle for small, rural communities. 
        These communities struggle with getting contractors and finding 
        the workforce to do everything at once. The burden of 
        administration is also extremely high and there is a tremendous 
        amount of risk involved with the cost of compliance for CDBG. 
        Audits may occur years after funding has been disbursed and 
        projects have begun, and states and localities must bear the 
        costs if projects are not compliant.

17. Federal formulas for funding do not always function effectively for 
        states. While costs for projects have grown significantly and 
        federal funds are often crucially important to offsetting these 
        extreme per unit costs for affordable units, minimum 
        allocations have stayed relatively constant. In addition, some 
        programs utilize formulas that have been designed for other 
        programs. For example, the traditional Emergency Solutions 
        Grants (ESG) Program uses the CDBG formula despite the vast 
        differences between their program goals. Although the 
        traditional ESG formula is effective at making allocations 
        quickly, it does not adequately serve places with homelessness 
        needs because it is designed to address more general community 
        development needs. The ESG formula used for the second wave of 
        Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act 
        funding was more aligned with program goals and led to more 
        targeted investments to drive improved outcomes.

18. Rural states often receive the minimum allocation of federal grant 
        funds. Consequently, they receive a much smaller administrative 
        allocation even though every project must follow the same steps 
        and requires the same administrative responsibilities as more 
        populous states. Insufficient administrative funding makes it 
        difficult for these states to leverage federal housing 
        programs.

19. Across the West, wildfires and other natural disasters are 
        devastating communities and creating real and persistent 
        impacts on the lives of Americans. Federal Emergency Management 
        Agency (FEMA) resources do a poor job of supporting those in 
        need, particularly renters and communities with little trust in 
        government. The federal process requires extensive 
        documentation--which is often lost, especially in fires--and 
        multiple rounds of applications and appeals. CDBG-Disaster 
        Recovery (CDBG-DR) funds require Congressional allocation, 
        which delays implementation of recovery activities. In 
        addition, the program is not well suited to support the 
        immediate needs of wildfire recovery. Homes are a total loss in 
        wildfires, unlike floods or hurricanes, and infrastructure 
        needs are beyond what CDBG-DR can support.

20. Manufactured and modular homes could help address the housing 
        shortage in the West. These prefabricated structures are 
        partially or fully constructed in off-site factories, which 
        makes them affordable housing options because they are 
        significantly less expensive and faster to build. Manufactured 
        homes are built to HUD standards and are moveable, while 
        modular homes are held to local, state, and regional building 
        codes for on-site homes. While there is a huge opportunity for 
        growth in this industry, regulatory barriers threaten to dampen 
        or halt their expansion. A recent Department of Labor (DOL) 
        proposal to expand the ``site of work'' definition for Davis-
        Bacon could drive up costs for manufactured and modular 
        housing, making it harder for Americans to access affordable 
        housing.

21. Affordable and quality housing is essential for an effective 
        military and the recruitment and retention of military 
        personnel and civilians. On military bases, the government 
        provides single and unaccompanied military installation housing 
        rent-free. There are also houses on bases, which are commonly 
        privately-owned. The federal government provides military 
        personnel with a Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) to offset 
        the costs of renting these houses or renting or buying off-base 
        housing. Civilians do not receive a BAH, but they are allowed 
        to utilize base housing if it is available. BAH rates are set 
        by surveying the cost of rental properties in each geographic 
        location. However, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
        has noted that these rates do not always accurately reflect the 
        cost of suitable housing for service members. Furthermore, GAO 
        has reported that remote military bases typically lack critical 
        services and amenities, prompting personnel and civilians to 
        search for housing in communities that are farther away or to 
        commute long distances to access them.

B. GOVERNORS' POLICY STATEMENT

1.  Western Governors urge Congress to pass legislation lowering the 
        threshold of PAB financing from 50 percent to 25 percent to 
        infuse equity into local economies, which would result in an 
        immediate increase in affordable housing opportunities and 
        hundreds of thousands of additional homes being built or 
        preserved.

2.  Inflation, increased material costs, and labor shortages are 
        already constraining affordable housing development. Western 
        Governors urge the federal government to reduce the 
        administrative burden associated with federal housing programs 
        to better facilitate and expedite affordable housing 
        development, using the U.S. Department of the Treasury's (USDT) 
        administration of the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program 
        as a model. Reducing administrative burdens would enable 
        affordable housing to compete on a more even field. 
        Specifically, Western Governors support subsidy layering review 
        and efforts to streamline the National Environmental Policy Act 
        or use other environmental reviews in its place and urge HUD to 
        streamline environmental review requirements for the HOME and 
        Housing Trust Fund Programs so that projects utilizing both 
        programs only have to complete one review. The Governors also 
        encourage DOL to consider providing Davis-Bacon waivers for 
        multifamily projects in small and rural communities, which 
        often have a limited pool of contractors.

3.  Western Governors request that HUD change provisions of 24 CFR 
        92.241(b) requiring property rehabilitation to adhere to strict 
        minimum property standards for the HOME Program. Flexibility 
        and discretion for rehabilitation funding would allow states to 
        make critical improvements to the housing stock without 
        projects dying due to the identification of other, less 
        critical problems during HOME assessments.

4.  Western Governors urge Congress to appropriate funding to FHA to 
        upgrade their technology and processing systems. We recommend 
        that FHA streamline its cumbersome claim filing process by 
        creating one efficient, centralized, and modern claim system. 
        In addition, FHA should provide ongoing and up-to-date guidance 
        to state and local housing authorities or authorize and train 
        its third-party contractor to provide guidance to state and 
        local housing authorities to avoid costly consequences that 
        hinder housing improvements in states. Western Governors also 
        encourage FHA to consider having designated state staff again 
        to improve communication and coordination between states and 
        the federal government.

5.  Western Governors request that the federal government support state 
        housing finance and public housing agencies and explore ways to 
        improve the services and resources provided to them.

6.  Western Governors encourage HUD to review and allow for alternative 
        processes in non-disclosure states to address the increasing 
        price of housing and adjust loan limits accordingly.

7.  The federal government should enable the LIHTC Program to work more 
        effectively for underserved communities, including rural, 
        tribal, high-poverty, and high-cost communities, as well as 
        extremely low-income and formerly homeless tenants. Western 
        Governors encourage the USDT and HUD to ensure that they better 
        preserve the nation's existing affordable housing inventory by 
        simplifying and aligning program rules. In addition, we 
        recommend that the federal government reauthorize the expansion 
        of 9 percent low-income housing tax credits that expired at the 
        end of the 2021 and move forward by increasing Housing Credit 
        allocations by 50 percent to help meet the need for affordable 
        housing.

8.  The federal government should review and adjust the formulas that 
        determine minimum allocations granted to states for housing 
        programs, including the Housing Trust Fund, the LIHTC Program, 
        and the HOME Program, to account for the high administrative 
        and regulatory costs associated with these programs. Increased 
        allocations would allow the states to produce more impactful 
        projects in our states. In addition, federal formulas should 
        include data elements that directly relate to program goals, 
        especially for the ESG Program, to ensure federal funding 
        serves those who need it most.

9.  Western Governors call for HUD to add a flat administrative fee for 
        minimum allocation states in addition to the percentage amount 
        for administration that is granted to them. Although projects 
        in these states tend to be smaller, the administrative costs 
        are the same as they are for larger projects and the 
        administrative funds determined by the percentage formula is 
        insufficient to cover these costs.

10. Western Governors request flexibility from HUD when utilizing CDBG 
        funds for housing, which will ensure necessary adaptability in 
        challenging rural markets. We encourage HUD to implement a 
        similar approach to USDA and allow grantees to identify 
        properties over the course of a project, instead of identifying 
        all properties before a project begins. Focusing on one or a 
        few properties at a time will open opportunities to grow and 
        improve the housing stock, especially in rural areas. We also 
        request ongoing guidance and communication from HUD to ensure 
        that states are in compliance and are not surprised by updated 
        guidance and penalized when projects are already underway or 
        finished.

11. Western Governors recommend that the federal government make FEMA 
        programs and CDBG-DR funds better tools for disaster relief. 
        FEMA resources should require less documentation requirements 
        after wildfires, given that many records are destroyed with 
        little time for households to evacuate a fire zone. For CDBG-
        DR, HUD allocations should consider infrastructure needs and 
        include additional resources to support rebuilding costs in the 
        West.

12. Western Governors urge Congress to pass legislation facilitating 
        the purchase of federal land by state or local governments at a 
        reduced price for the purpose of increasing the supply of 
        residential housing. We also request that the federal 
        government honor existing commitments to transfer land to state 
        or local governments in a reasonable amount of time.

13. Western Governors support manufactured and modular housing and 
        recognize the important role they play in providing affordable 
        housing for communities, particularly in rural areas. We 
        encourage DOL not to expand the ``site of work'' definition to 
        factory-built housing for Davis-Bacon wages, as it would 
        significantly impact the affordability of these housing 
        options.

14. Western Governors urge Congress and the Department of Defense to 
        consider how housing costs affect recruiting, retention, and 
        quality of life for military personnel and civilians, and 
        solutions to the challenge. This should include adjusting the 
        formula and process for determining the cost of housing on and 
        near military installations; the process and frequency of 
        adjusting locality pay, housing allowance, and remote site pay; 
        the formula for deciding which services and amenities should be 
        offered to personnel living on remote military installations; 
        and other adjustments that could improve the affordability of 
        housing and quality of life for both civilian and uniformed 
        personnel.

C. GOVERNORS' MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVE
