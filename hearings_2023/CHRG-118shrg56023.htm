              CONFIRMATION HEARING ON FEDERAL APPOINTMENTS

                              ----------                              


                      WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2023

                              United States Senate,
                                Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in 
Room 226, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. 
Durbin, Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Durbin [presiding], Hirono, Padilla, 
Graham, Grassley, Lee, Kennedy, and Tillis.
    Also present: Senator Lankford and Delegate Sablan.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Chair Durbin. This hearing of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee will come to order.
    Today, we'll hear from three judicial nominees: Sara Hill, 
nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District 
of Oklahoma; John Russell, also nominated to the U.S. District 
Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma; and Judge Ramona 
Manglona, nominated to serve a second 10-year term on the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. 
Congratulations to the nominees, and their families.
    Before I turn to Ranking Member Graham, I want to note that 
Ms. Hill and Mr. Russell each have received blue slips from 
both Republican home State Senators, Senators Lankford, who is 
with us today, and Senator Mullin. I thank the Senators for 
working with the White House in good faith to fill these 
vacancies, and thank all the other Members on the Republican 
side who are doing the same. We are seeing similar progress in 
many States, and it is encouraging.
    Now, I'll turn to Senator Graham for opening remarks.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM,
        A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to compliment my colleagues from Oklahoma, also, 
and, you know, trying to make the process work the best we can.
    The bottom line, we're about to leave and the Supplemental 
will not be passed. I think the Government will be funded, but 
with wars raging in Israel, and they rage in Ukraine, and we 
have a broken border. So I'm hoping that we can find a way 
forward when we get back to help our allies who are in 
distress, but also to help ourselves.
    And the key to all this, Mr. Chairman, is getting a border 
solution that would deter people from coming. At the end of the 
day, if people feel like they can come here, get released, and 
never get deported, they'll keep coming.
    So I've got a simple goal: Turn the system around to deter 
people so we make some order out of chaos, and I think that's 
the key to this package. And Senator Lankford's been working on 
it, and I appreciate all he has done. So, thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Graham, you and I have been working 
on this issue for at least 10 years, maybe longer.
    Senator Graham. Longer.
    Chair Durbin. It's been 30 years since Congress has done 
anything substantive in this area. I think we all agree on both 
sides of the aisle that something needs to be done to bring 
order to our border situation. I hope that we can achieve that, 
and I think that there's a spirit of good will, which I've 
discussed with Senator Lankford yesterday, that can lead to 
that.
    But I also hope we understand, as well, that trying to do 
it all before we provide critical aid to Israel, and to 
Ukraine, and humanitarian aid, may be an agenda that is not--is 
overly ambitious. We'll see. Let's keep a positive attitude 
toward it and hope that we can get this done in a thoughtful 
fashion.
    First, let me introduce Senator Lankford, from Oklahoma.

               STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES LANKFORD,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA

    Senator Lankford. Mr. Chairman, thank you, Ranking Member 
Graham, thank you so much for your time, and for the 
opportunity to be able to introduce Sara Hill and John Russell 
today to the Judiciary Committee. These are some outstanding 
Oklahomans that I think you'll enjoy some spirited conversation 
with to go through, and will have no doubt that they'll be able 
to answer your questions fully and completely.
    I also appreciate the Committee's sufficient processing of 
these two nominees. At the moment, the Northern District of 
Oklahoma has one full-time judge, and then we have a second 
judge that is split between our three districts.
    To give you a context on this, they have about 500 cases in 
their backlog right now in the Northern District of Oklahoma, 
based in the wake of the McGirt decision from several years 
ago, and the overwhelming number of cases that are then coming 
that direction.
    The Northern District now no longer does civil cases at 
all. At all. So the civil case backlog has backed up for years 
because there's not enough judges to actually fulfill the civil 
cases. So they're doing the criminal cases right now and trying 
to be able to do everything they can to catch up. So the need 
there for the additional judges is incredibly significant for 
them.
    Between 2020 and 2021, there was a 66 percent increase in 
criminal cases filed in the Northern District. Between 2021 and 
2022, there was an additional 28 percent increase. Due to this 
massive increase in criminal cases and the need to ensure 
constitutional rights to a speedy trial, the civil cases have 
not been heard, as I mentioned before.
    So, we need to be able to get additional judges, so we've 
gone through this process. Every person who becomes a Federal 
judge swears an oath that states, in part, that they will 
``administer justice without respect to persons, and . . . will 
faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties 
incumbent upon'' them ``as a judge under the Constitution and 
laws of the United States.''
    In reviewing potential nominees, it's important to me that 
I believe every person who will be a judge in my State will 
follow that oath, and I have no doubt these two nominees will 
consider that process. We have a very rigorous process of 
interview in my State as we work through this, and as the 
Chairman mentioned, this has to be an agreement between both 
Senators in Oklahoma and the White House.
    And as I would tell you that both Senators from Oklahoma 
and the White House don't agree on a lot of things, but we do 
have to find common ground to be able to work on things 
together. And we have gone through a rigorous process over the 
course of the last year to be able to come with two incredibly 
well-qualified candidates.
    John Russell lives in Tulsa. He received his bachelor's 
degree from Oklahoma State University, graduated from the 
University of Oklahoma College of Law in 1988 with distinction.
    John is a husband, a father to three daughters, and has two 
granddaughters. Here to support him today is his wife, Karen, 
his daughters, Emily and Allison, and his sister, Hope, which I 
hope he'll spend some time actually introducing them more 
completely.
    John has significant experience in both public and private. 
He began his career as a trial attorney in the Tax Division of 
the Department of Justice. He's prosecuted and defended civil 
tax cases on behalf of the United States, and was named an 
outstanding attorney. He served as an assistant United States 
attorney for 7 years before moving to private practice, and he 
currently practices at GableGotwals in Tulsa.
    One thing that stood out to me about John is also his 
dedication to serving the community, his volunteer in his pro 
bono time. He's been named one of Oklahoma's Super Lawyers from 
2016 to 2022. He's been listed in Oklahoma's Top 50 lawyers in 
2013, 2015, 2021, and 2022. I have no doubt, based on the 
respect that he has in our State, that he'll also be a highly 
competent and an excellent judge, and I recommend his 
nomination.
    Sara Hill is the second nominee we have. She's from 
Tahlequah, Oklahoma, as the former attorney general for the 
Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. If confirmed, she'll be the first 
Native American woman to serve on the Federal bench from 
Oklahoma.
    Sara's joined today by her husband, Jerry; her sister, 
Jennifer; the deputy principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, 
Bryan Warner; and the Cherokee Nation attorney general, Chad 
Harsha.
    Sara's an exceptionally impressive nominee whose career in 
private practice and in public practice has focused on serving 
others. Before she became attorney general for the Cherokee 
Nation, Sara served as a special assistant United States 
attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma.
    Over the many years that my staff have worked with Sara, we 
have found her to be one of the smartest people in the room in 
just about any room she walks in.
    She is highly respected in Tulsa for her legal knowledge 
and insight, and her ability to be able to not only discuss the 
law, but to be able to walk through complexities in the law.
    When she speaks, even those who have a different legal 
opinion often listen and respect the argument that she makes. 
Her goal as an attorney has always been to bring level-headed 
perspective to the goal of building consensus, traits that will 
make an excellent judge.
    I have no doubt that as a Federal judge, Sara will be 
guided by the United States Constitution, a document that she 
knows and respects. I am confident she will serve our State and 
our country extremely well, and I encourage her swift 
confirmation.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Lankford, thank you for joining us 
today. I know you have a busy schedule, and we'll excuse you 
when you're ready to leave.
    Senator Lankford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. I'll next recognize Congressman Gregorio 
Sablan--I hope I pronounced your name correctly?
    Delegate Sablan. Yes, you did. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Please proceed.

  STATEMENT OF HON. GREGORIO SABLAN, A U.S. DELEGATE FROM THE 
                    NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS

    Delegate Sablan. Yes. Thank you very much, Chairman Durbin, 
and Ranking Member Graham, and Members of the Judiciary 
Committee. Good morning.
    Thank you for this opportunity to support the nomination of 
Ramona Villagomez Manglona to a second 10-year term as chief 
judge for the United States District Court for the Northern 
Mariana Islands.
    As the sole elected representative of the Marianas in the 
United States Congress, I supported the nomination and 
confirmation of Judge Manglona when the seat opened on the 
Federal bench in 2009. Previously, the position had been held 
by men not from the Marianas.
    I believe with the growing political maturity of our 
islands, manifested that year by my own election as the first 
representative of the Marianas in Congress, the time has come 
to fill the Federal district court seat with a qualified 
individual from our islands.
    President Obama and the United States Senate concurred.
    Now, President Biden has confirmed the validity of that 
decision by nominating Judge Manglona to serve a second 10-year 
term.
    Judge Manglona has proven to be an impartial and thoughtful 
jurist, and has become a respected member of the Federal 
judiciary. During her tenure, she has participated in hundreds 
of cases and always exhibited a deep respect for the United 
States Constitution and the rule of law.
    As a trailblazing first woman and first person of Chamorro 
descent to sit on the Federal bench in the Marianas, Judge 
Manglona has demonstrated that neither attribute is an 
impediment to excellence, nor to the faithful execution of her 
duty to maintain the integrity of the law.
    You have before you Judge Manglona's record of decision-
making. So let me speak to how she has used her position to 
contribute to the Marianas community.
    She has hosted multiple outreach programs for emerging 
leaders: the High School Mock Trial program, the local 
Judiciary's Law and the Freshman Legislature Conference, the 
Girl Scouts Justice Patch program, and the Pacific Century 
Fellows. And just last week, Judge Manglona has become a 
grandmother. So, happy times for her.
    Judge Manglona's commitment to her community is 
particularly commendable in view of the two modes of the two 
super typhoons just 3 years apart and the global pandemic. 
While maintaining court operations under these difficult 
circumstances, she also managed to coordinate the transition to 
a new Federal courthouse, and she found the bandwidth to 
establish the district's first evidence-based drug court 
program.
    No wonder Judge Manglona, along with her superb team, 
received a 2019 Director's Award for Extraordinary Actions from 
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. No 
wonder USA Today recognized Judge Manglona as a ``Woman of the 
Century'' from the United States Territories. No wonder the 
American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal 
Judiciary reached the unanimous finding that Chief Judge 
Manglona is ``well qualified'' to serve on the United States 
District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands.
    And I may say, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member, and 
Senators, it is with this I speak for many others in our 
community when I say it is a sense of pride when we see a 
woman, or a person, one of us, sitting there as the U.S. 
district court judge for the Northern Marianas.
    So, Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee, I 
respectfully ask you to agree Ramona Villagomez Manglona should 
continue to serve as the chief judge, and send your 
recommendation to the full Senate for confirmation. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Congressman. We appreciate your 
being here today.
    Delegate Sablan. Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. Now we're going to ask the nominees to 
approach the table and stand by their chairs for a moment while 
we administer the oath.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Let the record reflect that all three nominees have 
answered in the affirmative. And Ms. Hill, you'll be the first 
to proceed with 5 minutes, and each will have that opportunity. 
Ms. Hill.

 STATEMENT OF SARA E. HILL, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED STATES 
      DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA

    Ms. Hill. Chair Durbin----
    Chair Durbin. You have to press the button on the console. 
There.
    Ms. Hill. Thank you for that tip.
    Chair Durbin. Now you're in business.
    Ms. Hill. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, and Ranking Member 
Graham. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the 
Committee today. I'm also honored and humbled by the support of 
my State Senators, Senator Lankford, and my fellow Cherokee, 
Senator Markwayne Mullin. And I appreciate Senator Lankford's 
introduction here today. I want to express my appreciation to 
President Biden for the honor of a nomination to serve as a 
district judge in the Northern District of Oklahoma.
    I would like to briefly introduce my parents who are 
watching me today from Tahlequah, Oklahoma. My father, Roy 
Hill, is a combat veteran who served with the 101st Airborne 
Division, and retired after a long career in public service 
working for the State of Oklahoma. My mother, a first 
generation college graduate, also retired from a career in 
public service. I am so very proud to be their daughter. I must 
also express gratitude for my son, Landon, a college sophomore 
at Northeastern State University, who is today in Tahlequah, 
keeping an eye on his grandparents who are hopefully also 
keeping an eye on him.
    I would like to introduce some dear friends and family who 
have come with me in person today, including my sister, 
Jennifer Daniels; the deputy principal chief of the Cherokee 
Nation, Bryan Warner; attorney general of the Cherokee Nation, 
Chad Harsha. There are many other family, friends, and 
colleagues, both online and here today, who are supporting me, 
and I am grateful for all of them.
    Last but certainly not least, I want to introduce my 
husband, Jerry Starkey, who stands with me today as he has 
stood with me for over 25 years. All of his family have made 
themselves my family, and I'm also incredibly grateful for my 
in-laws, Carol, Butch Daniels, Steven, and Tina.
    In closing, I'd like to also take a moment to honor the 
continuing career of Judge Claire Eagan, who assumed senior 
status in the Northern District of Oklahoma in 2022. She was 
the first woman to become a district judge in that district, 
and it is an honor to be nominated to succeed her. I want to 
thank her for illuminating a path into the Federal judiciary 
for women in the Northern District. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Ms. Hill. Mr. Russell.

  STATEMENT OF JOHN DAVID RUSSELL, NOMINEE TO SERVE AS UNITED 
  STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA

    Mr. Russell. Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, 
Members of the Judiciary Committee, thank you for scheduling 
this hearing. I want to thank President Biden for nominating me 
for one of the two vacancies in the Northern District of 
Oklahoma. It is an honor and a privilege to be nominated.
    I want to thank my home State Senators, Senator Lankford 
and Senator Mullin, for establishing the committee to review 
applications, and for their recommendation of my nomination to 
the President. I particularly thank Senator Lankford for the 
warm introduction and kind remarks this morning.
    I have too many people to thank, but I'm going to start 
with my family. And I have to say, I won the lottery when it 
comes to family. I would not have had the success in my career 
without their support. I want to particularly thank my wife, 
Karen, who is with me today. In 37 years of marriage, she has 
been my biggest supporter, pushing me to do my best and always 
having my back.
    She gave up her career practicing law to raise our three 
daughters, and the great work she has done shows. You are the 
best. With me, too, is our oldest daughter, Dr. Emily Russell 
Levy, of Denver, Colorado, and our second daughter, Allison 
Russell Barton, of Tulsa. Our youngest daughter, Olivia Russell 
White, is at home in Tulsa with our two very perfect 
granddaughters, and they are watching remotely. I thank all 
three of our daughters and their husbands for their support.
    I want to thank my parents, Paul and Patty Russell, who are 
back in Oklahoma watching online. My parents taught me the 
values of hard work and an education through their example. I 
want to thank my three sisters and their husbands.
    My oldest sister, Hope Saunders is here with me today. My 
sisters, Allison Fuller and Susan Sharpe, are in Oklahoma 
watching online. I want to thank my mother-in-law, Stella 
Smith, watching from home, and my late father-in-law, Joe, 
watching from above. They have been unwavering supporters.
    I want to thank the great lawyers and the support staff at 
my law firm, GableGotwals, for being great colleagues and their 
support through this process. I practice law with the best 
lawyers in Oklahoma, and I'm proud to be a part of that great 
firm.
    Last, I'd like to thank the many great lawyers from whom I 
learned how to practice law. I will be forever grateful for 
their guidance. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to answering the 
Committee's questions. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Mr. Russell. Judge Manglona.

STATEMENT OF HON. RAMONA VILLAGOMEZ MANGLONA, NOMINEE TO SERVE 
AS UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT COURT FOR THE 
                    NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS

    Judge Manglona. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Graham. Good morning. I would like to thank you, and the other 
Committee Members, for holding this hearing.
    I am grateful and thankful to President Biden for 
nominating me to serve a second term as the sole district judge 
for the District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. I am 
humbled by his decision to recommend that I continue serving in 
this judicial capacity.
    I would like to also express my sincere appreciation, or, 
as we say in the Chamorro language, Un Dangkulu na si Yu'us 
Ma'ase, to Congressman Gregorio Kilili Sablan for his kind 
introduction and supporting my renomination.
    There are family members joining us this morning who are 
excited to witness this confirmation process in person: my 
loving and supportive husband of almost 34 years, John, who's 
here together with my two siblings, Patricia Patricia V. 
Cepeda, who flew in from Houston, and Thomas P. Villagomez, who 
made the long 10,000-mile journey all the way from Saipan; my 
nephew, Thomas Peter Villagomez, from the Bay Area; and my 
grandnephew, Wally Wesley, who lives right here in the DC area.
    My two children, Dencio and Savana, who were here with me 
in 2011 for my first nomination hearing, are unable to join us 
today. My daughter, Savana, just gave birth a week ago to our 
first grandchild, Kaia Jay Manglona Jefferson. Savana and her 
husband, Jalen Jefferson, are at their home in Sacramento, 
absorbing all the joys of parenthood.
    My son, Dencio, is currently in Saipan, having just 
recently started a new job after obtaining his master's degree 
in public administration at American University just this prior 
May. He's saving his leave time to be able to travel to 
Sacramento and meet his niece, Kaya J., in December, when we 
all hope to be able to gather for the holidays.
    My nephew, Thomas A. Manglona, II, also wanted to be here 
in person, but is also back home covering all the regional 
news, including this story. It is 1 a.m., Thursday, tomorrow's 
Standard Time right now, and I believe my six other siblings, 
and their families, are viewing this event live stream.
    My in-laws, Pres and Lee Torres, in Saipan, as well as 
Vincent and Benita Manglona on Guam, and their children, are 
also online. My brother, David, who was here with me in 2011, 
is online from Hawaii. So we have a broad group. And I also 
understand some of the district court staff back on Saipan, as 
well as Guam, where I usually sit by designation, are also 
tuning in, including my dear friend, Chief Judge Frances 
Tydingco-Gatewood of the District Court of Guam. Thank you all 
for showing your support, and I am grateful.
    I thank the Committee for allowing me to make these 
introductions. And I look forward to answering your questions.
    Chair Durbin. Judge, thank you very much.
    And we know the duration of the trip makes it a special 
sacrifice for you to be here, and we certainly appreciate you, 
and your family and friends who are in attendance, for making 
that sacrifice. I'm going to start the round of questioning. 
Five minutes for each Member.
    Ms. Hill, most Members of Congress who have Tribal 
representation in their States understand this whole issue of 
Tribal sovereignty and the fact that you could have served as 
attorney general for the Cherokee Nation. Could you summarize, 
in a few sentences, the difference, or the challenge, that you 
faced with that responsibility?
    Ms. Hill. Serving as attorney general of the Cherokee 
Nation, you know, is--post-McGirt especially, has been very 
challenging. There's been a great increase in the number of 
criminal cases that are being heard. Indian Tribes have 
jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians across their 
Indian countries, so throughout the reservation of the Cherokee 
Nation, the Cherokee Nation has jurisdiction, and the office of 
the attorney general is responsible for prosecuting those. So, 
as the attorney general, it has been the responsibility, post-
McGirt, to scale up that office in a way that--as we're able to 
handle all the different cases that came to us.
    And I think that, you know, that's something that for 
people who have Indian country in their districts are probably 
more familiar with that process. It may not be that familiar to 
other people.
    Chair Durbin. So your responsibility as district court 
judge is separate and apart from the Cherokee Nation?
    Ms. Hill. Certainly. A district court judge for the United 
States is an entirely different job than the job of an 
advocate. As attorney general, of course, I was an advocate for 
the Tribe's legal position and for its rights. Like all 
attorneys, I would advocate on behalf of my client with every--
all the intellect and all of the strategic thought I could put 
into it on behalf of the Nation.
    For a Federal district judge, that is entirely a different 
job. The job is to look at all the cases that come before you 
impartially and fairly, and looking at everything on their own 
terms, and then applying the facts to the law. And it's a much 
different role entirely.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you very much.
    Judge Manglona--I want to pronounce your name correctly. Is 
it Manglona?
    Judge Manglona. Manglona. Yes, Manglona.
    Chair Durbin. Yes. Close now. You had a range of experience 
as a litigator and a jurist, and spent your legal career in the 
Northern Mariana Islands, including a previous appointment to 
the bench, to which you've been renominated.
    I want to make a note of this fact that after the island 
was hit with devastating typhoons in 2015 and 2018, you kept 
the courthouse open to ensure the crucial work of the judiciary 
would not be interrupted. Your judicial chambers were awarded 
the 2019 Director's Award for Extraordinary Action from the 
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
    How have your experiences equipped you to continue serving 
that unique need in the Northern Marianas?
    Judge Manglona. Senator, the two super typhoons that hit 
Saipan, with the distance to receiving the help, was truly 
challenging. I was very grateful for this board from the 
Administrative Office, as well as my neighboring district in 
Guam. As I mentioned, the experience that I've gone through 
made me stronger in regards to being creative in how to deal 
with challenges.
    And I actually--from our initial experience in 2015, some 
of the other districts that then suffered other natural 
disasters in other parts of the country, were able to avail of 
some of the lessons that we learned. And I believe all this 
experience is going to ensure that, should there be another 
disaster or calamity, I will be so well prepared to maintain or 
keep the courthouse doors open to ensure that people's 
constitutional rights are still addressed.
    Chair Durbin. Well, congratulations to you on that effort.
    Judge Manglona. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Mr. Russell, while reviewing your record, I 
noticed you've been representing U.S. purchasers in a putative 
class action against the manufacturer of a breast cancer drug 
called Herceptin. The plaintiffs in the suit contend the 
company falsely labeled vials of the drug so that the 
purchasers regularly receive less of the active ingredient than 
they thought they were receiving. Can you tell us about your 
work in that case and what specific claims the class is 
raising?
    Mr. Russell. Senator, the plaintiffs in that case, it's a 
putative class action--it's also a multi-district litigation 
case, and the claims are breach of warranty fraud. There are 
several different claims relating to the lack of Herceptin that 
is showing up in the vials over a historical period of time. 
And so the claims are that there were--the doctors' offices 
having to administer the Herceptin were required to open 
additional vials at cost and loss, in each time that they 
administered Herceptin to a breast cancer patient.
    Chair Durbin. I'm a little familiar with that issue because 
we've had the opposite be the case, as well. That drugs are put 
in containers far greater than necessary for the ordinary 
dosage, and many of these very expensive drugs end up being 
surplus and thrown away. So labeling, and handling, and 
bottling is a critical element in making sure that the American 
consumer is treated fairly.
    Thank you very much. Senator Graham.
    Senator Graham. Thank you.
    Yes. Ms. Hill, I think the Committee received a letter from 
the United--UKB, how do you say, the K----
    Ms. Hill. Keetoowah.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. Okay--questioning your 
impartiality and your ability to serve. What would you say?
    Ms. Hill. I would say, you know, certainly, there's been a 
fair amount of litigation between the Cherokee Nation and the 
United Keetoowah Band. And in that litigation, I represented my 
client to the best of my ability, which is my job and duty.
    Certainly, taking on the role of Federal district judge is 
one that leaves behind the life of advocacy and embraces the 
job and the life of a jurist. One who takes the case that's 
before them, and looks at them fairly, impartially, and applies 
the law to the facts. And I understand very much that that's 
the job of the district judge and not to serve as an advocate.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Are you familiar with a--called a 
``corrupt bargain'' --the allegation of a corrupt bargain 
between the Cherokee Federal and HHS concerning construction of 
a migrant detention center? Are you familiar with that?
    Ms. Hill. I'm not. I'm familiar with the attempt to 
construct a migrant facility that----
    Senator Graham. But you had nothing to do with that?
    Ms. Hill. No. That was done by Cherokee Nation businesses.
    Senator Graham. Okay. As an advocate for the Cherokee 
Nation, obviously you have to represent your client with vigor, 
and I think that's what all lawyers do. The two Senators speak 
very well of you. When it comes to the Dakota Pipeline, can you 
tell me your position regarding that?
    Ms. Hill. So when the Dakota Access Pipeline was--when the 
dispute in Indian country arose with the Standing Rock 
Reservation, I was the Secretary of Natural Resources for the 
Cherokee Nation. The legislature, the elected leaders of the 
Cherokee Nation, passed resolutions in support of the Standing 
Rock Tribe. And so, as part of a delegation of the Cherokee 
Nation, you know, I participated in activities regarding that 
pipeline.
    Senator Graham. Okay. In terms of--do you have any 
particular bias against the fossil fuel industry?
    Ms. Hill. I do not. I've worked--I think my record reflects 
that I've worked also with fossil fuel companies. When they are 
putting in infrastructure, things like pipelines, one of the 
things they have to deal with is trying to make sure they don't 
affect the various sites where there might be Tribal interests.
    And so, working directly with those pipeline companies to 
make sure that they're cited properly, and in compliance with 
the law, is something that I've also done. So I've worked with 
companies that are also involved in fossil fuels. I do not 
believe I have any bias against them, and I think my record 
would reflect that.
    Senator Graham. Ma'am, how do you say your last name, 
again?
    Judge Manglona. Manglona.
    Senator Graham. How long does it take to get from Saipan to 
here?
    Judge Manglona. Twenty-four hours one way, door to door.
    Senator Graham. You said that very certain.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Graham. That's a long haul.
    Judge Manglona. I've done it many times.
    Senator Graham. So you also have cases in Guam. Is that 
right?
    Judge Manglona. Yes, I sit by designation.
    Senator Graham. Is there anything the Committee can do to, 
like, make your job easier?
    Judge Manglona. Confirm me.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Graham. Yes. Good answer. I just assumed you had 
the job, so--yes, let me not jump over that part. You seem to 
be well qualified. Everybody listening back in Saipan, she's 
doing good.
    Judge Manglona. Yes.
    Senator Graham. So, I mean, how do you really--I mean, how 
long does it take you to get to Guam?
    Judge Manglona. Well, Saipan and Guam are in the same 
archipelago. So I just fly down. It's about a 30-minute flight. 
Unfortunately, airline is the only way. Boat is by days. And so 
we're in the same time zone. It makes it easier. There were the 
days when we would have three to five flights in a day. 
Nowadays, it's very restricted. So it does constrain.
    But thank goodness for modern technology. In 2021, I 
presided over a 7-week trial where I was doing the trial in 
Guam and then handling my cases virtually in Saipan. So I can 
move things along.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Thank you, much.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations, 
to each of you.
    I ask the following two foundational questions of nominees 
to--for any of the Committees on which I sit. So I'll start 
with Ms. Hill and go right down the line. Since you became a 
legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual 
favors or committed any verbal or physical harassment or 
assault of a sexual nature?
    Ms. Hill. No, Senator.
    Mr. Russell. No, Senator.
    Judge Manglona. No, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Have you ever faced discipline, or entered 
into a settlement, related to this kind of conduct?
    Ms. Hill. No, Senator.
    Mr. Russell. No, Senator.
    Judge Manglona. No, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. Ms. Hill, you have a long career working 
for the Cherokee Nation, most recently as attorney general. So 
I think that you will bring a unique perspective to the Federal 
bench. How has your experience working for the Cherokee Nation 
prepared you for an appointment to the Federal bench?
    Ms. Hill. One of the good things about working for the 
Cherokee Nation, one of the things I have most enjoyed, was the 
opportunity to work with lots of different types of people. 
Working with State leaders on issues of common concern, working 
with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District to 
prosecute crime in Indian country.
    So I've had an opportunity to work with lots of different 
types of individuals while working for the Cherokee Nation. It 
is the largest federally recognized Indian Tribe, and we have a 
very large reservation. So it's created lots of opportunities 
for me to learn to work with different people, and to learn the 
State very well. And to learn the law of lots of different 
topics, from laying pipelines and fossil fuels right up to 
criminal jurisdictional matters in Indian country.
    So it's given me a breadth of experience that I think is 
going to be useful to a district judge in the Northern District 
of Oklahoma.
    Senator Hirono. I agree with you. And if confirmed, you'll 
be the first Native American woman to serve as a Federal judge 
in Oklahoma. Now, this Committee has had a hearing in which we 
are, I think, sending to the floor, I hope--yes, we are--the 
first Native Hawaiian woman to sit on the Federal bench.
    So I think it's very important that we have judges who have 
the kind of perspective that has to do with our Native people. 
So, you know, I certainly look forward to supporting you.
    Again, for you, in--I'm sorry, McGirt v. Oklahoma--the 
Supreme Court held that the State of Oklahoma lacked 
jurisdiction to prosecute Native Americans for crimes committed 
on Tribal land. Can you tell the Committee briefly about the 
process of setting up the Cherokee Nation's Criminal Division 
following that Supreme Court decision?
    Ms. Hill. When that case was decided, the Cherokee Nation's 
criminal docket was pretty uneventful. It typically had about a 
hundred cases a year that we would hear, because most of them 
were serious crimes, were tried by the Northern District or the 
Eastern District.
    Post-McGirt, that completely changed. The jurisdictional 
rules applied throughout the reservation. So we had, I think, 
around 3,700 matters, criminal and traffic matters, filed that 
first year post-McGirt.
    So I had to go from one criminal prosecutor to nine full-
time criminal prosecutors. And that sort of ramping up included 
support staff, investigators, all of those things that were 
required. So that process of, you know, building that up very 
quickly was something that I had to oversee as attorney 
general, and it was quite the effort.
    But it was--you know, that's what the law required. The 
Nation's jurisdiction was larger than had previously been 
understood until the opinion in McGirt v. Oklahoma.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you.
    Judge Manglona, since 2011, you have served as the sole 
active Federal district court judge in the Northern Mariana 
Islands. And as such, you performed the work of a chief judge, 
a magistrate judge, and a bankruptcy judge. You wear many hats. 
Can you tell us about the unique experience of being not only 
the chief judge, but also the only Federal judge in a district, 
and how has this experience informed your judicial approach?
    Judge Manglona. Senator, it's been a wonderful challenge to 
be able to do all three areas of law. I'll be candid. The 
bankruptcy docket is not very vibrant right now, but there were 
instances where we'd have to do some novel issues. And, as I 
mentioned, I also sit by designation in Guam. So I assist in 
that district, and that's where I've also had additional 
experience, even presiding over bankruptcy cases.
    Given the broad general jurisdiction experience that I had 
in the trial court for 8 years, I think it really prepared me 
to be able to do everything from beginning to end, as 
magistrate judges for criminal or civil matters, from criminal 
warrants, all the way to sentencing as a district judge.
    So, I had that full experience, and I enjoy the full 
panoply. And I am so rewarded when I am also working with other 
district judges from either my neighboring district in Guam, or 
elsewhere, including Hawaii.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And while I didn't have a question 
for you, Mr. Russell, I look forward to supporting you also.
    Mr. Russell. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator. Senator Grassley.
    Senator Grassley. Yes, Ms. Hill, I'm going to start with 
you. You were for 4 years, until recently, attorney general, as 
we all know now. The Cherokee Nation has made contracts with 
the Federal Government for services related to unaccompanied 
alien children through tribally owned entities like Cherokee 
Federal.
    And this is an issue because 85,000 children have been lost 
track of by this administration. According to Cherokee Nation 
law, one of the attorney general's duties is to prepare drafts 
of, quote, ``contracts and other instruments in which the 
Cherokee Nation government is interested.''
    So, for you, do you agree that the Cherokee Nation 
government would have had an interest, as according to that 
law, in the multimillion dollar contract entered into between 
the U.S. Government and the Cherokee Federal tribally owned 
company?
    Ms. Hill. I mean, the Cherokee Nation would have had the 
interest of a shareholder in Cherokee Federal, which is a 
business arm that's operated by the Nation. So it would have an 
interest--an interest in the company. Certainly, it's the owner 
of that company, but that company is operated separately from 
the government. So it has its own attorneys, it has its own 
infrastructure.
    Senator Grassley. So you're saying that where your law 
requires you and your duties as attorney general to prepare 
drafts, you're saying you would not have been involved in 
preparing any of those drafts?
    Ms. Hill. That's correct.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. As attorney general--well, maybe 
you've answered this last question. Let me ask you and then 
come to the conclusion if you've answered it or not. What was 
your, or your office's, role with respect to these contracts 
entered into between Cherokee Federal and the Federal 
Government related to unaccompanied children's services? Did 
you approve them? Did you observe them? And I think you just 
told me, you had nothing to do with these contracts.
    Ms. Hill. I did not have anything to do with those 
contracts.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. This next question is--you may have 
the same answer, but it goes in a little different direction 
because maybe as attorney general, you'd hear about any 
problems.
    Did you, or your office, receive any complaints related to 
Cherokee Federal's, or any other entity, handling unaccompanied 
alien children, and if so, what kind of complaints did you 
receive and how did you handle them?
    Ms. Hill. I do not recall receiving any complaints about 
Cherokee Federal. The facility that--as I understand it, the 
facility that Cherokee Federal operated was in California. It 
was not a local facility, and I--so it wasn't on the 
reservation. It wasn't within the jurisdiction of the Cherokee 
Nation.
    I don't recall ever receiving any complaints about it. I do 
recall there being a bit of controversy about it, but it was 
not as if I had a formal request for review, or anything like 
that, on my desk that I can recall, Senator.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. If there's anything you can supply 
to us about these complaints you heard, just hear them, not 
being in involved with them, I'd like that information. You 
don't need to give it to me now, but you could give it to me in 
writing.
    For all of you: Very general question, but do you believe 
that a judge should ever consider his or own values or policy 
preferences when determining what the law means or what the 
cases outcome should be, and if so, under what circumstances?
    I'll start with you, Ms. Hill.
    Ms. Hill. I don't believe that the personal values or 
personal, you know, policy preferences of the judge should 
affect the outcome. You know, the laws are written by Congress. 
The judges should look at what the law is, they should look at 
what the precedent is in the circuit that we serve in. But I 
don't think that overlaying your opinion about those things is 
appropriate.
    Senator Grassley. If it's ditto for you, you can just say 
that, Mr. Russell.
    Mr. Russell. The same. Personal values are not important. 
It's the rule of law.
    Senator Grassley. And you, Ms. Manglona?
    Judge Manglona. I agree with my co-panelists.
    Senator Grassley. Okay. Maybe I will quit. I'll put the 
rest in for writing.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Grassley. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations, 
to each of you.
    Ms. Hill, what is ``collateral estoppel'' ?
    Ms. Hill. Collateral estoppel. I think collateral 
estoppel--well, Senator, I will say that my practice--my 20 
years of practice has primarily been dealing with issues 
relating to criminal law or relating to other areas of the law. 
And----
    Senator Kennedy. If you don't know just tell me.
    Ms. Hill. I certainly do know collateral estoppel. I'm 
finding that the bright lights of the moment are making it hard 
for me to recall it.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. So you don't recall it. Okay. What 
is the ``amount in controversy'' requirement?
    Ms. Hill. The amount in controversy requirement is $75,000, 
that typically governs, in many cases, almost any case, in 
diversity jurisdiction in the Federal courts----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Ms. Hill [continuing]. And certain other----
    Senator Kennedy. That's good. What does the Thirteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution do?
    Ms. Hill. It outlaws slavery.
    Senator Kennedy. What does the Seventh Amendment do?
    Ms. Hill. It ensures that all civil jury trials--that all 
civil cases in the United States are done by jury trial. That 
you have a right to a jury trial in a civil case.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. What is the difference between a 
stay order and an injunction?
    Ms. Hill. A stay order would prohibit--sorry. An injunction 
would restrain the parties from taking action. A stay order--
I'm not sure that I actually can give you the--that.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Tell me about--you'll see a lot of 
this in Federal court. Tell me about the multi-district 
litigation statute.
    Ms. Hill. So I'm not extremely familiar with the multi-
district litigation. I do know that multi-district litigation 
is often consolidated into a particular court.
    So all of the cases involving a particular type of issue, 
if there is a multi-district litigation, those will all be 
referred to one court and one judge who will then oversee the 
MDL. But I will confess, I'm not super familiar with all the 
ins and outs of that.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. What kind of constitutional claims 
are subject to intermediate judicial scrutiny?
    Ms. Hill. Cases involving certain types of classes, such as 
gender or illegitimacy, are subject to intermediate scrutiny. 
Some types of speech, like commercial speech, would be subject 
to intermediate scrutiny.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Tell me what a 12(b)(6) motion is?
    Ms. Hill. It's a motion to dismiss a claim--or, I mean, 
motion to dismiss an issue for failure to state a claim.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. And what's the standard for granting 
a summary judgment in Federal court?
    Ms. Hill. It's if there are no issues of material fact, and 
that the issue can therefore be decided as a matter of law.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. What's the standard for deciding 
whether a particular punishment is cruel and unusual under the 
Eighth Amendment?
    Ms. Hill. So the particular standard, the court has said, 
and I cannot recall the case, but it says that you have to look 
at not only whether it is--would be shocking to an individual--
to the individuals at the time that it was written, so it's not 
purely a historical review, as some of them are purely 
historical, but also you have to look at how it has changed, 
how those values have changed with time. It's one of those 
cases--circumstances where the court says it's appropriate to 
look at how values have changed with time.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Well our right against cruel and 
unusual punishment is a fundamental right. Is it not?
    Ms. Hill. It is.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. How do you square what you just told 
me about the Eighth Amendment with the case, after case, after 
case, by the U.S. Supreme Court that says the definition of a 
fundamental right is one that's explicitly stated in the 
Constitution, or deeply rooted in our history and tradition?
    Ms. Hill. Yes. I think that it is--I think it is deeply 
rooted in our history and tradition. The----
    Senator Kennedy. Yes, but, certain forms of punishment are 
not. If a form of punishment, it existed at the time of our 
founding, and it's deeply rooted in our history and tradition, 
you're telling me that makes it automatically constitutional 
today? I thought you just told me, no?
    Ms. Hill. No. I'm certainly not saying that. The Supreme--
I'm not. What I say is, about it, is really quite irrelevant, 
but the Supreme Court has said we look at it with a view to the 
changing values on these issues.
    Senator Kennedy. Why the difference? I thought----
    Ms. Hill. Well, I----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. They're both fundamental 
rights. Why the difference?
    Ms. Hill. Yes. I think that's a question that the Supreme 
Court's going to have to answer. Whether or not they have----
    Senator Kennedy. I think it has. I'm just asking if you 
know.
    Ms. Hill. I think I've answered the question to the best of 
my ability, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Thank you, all.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Hawley can, if you return. Oh. I 
think that all the Senators have appeared who are going to 
question today.
    Ms. Hill, I congratulate you on surviving the John Kennedy 
6-minute bar exam.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Hill. My contracts teacher is going to be appalled, 
and----
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Hill [continuing]. I'm going to have to live with that, 
Senator, but thank you--Chair, thank you.
    Senator Kennedy. [Speaking off microphone.]
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. If you promise to spare Ms. Hill, I'll----
    Senator Kennedy. Did the White House give any of you any 
written materials to use to prepare?
    Ms. Hill. They gave----
    Senator Kennedy. Or digital materials?
    Ms. Hill [continuing]. They gave us, you know, questions--
previous questions that had been asked by the panel.
    Senator Kennedy. And answers?
    Ms. Hill. I think we had to go find the answers ourselves. 
I think we had to go watch----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Ms. Hill [continuing]. The various----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. May I----
    Ms. Hill [continuing]. Committees.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Have a copy of that?
    Ms. Hill. I don't have one, but I am sure that it's just--
it is literally just a list of questions.
    Mr. Russell. I don't have a copy.
    Judge Manglona. I don't have any of the copies.
    Senator Kennedy. Would you send me a copy? I'm easy to 
find. Would you send me a copy, Ms. Hill?
    Ms. Hill. I will.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Would you each send me a copy?
    Judge Manglona. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Kennedy. Then I can compare and make sure they're 
all the same. Okay. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator, can we have a copy of your list of 
questions to share with----
    Senator Kennedy. Sure.
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Other Members?
    Senator Kennedy. I'll even give you the answers.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. It's like a bar review course.
    Ms. Hill. Yes.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to all of you 
for being here.
    Ms. Hill, I'd like to start with you, if that's all right. 
As you know, in 2020, in the McGirt case, the Supreme Court 
held that in unique circumstances, major crimes committed in 
Indian country can be prosecuted only by Tribal or Federal 
courts. This ruling removed the State's ability to prosecute 
those crimes in those circumstances.
    Now, you strongly support the McGirt decision, and it's 
important to keep in mind that in Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta in 
2022, the Supreme Court clarified States retain the authority 
to prosecute non-Indians who commit crimes against others, even 
if those crimes take place in Indian country.
    Now, in one of your many critiques of that decision, you 
called Castro-Huerta, quote, ``a very negative decision.'' And 
you said that, quote, ``Kavanaugh's opinion''--which, of 
course, was the opinion of the Court, ``Kavanaugh's opinion, it 
was terrible.''
    To justify that critique, you came up with a hypothetical. 
A hypothetical in which you stated that, quote, ``A non-Indian 
steals a car from an Indian, and that person can be prosecuted 
by the State. That person can also be prosecuted by the United 
States. They can be convicted twice for the same act, and serve 
two sentences.'' That was part of your critique.
    My concern is that your critique here demonstrates a 
fundamental misunderstanding of how the Double Jeopardy Clause 
of the Fifth Amendment works. I think most first-year law 
students can tell you that double jeopardy prevents separate 
prosecutions for the same offense when those prosecutions are 
brought by the same sovereign.
    A non-Indian who steals a car from a non-Indian, for 
example, in Utah, is properly subject to prosecution by both 
State and Federal authorities. By the State government, and by 
the Federal Government, because they are separate sovereigns in 
our system, just as in any other State in the United States.
    State governments are unique. They're unique, independent 
sovereigns, separate and apart from the Federal Government. And 
the Federal Government is a completely different sovereign. 
This has been a line of authority. This has been a principle 
that's been clearly established ever since our Nation's 
inception, certainly ever since we adopted the Double Jeopardy 
Clause in 1791 as part of our Constitution.
    So yes, McGirt represents--presents a unique set of 
circumstances. An Indian committing a crime against an Indian 
in Indian country, but nothing in the Constitution prevents a 
State from prosecuting a non-Indian for their crimes, 
regardless of who the victim is.
    So, in your view, do you disagree with the characterization 
of double jeopardy, as I've just stated it. Do you disagree 
that the States are separate sovereigns from the Federal 
Government for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause?
    Ms. Hill. I certainly don't disagree with that.
    Senator Lee. And if confirmed, would you follow the 
majority opinion in Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta?
    Ms. Hill. I absolutely would. And given the practice that 
I've had, I've been following it for some time.
    Senator Lee. Your apparent desire to remove the State's 
authority to prosecute non-Indian offenders would, in my view, 
only weaken law enforcement's ability to remove violent 
offenders from the streets.
    And it's dangerous to place loyalty to any particular group 
over your loyalty to long-established principles of law or of 
the Constitution. So when--am I misreading your statement 
regarding Castro-Huerta or the hypothetical?
    Ms. Hill. I think that the full context, maybe, is not 
really reflected there. The full context of my comments, I can 
say, certainly, I, on behalf of my client, I was critical of 
the decision in Castro-Huerta because it was a decision that 
had other ramifications in Indian law outside----
    Senator Lee. Right. But I'm not talking about the other 
ramifications. I'm just talking about the--about double 
jeopardy here.
    Ms. Hill. Right. I understand that. And the--but those 
ramifications, that was the--some of the context of my 
criticism of it. I certainly believe and understand that I'm 
required to follow--will be required to follow the law, if I'm 
so fortunate as to be confirmed to serve in the Northern 
District.
    And I understand the distinctions that, you know, you 
have--if you have three sovereigns, that all three sovereigns 
could bring those claims and there would not be a double 
jeopardy issue.
    Senator Lee. Okay. While you were--while serving as 
attorney general of the Cherokee Nation, did you state that you 
have--had no intent to enforce the law post-Dobbs?
    Ms. Hill. I never said that.
    Senator Lee. Did you, at any point, say, ``I expect, and I 
think everyone expects, massive constitutional challenges to 
that law,'' just for your awareness, referring to those laws?
    Ms. Hill. I was not referring to Dobbs, that was the 
decision of the Court. I was talking about the Oklahoma law 
that had been passed relating to abortion, post the decision in 
Dobbs, and that that law was being challenged, had already been 
challenged, in the courts. There was--it was significantly 
newsworthy in Oklahoma at the time that the Oklahoma law was 
being challenged.
    Senator Lee. Challenged post-Dobbs on grounds that you 
believed were legitimate challenges post-Dobbs.
    Ms. Hill. I couldn't say that they were legitimate. I just 
knew that there were likely to be many challenges to it. It was 
very contentious.
    Senator Lee. Okay. I see my time's expired. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Lee. Senator Tillis.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, all, 
for being here.
    Mr. Russell and Ms. Manglona--did I get that right? I 
intend to support you-all's confirmation. And even if I was 
leaning against you, I would've done it after your answer to 
Senator Graham's question about how your job could be made 
easier. I've been watching the proceedings in my office.
    Ms. Hill, I've got some questions for you. You probably 
know I'm from North Carolina, and I have a history with the 
Eastern Band of the Cherokee. And up until a couple of years 
ago, it was pretty positive. I was the speaker that negotiated 
the new compact for the Eastern Band that gave rise to live 
gambling and the additional casino that they had there. But 
we've had a parting of the ways that hopefully sooner or later 
we get back on track.
    This week, the Eastern Band are in the middle of the 
National Congress of American Indians, doing their best to 
disenfranchise State-recognized Tribes as either voting members 
or members of the organization. Which, of course, is just 
another example of where they want to shut the door behind 
their recognition.
    But I've got some questions I just need to clear up very 
quickly.
    On March 12th, the U.S Department of the Interior agreed to 
put 17 acres in Cleveland County in North Carolina in a trust 
for the Catawba Nation.
    On May 1st, 2020, as attorney general, your team filed a 
motion to intervene in the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians v. 
United States Department of the Interior.
    The motion backed the Eastern Band of the Cherokee, and 
claimed that the DOI willfully violated the National Historic 
Preservation rights, National Environment Policy Act, and 
Administrative Procedure Act. Do you believe the DOI got the 
decision right or wrong?
    Ms. Hill. You know, that case was some time ago. I remember 
that there was an issue regarding the NHPA in that particular--
--
    Senator Tillis. Okay. I'll let you--actually, if you'll 
submit that answer in writing. Just a----
    Ms. Hill. That would be helpful.
    Senator Tillis [continuing]. Straightforward, whether or 
not you think the DOI got it right or wrong.
    Can I get your commitment that you'll recuse yourself from 
cases involving Tribal issues, which you have had a degree of 
involvement that would create at least the appearance of 
lacking impartiality?
    Ms. Hill. Yes, I would certainly recuse myself, you know, 
as in any circumstance where the rules would indicate I should, 
including----
    Senator Tillis. So it's a maybe. If it's an appearance 
thing, it's a maybe. Do you agree that the Eastern Band of 
Cherokee Indians, that there should be three congressional 
delegates?
    Ms. Hill. I----
    Senator Tillis [continuing]. I know that you know that UKB 
and Eastern Band of the Cherokee may have differing opinions, 
here. I'm kind of curious about your opinion.
    Ms. Hill. Right. I mean, I certainly represented on behalf 
of the Cherokee Nation, that it was the treaty holder, and that 
it had a right to have the treaty that--the delegate on behalf 
of the Cherokee Nation. That was the position that I took on 
behalf of the Cherokee Nation.
    Senator Tillis. If the case regarding the potential 
Cherokee delegate to Congress comes before you, would you 
recuse yourself?
    Ms. Hill. I think I would recuse myself on that case.
    Senator Tillis. Do you believe that you should consider 
other cases regarding Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina 
impartially, given your background, should a case go through 
the courts and be in your jurisdiction related to Lumbee 
recognition?
    Ms. Hill. I can only follow the rules of judicial conduct 
on any matter that comes before me, and if there was an issue 
raised that demanded my recusal, I would certainly recuse 
according to the rules.
    Senator Tillis. Okay. I'm trying to do a lightning round 
here. I'm sorry. I really hate interrupting people, even when I 
appear to be hostile. This has nothing to do with you, Ms. 
Hill. It has to do with a profound issue and disagreement that 
I have with the Eastern Band of the Cherokee. So, please accept 
my apologies.
    There have been reports that the Cherokee Nation has made 
millions of dollars from immigration contracts to process 
individuals who enter the United States illegally, specifically 
unaccompanied children. As the former attorney general for the 
Cherokee Nation, were you involved in any of the immigration 
contract negotiations?
    Ms. Hill. I was not.
    Senator Tillis. Okay. And in your private practice? I 
believe that they have done some representation on this matter?
    Ms. Hill. I have never--I've never been involved, you know, 
in that in any real way.
    Senator Tillis. We've got a couple of--you know, it's 
unfair to hit you in the lightning round and ask you to recall 
all of that. We will be submitting a question for the record 
that's very concise with respect to the matter, and a couple of 
other things.
    Mr. Chair, I'm going to yield back time so Senator Padilla 
can speak, but I did have one document that was the filing 
[holds up a document]. If I may, I'd like to seek unanimous 
consent to have the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians v. 
Department of the Interior case into the record.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Padilla.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Welcome to all three 
nominees. Congratulations on being here today, and for your 
willingness to serve.
    My first question is a question I ask to every nominee that 
comes before this Committee for the Federal bench. And that's a 
two-part question.
    Number one, do you agree with the following? I believe one 
of our country's greatest strengths is our diversity. Not just 
ethnic racial diversity, but the diversity of our economy, the 
diversity of cultures, the diversity of life experiences and 
professional experiences that I believe our Federal judiciary 
should represent. Hasn't always.
    Working with President Biden, this Committee, we have 
considered and confirmed a historically diverse group of 
Federal judges at all levels over the last two-plus years. Do 
you agree that diversity is good for the courtroom, and for the 
judicial system? And I'm not just talking about diversity on 
the bench, by the way.
    Here's the part B of the question. If you agree with that 
statement, I'd love to hear it. If you disagree, I'd love to 
hear why. But if you do agree, then what would you do to work 
toward more diverse staff in the courtroom, not just on the 
bench, particularly when it comes to law clerks? I think you 
may each be able to speak to your experience as law clerks and 
what that did to support your career trajectory, whether it's 
been in public or in private practice.
    So two-part questions starting with Ms. Hill.
    Ms. Hill. I certainly, you know, do agree with the value 
statement that you gave, Senator. And as it relates to the 
hiring of court personnel, including staff, I was not a clerk. 
And I will say that growing up in the rural community that I 
grew up in, I just was not--didn't have any exposure to this 
world that clerks--or that I even understood exactly what 
clerks did or what that pathway looked like.
    And so I think that a lot of the work that perhaps needs to 
be done is just giving people that come from rural communities 
where you just don't have lawyers in your life--I didn't grow 
up in a world where there were lots of lawyers. And so that 
world is very opaque to me, even though I wanted to be a 
lawyer, I wasn't exactly sure how to understand that world.
    And so, I think one of the ways to do that is to reach out 
into communities where, you know, where there are people from 
rural areas, especially in the communities in the Northern 
District. And let people understand those opportunities, make 
people aware of what clerking is and what it can do for you, 
and so that people understand the value of it, and understand 
what the pathway is, would be one of the things I think would 
be valuable. And I would, you know, want to be able to 
contribute in some way to helping that happen.
    Senator Padilla. Beautifully said. Thank you. Mr. Russell.
    Mr. Russell. Senator, I agree with your value statement, 
and believe that diversity is important on the bench as well as 
in the staff at chambers of any judge.
    From my part, I, like Ms. Hill, I did not clerk. But in the 
many firms that I have worked at, we have seen the value of 
clerkships as we have had and hired clerks that have come in. 
And having the diversity is important because we are seeing 
talent coming from all different places. And so, if I'm 
fortunate to be confirmed, I would cast as wide of a net as 
possible to try to get clerks from as many places as possible, 
from diverse backgrounds, as well as racial diversity--in all 
types of diversity, I think, are important so that it's never 
an echo chamber. Thank you.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you.
    Judge Manglona. Senator, in my 20 years as a judge, I have 
seen the value of diversity. Speaking from the bench, I think 
it's nice for the community to see that people who are aware of 
them, all walks of life that are represented, are also on the 
bench. In the superior court that I was sitting at, there were 
only five trial court judges. Now with one district judge in my 
district, I am the only one representing, and I think it's 
something that is valuable for the perception of the community.
    In regards to hiring law clerks, for example, I do agree, 
as well, for diversity. I've hired from throughout the country. 
Unfortunately, we don't have a law school in my region. And so 
there aren't much in our district. But the ability to listen 
and hear different perspectives from--I have a law clerk from 
the East Coast and a law clerk from the West Coast, and having 
discussions about different issues or matters, it's really 
enlightening. And I think that's one reason why, as a judge, 
when we keep an open mind and then listen to the different 
perspectives, it would really keep--make us, enable us to make 
an informed decision.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chair. If I may, just one follow-up question 
for Ms. Hill. As Senator Lankford and Senator Hirono noted, and 
we all recognize, if confirmed, to be the first Native American 
woman to serve as a Federal judge in Oklahoma, where I think 
the Native population represents more than 10 percent of the 
State population. Your resume is clearly impressive. You are 
clearly more than qualified for this role, but this is a 
milestone that many would consider long overdue.
    I know a thing or two about being the first, but I'd like 
to hear from you. What would it mean to you and the people of 
Oklahoma, if you were to be confirmed, to be the first Native 
American woman on the District Court for Oklahoma?
    Ms. Hill. Yes. Oklahoma is such an amazing place. It's my 
home State, and I can't say enough great things about it. One 
of the great things about it, though, is its Native population. 
It's just--just brings something to the State that makes it 
utterly unique, and it's very valuable.
    And I think that having such a large Native population in 
the State, you know, it's--I think everybody will feel--I 
certainly feel like, you know, having a Federal bench that 
reflects the community that serves it, is a sign that your 
Government is thriving, that the community is thriving, that 
things are working well.
    And so I think that from that point of view, it will be a 
good thing to see and it's meaningful to me in that way. It's 
an opportunity to reflect the community that is served by the 
Northern District, and, you know, it's a very humbling thought 
to be the first.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator.
    At this point, I'm going to adjourn today's hearing after 
making this logistical note. Questions for the record will be 
due to the nominees by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, November 22nd, 
which is the day before Thanksgiving. So you'll be given time 
to celebrate Thanksgiving after 5 p.m. So I suggest everyone 
plan accordingly.
    The record will likewise remain open until that time to 
submit letters and similar materials. With that, and the 
gratitude of the Committee to the nominees, their families, and 
friends, this Committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:10 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
