                             Washington, DC

    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:04 p.m., in 
Room 2141, Rayburn House Office Building, the Hon. Andy Biggs 
[Chair of the Subcommittee] presiding.
    Members present: Representatives Biggs, Jordan, Nehls, 
Moore, Lee, Hunt, Jackson Lee, Nadler, McBath, Dean, Bush, and 
Johnson.
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you all for being here today. We are going 
to start with the Pledge of Allegiance. We will ask the 
gentleman from Texas, Mr. Nehls, to lead us.
    [Pledge of Allegiance.]
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Representative Nehls.
    I'm grateful to be Chairing this hearing today focused on 
how the Second Amendment empowers women. The Second Amendment 
empowers women and assists individuals when it comes to self-
defense.
    Violent crime continues to rise, and soft-on-crime policies 
are putting dangerous criminals back on the streets. This is 
happening across the country, including in our own Nation's 
Capital.
    In 2023, so far, there have been 906 carjackings in 
Washington, DC--more than double the number from last year. We 
had an opportunity to discuss these statistics more in-depth in 
our D.C. crime hearing in October.
    At a time when violent crime continues to plague the 
Nation, women have exercised their Second Amendment rights to 
protect themselves in dangerous situations while waiting for 
law enforcement to respond. Female firearms ownership continues 
to grow in the United States. Women are turning to themselves 
to be their own first responders.
    It is important to point out that Black female firearms 
ownership is especially on the rise. In 2021, the National 
Shooting Sports Foundation reported an 87 percent increase in 
gun ownership among Black women. I commend these strong women, 
and all strong women, for stepping up to protect themselves and 
their families.
    Unfortunately, some of our colleagues across the aisle do 
not share these same views. President Biden has made it clear 
lawful firearms ownership will not be tolerated.
    We all saw just recently how a lawful firearms owner in Los 
Angeles had his concealed carry permit suspended after 
defending himself, his wife, and his five-month-old from an 
armed attacker at their home. It is disgraceful that someone 
protecting their family would be punished in that way.
    The Biden Administration's policies only target lawful 
firearms owners and do not prevent actual criminals from 
committing violent crimes. They fail to realize how more gun 
control only harms and impacts the vulnerable populations they 
claim to want to protect.
    I am so grateful for our witnesses. All four of the 
witnesses here have compelling life stories. I have read all 
your essays. I look forward to hearing your testimony. You have 
come to us as mothers, survivors, business owners, teachers, 
authors, and more. I'm looking forward to your testimony.
    Make no mistake; I believe the Second Amendment is for 
everyone. The title of today's hearing rings true: Second 
Amendment Rights Empower Women's Rights.
    With that, I will yield back, and I will yield to my friend 
from Georgia, Mr. Johnson, for an opening statement.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I thank the Chair, and I welcome 
the witnesses today to testify before us.
    I will be reading the statement of Hon. Congresswoman from 
Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee, who is the Ranking Member on this 
Subcommittee, but she is occupied on the House floor with a 
very important matter that she is addressing. She has asked 
that I appear in her stead. I'm a Member of this Subcommittee.
    ``The right to bear arms is ingrained in the fabric of our 
country's history.'' At the same time, we cannot ignore the 
pressing need for measures that promote public safety and 
prevent the devastating toll of gun violence.
    At this very moment, we find ourselves at a critical 
juncture where we must strike a balance between upholding the 
Second Amendment and enacting gun legislation that protects us 
all.
    This is not a question of choosing one over the other; 
rather, this is symmetry. This symmetry requires an approach 
that respects individual rights while also addressing the 
urgent need for responsible regulation--a concept that was very 
clear prior to the politicalization of the Supreme Court of the 
United States.
    In the past, Congress has understood that gun legislation 
and regulation must be guided by the principles of public 
safety and that we must implement measures to prevent gun 
violence, particularly in the context of domestic abuse.
    For obvious reasons, I have long been a strong proponent of 
women's empowerment. If there are women who feel empowered by 
responsible, safe firearm ownership, that is certainly their 
prerogative, and I respect their decision.
    On the other hand, it is dangerous for this body to promote 
guns as a viable solution to domestic abuse, because both 
statistics and commonsense show that the answer to the 
victimization of women is not more guns and more violence. Not 
only are guns not the great equalizer, but they do not increase 
women's safety, as proven by readily available statistics.
    Today, guns are the no. 1 weapon used in domestic violence 
killings in the U.S. According to the Jewish Women's 
International, approximately 970 women are killed annually in 
the United States by men with firearms. In stark contrast, the 
Gun Violence Archive, the most complete record of gun use 
incidents in the country, reports an average of only 19 annual 
incidents of defensive gun use by women.
    Just having access to a firearm makes an abuser five times 
more likely to take their partner's life. Over the last decade, 
gun homicides by intimate partners jumped by 58 percent, and 
the pandemic was an especially lethal period for abuse victims. 
Gun homicides involving intimate partners rose a stunning 25 
percent in 2020 compared with the previous year--to the highest 
level in almost three decades.
    In that year, women accounted for more than two-thirds of 
the victims shot and killed by intimate partners, and in 2021, 
researchers reported that, ``more than two-thirds of recent 
mass shootings in the U.S. involved perpetrators who killed 
partners or relatives or had a history of domestic violence 
abuse''--``or had a history of domestic abuse.''
    Because the connection between domestic violence, gun 
violence, and homicide is undeniable, we must insist on common-
sense measures that effectively reduce gun violence and keep 
guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and other dangerous 
people who should not have them.
    That is why we passed H.R. 1620, the Violence Against Women 
Reauthorization Act of 2021, in the House during the previous 
Congress--with just 29 Republicans breaking ranks and voting 
with us. Under my leadership, we made sure that our bill made 
important improvements to existing laws to address the growing 
and unmet needs of victims and survivors of domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
    While firearms are often used in intimate relationships to 
kill, they are also used to threaten and intimidate, as one of 
today's witnesses has described in her written testimony. In 
many cases, homicides, assaults with firearms, and shootings 
could be prevented if abusers were prohibited from having 
firearms.
    For many years, Federal law allowed certain abusive dating 
partners to continue possessing firearms under Federal law when 
a similarly situated spouse, co-parent, or guardian could not--
commonly referred to as the boyfriend loophole. H.R. 1620 would 
have closed the boyfriend loophole by expanding the domestic 
violence provisions of Section 922 of Title 18 to include 
dating partners.
    Because we know people with a history of violence against a 
partner, including stalking or strangulation, are also far more 
likely to go on to commit more heinous acts, H.R. 1620 would 
have also added persons convicted of the misdemeanor crime of 
stalking to the list of those who may not possess a firearm 
under Federal law.
    If Republicans wanted to empower women, they could have 
supported these provisions to keep guns away from would-be 
abusers. Instead, these provisions were dropped from the 
version of the VAWA reauthorization that became law due to 
Republican opposition.
    Nevertheless, after nearly three decades of inaction and 
passage of the reauthorization, Congress listened to the 
American people, chose to act, and passed sensible gun safety 
legislation. That bill, the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, 
which only 10 Republicans voted for, partially closed the 
boyfriend loophole.
    While I had hoped to do more to address gun violence last 
Congress, especially as it relates to domestic abuse and 
violence against women, I remain hopeful. That is why this 
Congress I joined Representative Debbie Dingell, Judiciary 
Committee Member Mary Gay Scanlon, Republic Representative 
Brian Fitzpatrick, and others to introduce H.R. 905, the 
Strengthening Protections for Domestic Violence and Stalking 
Survivors Act, to close the boyfriend loophole completely.
    If our colleagues truly want to protect women and empower 
them, they could join their Republican colleague and support 
passage of our bill or any of the many bills Democrats have 
proposed that would remove at least one dangerous element from 
the domestic abuse equation--guns.
    The answer to the problem of gun violence in domestic 
violence is not more guns--although, it seems that more guns is 
the common Republican refrain for nearly every problem or issue 
our country currently faces. I sincerely hope our conversation 
today is truly about protecting and empowering women.
    With that, the Congresswoman would yield back, although it 
would be hard for her to do so.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Biggs. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman yielded 
back.
    Without objection, the Chair is authorized to declare a 
recess at any time.
    Without objection, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hunt, will 
be able to participate in today's hearing for the purpose of 
questioning the witnesses, if a Member yields him time for that 
purpose.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York, the 
Ranking Member of the whole Committee, Mr. Nadler.
    Mr. Nadler. I thank the Chair.
    Mr. Chair, this hearing is intended to promote gun 
ownership under the supposed theory that it empowers women. The 
very premise of this hearing is dangerous because we know from 
the data that the presence of a gun in the home actually 
increases the likelihood that a woman is murdered or dies by 
suicide.
    The statistic is as grim as they are unmistakable. A study 
of women who purchased handguns found that they faced a 50 
percent increased risk of homicide by any means and twice the 
risk of homicide by a firearm than women who did not purchase a 
handgun.
    The statistics are even worse when looking specifically at 
those experiencing domestic violence. One study found that 
access to a gun makes it five times more likely that an abuser 
partner will kill his victim.
    Another found that people living with handgun owners were 
seven times more likely to be shot by their spouse or intimate 
partner, and that 84 percent of the victims were women.
    Further, those with access to guns are three times more 
likely to die by suicide. The presence of a gun in a home also 
increases the risk of an accidental injury or death to everyone 
in the home, including children.
    So long as they are not legally prohibited, individuals 
have a right to own a firearm, but they should do so with full 
knowledge of these risks.
    Unfortunately, today, our Republican colleagues will try to 
obfuscate the plain evidence before us. Either they will simply 
ignore the obvious risks of gun ownership or, instead, they 
will suggest that, with the right gun or the right training, 
these statistics do not apply.
    This is the tactic the gun industry has taken in 
advertising targeted to women dating back to the 1980's--by 
promoting guns as ``the great equalizer.'' While this may sell 
more guns, it is plainly not true.
    We know that training is not enough to protect someone from 
the volatility of domestic violence because even law 
enforcement officers face significant risk in responding to 
domestic violence calls for services. A study of law 
enforcement fatalities that was conducted in partnership with 
the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund found that 
calls related to domestic disputes and domestic-related 
incidents represent the highest number of fatal types of calls 
for service. They were also the underlying cause of law 
enforcement fatalities for several other calls for service.
    What domestic violence victims need is not more guns and 
more training; it is more support from the many people and 
systems that should protect them and help them to safety well 
before they consider resorting to firing a gun. Law 
enforcement, social workers, behavioral health experts, and 
every Member of Congress have a responsibility to protect women 
and all people from gun violence.
    Republicans have repeatedly failed to exercise that 
responsibility to keep us all safer. Last Congress, the 
overwhelming majority of Republicans opposed numerous bills 
that would save lives while respecting the rights of 
responsible gun owners, including the bipartisan Background 
Checks Act and the Protecting Our Kids Act. They also opposed 
the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which became law over 
their objection.
    Republicans have also had every opportunity to empower 
women through other legislation. Every time Democrats offered 
them the chance to do so, the answer from Republicans was a 
resounding no.
    For example, the overwhelming majority of Republicans 
opposed the Women's Health Protection Act to empower women in 
their reproductive care. They are overwhelmingly opposed a 
resolution to extend the deadline for ratification of the Equal 
Rights Amendment. Notably for this hearing, they overwhelmingly 
opposed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act 2021, 
which would have closed the boyfriend loophole by prohibiting 
those convicted of stalking or abusing a dating partner from 
obtaining a firearm.
    In voting against this legislation, Republicans valued the 
right to access a gun above the very safety of those facing 
violence from convicted abusers. Time and again, Republicans, 
their allies, and their radical judicial appointees have also 
used the courts to prioritize access to firearms over women's 
safety.
    To give you an idea of how extreme their agenda is, the 
Supreme Court is currently considering United States v. Rahimi, 
a case challenging the law that prohibits possession of 
firearms by those who are subject to domestic violence 
restraining orders. This challenge grows out of the Supreme 
Court's decision to upend decades of Second Amendment 
jurisprudence in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. 
Bruen, which established a backward-looking test for gun-safety 
laws.
    Under this new test, a gun law can be upheld only if there 
was some similar law in effect more than two centuries ago, in 
1791, when the Second Amendment was ratified, or in 1868, when 
the 14th Amendment was ratified. These were times when women 
did not have the right to vote; when domestic abuse was not 
illegal or even frowned on, and when women were legally treated 
as property. In applying this framework in Rahimi, Republicans 
and their allies are asking the Supreme Court to turn back 
centuries of progress and to give dangerous abusers the right 
to access the firearm.
    Nearly one million women in the United States alive today, 
report being shot or shot at by an intimate partner, and 70 
women are shot and killed by a partner every month. Many more 
are threatened with a firearm or injured, but survive, like our 
witness, Ms. Glenn.
    Women don't need more guns. They need better laws that 
respect their autonomy; that promote the safety of all our 
communities, and that help them escape abuse, if they encounter 
it.
    No one should have to face the situations that Ms. Solomon, 
Ms. Watral, and Ms. Glenn have experienced. I thank all of you 
for coming here today to tell your stories.
    We should focus our efforts on keeping guns out of the 
hands of abusers and on preventing domestic abuse from 
occurring in the first place. Only then can we truly empower 
women.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.
    Mr. Biggs. I thank the gentleman.
    Without objection, all other opening statements will be 
included in the record.
    Mr. Biggs. I will now introduce today's witnesses.
    We will begin with Ms. Alcazar. Ms. Alcazar is one of the

    My name is Beth Alcazar, and I'm honored to represent 
female firearms owners, mothers, and educators who prioritize 
the safety of our families, our loved ones, and ourselves. I'm 
a writer. I'm an instructor. I'm a doctoral candidate working 
toward my terminal degree and curriculum and instruction, but, 
first and foremost, I'm a mother.
    I have made a personal choice to live as a mom with a gun. 
After all, I have three children who look to me as guide, 
coach, counselor, and protector. My journey in and my 
dedication to firearms self-defense and training has all been 
motivated by them. Ultimately, my three most important reasons 
for choosing to carry a gun are my three children.
    I'm also a proud member of the USCCA, one of the largest 
and fastest-growing organizations dedicated to educating and 
training responsible gun owners. Since the USCCA was founded, 
it has been providing essential self-defense training and 
resources to law-abiding citizens, so they have tools to 
protect themselves and their loved ones.
    Nowadays, our focus has expanded to advocating on behalf of 
the rising numbers of responsible gun owners from all walks of 
life, and I could not be more excited about this mission.
    My qualifications and certifications for teaching firearms 
self-defense and personal protection come from ALICE Institute, 
the American Red Cross, D.R.A.W. School, Force Science 
Institute, HSI, ICE Training, NRA, Sig Sauer Academy, and the 
USCCA, with whom I also have the privilege of being editor-at-
large for Concealed Carry Magazine.
    I'm also the author of ``Women's Handgun and Self-Defense 
Fundamentals,'' which was written, edited, and designed by 
women for women on their training journeys. More recently, I 
developed and authored, ``Children's Firearms and Safety 
Fundamentals,'' a curriculum designed to help equip parents, 
educators, and children with the knowledge needed to be safe 
around guns.
    As with all things in life, education is paramount. This 
isn't just about teaching firearms safety. It's about 
impressing on all of us how important it is to use good 
situational awareness and to avoid questionable or 
uncomfortable situations. It's about how to be prepared; how to 
consider and choose the best options, and how to live fiercely 
and safely each and every day.
    As a woman and a mother, I'm honored to be one of the 
leading instructors in the firearms industry. With this, I have 
witnessed firsthand a rich diversity, as scores of American 
women are purchasing, training with, and carrying firearms in 
the name of female empowerment. For many women, this self-
defense awakening has resulted in a new source of certainty, 
security, responsibility, and equality that we might not have 
otherwise had.
    For the women who walk across a dark parking lot every 
night after work; for the realtors who show houses to strangers 
every week; for any women who have shadows in their past, and 
for moms like me with children in tow, I think they would all 
agree: They refuse to stand by idle and helpless. They refuse 
to become someone's victim. They refuse to allow harm to come 
to those that they love.
    That's why I view the attempt to limit, or even 
criminalize, law-abiding citizens as antiproductive or 
dangerous, potentially carrying grave consequences for the 
safety of our families and our communities. The reality is 
violent criminals, many with evil intent, do exist and they are 
terrorizing us. It shouldn't be this way, but it serves as a 
clear reminder that law-abiding should be able to defend 
themselves from danger at all times. Any solution to better 
protect ourselves, our children, and our communities should 
start with our God-given right to self-defense.
    I can honestly say I'm a profoundly different woman and 
mother from the one I was before I decided to carry a firearm. 
I'm physically changed because of how I train; how I move 
through life, and how I carry, but I'm also emotionally changed 
because of the decisions I've made; situations I've 
contemplated, and obstacles I've overcome.
    The more I've trained, the more I've realized that I don't 
have to wait for someone else to care for me or protect me. I 
am my own protector, and I am my family's first and immediate 
responder. Being able to keep myself and those that I love 
safe, there is nothing more important than that.
    Today, I hope to be part of an open, respectful, and 
productive dialog about how we can empower and protect law-
abiding gun owners, especially the rising demographics of 
women.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify on this important 
topic.

                   STATEMENT OF RUTH M. GLENN

    Ms. Glenn. Thank you so much.
    Good afternoon, Chair Biggs, Ranking Member Jackson Lee, 
and Members of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and 
Federal Government Surveillance. Thank you for the opportunity 
to testify before you today.
    My name is Ruth M. Glenn, and I am the President of 
Survivor Justice Action, a national advocacy organization 
working to support, engage, and empower domestic violence 
survivors and their families, to prevent and end domestic 
violence in all its forms.
    I've been advocating for and with survivors of domestic 
violence for over 30 years. I am also a survivor of domestic 
violence and firearms violence.
    During my 13 years of marriage, a firearm was always 
present. It was used as a tool to frighten and control me and a 
reminder that, in a moment's notice, my life could end.
    Over 30 years ago when I left, my then-husband kidnapped me 
and held me at gunpoint for hours. Sadly, my experience is far 
from unusual. In our country, almost one in five women 
experience firearm threats from an abusive intimate partner.
    I have the opportunity of testifying before all of you 
today, but the reality is that I could have very well been 
another statistic. I could have been among the people murdered 
every seven hours by an intimate partner.
    Firearms are used in 50 percent of domestic violence-
related homicides. The simple presence of a gun in a domestic 
violence situation, regardless of who it belongs to, makes it 
five times more likely that a woman will be killed.
    After the kidnapping, my then-husband found and shot me 
three times. The first bullet went under my scalp; the others 
skipped off my forehead. I thought this couldn't be happening, 
and then, he shot me again in the arm. He left me for dead.
    The incident occurred while he was under a domestic 
violence protection order. At the time, that protection order 
did not keep him from possessing a gun. I did not have the 
benefit of protections that Congress passed in 1994 that have 
reduced domestic violence homicide rates.
    Recently, I joined survivors of domestic violence and gun 
violence outside the Supreme Court during oral arguments in the 
United States v. Rahimi case. Hundreds of us rallied and spoke 
to support the existence of domestic violence protection 
orders, which restrict those that are subject to those orders 
from possessing a firearm. These decades-old, bipartisan laws 
on the books help women stay alive.
    As domestic violence continues to plague our communities 
and disproportionately impact women, especially women of color, 
it is imperative that we recognize the added danger a gun 
presents. A woman is far more likely to be the victim of 
handgun homicide than to use a handgun in self-defense. A study 
found that, for every one time a woman used a handgun in self-
defense, 83 women were murdered by an intimate partner with a 
handgun.
    Congress has long recognized the deadly intersection 
between access to firearms and intimate partner homicide. If 
the laws, as written, were implemented, and fully enforced, 
intimate partner homicide could be reduced even further. States 
that have more comprehensive firearms laws have lower rates of 
intimate partner homicide.
    Congress can further invest in our country's efforts to end 
domestic violence in our lifetime by fully closing the dating 
and stalking loopholes; investing in funding ATF to enforce 
existing removal laws; funding research on intimate partner 
homicide and violence, and then, implementing universal 
background checks.
    Every survivor's story and path to safety is different. To 
the other witnesses on this panel, thank you so much for 
sharing your stories.
    For me, the presence of a gun tormented me and my son for 
many years--until it nearly claimed my life. Today, the 
traumatic experience continues to impact me, my son, and my 
community. The data overwhelmingly shows that the presence of a 
firearm significantly increases the chances that a victim of 
domestic violence will lose their life.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look 
forward to your questions.

    Now, Ms. Watral, you may begin your five minutes.

                  STATEMENT OF SHIRLEY WATRAL

    Ms. Watral. Thank you, Congressman Biggs, Ranking Member/
Congresswoman Jackson Lee, and Committee Members, for the 
opportunity to appear before you today and share my personal 
story.
    The following quote by an unknown author sums up my journey 
and what has brought me here today:

        One day you will tell your story of how you overcame what you 
        went through, and it will be someone else's survival guide.

    For 35 years, I was your average female who worked hard to 
become a successful businesswoman. Growing up, we did not have 
guns, and I was neither for nor against them. I built a career 
and a life I was proud of. Safety was never an issue for me 
because I thought ``it'' would never happen to me.
    Then, a man who said he loved me turned violent. He 
kidnapped me and held me for--and tortured me for 15 hours. I 
thought I was going to die that day.
    When he brought out a gun and set it on the bed, I saw it 
as my way to freedom. I could get it; I could defend myself, or 
the shot could be heard by the neighbors, and they'd call the 
police.
    I lunged for it. I pressed that trigger, but all I heard 
was my screams. The gun did not go off. I had been defeated. He 
had won.
    Now, I survived the beating, the biting, the whiplash, and 
being thrown around by my hair, and afterward, the restraining 
order I got did not stop him from stalking me or contacting me. 
The gated community I moved into, that did not stop him from 
gaining access and knowing exactly where I lived.
    He became desperate and wanted to kill me. Thank God, his 
plans to end my life were not successful. I started to mend 
physically, and it became apparent I was still not safe. The 
mental anguish I felt remained.
    Physical wounds of domestic violence eventually heal, but 
the invisible scars and never-ending threats which can only be 
felt by victims control their lives. For me, I escaped being a 
prisoner of his house, but I was still a hostage of fear. I was 
terrified to leave my house and afraid to live my life.
    This is what started my journey to firearms ownership. I 
walked into my first class scared, intimidated, and confused, 
and I left with newfound feelings of courage, strength, and 
confidence. I realized I could protect myself; I could be my 
own first responder.
    Millions of women are trying to reclaim their lives after 
living through terrorizing times like mine. We need to help 
domestic violence victims, encourage them to prepare to defend 
themselves. Stop telling them they are not capable of handling 
a firearm. Stop scaring them with a few statistics that only 
demoralizes them. Fund programs to offer training and arm these 
women. Above all, our right to ourself--our right to defend 
ourselves with our firearm.
    We recently witnessed citizens in Israel getting murdered 
in their homes. The Israeli government reacted by scrambling to 
arm their citizens. Why should it take an invasion or chancing 
another woman being abused or killed before our government does 
the same?
    The American people see the violence. They see the police 
being undermined and defunded by the same people pushing for 
gun control. They see the criminal justice system being lenient 
and almost sanctioning violence. They realizee no one is coming 
to save them.
    They have been buying firearms at a record pace over the 
past two years. Gun control policies like Red flag laws, gun-
free zones, and safe storage are not keeping people safe, and 
people want to be able to protect themselves and those they 
love.
    The difference between a safe sense of security and real 
security for me is my firearm. Help me and countless other 
women like me have the opportunity to protect themselves.
    The Second Amendment is vital to me. It made a difference 
in my life and how I live each day. We need to help the victims 
of domestic violence and preserve our Second Amendment for 
future generations. We need to stop penalizing responsible 
Americans and punish the killers and criminals that are making 
our communities dangerous.
    I am honored and thankful to be here representing millions 
of female gun owners and the organization Women for Gun Rights, 
where I serve as the Florida State Director.
    Thank you.

    Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Ms. Watral.
    Now, Ms. Solomon, you are recognized to give your five-
minute statement.

                  STATEMENT OF GENEVA SOLOMON

    Ms. Solomon. First, thank you, Chair Biggs and Ranking 
Member Ms. Jackson Lee, and the honorable Members of the 
Subcommittee.
    My name is Geneva Solomon and I'm deeply honored to testify 
before you today.
    My journey from victim to survivor to advocate has led me 
to this moment today, where I am compelled to share my story 
and advocate for empowering women through responsible firearm 
ownership.
    Imagine a childhood marked by emotional and verbal abuse, a 
place where your spirit is constantly torn down and your self-
worth is diminished. Then, you fast forward to a time when 
you've taken and broken free from that toxic childhood, earned 
a college degree, secured a great paying job, celebrated 
parenthood, and found love in a marriage.
    Yet, you find yourself trapped inside your own home, forced 
to endure relentless verbal abuse, physical assaults, and 
unspeakable amounts of violence--all while holding your 
precious toddler in your arms.
    This harrowing ordeal is not a mere nightmare; it's a sole-
crushing, demonizing reality that countless women endure, and 
I'm no exception. As a Black woman, this is not a matter of 
imagination; it was my lived experience.
    After summoning the courage to end my first marriage, the 
threats--those threats escalated, and I realized that I had to 
become my own first responder. Responsible--I was responsible 
for my safety and that of my child.
    With no prior knowledge of firearms, I embarked on a 
journey to explore firearm ownership as a means of self-
protection. Despite my experienced trauma throughout my life, 
and that journey at that time, my determination led me to 
research and educate myself on firearm ownership, and 
ultimately, becoming a registered firearm owner. Today, I 
proudly co-own Redstone Firearms in Burbank, California, which 
is the first Black-owned, brick-and-mortar firearms store in 
California.
    Gun ownership not only arms me with a physical tool, but it 
also gave me a profound sense of empowerment. It turned me into 
a woman who once was cowered in fear to someone who now stands 
tall, even in the face of adversity.
    In my role as a firearms store owner and educator, I've met 
countless women with stories like and more hectic than mine. 
Through education and proper training, they, too, discover 
their inner strength and realize that firearms, when handled 
responsibly, can be a tool of empowerment.
    When my current husband and I first started operating our 
FFL, we noticed the glaring gaps within the firearms world, 
especially among Black women. To address this, I created an 
educational program to introduce responsible firearm ownership 
to any beginner who sought to approach firearm ownership from 
an educational perspective. This initiative has empowered 
thousands, if not tens of thousands, across California, 
emphasizing that no one is coming to save you.
    The reality is there's a thirst for knowledge and 
empowerment, and it's happening in California big time. 
Redstone Firearms continues to educate those in Los Angeles and 
beyond on responsible firearm ownership and advocates for 
concealed carry rights in California.
    Through this passion, I have established a nonprofit 
organization that also focuses on women and other avenues of 
domestic violence like education, counseling, clothing, 
shelter, and safe spaces. However, despite these positive 
efforts, I stand before you today to express my grievances with 
continued gun control laws that are being proposed and even 
enacted in California. These rules disproportionately affect 
women, particularly, Black women, and will cost lives.
    In this opening today, I want to address a few 
perspectives. In California, regardless of the reason, a person 
must wait 10 days to obtain their firearm when done legally. 
Imagine having to wait 10 days while in fear of your life, 
wondering if the next moment will be your last. If the normal 
background check takes 10 days--and that's if it runs 
perfectly--but if it doesn't, it could take up to 30 days.
    There's also a statewide concealed carry issuance--there's 
no statewide standard for concealed carry issuance. In 
California, it allows each county to determine how that process 
will flow. So, you can find in more conservative areas that it 
can tend to take 45-60 miles. However, in liberal counties, it 
can take up to two years. This is after completing your 
education requirement and paying all those extreme fees.
    The cost of guns in California are far more expensive, and 
recently, our Governor enacted the sin tax. Who does that 
affect? Black women, all women--when they're just trying to 
protect themselves. These rules will have an unintended 
consequence that will disproportionately affect vulnerable 
populations, especially Black women.
    As I close on my remarks, I remain committed to helping all 
people who want to approach responsible firearm ownership, but 
I live the shared experience with women; my voice beats with 
them, but it screams for Black women.
    Thank you.

    Mr. Biggs. Thank you, Ms. Solomon, and thank you for your 
compelling testimony.
    We are now going to proceed under the five-minute rule with 
questions.
    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Moore.
    Mr. Moore. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Thanks to all the witnesses for being here today.
    I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Violent 
criminals don't care if you're Republican or Democrat, male or 
female. We should all be able to agree that owning a firearm 
puts you on better footing when it comes to defending yourself.
    I have two daughters and a wife. They all have concealed 
carries in Alabama, but they're here in D.C. a lot, and I don't 
want them to be caught in a situation where they cannot defend 
themselves, especially given the astronomical rise in violent 
crimes here in this city.
    Yet, D.C. is one of the hardest places to get a gun if you 
actually follow the law. It's not very hard for criminals, but 
it's very difficult for law-abiding citizens.
    So, Ms. Alcazar, I want to start my first question for you. 
What are the consequences for an individual's safety in areas 
with strict gun-control laws, like here in D.C.?
    Ms. Alcazar. Well, I can say from personal experience. I am 
someone that travels across the Nation. It is very 
disheartening to go from one State to the next, and then, not 
be able to have a tool for protection in that State because of 
their different laws.
    National reciprocity would be a huge win for us on that 
account because there are so many of us that do travel. Whether 
it's seeing family, whether it's a job requirement, or 
otherwise, I think that's a huge detriment to the law-abiding 
citizens, especially someone like me, as a mom who wants to 
make sure that the rest of my family is safe, no matter where 
we go.
    Mr. Moore. Let me compliment you. I appreciate you not 
playing the victim. I think that it was great that you took 
ownership and kind of say, hey, I'm going to defend my life and 
my children's lives as well.
    Ms. Watral, is that how you say that?
    In what ways might strict gun control laws inadvertently 
put women at disadvantages against an attack?
    Ms. Watral. Well, anytime you have a concealed carry and 
there's a waiting period, like Ms. Solomon mentioned, that 
waiting period, for me, when I didn't have a concealed carry 
license and when that person was trying to kill me. The waiting 
period to take the class was very detrimental. I didn't know if 
I was going to make it because I had no way to defend myself.
    I understand criminals have a way of getting a gun and 
breaking the law. My abuser was going to do the ultimate; he 
wanted to kill me. He actually was trying to buy plastic 
explosives, which are illegal, and I had no way to defend 
myself. I didn't have a concealed carry weapons license. I 
lived each day wondering if that would be the last day.
    So, the laws need to empower the victims. Because the ones 
that are trying to control the abuser are not working. The 
restraining order does not work. Red flag laws do nothing, it 
caused me more of a problem, because anyone that wants to 
disarm me can with no valid reason.
    Mr. Moore. Ms. Solomon, I'll ask you this question. How can 
a firearm be a deterrent for a potential attacker?
    Ms. Solomon. If you, as a woman, as a trained woman, and 
you have a firearm, it de-escalates the situation. If you are 
trained responsibly, you will understand that the firearm only 
comes out and is used as a last resort.
    So, that's why we talk about responsible firearm ownership. 
I'm just going to use this firearm to threaten. This is to 
empower yourself. This is to protect yourself in the event they 
want to harm and kill you.
    Mr. Moore. I've often asked--if there was a gun law that we 
could pass that would actually do away with gun violence, I'm 
sure we would all agree to pass it. Usually, it just makes 
everybody victims who are actually law-abiding citizens.
    So, I thank you, again, to all the witnesses, for being 
here.
    With that, Mr. Chair, I'll yield back.
    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. 
McBath.
    Ms. McBath. Thank you so much, Chair Biggs. Thank you, 
Ranking Member Jackson Lee, for deferring to me.
    Thank you, each and every one of our witnesses that is here 
today.
    I want to offer you just my heartfelt--I'm just really, 
really sorry for everything that you've suffered by. I'm 
listening to your stories, and you're right, I cannot imagine. 
Thank you so much for sharing those stories with us.
    I would like to say that empowering women includes, also, 
protecting women. Protecting women means providing them the 
necessary tools to make them safe, to keep them safe--tools 
like extreme risk protection orders, which empower law 
enforcement and loved ones to prevent violence involving a gun 
when an individual appears to be in crisis or has symptoms of 
experiencing crisis. Protecting women means closing the 
boyfriend loopholes and preventing intimate partners from 
possessing a firearm when they have a history of dangerous 
behavior.
    I came to Congress after my son was murdered with a gun 
with one clear goal in mind: Keep the American people safe and 
decrease the risk of death by firearms, especially for those in 
abusive situations.
    An already violent situation might turn fatal in an 
instant. The chance of dying at the hands of an abuser doubles 
when a gun is in the house. It doubles. Nine hundred and 
seventy women are killed yearly by men with firearms, and there 
are one million women alive today who have reported being shot 
at or shot at by intimate partners.
    So, my heart goes out to every single woman. As I said, ``I 
cannot even imagine the horror that you have lived with,'' the 
trauma that you continue to live with. My heart goes out to you 
and the child that also has been impacted by the domestic 
violence, because our children and our families are impacted as 
well. I thank you for coming here today to share your stories.
    I do want to say that abusers should not have access to 
firearms, plain and simple. If someone has a history of abusive 
and violent behavior, the very least that we can do in this 
Congress is make it harder for them to obtain those firearms 
and those weapons that they might use to harm their victims.
    Ms. Glenn, my question is for you. Thank you so much for 
speaking with us today and for sharing your story.
    In your testimony, you mention that the presence of a 
firearm in a domestic violence situation significantly 
increases the risk of lethal outcomes. What are some 
alternative approaches that you believe could better protect 
women in abusive relationships that do not rely solely on the 
use of a gun or gun ownership?
    Ms. Glenn. Thank you, Representative McBath.
    There are solutions to having a firearm present in the home 
or in the situation. I would suggest that we have other means 
by which we can protect women other than having a firearm and 
having it accessible.
    We can work on the dating and stalking boyfriend loop, the 
loopholes. We can talk about prevention by supporting having 
Congress support Delta and the rape intervention strategies 
that we've employed.
    There are many other solutions. What I'd like to point out 
is that the solution is limiting access to the firearm, whether 
it's in the hands of the victim of domestic violence or whether 
it's as someone who is abusive, it belonging to them. So, the 
solution is really limiting access.
    Ms. McBath. Well, thank you very much.
    We've had before our Crime Subcommittee many individuals 
that have suffered from atrocious abuse by violence. So, I want 
to thank the Ranking Member. I would like to thank the Chair 
for this, for this hearing today.
    I am committed to, like many of my colleagues, trying to 
make sure that we are passing policy that protects and supports 
all human life.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Biggs. The gentlelady yields back.
    I recognize the Chair for the entire Committee, Mr. Jordan, 
the gentleman from Ohio.
    Chair Jordan. I thank the Chair, and thank you for this 
hearing.
    I also want to thank our witnesses for their testimony and 
for their courage.
    Mr. Chair, I would yield the balance of my time to the 
gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hunt.
    Mr. Hunt. Thank you, Chair.
    This is not a liberal issue; this is not a conservative 
issue. The rights of women to defend themselves is a public 
safety issue. It's a constitutional issue. It's a human rights 
issue.
    Why is gun ownership among women on the rise today? Women 
have to arm themselves because the left has made it their 
personal crusade to disarm police, embolden criminals, and make 
American cities less safe.
    How, is the left making American cities less safe? Quite 
frankly, I think it's a very simple plan and it's done 
intentionally.

    Step 1. Defend the police.
    Step 2. Enact procriminal policies.
    Step 3. Open borders.
    Step 4. Take away your constitutional right to defend 
yourselves and your family.

    What is the end result? It is absolute chaos. We've seen it 
for the past few years.
    When public safety collapses, who bears the brunt of it? 
It's women and children.
    The left has created this dangerous environment in American 
cities, and now, they want to take away women's last line of 
defense, and that is gun ownership.
    I've read countless stories across the country of 
courageous acts of self-defense where women have saved their 
lives with a firearm when attacked by a man much stronger than 
they are. This is something that I take personally in the State 
of Texas.
    In June this year, a pregnant woman in Houston was simply 
pumping gas into her car when a suspicious man approached her 
and demanded her purse. She drew her legally concealed firearm 
on this man, and he fled immediately.
    The gun is the great equalizer against dangerous predators, 
and oftentimes, the last line of defense for women when it 
comes to protecting themselves and their children.
    This story would have ended much differently in D.C., and 
other Democrat-run cities. In liberal cities, only criminals 
have guns because the left is too busy disarming law-abiding 
citizens like yourselves.
    Let's recap this. The past few years, the left has focused 
on defunding the police; passing procriminal policies; opening 
the border and taking away your Constitutional rights to bear 
arms.
    Ms. Solomon, thank you for being here, ma'am. You're 
absolutely wonderful.
    You're probably aware that there has been an 87 percent 
increase in gun ownership among Black women. Black women are 
the fastest-growing groups of gun owners in the entire country. 
I wonder why. Because of these Black women live in Democrat-run 
cities with liberal policies. There are people like you, ma'am, 
who have every right to purchase and own firearm for your own 
defense.
    Women have also described your issues with domestic 
violence. I'm so sorry to hear that. I have a four- and three-
year-old daughter at my home. We are armed at my home, and they 
will learn how to responsibly carry firearms to prevent this 
from happening to them at some point in the future.
    It's devastating. We've got to put an end to it--but not by 
disarming you.
    Ms. Solomon, unfortunately, ma'am, I've got some bad news 
for you. Your gun shop happens to located in the People's 
Republic of China--I mean California. Your Governor and your 
State legislature are probably not big fans of people like you.
    If you don't mind, ma'am, could you please discuss with me 
some of the radical gun control laws that California has 
enacted to hurt your business?
    Ms. Solomon. Absolutely. Thank you. I wanted to get to that 
in my opening statement.
    We, California, had a big win when the Supreme Court 
allowed and opened concealed carry in California. Before, it 
was very subjective and not objective. It was a matter of 
knowing that county's particular--you had to be in that 
person's pocket, so to speak, or have a friendship. So, it was 
just cause. It wasn't if you passed the background check.
    We found that those in liberal counties can never get a 
concealed carry weapons permit, but those in conservative 
counties, sure. Then, you have to look at who lives there. Who 
lives in Orange County? Then, who lives in Los Angeles County?
    Then, you have your 10-day waiting period. OK, well, yes, 
there is a restraining order that can be issued in 24 hours, 
but what about that woman who went and bought a firearm and had 
to now wait nine more days?
    Or sin tax. When a woman is just moving away, she might 
have to flee with nothing. So, California already has the most 
highest cost of a firearm in the Nation, and now, you want to 
go and add in a 20 percent tax.
    Mr. Hunt. One last question before I run out of time. 
Really quick, how many people are purchasing guns that look 
like you and me?
    Ms. Solomon. Eighty-seven percent more.
    Mr. Hunt. You've got it, ma'am.
    Thank you so much for being here. God bless you, and I 
really appreciate it.
    Yes, I yield the rest of my time.
    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair recognizes the Ranking Member of the entire 
Committee, Mr. Nadler.
    Mr. Nadler. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Ms. Glenn, you are here to share your personal story and on 
behalf of your organization, Survivor Justice Action, which 
works with thousands of survivors of domestic violence and 
their families. You previously served as the President of the 
National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
    Based on your many years working with survivors, what do 
they need from Congress or others to get to safety, remain 
safe, and heal from their experience?
    Ms. Glenn. Thank you, Representative Nadler.
    I would suggest that they need not to be in the presence of 
a firearm. That would be first.
    Second, there are so many other actions that Congress can 
take to ensure that domestic violence victims and survivors 
have what they need to remain safe.
    One of the things that I'd like to have us remember, as 
we're talking about this, is that many times domestic violence 
abusers do not have a criminal record. That's really important 
to remember because the premise is that, if we allow criminals 
to have firearms, then we're at risk.
    I go back to prevention. I apologize. I go back to 
prevention. What we need to be talking about is, how do we 
empower young women and young men to understand that domestic 
violence is not OK; and that we need to put measures in place 
that prevent domestic violence, so that we never have to have 
this conversation. I and the other witnesses would never have 
experienced what we've experienced. One of the things that is 
lacking and needs to be addressed is prevention of domestic 
violence.
    Mr. Nadler. Thank you.
    Ms. Glenn, some have expressed a very bleak view of the 
world for women, where they cannot rely on family, their 
communities, law enforcement, or others for help. Is this true? 
How can women who are experiencing abuse right now be connected 
with people who can help them?
    Ms. Glenn. Very easily through the National Domestic 
Violence Hotline, for instance. They can more readily get 
protection orders that do provide them, yet another barrier to 
safety.
    I think that we need to be talking about more immediate and 
ready protections for those that are experiencing violence 
versus what might be the waiting for a firearm, for instance. 
The quicker that we remove victims from that type of danger, 
the safer they are.
    Mr. Nadler. Thank you.
    Ms. Glenn, a recent study found that, roughly, one in seven 
women had experienced nonfatal abuse with a firearm by an 
intimate partner, including being shot at or threatened with a 
firearm. Do you believe these women would be safer if they had 
a firearm?
    Ms. Glenn. I do not. Because I still go back to, and the 
data shows, that the mere presence of a firearm makes it five 
times more likely that a woman will be killed; a woman will be 
killed in those situations.
    Mr. Nadler. Thank you.
    Ms. Glenn, researchers found that 68 percent of mass 
shootings involved either the killing of a family member or 
intimate partner, or that the shooter had a history of domestic 
violence. How do domestic violence restraining orders promote 
the safety of those experiencing abuse, as well as promote 
public safety?
    Ms. Glenn. I would suggest that the piece of paper itself 
is not protection. Absolutely, I could attest to many survivors 
who've been informed by their abusive person that it's a piece 
of paper. What I would suggest is the protection order allows 
for the documentation of that abuse and ensures that, for 
instance, if the survivor is seeking out other types of safety, 
that they have the protection order of a document that shows 
that there's been that abuse.
    Mr. Nadler. Thank you.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Nadler. The gentleman yields back.
    The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Nehls.
    Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Thank you, ladies, for being here.
    For those watching at home, I want to be clear about what 
this is about. Joe Biden wants to take your guns. He does. He 
wants to infringe on your Second Amendment rights. He wants to 
strip you of the ability to protect your family, your 
community, and your country.
    It's dangerous; it's unconstitutional, and it does nothing 
to address crime. Criminals will still have guns long after 
law-abiding citizens don't.
    I'd like to turn your attention to an incident that 
happened in June near my district in Houston. Play the clip. 
This is what Mr. Hunt was referenced.
    [Video played.]
    We don't have audio, but you see this knucklehead here and 
he's in the gray truck. He gets up there, and he, obviously, 
has a pistol. There's a pregnant woman standing there with her 
husband. This guy gets a little bit bold. Look at it. He points 
the gun; he's going to try to rob them.
    He goes across. He approaches them, pistol whips the man, 
the husband, and the woman gets out and she shoots him; pulls 
out her pistol and shoots him--not only protecting herself, but 
protecting her husband and her unborn child.
    Unfortunately, the suspect was taken to the hospital, where 
he survived. I wish she would have been a better shot; it would 
have reduced recidivism. Because guys like this get back out on 
the streets. They get back out on the streets. They'll do the 
same damn thing.
    I think you've seen a rise in gun sales because the 
American people truly understand that they always can't count 
on the government to protect them.
    I served in law enforcement for 30 years. I was the sheriff 
of a very large county. I've been to several, several 
homicides, several of them related to domestic abuse, several 
of them where their husbands went out there and just brutally 
murdered the entire family.
    There are times I reflect, now, and I say to myself maybe I 
wish that mother, that woman who could have received training 
and been a responsible gun owner, would have had an opportunity 
to protect her children and herself from that husband, the 
boyfriend, and the numerous other women that were just brutally 
murdered by just criminals.
    Now, many of these guys may have had some mental health 
issues. I got it. They had nothing there to protect themselves. 
If they had something such as a firearm, maybe they would be 
able to talk to us today.
    Ms. Solomon, as a former lawman, we carry guns every day. I 
can tell you there's not a law enforcement officer in the 
country today that wakes up and says, ``I want to go out and 
legally kill somebody.''
    What do you think that woman was thinking after she was out 
there; she points a gun and shoots that guy? How will that 
affect her for the rest of her life? What do you think she's 
thinking, thinking about her mental health? How do you think 
that will affect her for the rest of her life?
    Ms. Solomon. I definitely do believe that she didn't wake 
up that day and say I wanted to kill anybody.
    Mr. Nehls. Right.
    Ms. Solomon. She will feel empowered that she was able to 
save herself and her husband or whoever that was, her family 
member, but she will have access to get better and over that 
and eventually still carry a firearm. She will feel empowered. 
I believe she was pregnant. So, it is going to empower her and 
that child that comes into the world that they're not a victim.
    Mr. Nehls. She should be here sharing her story as well one 
day, talking about how that weapon saved her life. Maybe 
looking at her training, how did she acquire that and what type 
of training? Did she become proficient at it? We have a lot of 
people that want to carry a gun, but they don't go through that 
training. I would encourage everybody, at least get proficient 
with that firearm so you know how to use it.
    Ms. Watral, you mentioned in your testimony that several 
major cities who have adopted some of the strictest gun control 
laws in the country remain unsafe still today. Do you think 
more gun control laws would have prevented that suspect in the 
video from illegally obtaining a gun?
    Ms. Watral. No. Criminals are going to get a firearm 
whether it is against the law or not. They don't care how many 
laws they break.
    When I carry, I carry to save a life, my life, not to take 
a life. So, when someone has faced a situation where they have 
to defend themselves and take a life, I am sure it is very hard 
to accept that, but they are very happy because they are here 
to talk about it.
    Mr. Nehls. Thank you. Ms. Glenn, would you agree? Chicago 
has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. They 
are out there. Red Flag laws. You can't have a concealed weapon 
without a permit, background checks, and lock and store the 
guns.
    They have the strictest, yet they have gun violence up 
through the moon. There were over 2,800 shootings in Chicago 
last year; 1,300 in LA; and 1,200 in New York. I am telling you 
right now, Tommy Turd does not care about gun laws. They're 
going to have them. It will just affect the law-abiding 
citizen.
    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman's time has expired. You may answer 
the question if you wish.
    Ms. Glenn. I don't have the expertise. I am not here on the 
expertise about gun laws in those cities. What I am here about 
is how do we ensure that those that are abusive do not have 
access to a firearm in which a woman can be killed.
    Mr. Biggs. The Chair recognizes the gentlelady from 
Pennsylvania, Ms. Dean.
    Ms. Dean. I thank the Chair and the Ranking lady. I thank 
you very, very much Ranking Member. To all our witnesses today, 
I have to say I am in awe of your courage, testimony, and 
willingness to bring your experiences here to us so we can 
craft better policy.
    I can't imagine how difficult it is to talk about the 
painful experiences you endured, in some cases year after year, 
day after day, especially Ms. Solomon, Ms. Glenn, and Ms. 
Watral. I thank you, Ms. Alcazar, for bringing your perspective 
and your courage and strength.
    Still, I want to focus on the facts. We have to focus on 
the data. We have to focus on the facts if we're going to save 
lives.
    I couldn't help but think of the many women. On average 70 
women a month who can't speak before us, as you have so 
courageously, because their abusers used a gun to murder them. 
Our laws failed to protect these women. We, as lawmakers, 
failed to protect them when we knew that access to a gun makes 
an abuser, and we have heard this statistic, but we really have 
to focus on it. It makes an abuser five times more likely to 
kill his female partner.
    We also know that when an abused woman purchases a gun for 
protection, or if there is another gun in the house for 
whatever reason, statistically speaking the risk that her 
partner will kill her doubles, five times and two times.
    That's why we have to be serious. We have to be honest. We 
can't spout the lies that we've heard on the other side. On the 
other side, we've actually had hearings where we don't want to 
defund the police. They want to defund and disband ATF. Imagine 
that. They don't want us chasing down criminals.
    So, we can't turn away from these alarming facts. Ms. 
Glenn, as a survivor yourself, what does the premise, and you 
talked about actually going out before the Supreme Court, what 
does the premise of the Rahimi case mean to you, in other words 
that a man--the holding is that a man subject to a domestic 
violence restraining order should nevertheless be able to hold 
a gun? What does that mean to you?
    Ms. Glenn. Thank you so much for that question. The premise 
being that if I am a survivor or a victim of domestic violence, 
and I am expected that--or I expect that a domestic violence 
protection order is going to protect me, how come I am not 
protected from the very thing that will cause me harm, which is 
the firearm?
    Ms. Dean. Well said.
    Ms. Glenn. It is very, very troubling, the access that 
abusive person may have to that firearm, even if I am under 
protection order, is removed.
    Ms. Dean. Well said. Ms. Solomon, again, thank you for your 
courage to defend yourself and your child. I cannot imagine 
what you have gone through, and how that really inspired you to 
be different, to start a business in this same area.
    I really honor the way you keep talking about responsible 
gun ownership. That is what we want in this country. We don't 
want to take everybody's gun away, but we want responsible gun 
ownership, and we want those who shouldn't possess a gun not to 
possess it.
    I will talk about your business for just a moment. I was 
concerned to learn that your business received Demand 2 letters 
from the ATF two years in a row, I believe, both in 2022 and in 
2023. For those who don't know, Demand 2 is a program, a 
requirement, under the Department of Justice ATF that helps 
local and State law enforcement trace crime guns.
    Currently, gun dealers are added to the program if they 
have had 25 or more guns traced to their dealership with a time 
to crime--I know you're familiar with this--which is the period 
between the initial sale of the gun and the recovery of the 
crime, three years or less.
    I want to be absolutely clear. You're getting those letters 
and requiring you to participate in the program does not mean 
you've done anything wrong, but it is unusual. Only about three 
percent of FFLs are subject to that program, the Demand 2 
program.
    So, I would like to talk to you about solutions. You are 
intimately close-up with the sale, the transaction, and the 
training. You know that many of these guns that have been sold 
through your FFL have been traced to crimes. You must be 
thinking about the solutions.
    What are some of the solutions, other than I know why 
people are here today to say arm more women, what are some of 
the other solutions to prevent gun violence and to prevent guns 
getting into the hands of criminals?
    Ms. Solomon. The one thing that we have to address is that 
people within the African American or Black community for years 
in hundreds of years have been starving for firearms education.
    Recently, with my work that I have been doing alongside my 
husband at Redstone Firearms is education. We have only been 
doing this for seven years alongside the National African 
American Gun Association.
    Our organization needs support to continue to get the 
education out there because approaching firearm ownership from 
an uneducated perspective when we have been starved of that 
education, you're going to end up with things like that.
    So, we are teaching education, and we support it. Our 
mission is to consult, educate, and train.
    Ms. Dean. Let me ask you about--
    Mr. Biggs. I am sorry. Your time has expired.
    Ms. Dean. Oh, I apologize. I didn't realize. I apologize.
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. No problem. The Chair now recognizes 
the gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Dean. Ms. Lee, Ms. Lee, sorry. 
I apologize.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you to each of the 
brave women here today representing your organizations for 
sharing your stories to help inform us as a Committee and, 
also, to empower other women.
    I will always fight to protect the Constitutional rights of 
law-abiding gun owners. Women who are trained how to properly 
own and safely shoot a firearm are not just gaining a tactical 
skill. A woman with a firearm who is trained and understands 
how to use it has a line of defense against a home invader, a 
dangerous partner or just any random act of violence.
    As we have seen from our victims of violent crime hearings 
here in the Judiciary Committee, cities like Chicago, New York, 
and even Washington, DC, are facing rampant rising violent 
crime rates. So, it is important as ever for us all to be 
empowered and to be prepared.
    Women across the Nation have the ability to defend 
themselves, their children, and their families. When we empower 
women in self-defense, we all benefit.
    I am especially proud to have Ms. Shirley Watral here today 
with us. As we've heard, she holds many titles as a firearms 
instructor, an author, and is my fellow Floridian. So, thank 
you for being here today to share with us your testimony and 
your insight.
    I would like to start here. Earlier during our hearing, Ms. 
Glenn testified about the significance of injunctions or 
protection orders and, also, hotlines as tools for survivors to 
escape abusive situations. I agree those are important tools. I 
would like to hear your perspective on whether those tools are 
adequate or whether we need to be further empowering women to 
protect themselves and their families.
    Ms. Watral. Thank you, Congresswoman. Speaking from my 
experience, my restraining order did not stop my abuser. The 
restraining order, as has been said many times, ``is a piece of 
paper.'' It is just for the record. So, that piece of paper is 
not going to keep me safe.
    So, I have to learn and figure out a way to defend myself. 
Like I said, there were plenty of times I knew that this person 
was trying to kill me. I had to depend on law enforcement. What 
if they didn't know what he was doing or where he was? Who was 
going to come save me but me? That's why I carry. I carry 
because my life is important to me now.
    I am going to also share; my first firearm's class wasn't 
just about learning to protect myself. It changed me 
internally, who I was, how I acted, who I engaged with, and how 
I let people treat me, and that is more important. I think a 
key to putting an end to domestic violence is empowering our 
young women, so they don't accept unacceptable behavior. They 
start understanding that their life is worth something more 
than what someone else is trying to tell you.
    Ms. Lee. On that subject, how is it that you believe 
firearm ownership, in particular, helps contribute to the 
concept of gender equality when it comes to self-defense?
    Ms. Watral. Well, once again, I will share from my 
experience. When I was trying to fight my way out of being held 
hostage in my abuser's home, I could not overpower him. There 
was nothing I did--I tried everything that I knew, and 
everything failed.
    My only goal when he brought that firearm, that was going 
to be my salvation and my freedom. I was either going to defend 
myself or alert the neighbors. To my disappointment, the gun 
did not go off.
    So, I think it is very important, and it is very important 
to me, to be able to defend myself. My equalizer I choose is a 
firearm.
    Ms. Lee. Another thing that you've touched on is the 
concept of abusers and repeat offenders getting back out on the 
street or not being held to account for their crimes. Tell us, 
if you would, how soft on crime policies that allow those 
repeat offenders or abusers to remain at large and at liberty 
are endangering women and how you have seen that affect women 
in America.
    Ms. Watral. Just based on the media, that I hear there are 
so many times that an offender, a criminal, is out on the 
streets with hardly any bail. They are repeat offenders. If 
they are repeat offenders, that means they are going to commit 
the violent crime that they have already been doing.
    So, if we put them and make them accountable for their 
crimes, that puts them--it makes our community safer. Women 
need to feel that the government is behind them.
    If I am going to put myself out there, and I am going to go 
to court against my abuser, I want to know that the government 
is going to be there behind me and make sure that he does his 
time. That early dismissal, that he can come out and threaten 
me some more, I want to know the government is there and is 
going to stop him from doing that.
    Ms. Lee. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes the 
gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like 
to recognize the folks who are here from Moms Demand Action. 
Thank you all for being here.
    You all want to see Congress do something to prevent the 
kind of situation where we have to teach our children, our 
young girls, that before you can be respected you have got to 
have a gun.
    They want a world where you don't have to--where you don't 
train your boys to say that the mark of being a man is to have 
a gun; and have a bigger gun than the guy next door to you. 
They want a world of commonsense gun reform.
    We're having this hearing today; Republicans have been in 
control of Congress since January 3rd of this year. It took 
them 15 rounds of decisionmaking and voting to elect a speaker 
and then nine months later, after having done absolutely 
nothing during the 9-months, they got rid of the speaker and 
elected a new speaker.
    Now, we have a new speaker. Instead of doing something to 
improve the lives of the American people, we are sitting here 
today at a hearing showing a doctored video. You can't trust 
these videos that they put up on the screen with the super 
predator shooting somebody. You know, all these kinds of 
subliminal messaging that they're doing, you can't trust these 
videos that they're putting out there because you didn't even 
see the whole thing.
    What happened, what was it really that happened? Then what 
has happened since then? Was anybody held accountable for 
shooting anybody? Was it justified or not? You don't know those 
things, but you stand up here and grandstand on a perhaps 
doctored video.
    This is a hearing where there is not a single policy 
proposal that we're discussing. It is just simply a title, 
Second Amendment Rights Empower Women's Rights. Well, I tell 
you, we need to--I don't want to see women's rights empowered 
by women going into a doctor's office demanding an abortion at 
gunpoint. I don't want to see a society like that. There has 
got to be a better way for human beings to exist on this planet 
and know how to live together.
    Let me ask this question, Ms. Watral. You said earlier that 
rather than control the aggressor, we should be focusing on gun 
laws that empower the victim. Do you think that laws that 
prohibit possession of firearms by people convicted of domestic 
violence, do you think that those laws are OK to prevent such 
people, convicted people, from owning firearms?
    Ms. Watral. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. I am 
here--
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Is it yes or no?
    Ms. Watral. Excuse me?
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Yes or no. Do you think that those 
laws are good, good laws?
    Ms. Watral. I am here speaking as a victim of domestic 
violence.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I will take then that my time is 
running that you don't support those laws. Do you support laws 
that would keep firearms out of the hands of people convicted 
of domestic violence, Ms. Solomon?
    Ms. Solomon. I am here to talk about empowering women.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. So, you're not going to answer the 
question either? How about you, Ms. Alcazar?
    Ms. Alcazar. I would agree--
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Do you support those laws?
    Ms. Alcazar. I would agree with my fellow witnesses that 
we're here to talk about empowering women.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. OK. All right.
    Ms. Alcazar. Instead of talking about the things that we 
can take away from women--
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Don't you think that it empowers 
women when--
    Ms. Alcazar. --to take away?
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. --people who have been convicted of 
domestic violence are not allowed to own firearms? Doesn't that 
help?
    Ms. Alcazar. I think it empowers women--the definition of 
empowerment is what we all need to focus on right here, right 
now because empowering--
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Let me ask this question--
    Ms. Alcazar. --is not taking away.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. --let me ask this question of Ms. 
Glenn, because Ms. Alcazar you're not answering my question.
    Ms. Alcazar. Empowering is giving and providing information 
and providing education.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. I control my time. Ms. Glenn, do 
you support laws that would keep firearms out of the hands of 
persons convicted of domestic violence and those under 
restraining orders?
    Ms. Glenn. Absolutely.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Why?
    Ms. Glenn. Because the presence of a firearm, and the 
danger that it represents for victims and survivors of domestic 
violence. No matter who the firearm belongs to, the data shows 
that it is five times more likely to have a woman killed when 
there is a firearm present.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. Mr. Chair,--
    Mr. Biggs. The gentleman's time has expired.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. --I'd last like to offer this 
article, ``Red States Have Higher Gun Death Rates Than Blue 
States and Here's Why.'' I would like to offer this for the 
record.
    Mr. Biggs. Without objection.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Biggs. The Chair recognizes the gentlelady from Texas, 
the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Ms. Jackson 
Lee.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I am very 
happy to be able to welcome the witnesses here and listen to my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
    I really find no reason for us to be here today because 
none of us should be in disagreement of empowering women and 
choosing the basis of the empowerment that they would utilize 
to be safe.
    I think it is important for women to be empowered. We need 
to respect the individual rights while also addressing the 
urgent need for responsive regulation, a concept that is very 
clear prior to the politicalization of the Supreme Court of the 
United States. We can do both.
    For obvious reasons, I have been a strong proponent of 
women's empowerment. If there are women who feel empowered by 
responsible safe firearm ownership, that is certainly their 
prerogative, and I respect their decision.
    On the other hand, women who have a different perspective 
should also be safe with the kinds of gun laws that will 
provide them safety, common sense gun laws. Certainly, in a 
domestic violence situation, their abusers should not have a 
gun to be able to use against them.
    I can never talk about this issue without mentioning 
Sergeant Preston in Houston, Texas, who enforces in his life--
he is now deceased--that domestic violence calls are some of 
the most dangerous calls that are ever made. He lost his life 
protecting a mother and son. They lived, but he died, answering 
a domestic violence call. I always want to pay tribute to 
Sergeant Preston.
    I also want to put into the record, Mr. Chair, an amicus 
brief led by the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, 
signed by 151 representatives, and 18 Senators filed in U.S. v. 
Rahimi and just take one quote that I think is important. ``The 
only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is 
the presence of a gun.'' So, we know that--
    Mr. Biggs. Without objection.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. I thank you. We know that we have to be 
safe when we talk about gun use. Let me put into the record as 
well some statistics that are important as I begin to ask my 
questions.
    Just having access to a firearm makes an abuser five times 
more likely to take their partner's life. Over the last decade 
gun homicides by intimate partners jumped 58 percent, and the 
pandemic was an especially lethal period for abuse victims.
    Gun homicides involving intimate partners rose a stunning 
25 percent in 2020, compared with the previous year to the 
highest level in almost three decades. In that year, women 
accounted for more than two-thirds of the victims shot and 
killed by intimate partners.
    In 2021, researchers reported that more than two-thirds of 
recent mass shootings were involved with perpetrators who have 
killed partners or relatives who had a history of domestic 
abuse.
    So, we have to find a balance here. So, what I would--the 
first question I want to ask all of you, is gun storage a good 
common ground that we all can support, storing one's guns? Ms. 
Solomon?
    Ms. Solomon. I believe we all can agree that guns should be 
stored when not in use.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. Ms. Watral?
    Ms. Watral. I also agree with Ms. Solomon, but I also 
believe they have to be accessible. If I am going to have a 
firearm in my home--
    Ms. Jackson Lee. You believe that storage is good. Thank 
you. Ms. Glenn?
    Ms. Glenn. Absolutely.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. Ms. Alcazar? We know they have to be 
accessible. You have children, so do you believe in good 
storage structure?
    Ms. Alcazar. Storage is only part of the education and 
training that we would do for only part.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. It is included in it. I appreciate your 
response. Let me also indicate that I have a letter from the 
Jewish Women International that I would like to have submitted 
into the record.
    Mr. Biggs. Without objection.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. I would also like to, acknowledge the Moms 
Demand Action for your leadership.
    I think what I would like to conclude on is I believe in 
empowering women. I believe any hearing that would suggest that 
any difference between protecting domestic violence victims is 
untoward and incorrect.
    I do want to leave a topic that is somewhat related about 
empowering women, and I have paid tribute to her and 
acknowledged here. That is the horrific reproductive rights 
legislation that we have in Texas that has allowed an innocent 
mother of 31 years old to actually flee our State to be able to 
save her life and to be able to have additional children. That 
is Kate Cox. So, when we talk about empowering women, we need 
to talk about all issues.
    Ms. Glenn, I am very pleased to see your leadership on 
these issues, but I want to make sure that your leadership is 
not diminished. You want to train women, but you want to make 
sure that people know that a gun can be very detrimental.
    I guess as I close, so can detrimental reproductive denial 
that would allow a young woman or force her to flee and to 
prosecute, prosecute innocent medical providers who are simply 
trying to save lives. We should not prosecute anyone for trying 
to save lives. With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Biggs. The gentlelady yields back. I recognize myself 
for five minutes. I will begin first with just two points here.
    Part of the reason that you have this problem is the 
prosecutor is not prosecuting. They are letting people out on 
DVs, or domestic violence, particularly misdemeanor charges, 
and they let criminals back on the streets. That is a problem. 
I used to be a prosecutor who prosecuted domestic violence 
cases.
    I want to go now to the testimony that you--the written 
testimony, Ms. Alcazar. In your opening statement, you said the 
reality is that violent criminals, many with evil intent, do 
exist and are terrorizing us today. I want to be a part of a 
respectful, productive dialog about how we can empower and 
protect law-abiding gun owners, especially the rising 
demographic of women.
    Briefly, can you tell us what you think empowers women who 
potentially could be victims of domestic violence?
    Ms. Alcazar. Yes. Thank you very much for the question. 
Just to summarize what I had intended to say earlier, it seems 
like we have a very big problem with the definition of 
empowerment here because we keep hearing these ideas that, and 
I quote, ``we failed to protect them.'' We protect her. We 
protect them. It is not about--that is not empowerment if 
someone is failing to protect us.
    It is not their job to give us something or take away 
something or influence us in that way. To empower us means to 
allow us, enable us, and affect us in positive ways. To empower 
women in this specific environment with the Second Amendment is 
not take away their options or say we failed in protecting 
them. It is saying, you know what? You protect you, and we 
support that.
    One way to do that is the firearm. The gun is never the 
solution. It is an option. It is a protected option that anyone 
should be able to have if she so chooses so. Along with that 
empowerment comes the training and the resources and the 
commitment to make that decision for themselves.
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. I think Ms. Solomon, I am on you. You 
said in your statement, you talked about this, I realized that 
I had to become my own first responder, responsible for my 
safety and that of my child. Please talk to us about that in 
relationship to empowerment.
    Ms. Solomon. I always tell people; do you know how long 90 
seconds is? Ninty seconds is being generous when we talk about 
law enforcement responding. We hear that domestic violence is 
the most dangerous call. So, in those 90 seconds if you don't 
have a firearm and you do not want to fight one or two 
attackers as a woman, that is a very long time.
    So, empowering yourself to be able to live and empowering 
your child is a God given right.
    Mr. Biggs. I appreciate that. You're right, 90 seconds can 
feel like a long time. Quite frankly where I live, the response 
time is closer to 12-15 minutes.
    Ms. Watral, you said, ``the criminal mind doesn't care 
about how many laws they break.'' Their focus is on finding a 
place with the least amount of resistance where they can cause 
the most death and destruction.
    Please tell us how the Second Amendment empowers you to 
counter people with malevolent criminal intentions.
    Ms. Watral. Well, the way to summarize it is, the only way 
to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun, someone 
that has the experience and has the knowledge of how to handle 
a firearm.
    When these mass killings come up, and criminals are looking 
for least resistance and doing the most damage, there is not 
any law that I think they would ever say, oh, I shouldn't do 
that because I am not allowed to have a firearm.
    They've already made that decision. They're already broken 
the ultimate law in wanting to kill somebody, just like my 
abuser wanted to kill me.
    Mr. Biggs. I would just say all of you had such compelling 
stories, all four of you, and very informative. I want to ask 
one more question to you, Ms. Watral, because your statement 
said, ``we are being targeted and discriminated against, 
politically, financially, and socially.'' When you said we, who 
are you referring to?
    Ms. Watral. Women, women of all races, financial status, 
all women in the country. That is my belief.
    Mr. Biggs. Thank you. I am going to now--the question was 
asked by one of my colleagues across the aisle whether the 
individual who was trying to attack the pregnant lady and her 
husband or boyfriend, whoever that family member was, was he 
arrested? Yes, he was arrested. He was charged. I am going to 
enter that in the record without objection.
    Then additionally, we need to talk about what the real 
problem is in Red States. It is Blue cities. That is where the 
real problem is for violence. So, I am going to introduce now a 
report called, ``The Blue City Murder Problem.'' I will do that 
without objection.
    With that, I thank the witnesses again. I thank each of you 
for being here.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. I would like to submit something in the 
record.
    Mr. Biggs. Yes, please go.
    Ms. Jackson Lee. Thank you. To add to the work that the 
Biden-Harris Administration are doing to work with all of you, 
I want to submit into the record their announcement of a number 
of reducing gun violence initiatives, first, establishing the 
State Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which should really 
help all of you.
    I encourage you to participate with them on the issues that 
you are concerned about because it talks about reinforcing 
responsible gun ownership, and it does include storage. That's 
just one of the things, working with the industry.
    I don't think it sees them actually--and I am just going to 
ask you to submit it. It doesn't say anything about Blue States 
or Red States or Blue cities or Red cities. It just talks about 
Americans working together to make us all safe. I yield back, 
Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Biggs. Without objection. Again, thank you for being 
here, and I thank the audience for being here as well. With 
that, we are adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:38 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]
