                              ----------                              


                         TUESDAY, MARCH 7, 2023

                      United States Senate,
Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and 
                                   Consumer Rights,
                                Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice at 3:07 p.m., in 
Room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Amy Klobuchar, 
Chair of the Subcommittee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Klobuchar [presiding], Whitehouse, Coons, 
Blumenthal, Hirono, Lee, Grassley, Hawley, and Tillis.
    Also present: Chair Durbin and Senator Padilla.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA

    Chair Klobuchar. Sorry we were a little late, but the good 
news is, we got both votes done. So we won't be running back 
and forth. I call to order this hearing of the Subcommittee on 
Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights on ``Reining 
in Dominant Digital Platforms: Restoring Competition to Our 
Digital Markets.'' I'd like to welcome our witnesses and thank 
Senator Lee and his staff for helping to plan this hearing.
    We all know that a few dominant online platforms have the 
power to control whether and how businesses can access 
customers and markets online. These dominant platforms often 
abuse this power to preference their own products in a way that 
stifles competition and innovation.
    Last Congress, between the House and the Senate, over 150 
hearings on the tech issues were held. Let me say that again--
one, I don't mean to not make you guys feel special--but, 150 
hearings were held, and we did make progress.
    In addition to the House report that Representative 
Cicilline and Representative Ken Buck, as well as the Chairs 
over in the House put out, we passed some bills.
    The Senate Judiciary Committee, as you know, passed out the 
bill on changing the merger fees that Senator Grassley and I 
had, as well as the bill that Senator Lee and I had, that 
Senator Lee led on venues.
    Both bills passed at the end of last year as a part of the 
year-end budget, and Senator Lee and I worked together. And I 
believe those are very important pieces of legislation for 
assisting those at the State and Federal level that are going 
after these cases.
    The Senate Judiciary Committee also reported the bipartisan 
American Innovation and Choice Online Act to the Senate floor, 
making it the first tech competition bill voted out of this 
Committee since the dawn of the internet. This isn't just about 
the money for enforcement or about State efforts. This is 
actually about Federal efforts and the need to change the laws 
to fit the times.
    A few weeks later, the Open App Markets Act, something led 
by Senator Blumenthal, and Blackburn, and myself, was also 
reported out on a strong bipartisan vote, but after an 
unprecedented lobbying effort by the dominant platforms--as in, 
I remember in August of last year, they'd spent more money on 
legislation, according to a Bloomberg report, than any other 
entities, industries. Even more than Pharma had at that point.
    I don't have updated numbers, but I know that nearly, 
probably over $200 million was spent against this bill in 
States all over the country with ads that had nothing to do 
with each other, for red States and blue States, to show their 
dominance. These bills did not get a vote on the floor.
    And let me give you some numbers. I just noted the millions 
of dollars in advertising against the bills--$90 million on 
lobbying over the previous 18 months. In just one week last 
May, one industry group spent $22 million on TV ads against the 
American Innovation and Choice Online Act.
    I--particularly, I want to note for the companies--enjoyed 
the pop-up ads run in DC against me that said, ``Amy 
Klobuchar''--and I love the way your lawyers insisted on 
putting in small letters, ``could.''--``Amy Klobuchar could 
destroy Amazon Prime.'' ``Amy Klobuchar could''-- in really 
small letters--``destroy Google Maps.'' They were well noted. 
Congratulations on your money spent.
    These companies have only become more brazen since then 
with armies of lobbyists and lawyers. They are in every corner 
in this town, at every cocktail party, and all over this 
building. But it's easy to see why they don't want us to act. 
We would be happy to work with the companies on legislation, 
but they shut every single thing down. Why? Because they can.
    Google has 90 percent market share in search engines. Apple 
controls 100 percent of app distribution for iPhones. Three out 
of every 4 social media users use Facebook or Instagram. Amazon 
accounted for about 40 percent of the entire U.S. e-commerce 
retail market last year. That's dominance under any way of 
looking at the antitrust laws, something that I know the 
Justice Department is looking into, as we speak.
    So while many have said all the right things about 
fostering innovation, helping small businesses, and improving 
privacy, when it comes to actual action, we have done nothing 
in this Congress. With the exception of the funding--which I 
will say is incredibly important--and the Venue bill, we have 
done nothing in terms of setting standards when it comes to 
tech.
    Nothing out of the Congress on privacy. Nothing out of the 
Congress on updating the children's protection bills when it 
comes to the internet. Nothing on the Congress when it comes to 
dominance on the platforms and self-preferencing. Nothing out 
of the Congress on AI. You can come to your own conclusions on 
why that has happened.
    But I think you all know when you talk to parents who are 
trying to help their kids to do their homework, and not spend 
their whole day on social media, or be exposed to bad stuff. Or 
when you talk to small businesses, like those in the National--
NFIB, the National Federation of Independent Businesses--which 
is not exactly known as a liberal group, that has endorsed the 
bill that we are in part talking about today--I think you then 
understand what's going on in this country, and why we need 
some rules of the road, and why there has been bipartisan 
support for these bills.
    I'm well aware of what's going on in the House, and 
Congressman Buck, who I spoke to this morning, his loss of his 
Committee post--which he did so well--and I'm well aware of 
some of the changes made to that Subcommittee that have made it 
harder and harder for us to proceed with these bills. We have 
to be honest about that. But to just close our eyes and do 
nothing and let another 2 years go by is a huge mistake.
    And that's why we're having this hearing, and that's why 
we're moving ahead. While we fail to act, the dominant 
platforms use their control to suppress the competition and 
rake in billions at the expense of consumers.
    If you don't want Meta to have your data and sell it to 
advertisers, tough luck, because you will have to avoid using 
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.
    If you don't want to use the Apple App Store, tough luck, 
because there is no other way to get your apps on the iPhone.
    And if you're a small business that wants to use a local 
delivery service instead of Amazon's shipping system, tough 
luck, because they're two. Because it is virtually impossible 
to get to the top of Amazon's search listings unless you buy 
Amazon's shipping systems.
    Small businesses are beholden to digital gatekeepers that 
can block access to their customers, take their data, and 
demote them in search rankings while copying their best ideas 
and bringing them to market on their own. That discourages 
businesses from innovating and deters investors from putting 
money into startups. They all know the game is rigged.
    We know that other countries are taking action. They are 
leading the way in the Digital Age. I wish we were. I know 
Senator Hawley has some ideas on how he would like to proceed. 
I know Senator Lee has tons of ideas. But in fact, let's be 
honest, that's not happening right now.
    The European Union enacted the Digital Markets Act, which 
puts regulatory restrictions on how the largest digital 
platforms can use their power. Australia is considering similar 
reforms to protect digital competition.
    I'm glad they're doing this. It will give us good examples. 
It will show that the market is still vibrant even when they 
protect their consumers and they have the guts to pass 
something.
    The UK is considering legislation to further empower its 
digital markets union. And South Korea enacted new rules to 
open up app markets.
    If Congress does nothing, we abdicate America's leadership 
position on global competition policy. We let foreign laws 
become the global standard for regulating American digital 
businesses around the world.
    And while the dominant digital platforms lobby against 
legislation in the United States, they are agreeing to the same 
common-sense rules in other countries.
    That may be the biggest hypocrisy of all. It's okay to give 
small businesses some rights in Europe. It's okay to have help 
for consumers and protection for consumers in the UK or 
Australia. But here, where they are allegedly hometown 
companies, where they're supposed to be looking out for 
Americans, they fight it tooth and nail.
    The good news is that there's still a bipartisan majority 
in both Chambers that is ready to take action. Bipartisan 
legislation with Senator Grassley and other Members of this 
Committee, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, as 
well as Representatives Cicilline and Buck in the House, which 
establishes rules of the road for dominant digital platforms 
and prevents them from favoring their own products or services 
just because they own them.
    These are targeted reforms to address anticompetitive 
behavior, level the playing field for businesses, and increase 
choice while driving down costs for consumers. And these 
reforms do it without compromising privacy or security.
    That's why, as the Attorney General said last week, the 
Department of Justice, along with the Commerce Department, 
endorses the bill. The bill also, as I already noted, has 
strong support from the National Federation of Independent 
Businesses, Consumer Reports, the Main Street Alliance, and 
Consumer Federation of America, and many civil society groups 
across the political spectrum.
    I also joined Senators Blumenthal and Blackburn to 
introduce the Open App Markets Act to give app developers more 
power to reach their customers without the control of app 
stores run by Apple and Google. And I am working with Senator 
Lee on this bill to improve competition and transparency in ad 
technology markets. We're going to be having another hearing to 
focus on that soon.
    Here's the bottom line: We cannot afford to waste another 2 
years getting nothing done; another 2 years for these 
monopolists to further entrench their power; another 2 years of 
unchecked anticompetitive self-preferencing; another 2 years of 
small businesses closing up shop; another 2 years of failing to 
protect American consumers; while the rest of the world moves 
forward.
    And I am well aware that the content arguments are used, 
and they're very different. The arguments that are made to the 
left from the right. One day I hope to publish the sentences 
that said that the companies give to the right and what they 
give to the left. And at some point, we know that they're the 
same because they're designed for one thing, and that is to 
stop these bills and maintain their dominant position.
    I know eventually we're going to get this done, even if it 
means all these other countries went before us, and there'll be 
pressure for them to agree to it in America. Eventually, we 
will. But for the good of the people of this country, I hope it 
is sooner rather than later. I look forward to continuing to 
work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle. And with that, 
I turn it over to Senator Lee.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL S. LEE,
             A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF UTAH

    Senator Lee. Thanks so much, Madam Chair. If it seems like 
we've had this hearing several times before, well, it's because 
we have. But it's also because finding a way to rein in the 
pernicious influence of Big Tech remains one of the most 
pressing public policy concerns of our time.
    These aren't the first monopolies, by any means, that 
America has endured, and has had to figure out how to deal 
with. We've dealt with them before, but never before have we 
seen just a handful of trillion-dollar corporate bureaucracies 
exercising such pervasive control over how we stay in touch 
with friends and loved ones, how we shop to provide for our 
families, obtain news and other information, exercise our First 
Amendment rights, influence public debate, and even how we turn 
on our air conditioning, and lock or unlock our doors.
    All of that is on top of the fact that they're doing stuff 
to our kids that many of us find very disconcerting. Big Tech's 
business plans are built on an addiction business model, and 
our children are uniquely vulnerable to fuel their growth and 
their expansion as attractive targets for those businesses.
    What's sold as fun and as a matter of convenience seems to, 
more often, end up as a gateway to pornography and to Chinese 
propaganda. But for them, a click is a click. Yet, while Big 
Tech profits have grown significantly, so have teenage anxiety, 
depression, and suicide rates. These companies don't just track 
where we go, what we say, what we buy, who we talk to, what we 
read. They actively influence, and direct nearly every facet of 
our lives, to ensure that our patterns of behavior remain 
what's most profitable for them.
    Not content to stifle competition in their respective 
commercial markets, Big Tech increasingly works to kill 
competition in the marketplace of ideas. Woke ideology is 
seeped from universities to the boardroom, and it's now being 
foisted upon consumers in the form of censorship and exclusion 
from the 21st-century public square. Even worse, we now know 
that these companies have been colluding with the Federal 
Government to do so. A gross violation of our constitutional 
rights.
    It turns out Big Tech and Big Government share a lot in 
common, including their love for surveillance and censorship. 
They don't necessarily bring out the best in each other, and 
that's putting it mildly. So it's not surprising that so often 
when we see Big Tech tracking and censoring us, it turns out 
that Big Government was there, egging them along, facilitating 
it, perhaps requesting it, all along.
    In the past, there was at least some consolation in the 
idea that market forces would eventually intervene, that 
changes in technology and new innovation would somehow disrupt 
incumbents and provide consumers with new choices. But today's 
monopolists, however, control much of the consumer technology 
and innovation themselves. And what they don't control, they 
actively endeavor to buy up before it can become a competitive 
threat that might actually risk displacing them or disrupting 
their control of the marketplace.
    This is precisely why there's such a strong bipartisan 
support for the idea that we need to find ways to ensure that 
the same companies that began as innovative startups disrupting 
stagnant markets to improve the lives of consumers, don't end 
up as entrenched as the monopolists undermining competition at 
the expense of consumers and American society itself.
    This is an incredibly important task, and one that I take 
very seriously, as someone who's long championed Congress' 
unique legislative prerogative and responsibility to make law. 
And neither the judiciary nor the executive branch can solve 
these problems alone. Congress must act.
    At the same time, we also have a duty to ensure that the 
cure isn't something that turns out to be worse than the 
disease. As concerned as I am by the behavior of Big Tech, I'm 
equally concerned that some of the bills that have been 
introduced to solve one problem or another simply replace a 
corporate tyrant with a Government tyrant. They would replace a 
lack of competition with an excess of Government 
micromanagement by bureaucrats, trading one form of dysfunction 
for another.
    Ironically, it's often this very kind of regulation that 
leads to consolidation in the first place, pushing firms to 
merge, thereby erecting barriers to entry, and protecting 
themselves from competition. Congress should prefer targeted, 
detailed legislative solutions to broad, vaguely defined grants 
of new authority to Federal agencies.
    As I've said before, it's important that Congress solve the 
problems presented by Big Tech rather than broadly delegating 
the issue off to Federal bureaucrats and agencies subject to 
regulatory capture and unaccountable to voters. I remain 
particularly opposed to the idea of granting any new authority 
to the Federal Trade Commission.
    Unfortunately, the radical agenda of the Biden FTC has made 
it even harder to find common ground in the fight against Big 
Tech. Even passing a bill to update the merger filing fee 
structure, something that should have been uncontroversial, was 
needlessly difficult and almost failed, simply because of the 
overreach and the incompetence of the FTC under the current 
administration.
    I'm grateful to Senator Klobuchar for convening this 
hearing because we're here to discuss some really important 
issues, and for continuing to be a valuable legislative partner 
as we both work toward bipartisan solutions to shared 
challenges.
    I look forward to our discussion today and a hearing later 
this month that we'll be having to discuss our AMERICA Act to 
tackle competition in digital advertising. Thank you, Madam 
Chair.
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you, very much, Senator Lee. And now

    STATEMENT OF FIONA M. SCOTT MORTON, THEODORE NIERENBERG 
 PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, YALE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT, NEW HAVEN, 
                          CONNECTICUT

    Professor Scott Morton. Thank you, Chair Klobuchar and 
Ranking Member Lee, for the invitation to testify today. I have 
only a few points to make.
    The modern interpretation and application of U.S. antitrust 
laws has failed to preserve competition in today's digital 
platform markets. Relying on entrenched monopolists to innovate 
and create competition is foolhardy and unsupported by economic 
learning. The perfect antitrust law would be a great help, and 
I would firmly support that.
    But my understanding is that such a law is not on the menu 
today, and will not be anytime soon. This means our choice is 
between the status quo and the bills we're here to discuss 
today.
    Larger budgets for antitrust enforcement are also 
necessary, and I support those. But litigation is an expensive, 
uncertain, and slow method to stop the behaviors Congress, and 
many other jurisdictions, have identified as problematic.
    Current antitrust enforcement actions against Big Tech also 
run up against the problem of what remedy to request should the 
Government prevail. How can agencies restore the lost 
competition? In the absence of prompt and effective remedies 
that create competition in platform markets, a good alternative 
is a set of rules that stimulates competition on dominant 
platforms. The apps, vendors, and other businesses that use 
these platforms are businesses that will not invest and invent 
unless they have a route to profitability.
    AICOA is quite conservative in that it aims to restore 
competition to digital markets that are concentrated or 
monopolized. The bill is fit for purpose and makes actionable 
only those violations that injure competition. The deference 
generally given to affirmative defenses in our current system--
an undue deference, in my opinion--very often indicates that 
the law is very unlikely to penalize reasonable actions and 
quality products.
    The Protect Competition language in AICOA is new exactly 
because we know we have an antitrust enforcement problem. Using 
language drawn from the same ineffective jurisprudence we now 
use today would yield the same ineffective outcomes we have 
today, namely, insufficient protection of competition.
    I expect it will take many years until we have a digital 
regulator, just as it took much human suffering before Congress 
chose to create regulators for industries like pharmaceuticals 
and railroads. Until we have such a regulator, the laws being 
proposed today are the best route to immediate improvements for 
the welfare of consumers.
    The pair of bills that we're discussing today reflect some 
of the content contained in the Digital Markets Act, which 
Senator Klobuchar referenced a few minutes ago and which will 
take effect in Europe in January 2024, less than 9 months away.
    Let me give you a few examples of the requirements in that 
law.
    Article 5, number 4 is anti-steering and an anti-gag rule. 
Gatekeeper shall allow business users to contract, communicate, 
promote, deliver various services bought elsewhere through the 
core platform. So this gives app developers much more freedom 
than they have today.
    Article 5, item 7. Prohibition on tying a platform with an 
in-app payment system, that gets freed up.
    Article 6, item 2. Prohibition of the use of nonpublic 
business user data to compete against the business users.
    Article 6, item 4. An obligation to open operating systems 
to third-party apps and app stores. ``The gatekeeper shall 
allow and technically enable the installation and effective use 
of third-party software applications or software application 
stores.''
    Article 6, number 5. ``The gatekeeper shall not treat more 
favourably, in ranking and related indexing and crawling, 
services and products offered by the gatekeeper itself than 
similar services or products of a third party.''
    Article 6, item 7. Free interoperability. So free, no 
access charge, interoperability for business users, hardware, 
and software that is equivalent to the access enjoyed by the 
platform's own hardware and software.
    As you can see from this limited selection, the DMA is much 
more detailed than the text of AICOA or OAMA, and does not 
include any efficiency defense. In particular, the DMA does not 
require that the regulator show that each instance of 
prohibited conduct harms competition. Instead, the rules were 
chosen to be those that, in the view of the European 
Parliament, would generally protect and increase competition. 
Platforms must be in compliance with these rules by 2024 in 
Europe.
    What does this mean for the bills we're discussing today? 
Right now, companies that seek to compete against today's 
dominant platforms, or offer services through them, will have 
an enormous incentive to focus their efforts in Europe where 
they can bring new services, innovations, and lower prices to 
European consumers with these changes in the laws that give 
them more access, control, and innovative ability.
    American businesses and consumers will be able to read 
about these innovations, but they will need to go and launch a 
product in Europe themselves or visit on vacation to experience 
those products.
    The United States will miss out on opportunities to lead 
the world in tech sector innovation and experience the benefits 
that that innovation can deliver. Thank you.

    STATEMENT OF CHRIS LEWIS, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
           OFFICER, PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE, WASHINGTON, DC

    Mr. Lewis. Thank you, Chair Klobuchar, Ranking Member Lee, 
for the invitation to testify today. Public Knowledge is a 
nonprofit digital rights organization whose mission is to fight 
for an open internet, free expression, and affordable access to 
communications tools and creative works. And we see promoting 
robust competition online as a key part of that mission.
    Tech users are increasingly feeling like they have no power 
over tech giants online and, at times, feel stuck with them. 
Big Tech companies are popular for the democratic speech they 
support, for the ease of purchasing products, and the 
communities that they foster. However, there is a distinct 
downside.
    Consumers don't know or understand how they are being 
tracked or influenced. Small businesses must accept unfair 
treatment in order to access consumers through the digital 
platform that dominate the internet. Their products can be 
unfairly demoted in search results, their ability to 
communicate with their customers can be limited, and their 
competitively sensitive business information can be misused.
    On social media, where so much of our modern political 
debate takes place, women, people of color, and other 
marginalized communities, face harassment that pushes us out of 
the conversation. Radicalization pipelines on social media have 
offline consequences.
    Digital platforms are a distinct sector that need new laws 
and rules to address their power and protect users. Antitrust 
laws have an important role to play here, but existing 
antitrust law will not be sufficient.
    Here's a four-part framework that we've come up with for 
how I think we can best address the variety of policy 
challenges posed by dominant digital platforms.
    The first is the subject of this hearing. Competition. We 
need sector-specific, pro-competition legislation to empower 
consumers and business users by incentivizing market entry, and 
facilitating switching to new platforms.
    Competition empowers customers to choose the option that is 
best for them. In many markets, that's the best price. But in 
digital platforms, where the price is often $0, competition may 
happen along a variety of quality measures.
    Consumers might prefer to see fewer ads, more relevant 
search results, more reliable information, perhaps filtering 
tools, or antiharassment tools, or even more, or less, content 
moderation.
    The American Innovation and Choice Online Act, AICOA, and 
the Open App Markets Act, will make sure consumers are actually 
seeing the products that are best for them and not just 
products that are best for tech's bottom line.
    By taking away some of the key tools that Big Tech uses to 
stifle competitors and potential competitors online, fair 
competition rules, like those found in AICOA and the Open App 
Market Act, will also encourage new innovation to enter the 
market, since they'll know that they can have a fair shot to 
actually reach customers.
    Briefly, the other three parts of the framework are 
important as policymakers address sustainable solutions to meet 
consumers' needs.
    Part two is the importance of transparency so that 
consumers and business users can make informed choices. 
Transparency and due process practices, paired with 
interoperability requirements, can build trust and empower 
users when it comes to content moderation.
    Third, we need consumer protection laws and rules to 
address platform harms that won't be improved by competition. 
The first, and most important, of these will be a comprehensive 
privacy bill, like the ADPPA, which we support. Everyone 
deserves to have their privacy respected.
    Last, these responsibilities should be housed in a new 
agency, an expert digital regulator. This regulator would work 
together with antitrust enforcers, not in lieu of antitrust 
enforcement. It would have competition, privacy, and other 
consumer protection authorities. It could also address content 
moderation concerns through transparency and due process 
requirements. And it could help carefully craft the future of 
algorithmic oversight and accountability.
    Given the bipartisan work of Congress over the past few 
years, we believe this framework can build a foundation for a 
better internet in the future. I know folks may disagree on 
some of the details of these legislative proposals, but we are 
happy to work with you, and other stakeholders, to find 
workable solutions. So thank you for inviting us here today, 
and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Lewis appears as a 
submission for the record.]
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you, very much. Next up, Professor 
Francis.

        STATEMENT OF DANIEL FRANCIS, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR
        OF LAW, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, NEW YORK

    Professor Francis. Chair Klobuchar, Ranking Member Lee, 
Members of the Subcommittee, thanks for inviting me today. I'm 
a former Federal antitrust enforcer, and I strongly support the 
Subcommittee's focus on tech monopoly.
    Our digital markets are not competitive enough. Antitrust 
enforcement needs more money, building on the recent wonderful 
successes, and it needs updated statutes so that we can stop 
anticompetitive acquisitions and exclusionary practices in tech 
and other markets. And I would support platform rules that were 
targeted at specific practices that used market power in 
anticompetitive ways to harm consumers. But I don't recommend 
enacting either of these bills under discussion today.
    First, I don't support AICOA because I read it as telling 
platforms to do less for consumers and more for other 
businesses, some of which are going to turn out to be bad or 
harmful.
    Point one: AICOA makes it presumptively illegal to do many 
things that benefit consumers. Integrating functions like 
putting map information in search results, pre-installing apps 
like mail or maps on a phone, bundling services like music or 
movies in with Amazon Prime--those things shouldn't be even 
presumptively illegal.
    Point two: AICOA is going to discourage platforms from 
protecting users. There are plenty of bad actors, malicious 
apps, and junk out there on the internet. And today, platforms 
protect users by restricting access.
    But under AICOA, those access restrictions are going to 
mean a threat of serious hassle, at best--complaints, lengthy 
investigations, the threat of huge penalties and injunctions, 
and even the forfeiture of personal compensation by executives. 
And that threat's going to be bigger because so much of AICOA 
is vague.
    So, it's going to be much less attractive for platforms to 
protect users than it is today. Now, that's going to mean that 
some good actors will get access to platforms and users, and 
that will be good.
    But more bad actors are going to get access, too. They're 
going to be pre-installed on devices, they're going to be 
available in app stores, they're going to be available to 
choose as a default, given access to cameras, and microphones, 
and GPS information. And I think that's a much bigger harm.
    Point three: The affirmative defenses are much too weak. 
There's no defense here on the ground that what was restricted 
was just a bad product, or it was full of spam, or intrusive 
advertising. Or full of false, or objectionable, or sexually 
explicit content. Or just too expensive to integrate.
    There is a product improvement defense, but it's only 
limited to core functions. If you improve a noncore function, 
it doesn't apply. And the defense doesn't apply at all if what 
you're doing could be done in a less discriminatory way, even 
if doing it that way would be unprofitable.
    And relying on the affirmative defense at all means 
spending time and money to prove it, risking penalties and 
injunctions, and even the loss of your own salary if a court 
ends up disagreeing. So, I think it's going to be a paper 
shield in practice.
    Point four: Crucially, the bill doesn't define the central 
concept of harm to competition. It could mean either an 
antitrust-style consumer welfare test or injury to rivals. It 
can't possibly be both. And if it's the latter, then it's no 
limit at all. And if it's the former, which would allay a lot 
of my concerns, it must say so explicitly.
    Point five, and finally, AICOA is going to inject a ton of 
confusion into tech markets. It's full of terms and concepts 
that are new, important, broad, and undefined. And it's going 
to drown in complaints the very same agencies that today barely 
have the resources to cover their antitrust docket. I think 
that's the last thing they need. And I can imagine State 
attorneys general taking really different views in perfectly 
good faith about how AICOA should work, including how content 
moderation fits under Sections 3(a)(3) and 3(a)(9) of the bill.
    Very briefly on the app store bill, I think it's a much 
more promising basis for discussion. I would support rules for 
app stores that have significant market power. A ban on app 
price MFNs, a narrow ban on the competitive use of some data 
that preserve their right to use their own data and to buy it 
from developers, and I'd support a mandatory disclosure 
requirement when paid advertising leads to a search ranking 
boost.
    But forcing third-party app stores into digital ecosystem 
threatens real harm. The whole cybersecurity world, from the 
NSA, and the FBI, to the FTC, tell consumers and users to stay 
away from third-party app stores. I think the last thing we 
should do is lift those up.
    I don't think, even though I've been negative in my 
presentation, that there are any easy answers here. Just really 
hard tradeoffs and best guesses about what consequences are 
going to be. My instinct is that we do a lot better supporting 
and investing in the antitrust system that we've got, which so 
badly needs support. I think that's a better deal all around. 
Thanks for having me today, and I look forward to your 
questions.

    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you. Next up, Professor Candeub.

  STATEMENT OF ADAM CANDEUB, PROFESSOR OF LAW, MICHIGAN STATE 
               UNIVERSITY, EAST LANSING, MICHIGAN

    Professor Candeub. Madam Chair, Ranking Member Lee, and 
Senators, thank you for the chance to speak to you today. Big 
Tech's market power undermines our Nation's culture of 
vibrant----
    Chair Klobuchar. Sorry. You have to turn your microphone 
on, Adam.
    Professor Candeub. Big Tech's market power undermines our 
Nation's culture of vibrant democratic deliberation. Elon 
Musk's Twitter files demonstrated that Big Tech has indeed 
limited particular groups, including dissenters, from important 
Government policies from full participation in national 
political discussions. This power to exclude threatens all 
Americans. Power to silence one group of Americans will be used 
sooner or later to silence another.
    Consider Parler. Beginning in 2021, the social media 
company, which differentiated itself from competitors by its 
free speech policies, was the most downloaded app on the Apple 
Play Store. But then, on seemingly pretextual grounds, Apple 
removed Parler from the App Store, and soon after, Google 
removed it from the Play Store. Then Amazon Web terminated its 
hosting agreement. The Parler app was quite literally taken 
down, only returning online months later. It never recovered 
its growth momentum. And this problem, the problem of Big Tech, 
stems from its market power, and not simply Silicon Valley's 
moral outlook that may differ from that of most Americans.
    As price givers, they dominate certain online business 
niches. And internet platforms can decrease service quality, 
silence viewpoints, perspectives without experiencing revenue 
loss. Competitive markets do not discipline their behavior.
    Antitrust addresses market power and presents to many, 
including myself, a dilemma. I stand on the side of markets and 
economic freedom, but at the same time cannot close my eyes to 
Big Tech's deleterious effects on the institutional resilience 
of our democracy, free speech, children's health and 
development, as well as, quite possibly, on economic innovation 
and growth.
    Antitrust has long recognized that special rules apply when 
dealing with market power deployed to stifle free speech and 
free expression. The Supreme Court, in Associated Press v. 
United States, makes that point, and I quote, ``The First 
Amendment, far from providing an argument against the 
application of the Sherman Act, here provides powerful reasons 
to the contrary. That amendment rests on the assumption that 
the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse 
and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the 
public.'' So from my perspective, I ask whether the Open App 
Markets Act and AICOA further a freer country, a stronger 
democracy, as well as a more vital and innovative online 
economy.
    The Open App Markets is a solid attempt to combat the power 
of the large app distributors, but can be strengthened. As 
written, it's not clear that it would solve the Parler problem. 
There is no unreasonable discrimination provision that 
prohibits arbitrary de-platforming. Further, Section 4 
exceptions allow platforms to exclude or de-platform apps to 
further digital safety.
    As a law professor who specializes in communications law, I 
confess I never heard the term until I read it in the bill. 
What does digital safety mean? Don't text and drive? Don't 
charge your iPhone while using it in the bathtub? Alas, no.
    Digital safety is a concept pushed, and likely coined, by 
the World Economic Forum and its Global Coalition on Digital 
Safety. The WEF defines digital unsafe content as, I quote, 
``lawful, but awful.'' As the Twitter files show, employees of 
the major platforms have notions of what constitutes awful, 
which probably do not align with what the Davos crowd considers 
awful, and which are probably quite contrary to American 
traditions of free expression.
    As for AICOA, its Sponsors should be congratulated for 
reforwarding the issue of restoring competition in digital 
markets. I do have a few reservations. AICOA may simply be 
ineffective at promoting free speech. With no private cause of 
action, it is a very big stick, really a club, that DOJ, the 
FTC, and the State attorney generals can use to hit Big Tech.
    As was observed in the opening comments, Government power 
for Big Tech often can have a bad effect on free speech. AICOA, 
with its open-ended terms, and discretionary and exclusive 
Government enforcement, adds to the available pressure 
Government can employ on the major internet platforms to 
silence Government's critics. I welcome the Committee's 
questions. Thank you.

    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you, very much. Ms. Amanda Lewis, 
thank you for being here.

           STATEMENT OF AMANDA LEWIS, PARTNER, CUNEO
             GILBERT & LADUCA, LLP, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Lewis. Chairwoman Klobuchar and Ranking Member Lee, 
thank you for the invitation to testify. I am here in my 
personal capacity and not on behalf of any client.
    Last Congress showed strong bipartisan support for 
antitrust reform, especially for bills that would curb Big 
Tech's and Big Pharma's monopoly power. There is a lot of 
common ground here. This Committee advanced AICOA and the Open 
App Markets Act on a bipartisan basis. You deserve credit for 
doing so.
    Enforcers, as well as private plaintiffs, are currently 
seeking relief in court to address some of the gatekeeper 
platforms anticompetitive conduct. But the unique challenges of 
digital markets, plus the time and resource-intensive nature of 
litigation, make this an inefficient, and also possibly 
ineffective, tool for the job.
    Under current law, the deck is stacked in favor of the 
platforms. And that is why Congress should pass legislation to 
rein in the dominant digital platforms and restore competition 
to our digital markets.
    AICOA is a comprehensive and well-thought-out bill. It 
draws support from a long list of consumer groups, businesses, 
and labor unions. It counts both NFIB and the Teamsters as 
strong supporters. An example will help identify just a few 
concrete benefits of the bill. AICOA would prohibit Amazon from 
tying, which forces third-party sellers to pay enormous fees to 
Amazon for services that they don't actually want to buy.
    By prohibiting this conduct, AICOA will restore dignity and 
autonomy to businesses that have no choice but to rely on 
Amazon. Independent businesses will cease to be puppets with 
Amazon pulling the strings.
    Consumers will also benefit when sellers are no longer 
forced to pay junk fees to Amazon that effectively add up to a 
50 percent commission on every sale. Sellers will undoubtedly 
pass those savings on to consumers. And this is just one 
example of many of the benefits of AICOA.
    The Open App Markets Act is much narrower. It's focused on 
the mobile app ecosystem. If OAMA is passed, consumers will see 
immediate savings, as well, when Apple can no longer force a 30 
percent commission on developers for payment services that 
should cost a fraction of that. OAMA would also force Apple to 
give consumers the same freedoms that they enjoy on their 
desktop and laptop computers, the freedom to download the 
software and services of their choosing. This would put the 
power back where it belongs: not in the hands of the dominant 
platforms but in the hands of consumers.
    Finally, OAMA will restore the incentive to innovate for 
app developers. When innovators are no longer afraid that Apple 
will effectively steal their ideas and hard-won customers, they 
will take more risks and invest in new ideas. An increased 
sense of security will encourage the investment of capital in 
the innovation economy.
    After this Committee's hard work to study the problems and 
the solutions, these bills are ready to become law. I urge 
Congress to move quickly to pass both AICOA and OAMA. Thank 
you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Lewis appears as a 
submission for the record.]
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you, very much, to our witnesses.
    I'll get started here. We have a number of Senators with 
us. I'll start with you, Professor Scott Morton. I was 
interested to see already the 2,800 lawyers and lobbyists for 
the companies are now claiming that one of my points was that 
we should cede regulation to--that I said, we should cede 
regulation to Europe, and to Australia, and to South Korea. 
They're already at it.
    I think you know what I said, which was, that we should 
take the lead. We in America, who believe in competition, 
should take the lead. And that we have some good examples out 
there, but we shouldn't let them take the lead. So, I just 
thought for those of you tweeting that out, you might be 
interested to note that that was a lie.
    Professor Scott Morton, could you please talk about, and 
kind of refute, some of the points that Professor Francis made 
when it comes to the bill, and how the bill is all about 
capitalism and competition? And as you know, throughout 
history, that has been a counterweight to monopolists.
    Professor Scott Morton. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. I 
think the parade of horribles that was listed by Professor 
Francis really can't happen if there's a requirement to find 
injury to competition. Today's courts are actually really happy 
to find behaviors that economists would identify as harmful to 
competition, to be fine.
    The problem we have is actually excessive deference to that 
kind of an argument. And I think, therefore, it's natural we 
would have some of that here despite the beefed-up language. So 
the notion that courts will suddenly eliminate quality products 
because they have to evaluate a harm to competition is, I 
think, misplaced.
    And the kind of self-preferencing that the bill is worried 
about can be harmful. This is known. It's not an imaginary 
thing.
    And Professor Francis has himself written that self-
preferencing isn't captured by the antitrust laws--the current 
antitrust laws. So what kind of self-preferencing would we 
worry about? What kind would be harmful? The kind that harms 
competition.
    So, again, we're returning to familiar economic concepts. 
This is all stuff that we know from the literature. And the 
fact that new words are being used in this legislation is 
exactly to ensure that we get a new outcome. We can't use the 
same terminology and imagine that courts won't understand it 
the way they always have. So, to get a different outcome, we 
have to use a new word and say, look, we're worried about harm 
to competition.
    In terms of innovation, I think, as I said in my opening 
remarks, the entrenched monopolists that we have right now are 
not--should not be relied on to generate innovation. That's not 
what a monopolist does. It's safe. It doesn't have to run fast 
to innovate. Where we're seeing quite a lot of innovation is 
actually on these platforms now. So the apps themselves 
competing with each other and trying to innovate and indeed 
someday replace the platform. That gets limited without 
protections.
    Chair Klobuchar. Okay, thank you. Ms. Lewis--we have two 
Lewises. So I'll start with you, Ms. Lewis. This Committee 
found your testimony very interesting and compelling about the 
small businesses. And I think you know we have previously heard 
from them. Their group, the NFIB, is strongly in support of 
this bill. And many of them have told us they're afraid to come 
forward individually because they're afraid of retaliation by 
the platforms. And we've seen this before because they can go 
out of business if they're retaliated against.
    You work with companies who are stuck in this position. How 
would the American Innovation and Choice Online Act help them?
    Ms. Lewis. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. The fear of 
retaliation is significant and really overwhelming for many 
market participants. It is something that I encountered during 
the House Judiciary Committee digital markets investigation and 
have continued to experience in private practice.
    It's one of the reasons why I co-founded the Responsible 
Online Commerce Coalition: because small businesses, like 
Amazon third-party sellers, are terrified--terrified of the 
degree to which Amazon has complete control over their economic 
livelihood and the power to essentially eliminate it overnight.
    The AICOA very helpfully explicitly prohibits retaliation 
when businesses of all sizes, and individuals, too, I believe, 
raise concerns about these platforms anticompetitive conduct. 
And that is a key provision, and I applaud you for that.
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you. Last question, Mr. Lewis. How 
do you think the bill will affect the strength and 
competitiveness of U.S. tech companies?
    Mr. Lewis. Senator, I think it will affect it directly. Too 
many small companies rely on these platforms for access to 
consumers. And so it's important that they have the ability to 
reach consumers without having to ask for permission. It's 
important that they feel free to innovate without fear of their 
business data being manipulated by the dominant digital 
platforms.
    So, most of the folks that we talked to, folks that were 
studied in the House antitrust investigation, folks who don't 
always want to come forward and share their fears, will say 
privately that it's important that they have the ability to 
compete. That they feel restricted by the practices of the 
dominant digital platforms.
    Chair Klobuchar. Okay.
    Mr. Lewis. And I feel like AICOA specifically targets the 
harms that we saw studied in the House Antitrust Subcommittee.
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you, very much. And I just think 
it's really important to note as Ms. Lewis was talking about 
the momentum for the bill, we have had major breakthroughs, 
including the NFIB endorsement, since this started. And these 
things take a long time. And we--the more and more small 
businesses that, I think, that these platforms took for granted 
that are coming out and talking about what's happening, and 
including medium-sized businesses, and the like. I think it's 
really important that we note that kind of momentum that we've 
had, in terms of a change of the support that we're getting for 
this bill, as more people understand what's really going on, 
which--in this ecosystem, and what's going on around the world. 
Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you.
    Professor Francis, I'd like to start with you, if that's 
okay. I share many of the concerns that have been expressed by 
colleagues that self-preferencing by dominant digital platforms 
may, in some circumstances, harm competition. But I'm also 
concerned that the broad, vague language used in AICOA could 
actually prohibit conduct--some conduct that's procompetitive 
as well. Do you share this concern? And if so, can you 
elaborate?
    Professor Francis. Very much, Senator. So, the bill makes 
central, as a limiting principle, the concept of harm to 
competition. And that's going to mean one of two things. Either 
antitrust-style consumer welfare, or injury to rivals or 
competitors. And the bill inexplicably leaves that vacant.
    Professor Scott Morton is exactly right. Antitrust does 
have a concept of competitive harm. Not exactly the statutory 
language that AICOA has chosen, but consumer welfare. The use 
of market power to make consumers, or trading partners, or 
workers, worse off overall. It's a harm requirement.
    And if AICOA said that, then my written testimony would 
have been much shorter and my concerns would have been allayed. 
But it doesn't. It could just mean injury to competitors, and 
that's what creates these terrible dangers.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, that's helpful.
    Professor Candeub, as I've mentioned, censorship isn't 
necessarily itself an antitrust problem. But market power can 
certainly enable, and in some cases markedly exacerbate, 
censorship.
    I think that we need to deal with the censorship issue 
head-on, on its own terms. Which is why I'm preparing to 
introduce legislation that would prevent social media companies 
from acting as censor in private communications between one 
person and another, and would require them to be transparent 
and offer due process to their users when moderating public 
content while still allowing for the removal of illegal and 
pornographic content. Do you believe such a bill would be 
helpful?
    Professor Candeub. Very much, Senator. As noted, OAMA 
doesn't really directly address the issue of de-platforming 
individuals. You could sort of read into it in one of the 
sections that it perhaps provides the protection, but it 
doesn't have direct language saying that the platform shall not 
engage in unreasonable discrimination.
    Similarly, AICOA protects business users, but not user 
users. So I think that legislation that sets that forth would 
be a real step forward and would help Americans.
    Senator Lee. Okay. Let's go back to AICOA for a minute. 
Professor Francis, AICOA's supporters have pointed out--they'll 
point to the requirement that, in many sections, conduct has to 
result in harm to competition. Does this alleviate any of your 
concerns?
    Professor Francis. It doesn't, Senator. And I think there's 
a real risk that a court looking at this bill will say, gosh, 
it's pretty clear that this was intended to signal a departure 
from the antitrust standard.
    Number one, this conversation is being had right now as 
part of the legislative process. And so failing to answer that 
pretty strongly suggests that there isn't a clear answer that 
can be written into the bill. This is not itself going to be an 
antitrust statute. It doesn't use antitrust statutory language.
    So, Section 7 of the Clayton Act, for example, talks about 
a merger being illegal if its effect may be substantially to 
lessen competition. That's not language that's followed here. 
And there's nothing in AICOA that says harm to competition 
shall be interpreted compatibly with antitrust.
    So, this looks like a different kind of bill, doing 
different kind of work, that very intentionally is going a 
different way from traditional antitrust, including--because of 
political and other concerns about antitrust's consumer welfare 
standard itself. So I think failing to answer that question on 
the face of the bill is very dangerous.
    Senator Lee. Okay. So, by leaving these important terms 
vague and undefined, are they giving the game away? Giving the 
game away in that this would end up being a bill about 
protecting competitors, not competition, or not consumers. 
Right?
    Professor Francis. I don't think there can be any room for 
doubt that if harm to competition in this statute is read to 
mean injury to rivals or injury to competitors, it would be 
terribly anticonsumer in its operation.
    Senator Lee. And can that be remedied without an adequate 
narrowing of the term? Eliminating the vagueness in the 
terminology?
    Professor Francis. I can't think of an alternative, 
Senator, to saying--and it's a short and simple provision if 
this is really the purpose of the measure--to say that harm to 
competition means injury to consumer welfare, or not wedded to 
the terminology of something else, like overall harm to 
consumers and workers. But something that incorporates the 
concept, I think, is critical to ensure that it doesn't do a 
terrible amount of unintended harm.
    Senator Lee. And yet this concept is not foreign to our 
competition policy. It's not foreign to antitrust law. This is 
pretty well-worn stuff. Right?
    Professor Francis. Exactly. As Professor Scott Morton says, 
that's what antitrust typically means when it says harm to 
competition. Now, it can be hard, in some cases, to figure out 
whether a harmful static effect, like a price increase, can 
really be outbalanced by a beneficial, dynamic benefit like 
greater innovation. So there can be difficulties in applying 
it. But everybody understands in antitrust that we're concerned 
with overall consumer welfare effects. And that's the question 
that's going to be asked of this statute.
    Senator Lee. Thank you. I see my time has expired. Thank 
you.
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you, very much, Senator Lee. Next up 
is Senator Durbin, our Chair. Thank you for being here.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Madam Chairwoman, Senator Klobuchar, 
I want to thank you, and Ranking Member Lee, for holding this 
hearing.
    My observation, in general, is that the pace of change in 
the digital markets is lightning fast and evolving every day. 
My observation, based on many decades of working on Capitol 
Hill, is that the response of our Government is painfully slow, 
often understaffed and underinformed, and usually sailing 
against the wind of vested interest. It doesn't make a very 
easy situation for us to respond to in a thoughtful way.
    I look back when I served in the House and we passed the 
Communications bill, about 30 years ago, and somehow left out 
the word internet. And I would think, as we reflect on the 
state of the digital market today and wonder how we're going to 
solve the problem, if smarter people or, at least, more people, 
are thinking about ways to avoid any kind of regulation or 
restraint, aren't going to get the best of us again. How can we 
avoid this? Open question.
    Chair Klobuchar. Does someone want to chime in? Mr. Lewis?
    Mr. Lewis. I'll take a stab at it, Senator. Senator, I 
think this is why--first of all, I agree with your assessment 
of the challenge for Congress to keep up with regulating a 
fast-moving sector.
    And like the Communications Act, which you referenced, I 
think it's--a long-term solution is to look at empowering a 
regulator who has the expertise in the technology, like the FCC 
has in telecommunications, to be nimble, to be careful, to be 
analytical in the duties that Congress charges it with to 
protect consumers, to protect competition, and other harms, and 
with the proper oversight from Congress. So, we believe that's 
a critical part of protecting consumers online.
    I know it's not the exact focus of this hearing, looking at 
specific competition bills, but I think added with the 
principles and ideas in these competition bills could be part 
of a real long-term solution.
    And your point about not having the internet in the 
Telecommunications Act points to what I believe was the wisdom 
of Congress. The Telecommunications Act does give the FCC 
authority over communications over wire and radio. What else do 
we think the internet is? It's communications going over wire 
and radio. Sometimes it's a fiber optic wire. Sometimes it's 
radio signal to a mobile device. This is why we've advocated 
for authority over broadband at the FCC. But that's a different 
topic.
    Chair Durbin. But if we're dealing with digital markets so 
overwhelming in size--Amazon commanding 40 percent of the e-
commerce market in the United States, 6 times its nearest 
competitor. Google controls 93 percent of online searches. 
Apple holds tight grip on 120,000,000 plus iPhone users. Do we 
really think the Federal Trade Commission is up to the 
challenge? Mr. Lewis, or whoever else----
    Ms. Lewis. I'm happy to----
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. Who wants to----
    Ms. Lewis [continuing]. Address that.
    Chair Durbin. Please, Ms. Lewis.
    Ms. Lewis. As somebody who's a former employee, enforcer at 
the FTC--and I know I'm not alone in that, as Professor Francis 
was also a former FTC enforcer--I absolutely think that the FTC 
and the DOJ are up to the task of applying the laws that we're 
discussing today, should they become law, AICOA and OAMA, to 
these markets.
    More expertise is certainly better. Being more informed is 
better. But I believe strongly that the FTC and the DOJ, as 
they stand today, do have the tools and the ability to get the 
expertise that they need to address the problematic conduct in 
digital markets.
    However, I'll say they have the ability, but they--I'll 
correct myself--they don't have the tools because--and that is 
wherein AICOA and OAMA come in. Current antitrust law is not 
well suited to address the problems that we're seeing--the 
abuse of these dominant platforms' market power. So these bills 
are really necessary.
    But I'll also add that AICOA is a bill that, I think, did a 
lot of hard work--I think the Sponsors did a lot of hard work 
to future-proof the bill. So it is specific enough that it 
gives guidance to the agencies and the courts, but also leaves 
room for--to adapt to future conditions.
    Chair Durbin. Well, I just want to close by saying that no 
reflection at all on the Senator from Minnesota who has led 
this charge and revitalized this issue of antitrust debate to a 
level that I've not seen in many, many years. And I think it's 
long overdue.
    But I think the challenge for us is to make sure there is 
an agency with the authority, and the resources, and the 
political support, to get the job done. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chair Klobuchar. Well, very good. Thank you, Senator 
Durbin. I would note through the work that Senator Grassley and 
I did, and Senator Lee last year, the Merger Fee bill that 
passed with the 88 Senators, along with the Venue bill of 
Senator Lee's as an amendment, is going to amount to a billion 
dollars to these agencies.
    As Professor Francis, he and I agree on this, on the 
resources, and what you're referring to, Ms. Lewis, that is a 
significant increase. While we'd like to see more, it's a 
significant increase, not on the backs of taxpayers, to help 
these agencies to do their work. Okay. Next up, Senator 
Grassley.
    Senator Grassley. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. My first 
question is to Professor Morton, Mr. Lewis, and Ms. Lewis. In 
your testimony, you expressed support for the American Online 
Innovation Choice Act, how it deals with the digital market 
abuses.
    You've just heard testimony by Professor Francis and 
Professor Candeub expressing a number of concerns with the 
bill. So I'd like to have the three of you briefly explain why 
you agree or disagree with Professors Candeub and Francis.
    Professor Scott Morton. Thank you, Senator. I think that 
the digital platforms we have today have quite a bit of 
entrenched market power. When Senator Durbin said technology 
moves fast, yes, it moves fast. But think of how many years 
we've been using Google Search, getting onto Facebook.com, 
having an Android operating system. These platforms have been 
around for some time now. And that's because we haven't been 
able to use current antitrust laws effectively to create 
competition in this space.
    So, we need an additional tool. And if a few words 
describing what competition means is going to make this law 
pass for Professor Francis, then I think we're done. I mean, 
we've got problems, and we need solutions to those problems. A 
general-purpose antitrust statute would also be good. But 
because the problems in digital platforms are somewhat unique 
to them, and they're so entrenched, I think we need a 
particular tool. And this statute would be that.
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Lewis, if you've got something to 
add.
    Mr. Lewis. I agree. I think AICOA is very specific in the 
anticompetitive harms that it's trying to solve. Issues of 
self-preferencing, issues of tying, issues of control of data. 
And so I think the specificity that Mr. Francis is looking for 
is in the bill.
    Regarding the concerns about free expression. Free 
expression is a core value for my organization. I believe that 
AICOA specifically targets anticompetitive harms, and I don't 
believe that content moderation on a platform--a single 
platform is necessarily an anticompetitive harm. 
Discrimination----
    Professor Scott Morton. You have other platforms to choose 
from.
    Mr. Lewis. Well, you do. And discrimination looks different 
on every platform. But the internet has infinite channels. And 
by promoting competition, we're giving users a choice of 
platforms to go to.
    And I know there's going to be another hearing on content 
moderation in the future. I think that's the proper place where 
folks who are concerned with too much or too little content 
moderation to address those concerns specifically.
    But this bill dealing with anticompetitive harms has a 
secondary impact, that by promoting competitive choices, lets 
users vote with their feet and go elsewhere if they don't like 
the moderation choices that they're given on a specific 
platform. So, I don't think it's restrictive at all, and I 
don't find those choices to moderate content to be 
anticompetitive.
    Senator Grassley. Ms. Lewis.
    Ms. Lewis. Thank you. So, I do not agree with Professor 
Francis' analysis here. And I also, in terms of--there was a 
suggestion that adding consumer welfare--those words--into the 
statute of AICOA would be a good thing. I disagree with that. 
Consumer welfare is not a word that appears in any of our 
antitrust statutes, and can be interpreted to be extremely 
narrow and refer only to harms from price. Now, and certainly 
in digital markets, the harms go far beyond price to privacy 
and other non-price dimensions. So codifying that, I think, 
would be a mistake.
    I also find it interesting that Professor Francis has said 
that the current antitrust laws is what we should work with and 
what we should invest in. Those laws, those statutes are 
extremely vague, very short.
    And the language that was used in those antitrust statutes, 
well, that was new language, when those when those laws were 
passed.
    Because it was using a new phrase, does that mean we 
shouldn't have passed those laws? So I think that what I see as 
a somewhat unfounded fear of courts interpreting harm to 
competition in a way that would prohibit procompetitive 
conduct. I don't think that that is a good reason to oppose 
this bill.
    Chair Klobuchar. Well, thank you. And thank you, Senator 
Grassley, for your work on the bill, the Merger Fees, but also 
for being the lead Sponsor on the bill that we're talking about 
today.
    And I will note the hearing you referred to, Mr. Lewis, is 
actually going to be chaired by Senator Blumenthal. The Section 
230 hearing with Senator Hawley--I believe, coming up tomorrow. 
So, we're on top of things. Okay. Next up is Senator 
Whitehouse.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman Klobuchar.
    And let me start with a particular welcome to Ms. Lewis. As 
a friend, colleague, and admirer of David Cicilline's, I'm very 
glad that you are here, and thank you for his work supporting 
the efforts of the House Judiciary Committee.
    I have two questions, and given the short period of time, I 
would invite specifically Ms. Scott Morton, Mr. Lewis, and Ms. 
Lewis, to answer as questions for the record. But given that, 
we'll have a little bit of time, I invite you to jump in.
    The two questions are, first, we have the EU's Digital 
Markets Act coming on, and I'm interested in what effect you 
see that having in this marketplace, and what lessons we should 
take from the effect of that law in this marketplace. 
Presumably, the minimum conclusion one could draw is that you 
can legislate in this space and not break everything. But I'd 
be interested in your views about that.
    And the second, to the point suggested just now by Chairman 
Klobuchar, is how do you see Section 230? As problematic or 
helpful in this space? And I'll flag my bias. I think it's 
problematic. I think a lot of these problems would have sorted 
themselves out a lot earlier if these industries weren't 
protected from several centuries of legal tradition that govern 
human behavior, so----
    Professor Scott Morton. I'll just jump in on the DMA 
quickly----
    Senator Whitehouse. Please.
    Professor Scott Morton [continuing]. And say that it's 
going to be very interesting for the United States to see how 
platforms respond to the DMA. Because there will be some 
instances, I imagine, where it's easier, more cost effective to 
have one business model and run it globally. In which case, the 
changes made to comply with the DMA will be taken advantage of 
by American consumers----
    Senator Whitehouse. Yes.
    Professor Scott Morton [continuing]. And businesses. I can 
also----
    Senator Whitehouse. We see that in automobiles when 
California----
    Professor Scott Morton. Correct.
    Senator Whitehouse [continuing]. Puts its standards out.
    Professor Scott Morton. Exactly.
    Senator Whitehouse. Nobody makes two cars.
    Professor Scott Morton. Exactly. But there will be other 
cases where, look, if the platform can run an exploitative 
model in the United States and a competitive one in Europe, and 
they make more money doing that, then they'll choose to do 
that. And so we're going to see those kinds of choices as well 
as then be able to learn from the smoothness, or lack thereof, 
in new products, or lack thereof, as to what are the most 
effective rules.
    Senator Whitehouse. And who do you expect most effectively 
to look at that behavior and draw lessons from it in the U.S. 
Government?
    Professor Scott Morton. In the U.S. Government?
    Senator Whitehouse. Mm-hmm.
    Professor Scott Morton. I don't know. I mean, the European 
Commission is going to get reports from platforms and 
confidential information on what's changed and what they're 
doing. I don't know that we have any way to study it in the 
U.S. Government----
    Senator Whitehouse. Do you think----
    Professor Scott Morton [continuing]. That I'm aware of.
    Senator Whitehouse [continuing]. The FCC would be up to the 
task of looking at that.
    Professor Scott Morton. Would who?
    Senator Whitehouse. The FCC.
    Professor Scott Morton. That would be a great idea. Ask 
them to write a report. Yes.
    Senator Whitehouse. Okay. Mr. Lewis.
    Mr. Lewis. Senator, you asked about Section 230.
    Senator Whitehouse. Yes.
    Mr. Lewis. While we're very supportive of these efforts to 
promote competition, I think Section 230, and the issues around 
it, are a different issue. Section 230 was crafted to support 
the creation of third-party content online--both the choice to 
moderate it and the choice not to moderate it.
    And I think it's an essential protection that, combined 
with smart competition policy, actually gives folks choices to 
express themselves freely on whatever platform they choose to, 
based on the moderation practices that that platform uses.
    I think transparency of those moderation practices is 
important. I think due process is important. But it's----
    Senator Whitehouse. I guess you and I are going to disagree 
on that.
    Mr. Lewis. We might disagree. Yes.
    Senator Whitehouse. Ms. Lewis.
    Ms. Lewis. Thank you. So you asked what lesson could be 
learned from the enactment of the DMA. I think one important 
lesson is what you referenced is, we see that you can pass 
legislation here to rein in the dominant digital platforms and 
stop the abuse of their market power over businesses and 
consumers.
    And you can do that without breaking these products and 
services that consumers love. These two things are in no way 
mutually exclusive. And so we are already seeing, or at least 
it was reported, for example, that Apple--who said if we pass 
OAMA, we're going to break the iPhone and the App Store system, 
and create problems for users, in terms of safety and security.
    Well, it turns out or, at least, it's reported that in 
Europe, in order to comply with the DMA, that they are 
preparing to allow for alternative app stores. So, how is it 
that--you know, it's interesting that they say here last 
Congress, to U.S. Members, oh, you cannot pass this law. It 
will break the product. It will break the phone. And then there 
are reports that they're voluntarily agreeing to make these 
changes. I will say not purely voluntarily because it's in 
response to the law.
    And if we want to see similar benefits for U.S. consumers 
and businesses, then I think we similarly need to pass 
legislation.
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you, very much. And thank you for 
that excellent point, Ms. Lewis, because I just don't think 
we're just going to wait and let Europe have the benefits for 
10, 15 years.
    They're not going to do it unless we start moving, and then 
maybe they'll negotiate with us. Okay. Next up, Senator 
Blumenthal, who knows a little bit about this topic. Thank you.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Madam Chair. And thank you for 
your profoundly persistent and courageous work in this area. 
Thanks to our Ranking Member, as well. I'm very proud to be 
working with you on a number of these bills, including your 
American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which does far more 
than just stop self-preferencing. It is very, very potentially 
significant.
    And my Open App Markets Act, the reference was made earlier 
to Section 230. Yes, we are having a hearing tomorrow--
Judiciary Committee hearing, the Tech and Privacy Subcommittee. 
Senator Hawley and I are going to be exploring potential 
reforms to Section 230.
    But let me just begin with the comment that Senator 
Klobuchar just made. If we wait for Big Tech to reform itself, 
we're going to be old men and women. We may not be around to 
see anything happen. And to the point about content moderation, 
let's be very clear. Big Tech has an abysmal record on civil 
rights and safety. It helped foster and fuel racial 
discrimination, threats, and privacy violations that have a 
material and costly impact on people's real lives.
    These behemoth corporations are not protectors of 
vulnerable communities nor of free expression. So if we wait 
for them to do that as well, we just are not going to see it. 
There is an elephant in the room, which is Big Tech's response 
to this legislation. And I'm not speaking for Senator 
Klobuchar, just for myself. I would say it's an unprecedented 
smear campaign, a disinformation strategy. One of the elements 
of that disinformation campaign is to say, it's a dire threat 
to cybersecurity and privacy.
    As anybody who's read both of our measures knows, we take 
specific steps. We insert very explicit provisions, which Big 
Tech says need to be much broader, trying to create loopholes 
and exceptions that swallow the rule.
    I wonder, Professor Scott Morton, whether you would 
describe--you allude to some of them in your testimony. And I 
know you're not a lawyer. I always think of you as a lawyer 
because you know so much more law than most of us on the 
Judiciary Committee--speaking, again, just for myself--but 
you're also a very astute and learned economist. I wonder if 
you could talk about how those exceptions provide for privacy 
and security?
    Professor Scott Morton. Thank you, Senator. I always get a 
warm welcome from the Senator from Connecticut, which I 
appreciate. The important safeguards in these bills, I think, 
are doing exactly what you say. It would be counterintuitive to 
have a bill that's going to promote consumers' welfare and have 
there be dangerous products.
    And therefore we want to give the platforms the ability to 
control that. And there are many ways to do that. And it is in 
the platform's interest to do that because if you want to 
attract users to your platform, you want it to be safe and a 
good experience.
    So, I just see no reason why with all the technological 
capability these platforms have, they can't design the product 
to be safe. And given that both bills allow them to do that, 
I'm really thinking that American ingenuity is going to make 
this work out just fine.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. Ms. Lewis, you made the 
comment just now that Apple may be developing a system to 
enable apps access to their phones in Europe, but I'm not sure 
we can count on those products being available here. Shouldn't 
Americans have as much access to competition, fair play, 
innovation, as European consumers?
    Ms. Lewis. Senator Blumenthal, I agree with you 100 
percent. And the--it is just critical that American businesses 
and consumers can benefit from the increased choice in terms of 
alternative app distribution. And this would also likely result 
in not only cost savings for consumers, but also spur 
innovation and growth among U.S. companies. And so it is U.S. 
consumers, and it is also U.S. businesses.
    The U.S. economy does not just consist of these four 
dominant platforms. And so if we want to see the economy thrive 
and our consumers benefit from competition, then legislation 
must be passed in the United States to do that.
    Senator Blumenthal. I'm at the end of my time. I have a 
bunch of other questions, but I just want to thank all the 
members of the panel for being here today and your last 
comment. These measures are really pro-business. Maybe they're 
not pro-monopolist or pro-predatory conduct, but they are pro-
business. And as complicated as it seems, the internet 
befuddles a lot of people.
    Think of it in terms of the old days of the railroads. If 
the railroads had said you can only run our boxcars with only 
our manufactured goods because we control the rails, you didn't 
need any smoke-filled rooms to know that was going to be 
anticonsumer and anti-business. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you very much, Senator Blumenthal. 
Someone else who knows a lot about this, has been a leader in 
this area, Senator Hirono is with us. Thank you.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Madam Chair. It's so good to be 
on the Subcommittee, and I thank the Ranking Member also. It's 
been really challenging to do anything to regulate these very 
powerful digital platforms. So, the AICOA bill, when we start 
talking about making changes to Section 230, it's just been 
almost hellacious, I'd say.
    So, I think Professor Scott Morton, you said something 
along the lines of the current antitrust law have not been 
particularly effective in regulating digital platforms. Did I 
hear you correctly that you said something along those lines?
    Professor Scott Morton. Yes, I did.
    Senator Hirono. Mr. Lewis, do you agree with that kind of 
characterization of the current antitrust laws?
    Mr. Lewis. Yes.
    Senator Hirono. So, what if AICOA, which is, I think, 
pretty specific in what it wants to do, would it help to have a 
law like that, which is much more specific than the current 
antitrust laws?
    Professor Scott Morton. In my opinion, it would. And that's 
because the current antitrust laws have requirements such as 
defining relevant markets and predicting but for outcomes that 
turn out to be quite challenging in fast-moving digital 
markets. And if Congress wants better enforcement here, I think 
it's very helpful to give more explicit instructions to courts 
on how to get there.
    Senator Hirono. Mr. Lewis, did you want to add something?
    Mr. Lewis. Just the thought that, you know, these are often 
referred to as antitrust bills, but they're very specific in 
the prohibited conduct. And that, part of what we've seen in 
the weakness of the current antitrust laws, is just how they've 
been interpreted.
    And so I think there are ways in which, with cases brought 
that challenge monopoly under the current antitrust laws, to 
look at different ways to think about the power of monopoly. 
But this specific bill, AICOA, I think, adds just more tools to 
the toolbox for those antitrust enforcers.
    Senator Hirono. Oh, back in the day when the Sherman Act 
and Clayton Acts were passed--and, yes, we have decades of 
interpretation of both of these laws--but nobody predicted that 
we would have these kinds of hugely powerful digital platforms 
that--that millions of people use. And basically, there's very 
little, apparently, that we can do to make sure that consumers 
are protected.
    And so, Mr. Lewis, you mentioned that Public Knowledge has 
called repeatedly for a new competition promoting expert 
regulator for digital platforms. And I think that is 
acknowledging that maybe we need a whole new kind of legal 
framework for regulating digital platforms. So, can you just 
explain a little bit more about what you had in mind with that 
proposal?
    Mr. Lewis. Sure. The idea of an expert digital regulator is 
to complement antitrust enforcement, not to replace it. And a 
regulator, we think, would have authority over consumer 
protection, authority over, or involvement with, competition 
harms and concerns.
    You know, my background is in telecommunications. We're 
impressed with the relationship between the FCC and the 
antitrust enforcers----
    Senator Hirono. Mm-hmm.
    Mr. Lewis [continuing]. Where they work together when 
looking at mergers, when looking at--you know, with a different 
standard at the public interest harms. And so an expert digital 
regulator would be able to do that to address things that can't 
be dealt with through competition policy.
    So, you know, I think it could be structured in a number of 
different ways. It could be an existing agency. It could be a 
new agency. There's interesting proposals out there from 
Senator Bennet and Senator Welch that we're interested in and 
supportive of. It's a challenge to set up. But I think taking 
the time to look through the harms that you want an agency to 
address, and giving them the proper authority to do so, and the 
resources to do so, I think----
    Senator Hirono. My time----
    Mr. Lewis [continuing]. Would help Congress. Yes.
    Senator Hirono [continuing]. Is running out. Thank you.
    Ms. Scott Morton, would you agree that perhaps a new kind 
of agency, or a person or two, to be focused on consumer harms 
and the public interest----
    Professor Scott Morton. Yes, I do.
    Senator Hirono [continuing]. Would rein in digital 
platforms?
    Professor Scott Morton. It's what we normally do in the 
United States. We invent airplanes, we have an airplane 
regulator. We invent trains, we have a train regulator. We 
invent drugs, we have a drug regulator. There's no regulator 
for digital, and there's a lot of problems as a result. So, I 
agree.
    Senator Hirono. I agree with you. Thank you for talking 
about that.
    And Ms. Lewis, you noted that the DMA that Europe has 
passed, the companies are able to make the appropriate 
adjustments.
    So, there's nothing to say that we can't pass something 
that is--the AICOA is narrower than the DMA, isn't it, in its 
focus?
    Ms. Lewis. To give you a more complete answer, I would want 
to get back to you in writing. But, I think--I think it is, the 
AICOA is narrower, and I have done a comparison of that.
    Senator Hirono. Oh, thank you. We would appreciate having 
that. But the world is not going to come to an end because 
Europe passed the DMA. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chair Klobuchar. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Next up, 
Senator Padilla.
    Senator Padilla. Thank you, Madam Chair. And particularly, 
I want to thank you for your leadership on these issues.
    I think it's vitally important, not just for the 
innovators, and investors, and entrepreneurs, but for 
consumers, and workers, and the overall health of our economy, 
that we have an open, and innovative, and competitive 
technology sector.
    So, I hope we can continue to work closely together, this 
Congress, to build upon the great work that has already been 
done to better identify market failures, and areas of 
underenforcement, and to develop more precise legislative 
remedies to specifically address the issues that we're facing.
    Now, during the Committee's consideration last year of the 
American Innovation and Choice Online Act, I expressed concerns 
that provisions of the bill may open the covered platforms to 
either lawsuits, or even threats of lawsuits, for decisions 
they made to enforce their content moderation policies against 
hate speech, misinformation, and other content that they may 
want to not host.
    And several academics, nonprofit groups, and other 
Senators, actually voiced similar concerns. And even supporters 
of the bill approached my office with differing opinions. I was 
told by some supporters that no such problems existed, while 
other supporters told me that, yes, the concerns raised were 
indeed valid.
    Question for Professor Francis. Should we be concerned 
about the bill's unintended impacts on platform content 
moderation, and is this an area where the bill can be improved 
through additional clarity?
    Professor Francis. I think so, Senator. I'm certainly not 
an expert on either the practices or the law of content 
moderation. But as I read this bill from the perspective of an 
antitrust person thinking about what compliance would look 
like, I look at two things, and they both give me the concern 
you've just articulated.
    So, one is Section 3(a)(3) of the bill, which prohibits 
discrimination with respect to the application or enforcement 
of terms of service in favor of business users against 
similarly situated business users.
    Now, as I read it, that would include content moderation of 
various kinds that a court ultimately concluded, or even a 
State attorney general alleged, was discriminatory.
    And then we look at our affirmative defenses. AICOA 
provides no defense on the ground that what was restricted was 
spam, was supplying false, or objectionable content. Nothing in 
there that one might plausibly identify with content 
moderation. So, regardless of how one feels about the optimal 
content moderation law, this very sharply raises the question, 
but doesn't answer it.
    And to my mind, what that means is litigation, threats of 
litigation, a lot of uncertainty, and a lot of deterrent effect 
running in ways we almost certainly don't want.
    Senator Padilla. Well, the American Innovation and Choice 
Online Act, as we discussed and debated in the Committee last 
year, attempts to address several market problems at once.
    However, I worry that in doing so, it may inadvertently do 
harm to products and services that consumers actually enjoy. 
For example, in broadly and presumptively making unlawful the 
prefe-rencing of a platform's own product, services, or lines 
of business, is it possible that basic and convenient features 
of integrated products and services that consumers enjoy, and 
benefit from, would be prohibited, and subject to unnecessary 
and, perhaps, chilling scrutiny? Professor Francis, I'll let 
you go first here.
    Professor Francis. I completely share that concern. So 
things that would constitute self-preferencing cover an array 
of things that are clearly great for consumers. Integrating 
functions like map results in search. Or better integrating 
your own voice assistant because you found a way to do that.
    Pre-installing apps or features on a device without doing 
that for the whole world. Bundling services together, or even, 
in order to create a more secure and seamless experience, just 
say, hey, we're going to have a closed system on this part of 
our platform where we're not going to have third-party 
participation.
    All of that stuff is self-preferencing, and then the whole 
game is whether or not there's harm to competition. Number one, 
that term is central and undefined. If nothing else, that is a 
ton of uncertainty, and the prospect of being dragged through 
investigations, litigations, injunctions, huge penalties, and 
even having executive personal compensation taken away, that's 
going to deter a lot of behavior that we would want to see from 
platforms that they'd otherwise do.
    Senator Padilla. Well, I'll just conclude with this, Madam 
Chair, because I still agree with the stated objective here of 
our legislative efforts. But I want to continue to work with 
you, and the experts here, to make sure that we're getting it 
right. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you, very much.
    So, Professor Francis, you said you were not an expert on 
the content moderation. So I'm going to turn to some people 
that I think could shed some light on it, but I appreciated 
your answers.
    Ms. Lewis and Mr. Lewis, we'll turn to the two Lewises 
here, could you talk about what this bill is about, the 
American Innovation and Choice Online Act?
    And I'll start with you, Ms. Lewis, whether or not the bill 
would have impact on the speech rights of anyone on a covered 
platform. I point out that Senator Grassley and I worked to 
ensure that the bill is focused solely on addressing digital 
platform competition issues. But that, of course, hasn't 
stopped the bill's opponents from raising dubious arguments 
related to free speech. And so I thought you, Ms. Lewis, might 
want to address that. So, please, go ahead.
    Ms. Lewis. Yes, thank you, Senator Klobuchar. 
Unfortunately, I think that this debate over content moderation 
or, sort of, the critiques that are aimed at AICOA, are a 
divisive distraction. In my view, AICOA does not impact content 
moderation. It does not make it harder for a gatekeeper 
platform to engage in content moderation, and it does not make 
it easier for the digital gatekeeper to engage in content 
moderation. The bill simply has nothing to do with it.
    And in terms of the idea that certain things may be--you 
mentioned the word, ``dubious,'' and the idea that certain 
things may be possible, I would not even concede that it is 
possible. But let's say it is possible that a State AG, or I, 
could interpret the bill in that way. I don't think it's 
plausible. And I don't think--when we think about very unlikely 
things that could occur and possible far-fetched outcomes, I 
think we should be thinking about what is plausible rather than 
what is improbable and unlikely. Again, in summary, AICOA does 
not affect content moderation.
    Chair Klobuchar. Thank you. Senator Padilla had to leave, 
but we will convey your testimony to him. Mr. Lewis, do you 
want to answer that as well?
    Mr. Lewis. I guess what I would add, because I agree with 
Ms. Lewis, what I would add is just that the language in the 
bill is so specific. Mr. Francis keeps pointing to the 
competition harm phrase. But I think it's very important that 
the Attorney General, the Federal antitrust official, would 
have to go to court and make a case for what is materially 
harming competition in the practice of the platform. And so I 
don't read that phrase as referring to content moderation. But 
if someone wants to bring that case, they would have to point 
to what that practice is.
    Simply limiting someone's content that they posted online, 
I don't see how that hurts competition when there's so many 
places where you can post online, and folks can create their 
own websites. So there's a great opportunity to speak. So, 
proving that case just seems very hard. I think that's what Ms. 
Lewis----
    Chair Klobuchar. Right. Yes.
    Mr. Lewis [continuing]. Means by impractical.
    Chair Klobuchar. We also note that the Attorney General, 
the Justice Department, supports this bill as well, so.
    Mr. Lewis, again, kind of changing topics here. Numerous 
reports have suggested that Amazon creates knockoffs--these 
are, you know, Wall Street Journal stories and the like--of 
third-party sellers' products and uses its algorithm to give 
its own brands an advantage.
    A recent study by economists at the National Bureau of 
Economic Research found that Amazon-branded products are ranked 
higher than observably similar products in consumer search 
results on Amazon's platform.
    How do these practices affect competition and the 
incentives of small businesses to create new innovative 
products, and how can some common-sense rules of the road--
maybe you want to start with this--help protect small 
businesses to compete against these mammoth companies?
    Mr. Lewis. Right. I think the rules in AICOA go a long way 
to protect those practices. The difference between an online 
marketplace, like Amazon, and a brick-and-mortar marketplace 
are very different. The ability to control data, to see all the 
data that's coming in about sales, about the products, the 
limited space, and the control of that space where products are 
seen, is just very different.
    The scope and scale of an online marketplace is just wholly 
different from what we see in brick and mortar. And so having 
these sort of specific rules protecting the small businesses 
and the products that they want to bring to that market since 
it's one of their few choices that they have to reach consumers 
is critically important.
    Chair Klobuchar. Mm-hmm.
    Maybe I'll ask you this--it looks like, Ms. Lewis you want 
to say something, but I want to--just very quickly.
    Ms. Lewis. Yes. So, I think the self-preferencing that you 
just mentioned is a perfect example of what can be 
anticompetitive self-preferencing. And so you have the 
situation where Amazon is putting its thumb on the scale to 
distort competition. And that's the situation where third-party 
sellers, who maybe come up with new ideas, or have high 
quality, maybe better-quality products, are not being able to 
compete on the merits of their goods and services----
    Chair Klobuchar. Okay.
    Ms. Lewis [continuing]. Their goods, in this case.
    Chair Klobuchar. All right. And then I just want to make--
you mentioned these conflicting statements. And if you could 
just quickly mention this. I think this is so important. We 
made it clear in the bill that it would not impact 
subscription-based services like Amazon Prime, despite Amazon's 
claims. And I noticed these lying pop-up ads that I've shown to 
my colleagues because that's what they're done--they're done to 
scare other people if they support the bill.
    And so now, Amazon in Europe has pledged to allow sellers 
to use other shipping and logistics services and still be part 
of Amazon Prime. And they are doing this to settle an 
investigation by the European Commission.
    The exact thing that they said would break Prime in the 
U.S. That's what their claims are. How do we square the story 
Amazon is telling us here in the Senate, and what they are 
actually doing in Europe, and what they're doing to our 
consumers versus what's happening in Europe?
    Ms. Lewis. Unfortunately, I think it's an example of 
doublespeak. I understand that Amazon has incentives to want to 
hold on to the profits that they may--and the revenues that 
they may get from self-preferencing. And in doing so, perhaps 
they overreached in their arguments to regulators and 
legislators here.
    But the proof is in the pudding. If they are offering this 
up, they offered this up as a voluntary commitment that, in 
fact, they can do this and still continue to offer Amazon 
Prime, there is your answer. I'm not sure how to square it 
other than that the original argument was disingenuous.
    Chair Klobuchar. Okay. I have another question about 
another hypocrisy, but I'll go in, to let Senator Lee go.
    Senator Lee. Thanks. Professor Candeub, did you want to 
respond to that last point we were talking about? I think there 
was a hanging chad there somewhere.
    [Laughter.]
    Professor Candeub. The content moderation issue?
    Senator Lee. Yes.
    Professor Candeub. Yes. I think it's an interesting 
question, and it does go, as correctly pointed out, to the 
Section, I guess it's 3(3), that prohibits a platform from 
discriminating in the application and enforcement of the terms 
of service of the covered platforms amongst similarly situated 
business users----
    Senator Lee. I'm having a hard time hearing you, again.
    Professor Candeub. Oh.
    Senator Lee. Can you move your microphone?
    Chair Klobuchar. Could you move your microphone?
    Professor Candeub. Yes.
    Senator Lee. Yes, thanks.
    Professor Candeub. Is that better?
    Senator Lee. Yes, that's better.
    Professor Candeub. Okay.
    Senator Lee. Thanks.
    Professor Candeub. So it goes back to the Section 3 that 
prohibits discrimination among similarly situated business 
users. And so what does that actually mean in life? Well, you 
could imagine, you know, a dating app that only is for, you 
know, Nazis, or, you know, Communists, or something like that, 
and a platform didn't want to have it. And the question is, 
what would be the remedy? I think it was pointed out they would 
not have a private right of action. I mean, you'd have to find 
some attorney general or the Department of Justice to take up 
their cause, which I would find extremely unlikely. So, you 
know, I do that in the abstract. It does present this problem. 
But I think, in reality, it's not something that is likely to 
occur.
    Senator Lee. Right, right. And if it were to occur, we're 
talking about a very weird niche market. I mean it----
    Professor Candeub. Yes.
    Senator Lee [continuing]. One that, that would not likely 
amount to a significant percentage of the population, everyone 
would hope. And so if you ended up in that circumstance, you'd 
be dealing with something different than where you have 
politically motivated content moderation decisions that may cut 
against where roughly half of Americans are excluded from it. 
Is that part of your point?
    Professor Candeub. Yes, precisely, because there is no 
private right of action. I mean, you'd have to have the 
judgment and common sense of elected officials, and I would be 
very surprised that they would take up that cause.
    Senator Lee. Right. All right, back in 2021, Apple, Google, 
and Amazon, as you mentioned a little while ago, de-platformed 
Parler. This, of course, was a popular and quickly growing 
competitor to Twitter that was favored by many in the sort of 
libertarian-to-conservative community.
    Conservatives have, of course, been lectured for years that 
if conservatives don't like how a tech platform moderates 
content, then they should just go build your own, as many of us 
were told.
    So the Parler example, I think, illustrated how shallow and 
how empty that response would be. Do you agree that Google and 
Apple ought to be barred from preventing users from installing 
apps of their choice on their devices?
    Professor Candeub. I think that's a reasonable, targeted 
remedy. As I pointed out, Google and Apple are only able to 
skew public discourse because of the market power they enjoy. I 
think a targeted solution that says, you know, look, you are--
you're unusual. You're sui generis. You're the big guys. We all 
depend upon you. You have general obligations to the 
institutional values of the United States. And I think that 
would be a targeted and limited approach that would be 
effective.
    Senator Lee. Part of what has left so many of us cynical 
about what happened with Parler is the fact that Parler was--it 
had hit its sweet spot. It had hit its stride. It was doubling. 
I don't remember what the stats were, but it was doubling its 
user base every 6 weeks, or something like that. It was growing 
by leaps and bounds. And all of a sudden in early 2021, out of 
the clear blue, some tech giants combine together and all 
decide, as if miraculously, that they're going to shut them 
down. And they do shut them down.
    Now, they make decisions eventually that allows Parler to 
come back, but by then, the party is over. By then, it had lost 
the vibe. And, you know, these things are such that if you cut 
that off at the wrong time, and you take them essentially 
offline for a couple of months, it's a death knell. And they've 
never recovered as a result.
    Professor Scott Morton, could we have avoided the situation 
that we're in today if we had just had better enforcement of 
our antitrust laws over the last 10 or 15 years or so?
    Professor Scott Morton. Thank you, Senator. I think the 
answer is not so much enforcement, but the jurisprudence in the 
courts. When you have rules like Brooke Group, and 
jurisprudence like Amex and Trinko, it really sets such a high 
bar for the plaintiffs that you can have very good enforcers, 
but they just aren't going to win in the places where the 
consumer needs them to win.
    Senator Lee. Do you think that the antitrust law has been 
weakened by lax enforcement? Is that part of your point?
    Professor Scott Morton. No. I think it's been weakened by a 
tradition that's very old now, from the Chicago School in the 
1970s that made a lot of assumptions for courts. Like, markets 
will self-correct on their own. You should be really afraid to 
enforce that--that predatory pricing doesn't exist. 
Oligopolists can't collude--things that we know to be actually 
not part of the economic learning that we have and not part of 
how markets work.
    But if you make those assumptions, you don't need antitrust 
enforcement. And courts have been therefore dialing it back 
really quite steadily over the last 40 years.
    Senator Lee. Professor Francis, how do you respond to the 
same question?
    Professor Francis. I agree with, I think, almost everything 
Professor Scott Morton said. I think, you know, a lot of the 
criticism that has been leveled at enforcement agencies would 
better have been leveled at the decisions of the Federal courts 
on some important margins in the last couple of decades.
    But I'll add that I also think part of the problem is that 
our statutory standards, even though we've been working on them 
for 130-odd years, in the case of the Sherman Act, could really 
use some clarification. Right.
    So 1890, the Sherman Act gives us restraint of trade and 
monopolies. Those are still battlegrounds in litigation today. 
1914, the Clayton Act substantially lessened competition. The 
courts, for sure, have been taking--you know, antitrust cases 
should be hard to win, but they shouldn't be impossible to win. 
So courts have been unduly, sort of, receptive to defendant 
arguments for several decades.
    But it's not just the courts. It's also the fact that 
they're looking at statutes that really could be clarified by 
Congress in some pretty common-sense ways that I think would 
really sharpen antitrust on some very important margins: 
monopolization law, merger law, in particular.
    Senator Lee. And doesn't that suggest that a lot of these 
problems could, and should, be dealt with most appropriately 
through reforms to the way we enforce them? Reforms like those 
suggested in the TEAM Act rather than implementing expansive, 
untested new regulatory regimes?
    Professor Francis. I think that antitrust enforcement, not 
just for a small number of tech companies, but across the 
economy, is the most important competition policy problem we 
face right now and an urgent need. And I want to just respond 
to the idea that AICOA is a kind of fast-track antitrust, it 
really is not. Antitrust enforcement focuses on the use of 
market power in ways that harm consumers. When you consider all 
procompetitive justifications for a practice, it would be 
protecting interplatform competition here, making sure that we 
weren't suppressing or deterring the emergence of competitors 
of Google, and Facebook, and Apple, and others. And it rejects 
the kind of blanket duty to deal that AICOA imposes. So it's 
not----
    Senator Lee. So it's almost anti-antitrust.
    Professor Francis. That is----
    Senator Lee. Double----
    Professor Francis [continuing]. Exactly----
    Senator Lee [continuing]. Negative. It's just a trust at 
that point.
    Professor Francis. It turns the trading partners of these 
platforms, who would be the very businesses best placed to 
become or to sponsor competitors, into stakeholders in the 
status quo. And not only is this not antitrust, it's not even 
accelerated antitrust.
    If Congress passes this bill, we're going to see a 
generational landslide of litigation over concepts like 
critical trading partner, fair and neutral search rankings, 
preference--part of, or intrinsic to, a digital project. The 
mechanism of enforcement is the same as antitrust. We're going 
to see enforcement actions brought by agencies moving through 
the Federal court at the same pace as antitrust but doing less 
good.
    Senator Lee. So 133 years later, we're still arguing over 
meaning of things enacted in 1890. If we enact other language, 
you know, sure, we're still haggling over it, but we have 
developed, over time, a pretty sound understanding of what they 
mean. If we develop this, this could be another 130 years of 
exploratory litigation. It would be really good to fund the 
private college educations of the children of lawyers 
everywhere but could create chaos.
    Professor Francis. This is going to cost the economy a 
fortune in compliance costs and attorney fees, even before we 
get to foregone innovations or failure to protect consumers. I 
would love to see us take a fraction of that money and use it 
to support antitrust enforcement.
    Senator Lee. All right. Let's talk about the Open App 
Markets Act for a minute. It, of course, banned dominant app 
stores from using MFNs. Would this help bring more competition 
to that space?
    Professor Francis. I think it could, Senator. And one of 
the things that I like about it is that this promotes 
interplatform competition. So the idea is that if you take away 
the power of an app store with market or monopoly power to say 
to app developers, hey, don't offer a better price elsewhere--
if you take away their ability to do that, then suddenly big 
app developers can sponsor competition against the app store 
itself by offering discounts or other preferred terms. So I 
would support an MFN ban here, as in other markets with market 
or monopoly power.
    Senator Lee. Professor Lewis, would AICOA prevent a company 
like Amazon from charging different prices to business users on 
its platform based on a user's size?
    Ms. Lewis. Oh, I'm sorry. Ms. Lewis. I'm not a professor, 
but----
    Senator Lee. I'm sorry.
    Ms. Lewis. That's okay.
    Senator Lee. Today you are.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Lewis. I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?
    Senator Lee. Yes. Would AICOA, as you read it, would it 
prevent a company like Amazon from charging different prices to 
different business users on its platform based on their size or 
the volume in which they deal?
    Ms. Lewis. So, on it, my--my reading of it is that it would 
not, but I would want to go back and really do an analysis to 
look at the statute and confirm that that's accurate.
    Senator Lee. Do you think it's unfair to charge different 
businesses different prices based on their size?
    Ms. Lewis. So, again, I think I would have to give that 
some more thought because there's really--there's no context 
there. So I would really want to look at the individual facts 
of the situation before I would make a blanket statement.
    Senator Lee. Okay. Professor Scott Morton, let's go back to 
you for a minute. AICOA would require enforcement actions to be 
brought in Federal court. While I've got concerns with the 
breadth of the bill, I view this element as absolutely 
essential to protecting due process. Would you agree with that?
    Professor Scott Morton. Yes, that's right.
    Senator Lee. What in your view--are there things that would 
be better than this, or is this the right thing to do it?
    Professor Scott Morton. Well, I think as I said in my 
statement, in some ideal future world, we have a regulator who 
is expert, and can use the public interest standard, not just 
competition, but privacy, security, all these other issues 
you've been raising.
    In the absence of that regulator, I'm against the status 
quo. I think we should try to move forward with a bill like 
this. I think the possibility of public enforcement, rather 
than private enforcement, limits the kinds of cases that are 
being brought to ones that are meritorious and necessary.
    And so with luck, you wouldn't get platforms engaging in 
litigation where it's pretty clear that the instructions in the 
statute require them to do something.
    Senator Lee. But do you think it would be preferable to 
have them handled by experts in an enforcement agency, sort of, 
a beefed-up panel of uber-experts?
    Professor Scott Morton. Well, as I said, when we invent 
technologies, typically, in the United States, we also bring a 
regulator along with them--whether that's trains, or 
pharmaceuticals, or airplanes, or whatever. And I don't think 
this technology is any different in that regard.
    But it usually takes Congress a really long time to 
regulate dangerous things. I don't know why that is. You 
probably do. And so in the meanwhile, I think something like 
this, where we're working through the courts and building off 
of what we know from the antitrust context, is an excellent 
first step.
    Senator Lee. Okay. Thank you.
    Chair Klobuchar. Very good. Senator Blumenthal.
    Senator Blumenthal. Yes. Just a couple of quick questions. 
First, let me just say on the issue of enforcement, you know, I 
spent most of my career in enforcement. Some of it, in fact, in 
antitrust enforcement as State attorney general. So I'm all in 
on enforcement.
    And I'm also--frankly, I've been critical of Federal 
antitrust enforcement.
    Often the States were ahead of the Federal Government in 
some cases on antitrust enforcement, which I say with some 
pride as a former State attorney general. But enforcement can't 
invent laws. You know, people used to say to me, ``Oh, you're 
too aggressive,'' even when we won cases. And I used to say, 
``Well, it's not me that gives us the power, it's the law. I 
can't do anything without the law on my side.''
    So when we talk about clarifying or improving, we're just 
giving enforcers the tools that they need. And some of it is to 
avoid those loopholes, and exemptions, and exceptions that can 
swallow the rules.
    Let me ask you Professor Scott Morton, and others can 
answer too. I understand that there have been media reports 
indicating that the Department of Justice is investigating 
Apple for some of the same exclusionary and tying practices 
that the Open App Markets Act and the American Innovation and 
Choice Online Act would help to prevent.
    Why should we not just rely on the Department of Justice to 
try to enforce existing law at some point, I don't know, a 
year, 2 years, 5 years, a decade from now?
    Professor Scott Morton. Well, I think you've answered your 
own question. The Google search case, that was filed in 2020, 
hasn't come to trial yet. Typically, a case takes some years of 
investigation before it's brought. Then the court needs to 
write an opinion. Then there's an appeal, and it goes from 
there. And at the end of that process, it's not clear what the 
remedy is, because the platform has become so entrenched, over 
so long, that it's really hard to do anything to restore the 
lost competition.
    So that's why I think this bill is really useful, because 
it holds out the prospect of much more immediate relief for 
consumers. We would have competition on the platform, in short 
order. And I think that's both safer and quicker for consumers.
    Senator Blumenthal. Well----
    Professor Francis. Senator, do you mind if I accept your 
invitation----
    Senator Blumenthal. Yes, please do.
    Professor Francis [continuing]. To add something? I can't 
understand why anyone thinks AICOA enforcement will be any 
faster than antitrust enforcement. It's going to be complaints 
filed in the same Federal courts, proceeding under the same 
discovery rules, on the same slow timetables. Except, all the 
terms are new, and don't have the benefit of 130 years of 
precedent and doctrine to guide them.
    This is not like the DMA. To make the DMA work, the 
institutional structure of the European Union is critical. The 
European Commission proposed it. They issue implementing Acts 
to tell specific companies how to comply. They conduct 
compliance audits. They take enforcement actions, and then they 
issue decisions on them.
    So, there's only one actor that has a bureaucratic monopoly 
on the process. And whether or not one likes that system, that 
is not our order.
    Ms. Lewis. I----
    Professor Francis. So, I don't think this would be faster 
at all.
    Ms. Lewis. I disagree----
    Senator Blumenthal. Ms. Lewis.
    Ms. Lewis. I'm sorry. I disagree with that 
characterization. I mean, one important thing that AICOA and 
OAMA both do is to absolutely streamline one concept that is 
extremely time consuming, and expert intensive in antitrust 
law, and that is market power.
    And so AICOA has a definition of critical trading partner. 
And yes, it may be litigated, the scope of what that means, but 
Congress is telling the agencies and the courts what it means. 
There is a description and explanation of that.
    When it comes to OAMA, the word ``competition'' is not 
there. There are much fewer terms to interpret. It is a bit 
more straightforward because it is much narrower. And for OAMA, 
there is no need to prove a relevant market definition, to 
assign market shares, and so both bills, I believe, would 
streamline the process. I'd also add that the DMA, once it was 
passed, it already--the idea is to avoid litigation here by 
making clear what conduct is prohibited.
    And so I think you would expect to see changes. Companies 
will respond differently. But some of these digital platforms, 
I believe, will, if these laws are passed, make changes that 
will benefit consumers and businesses in response to that.
    Senator Blumenthal. Yes. I think, Professor Francis, your 
comment is correct. The rules of discovery are the same. The 
rules of evidence are the same. The Federal procedure is the 
same, but the cause of action is different. The cause of action 
is targeted and streamlined.
    So, you may have discovery, but it's not going to be on a 
kitchen sink. It can be on literally one topic, and it can be 
streamlined. The whole process can be streamlined.
    And equally important, the remedy is clearer. A lot of the 
litigation--you take the Microsoft case, which I was involved 
in, half the litigation was about the remedy. The judge ordered 
the company broken up. He found liability. The court of appeals 
reversed. And frankly, we didn't ask for the company to be 
broken up.
    So, you know, it's--I think it comes down to the cause of 
action, defining what the wrong is, what the legal violation 
is. And this is a targeted and streamlined process. Professor 
Scott Morton, did you have a comment?
    Professor Scott Morton. No, I just agree. In particular, if 
you've got these very specific rules, you're looking for an 
MFN, discovery is about whether there's an MFN--that doesn't 
take years. So, I agree with your characterization.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you.
    Ms. Lewis. If I----
    Senator Blumenthal. Professor Francis.
    Professor Francis. Senator, I think this is exactly where 
the rubber meets the road. Right? So, we were told earlier that 
the harm to competition language in the bill, exactly as you 
say, in the heart of the cause of action, would make sure that 
this bill stopped harmful conduct and allowed good conduct. If 
that's right, then litigation over harm to competition will 
mean exactly litigation over market definition and market power 
and effects evidence. It can't be----
    Senator Blumenthal. Well, I don't know. You know, if Apple 
says to an app store, or an app developer, you need to pay 30 
percent of your revenue to get on our store and you show the 
market power of Apple, that's pretty well defined. Right?
    Professor Francis. I don't know, Senator. So, number one, I 
think a lot of businesses charge 30 percent that don't have 
anything like market power. And number two, I am sure that if 
there's a harm to competition test in the bill, regardless of 
where the burden is, there is going to be all the litigation 
over it that looks exactly like any competitive effects 
litigation.
    Senator Blumenthal. Well, frankly, if my job is to show 
that Apple has a monopoly or overwhelming market power on app 
stores, I'll take that side of the case and I won't even charge 
for it.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Blumenthal [continuing]. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chair Klobuchar. Very good. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.
    So, we have a vote that's been called. I thought I would 
just ask one more question, and that is actually in the area of 
hypocrisy, again, with what's been going on around the world. 
We talked, Ms. Lewis, about how Amazon claimed we'd break 
Amazon Prime and then, in fact, is agreeing to the exact same 
thing they said would break Amazon Prime in other countries.
    And this Committee has previously heard from small 
businesses that experienced retaliation. You and I talked about 
that, and I think that's very important because they've always 
been emphasizing that they are promoting small businesses, yet 
we now have many of them that are coming forward, even if they 
don't want to come forward individually, through their trade 
associations.
    And then on another front, and this involves Apple, we made 
improvements, as you know, to the bill to clarify that the 
platforms can take actions that were reasonably necessary to 
protect privacy and security. That was something that some of 
the opponents of the bill--they have about, you know, 15 
different things that they try out with Members and test drive, 
in various ways or send emails about them.
    One of them was this, we know they hired some former 
security people and some of the Members thought they were 
current security people at one of the hearings. They were not. 
And, in fact, as I noted, the Justice Department has endorsed 
this bill.
    So, while we heard from Apple that the changes that we made 
were not enough, they reportedly plan to allow third-party app 
stores on the iPhone in Europe. Is there any reason why they 
can't do the same thing in the United States?
    Ms. Lewis. Senator Klobuchar, I am not aware of any reason. 
And if you look to the example of the fact that a user of a 
MacBook, or an Apple, a laptop--either their laptops or 
desktops, are able to download apps from alternative sources 
and there seems to be no problem with that.
    So, I have not heard any credible explanation as to why 
Apple cannot allow alternative methods of distribution for apps 
on the iPhone. I see no reason why they can do it in Europe, 
but they cannot do it here. I see no reason why they can do it 
for desktops or laptop products, and they can't do it for the 
iPhone. That just doesn't add up to me.
    Chair Klobuchar. Mm-hmm. Exactly. And I think this is one 
of the failed arguments that they have been trying to make. And 
we clearly worked with them on making improvements to the bill, 
but still they persist. So, do you believe that this bill 
ensures that the companies can continue to protect privacy and 
security, and even improve their security and privacy 
provisions if they'd like?
    Ms. Lewis. I do. And so I know that there have been changes 
to the Open App Markets Act from the version that was 
introduced in the House.
    Chair Klobuchar. Mm-hmm.
    Ms. Lewis. And as you mentioned, many of these changes have 
been made to respond to criticisms of the bill that it was not 
sufficiently clear that the covered app stores and the 
operators would be able to protect user privacy and security.
    I think that the bill Sponsors here have gone above and 
beyond to respond to those criticisms, which I don't think were 
necessarily valid. I think the bill was--allowed for that in 
its current form.
    But the bill Sponsors have gone above and beyond to add 
language in response to those critiques, and work with 
important and knowledgeable civil society groups that are more 
expert in privacy and security than I am to ensure that the 
bill does make that clear.
    Chair Klobuchar. Mm-hmm. And I think that's the very point. 
We made over 100 changes to the bill between the introduction, 
the markup as we headed to the floor. But the point is that 
they just keep moving the ball. So, they don't really want to 
work with us on these changes, or they would have, you know, I 
think, come to some agreement on provisions. But they don't 
want to. They just want to stop it, and they keep coming up 
with new arguments. I think that's unfortunate.
    Maybe these Section 230 hearings, and the like, will make 
people be more sensible. But right now, as I noted at the 
beginning of the hearing, they are just--if we do nothing, we 
are allowing other countries to come up with the solutions. 
Some of them we'll like, some of them we won't. But that's 
what's happening right now.
    And it's clear that some of these most common-sense things, 
that they just hit back at vociferously, are things they 
actually could do without breaking the internet, breaking 
Amazon Prime, breaking Google Maps, or breaking the app stores.
    So, in any case, this has been an incredibly good hearing. 
I don't want to be the last one to vote. That would be bad. And 
I'm really glad one of the benefits of having a year in making 
over 100 changes and hearing these same arguments over and over 
again, I think, it's very important for our colleagues.
    We had 11 Senators here, which is more than we have for 
most Full Committee hearings. So people were really able to 
engage and be part of this discussion, as well as their staffs, 
either here or watching online. And so that will help to inform 
them as we go forward, I think, answered a lot of the questions 
that were raised.
    We don't expect to agree on everything, but I am glad, 
Professor Francis, that we agree on the antitrust funding, and 
some of the other things that are necessary. And that we all 
agree that there is a problem, and that we agree that, I would 
say, just doing nothing may not be the answer here.
    So thank you, so much. We're going to leave the record open 
for 1 week. I imagine some of the Senators that could not join 
us, or had to leave early, and we really appreciate those that 
came by, may have some additional questions for the record. 
And, of course, we welcome that.
    So, the record will remain open for 1 week until March 
14th, 2023. Thank you, very much. The hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 5:20 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
