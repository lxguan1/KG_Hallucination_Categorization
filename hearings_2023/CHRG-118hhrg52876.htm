                  House of Representatives,
                       Committee on Armed Services,
       Subcommittee on Readiness, Meeting Jointly with the 
            Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces,
                           Washington, DC, Tuesday, March 28, 2023.
    The subcommittees met, pursuant to call, at 9:59 a.m., in 
room 2118, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Michael Waltz 
(chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness) presiding.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MICHAEL WALTZ, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
          FLORIDA, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON READINESS

    Mr. Waltz. I call to order this hearing of the Readiness 
and Seapower and Projection Forces--Seapower and Projection 
Forces Subcommittees on Posture and Readiness of the Mobility 
Enterprise.
    I ask unanimous consent that the Chair be authorized to 
declare a recess at any time. Without objection, so ordered.
    Good morning and welcome to our joint hearing on the 
posture of our mobility enterprise. I think this is probably 
one of the most important hearings that we will have this 
posture season. I want to thank you, especially to our 
witnesses for participating today. I look forward to your 
testimony.
    And the reason amongst many that I feel that this is so 
important is the Indo-Pacific as a priority theater. We've all 
talked many times, and I don't think we can ever fully 
appreciate the tyranny of distance that will strain our 
platforms, our people, our material, our fuel laydown, all of 
the things that support the mobility enterprise. And we will 
face struggles on all of these fronts.
    With the pending closure of Red Hill in Hawaii, we are--we 
are forced to examine our fuel laydown across the Indo-Pacific 
and across other COCOM [combatant commands] areas of 
responsibility. Congress designated TRANSCOM [U.S. 
Transportation Command] as the DOD [Department of Defense] 
executive agent for our bulk fuel management. And will serve--
TRANSCOM will serve an important role in moving that fuel 
forward to support our strategic operations.
    Moving fuel in particular for air operations is a strategic 
capability that cannot be neglected. Replacing our aging 
airlift and air refueling platforms is complicated. We have 
struggled, frankly, in some areas. We must ensure availability 
of legacy platforms until their replacements reach full 
operational capability.
    And for that reason, Congress has established statutory 
minimums for both the airlift and air refueling fleets to 
ensure we have needed capacity.
    Our MARAD [Maritime Administration] and Military Sealift 
Command fleets are also in a similar state. Recapitalization of 
our Sealift fleet that will rely--that we will rely on to carry 
ground platforms and material into theater is a pressing issue.
    Crewing these vessels is also a great concern. We have a 
significant shortage of credentialed mariners that, combined 
with an incredibly poor and concerning state of our vessels, 
have resulted in a less than impressive, and that's an 
understatement, less than impressive readiness rates during 
recent exercises.
    We will also rely on this same pool of credentialed 
mariners to crew commercial vessels in the Maritime Security 
Program and the Tanker Security Program.
    We have a tough road ahead, and I look forward to hearing 
how MARAD plans to administer these important programs and 
bolster the number of credentialed mariners. I would also like 
to highlight an important issue for our sevice members.
    TRANSCOM administers the Defense Personnel Property Program 
that moves and stores service members' household goods during 
their change-of-station moves. We ask so much of our military 
members, and we ask even more of their families.
    And General Van Ovost, we've had many conversations about 
reducing the stress on our family members as they're--as 
they're moving. I look forward to hearing you address those 
program changes today.
    I remain concerned about a single point of failure and 
having one prime contractor in the new global household goods 
contract and will continue to emphasize that oversight from 
both TRANSCOM and Congress will be an important part of the--of 
implementing that program.
    In closing, our ability to execute logistical functions in 
a contested environment will define our ability to succeed in 
any future strategic competition. We are seeing today a global 
lesson on the failure of logistics with Russia--with the 
Russian military in Ukraine.
    We must get this right, and we must ensure that we can 
move, sustain, and fuel U.S. forces to meet any scenario.
    With that, I look forward to hearing whether the fiscal 
year 2024 budget meets--request meets that task. And I yield to 
the ranking member.

   STATEMENT OF HON. DON DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM NORTH 
    CAROLINA, VICE-RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON READINESS

    Mr. Davis. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair, Chairman Waltz.
    It's an honor to be here today as Vice Ranking Member. 
General Van Ovost, it was great meeting you this past Friday as 
a fellow grad as well. And Admiral Phillips, thank you for 
coming before our committee to discuss the important work for 
the Maritime Administration.
    Strategic Mobility has always been a strength of the United 
States unmatched by any adversary. TRANSCOM has the unique 
ability to work across combatant commands or services, the 
private sector, and our allies to achieve both military and 
diplomatic goals of the United States.
    Most recently, since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
TRANSCOM has transported equipment, artillery, armor, troops, 
and other aid that has made a critical difference for 
Ukrainians fighting against Russian aggression.
    But despite having unparalleled capabilities and strategic 
mobility, China and Russia are catching up, not just in the 
Indo-Pacific Command theater, but in Southern Command, in 
Africa Command as well. Russia and China have done much to 
expand cyber and anti-access area denial capabilities, along 
with expanding the geopolitical influence across the globe.
    And at this critical time, our airlift, sealift, and air 
refueling capabilities are aging, and we're critically short on 
civilian mariners. Now more than ever, it is critical that 
TRANSCOM and MARAD have the resources they need to ensure we 
retain our advantage.
    I look forward to hearing your views on how we can ensure 
our mobility enterprise remains unmatched across the globe.
    With that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Mr. Davis. And now I yield to 
Chairman Kelly for his opening statement.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TRENT KELLY, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
        MISSISSIPPI, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON SEAPOWER

    Mr. Kelly. Chairman Waltz, thank you for your leadership in 
leading this morning's posture hearing.
    Today we'll hear from two leaders who are experts in their 
fields. I thank you both for your service to the nation.
    TRANSCOM's charter is to project and sustain combat power 
whenever and wherever our nation chooses. As I think on that 
problem set and the multiple adversaries we face, it is a 
daunting challenge and deserving of congressional support.
    Conflicts are won or lost primarily because of logistics. 
We need to look no further than Russia's recent logistical 
blunders to prove this point. Notably, TRANSCOM's 
accomplishment supporting Ukraine war and the earthquakes in 
Turkey and Spain have been amazing and done in addition to 
their day job.
    TRANSCOM has also assumed the role of Department of Defense 
single manager for global bulk fuel management and delivery. 
This mission represents a different approach to managing bulk 
fuel, and I look forward to hearing how it is going.
    I remain concerned with our aging sealift and air refueling 
fleet. This year's budget increase includes money to purchase 
two additional sealift assets, but the fleet remains on average 
too old. This is especially critical because, as Mr. Waltz or 
Chairman Waltz mentioned, recent exercises with these reserve 
fleets were concerning.
    MARAD is also an organization punching above their weight. 
We are happy with the success of the Tanker Security Program 
and would like to hear your thoughts on the increasing 
capacity.
    Inter and intra theater mobility will be key to sustainment 
in the INDOPACOM [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command] area of 
responsibility. And the ten ships in the program are just the 
tip of the iceberg. We need to be prioritizing this capability 
today.
    Finally, I'm concerned with Merchant Mariners' readiness 
and how we can increase the pool of credentialed mariners. And 
I look forward to hearing your thoughts about recruitment and 
retention.
    The fiscal year 2024 budget request for TRANSCOM and MARAD 
show us the problem is not getting easier. I want to thank our 
witnesses in advance for their time today. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you during the 118th Congress to assure 
that we are appropriately postured to meet and defeat the 
threats posed by our adversaries.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Kelly can be found in the 
Appendix on page 43.]
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, and now I yield to Ranking Member 
Courtney.

     STATEMENT OF HON. JOE COURTNEY, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
     CONNECTICUT, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON SEAPOWER

    Mr. Courtney. Thank you, Chairman Waltz. And thank you, 
Chairman Kelly, and my good friend the vice-ranking member, Mr. 
Davis, in terms of your opening remarks.
    Again, I think Mr. Waltz stated it on target where he said 
that, you know, today it's all about the logistics of airlift 
and sealift, particularly when we're talking about a part of 
the world that is as vast as the Indo-Pacific region, where 
supply lines are going to be severely tested.
    And we have two great witnesses here today. To quote Omar 
Bradley, ``Amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk 
logistics.'' We have two ultimate and you know total 
professionals here to share their thoughts in terms of their 
critical agencies in terms of how we solve this problem.
    I would note that, you know, these two committees have in 
my opinion a very strong record over the last 6 years in terms 
of addressing issues like the Tanker Security Program, which 
did not exist prior to 2020.
    It was actually authorization language that came out of the 
Seapower Mark that year, which was like crawling over broken 
glass getting it through the Senate, but we did it.
    And we also got a matching appropriation last year, so that 
we now actually have real funds so that, again, MARAD can go 
out and solicit providers.
    In my mind, that is Congress at its best, following its 
duty under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 13, of the Congress--of 
the Constitution, which states that Congress shall provide and 
maintain a navy.
    Again, that TSP [Tanker Security Program] started right 
here. And as Mr. Kelly said, you know, we really should be 
looking for ways to size it up further in this year's fiscal 
year 2024.
    I would note that the other sort of issue, which again, 
others have alluded to, is the aging maritime fleet, which 
again is, we have heard all the statistics. You know, over 50 
years old, you know, we've had issues even with delivery of 
supplies to Ukraine in terms of breakdowns because of some of 
the fleet there. And you know, it just screams out for action.
    I am disappointed, I have to tell you, having read both 
your testimony, about the fact that in my opinion, one of the 
most promising made in America programs was barely mentioned, 
which again, originated in these two committees, is being 
administered by MARAD. It's the Maritime Training Ship Multi-
mission Vessel, which is now underway in the Philly 
[Philadelphia] Shipyard.
    Again, these are 525-foot ships that displace 19,000 tons 
that, again, will be there to train our future maritime 
officers, which is, again, something that we must do.
    But it is multi-mission. If an emergency happens, those 
boats can be converted into emergency delivery, whether it's 
first responders or whether it's military, equipment or 
personnel. And this program, again, at a time when the 
commercial tonnage in this country has just almost disappeared 
shows that we can do it in this country.
    Again, the Empire State is going to be launched later this 
summer. And there is four right in sequence after it. I would 
encourage all of the members to take a quick trip up to the 
Philly Shipyard. It was almost down to 20 workers when this 
program started, it's 2,000 today.
    And the fact is, is they can take on more after they are 
done with this maritime training ship procurement, which is to 
basically have a made in America sealift. We do not need to be 
buying ships overseas on the used market. When do we learn the 
lesson of COVID [coronavirus disease 2019] that international 
supply chains cannot be relied on in terms of price or 
accessibility?
    And we need to bring back the commercial and shipyard 
sector in this country. And we showed with this program that 
actually, we can do it.
    So again, I, as I said, there was one bare mention of this 
program, even though MARAD is, in my opinion, the hero here in 
terms of executing this program. And the fact is it should show 
us a model for how we try to solve the very serious problems 
which Chairman Waltz started.
    And I apologize for going on here, but again, we have work 
to do. And the fact, the good news is, it's not hopeless. We 
can do it.
    And with that, I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. No apologies needed, Mr. Courtney. I think the 
last briefing I received, there were over 50,000 Chinese 
flagged vessels and now less than 5,000 U.S.
    So this is a strategic vulnerability, and I look forward to 
all of us working together on--it shouldn't be such a hard push 
to get our domestic shipbuilding back to where it needs to be 
and how the commercial drives the national security.
    So again, I'd like to thank our witnesses for their time 
and for joining us. Today we're joined by General Van Ovost, 
Commander of Transportation Command; Rear Admiral Phillips, 
Administrator of MARAD.
    And now I would like to recognize General Van Ovost for her 
opening remarks.

 STATEMENT OF GEN JACQUELINE D. VAN OVOST, USAF, COMMANDER OF 
                  U.S. TRANSPORTATION COMMAND

    General Van Ovost. Thank you, Chairman Waltz, Chairman 
Kelly, Vice-Ranking Member Davis, and Ranking Member Courtney, 
distinguished members of the committees.
    Good morning, it's my honor to join you today with my 
senior enlisted leader, Fleet Master Chief Donald Myrick, to 
represent the men and women of the United States Transportation 
Command as we defend the nation, take care of our people, and 
succeed through teamwork.
    I'm extremely proud of our team of logistics professionals 
who lead the joint deployment and distribution enterprise, 
continually exceed expectations, and ensure hope, deterrence, 
and victory are assured as we contribute to our nation's 
defense.
    From competition to crisis, the entire enterprise proudly 
delivers for our nation, our allies, and our partners. We know 
our success in the European theater and beyond would not be 
possible without the steadfast support of these committees and 
the whole of Congress.
    To maintain the unrivaled strategic advantage to project 
and sustain the joint force over global distances, through 
natural disasters, pandemics, conflicts, peace, and war, while 
defending the homeland, we must preserve our logistical 
dominance. Our organic fleet, along with our commercial 
transportation partners, must continue to present credible 
deterrence and requires proactive efforts to recapitalize and 
modernize. My highest concerns lie in the reductions in 
capacity and readiness in both sealift and air refueling.
    We are a generation late in recapitalizing a ready sealift 
fleet to meet our national objectives. The average age of the 
44 roll-on, roll-off ships that we use to surge from the 
continental United States is 44 years old. In fact, 17 of these 
44 ships are 50 years or older.
    TRANSCOM supports the Navy strategy to acquire used sealift 
vessels from the commercial market and further requests to 
provide the Secretary of Defense discretionary authority to 
purchase foreign-built used ships under favorable market 
conditions and without limitation on number.
    I greatly appreciate your support for stabilized funding 
towards our sealift recapitalization effort, and I'm heartened 
by the current progress on the first five ships.
    We've also taken steps to address the Department's 
shortfall in meeting wartime fuel delivery demands and the 
vulnerable position of continued reliance on the use of 
foreign-flagged, foreign-crewed tanker vessels.
    We are working with MARAD to implement the Tanker Security 
Program, which would provide assured access to the U.S.-flagged 
tankers and begin to reduce risk in sealift tanker capacity.
    In addition to the Tanker Security Program, we fully 
support the Maritime Security Program, the Jones Act, and cargo 
preference laws that all work together to ensure we have the 
necessary U.S.-flagged capability and U.S. mariners during 
peacetime, and ready to move sensitive defense materials during 
a national emergency.
    In every domain, American workers are critical to joint 
force transportation and logistics. In particular, maritime 
stakeholders have been experiencing challenges with recruiting 
and retaining mariners. We support MARAD and industry efforts 
to identify strategies that address the mariner shortage and 
ensure their readiness.
    In the air, the air refueling fleet is the backbone of 
rapid global mobility and our most stressed capability. 
TRANSCOM supports the Air Force's continued efforts towards 
focused modernization of the fleet, uninterrupted tanker 
recapitalization, and accelerated pursuit of the next 
generation air refueling system to ensure our capacity and 
readiness remains credible to cover simultaneous global 
requirements.
    Future operations will also require high degrees of battle 
space awareness and leveraging data to align scarce mobility 
resources with the greatest strategic need. Integration into 
battle networks, resourcing cryptographic modernization, cyber 
security, and ensuring resilient position navigation and timing 
are among my top priorities.
    And just as we are engaged globally in supporting DOD 
operations, the global household good contract is our flagship 
transformational effort and will bring accountability that does 
not exist in the current program of dispersed vendors. We owe 
it to our members and their families to ensure that they have 
the best relocation experience we can provide.
    I'm honored to join Rear Admiral Phillips, U.S. Navy 
Retired, and thank her for her 30-plus years of service to our 
country and her commitment to our nation's security. I'd like 
to thank you once again for your leadership and the support you 
provide our workforce.
    I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of General Van Ovost can be found 
in the Appendix on page 44.]
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, General Van Ovost.
    Rear Admiral Phillips, your opening statement.

 STATEMENT OF RDML ANN C. PHILLIPS, USN (RET.), ADMINISTRATOR, 
                    MARITIME ADMINISTRATION

    Admiral Phillips. Chairman Waltz, Chairman Kelly, Ranking 
Member Courtney, Ranking Member Garamendi, Vice-Ranking Member 
Davis, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for your 
tremendous support for the Maritime Administration, including 
our Ready Reserve force, the Merchant Marine Academy, and the 
U.S. maritime industry. And thank you for the opportunity to 
testify before you today.
    As a retired U.S. Navy admiral with more than 30 years of 
military service, I knew before becoming the Maritime 
Administrator how critical our merchant marine and our entire 
maritime industry are to our national defense, as well as our 
economy.
    Now, having led the great MARAD team for just under a year, 
I can tell you this agency is meeting many historic moments as 
we work to promote the merchant marine and strengthen all 
facets of the maritime industry.
    We are administering a once-in-a-generation investment in 
our nation's ports and waterways made possible by the 
President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. We are working to 
advance culture change throughout the merchant marine. We are 
advancing long-overdue recapitalization of our aging Ready 
Reserve force.
    Let me begin by discussing the Ready Reserve, an area of 
our focus today. America's strategic sealift enables our nation 
to protect power globally, including through congested 
environments whenever activated by U.S. Transportation Command, 
led by General Jacqueline Van Ovost. I am honored to join you 
with her here today.
    The Ready Reserve is a fleet of 45 vessels with an average 
age of more than 45 years. It will grow to more than 50 vessels 
after a planned transfer of additional vessels for the military 
sealift command is complete later this year. MARAD will then be 
the single sealift surge provider.
    The President's fiscal year 2024 budget requests 809.6 
million from DOD budgetary authority for MARAD to acquire, 
upgrade, and maintain the Ready Reserve.
    Due to the advancing age of these ships, I will tell you 
that sustaining safety, material condition, regulatory 
compliance, and the challenges of equipment, parts delays, and 
increased scope of needed repairs, including steel work make 
repairing these ships difficult and challenging.
    MARAD is working to implement our recapitalization, and in 
March 2022, for the first time in nearly 30 years, we announced 
the purchase of two vessels, which will add more than 360,000 
square feet of military cargo capacity.
    Earlier this year, DOD transmitted to Congress our intent 
to purchase three more ships with three flagging an entry to 
the Ready Reserve beginning in April 2023. But this is just the 
start of needed overall recapitalization.
    In addition, MARAD provides ships from the National Defense 
Reserves Fleet as training vessels for the six State maritime 
academies. We are working to replace these training vessels 
with new vessels that will meet the needs of academies and 
provide training for mariner workforce.
    There are now four NSMVs [National Security Multi-Mission 
Vessels] under construction, and the first ship, the Empire 
State, is launched. We anticipate taking delivery of her later 
this year.
    MARAD's fiscal year 2024 budget requests full authorization 
of 318 million for 60 vessels enrolled in the Maritime Security 
Program and further requests 60 million at the authorized level 
for the Tanker Security Program.
    As promised, MARAD issued the interim final rule for the 
Tanker Security Program last year, and anticipate announcing 
the first ten vessels selected for enrollment soon. The 
initiative will also create new employment for approximately 
500 U.S. mariners.
    Last fall I hosted a summit with industry and Federal 
stakeholders to discuss the mariners shortfall, and we will 
continue to work with our partners to help grow and strengthen 
the mariner pool.
    On that front, one thing is clear: everyone in this 
industry must continue the critical effort to ensure mariner 
work environments are safe and that the maritime industry is a 
place where mariners can succeed on the basis of their 
professionalism and skill.
    In support of that effort, the President's fiscal year 2024 
request will also enable MARAD to continue to address urgent 
and longstanding challenges at the Merchant Marine Academy, 
including implementing the many new authorities and 
responsibilities provided in the fiscal year 2023 NDAA 
[National Defense Authorization Act].
    Specifically, funding will enable us to continue our work 
implementing the Every Mariner Builds a Respectful Culture 
Program [EMBARC] and help meet the Academy's extensive facility 
maintenance and repair needs.
    As you know, MARAD established the EMBARC program in 
December 2021 to help prevent sexual assault and harassment 
during the Sea Year Program, to support survivors, strengthen a 
culture of accountability, and improve safety for all mariners.
    Now, thanks to the fiscal year 2023 NDAA, commercially 
operated vessels must by law comply with sexual assault and 
harassment prevention and response standards set by MARAD 
before they can train Academy cadets. MARAD is working as 
quickly as possible to develop an EMBARC rule pursuant to the 
NDAA.
    I note that today there are 16 commercial operators 
enrolled in EMBARC, and together they operate more than 140 
vessels.
    Thank you for the opportunity to present and discuss the 
President's budget for MARAD, and I look forward to any 
questions you and the members of the Subcommittee may have. 
Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Rear Admiral Phillips can be 
found in the Appendix on page 65.]
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Administrator. Thank you both for 
your testimony. I now recognize myself for questions.
    General Van Ovost, we had a number of conversations about 
global household goods and that transition. I continue to hear 
from the moving industry, and I'm trying to figure out where 
this disconnect is from your assurance and that I've received 
from you and your team and the concerns that I'm hearing about 
the transition risk to this program for military moves.
    I've heard from, including just as recently as yesterday, 
from numerous moving service providers that they can't plan for 
what their work share is going to be over the next year. That 
they don't have agreements in place with the prime contractor. 
That they don't have pricing in place so that they can budget.
    And I talked to one van line that is going to just walk 
away from doing business with the government. So how are you--
how are you considering, and this is--I know we've had 
conversations, but I think it's important to get out there for 
the public record, the capacity of the moving industry in its 
planning phases for global household goods is one question.
    And then two, you know, I know we've talked about you 
running the old program and the new program in parallel, and 
you've assured me you will hit the brakes on the new program 
if--if things aren't moving as they--as they need to move and 
they aren't transitioning. But I think what we're missing is I 
don't know that there's going to be anybody left in that old 
program and any backup plan to go to.
    So how are you--how are you planning for that loss of 
capacity in the--in the moving industry that is just shifting 
rapidly over to the private sector and away from government 
moves?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you for the question. As you know, 
there's no more important program for our family members, and 
so we absolutely have to make sure we get this right. Which is 
why we have extensive oversight. In fact, as HomeSafe has come 
on, as you know in November we were given the green light and 
we're moving forward.
    They started here in March. Their campaign to go to 
regional areas and start to explain the implementation plan, 
their framework and how they're going to move forward.
    We are dealing with the final rates right now, not just for 
HomeSafe, but as you mentioned, the Tender of Service Program, 
where we have those 900 tenders, is going to continue on, and 
we're going to work it in parallel. In other words, as we bring 
up HomeSafe, we're going to start to dial back the current 
Tender of Service Program.
    Our rates for the Tender of Service Program come out 
traditionally about now, I believe in the next few weeks it'll 
come out. And that will be about the same time you'll probably 
see it with HomeSafe as well. So that we--they have this 
understanding of--and so HomeSafe will be able to provide them 
the full plan.
    They've provided the framework in how this is going to 
work, but they'll be able to do the final deals coming up here 
as the rates come out.
    So you know, I am not aware of people shying away from 
being part of this capacity. You know, anecdotally, the rollout 
seems to be going okay. We are at all of those events. In fact, 
we talk daily with HomeSafe on their ability to gain the 
capacity and to move forward. We are working on the IT 
[information technology], we're working on the claims front----
    Mr. Waltz. General, just--sorry, sorry, just for the sake 
of getting to other members. I would just encourage you to talk 
directly to some of these lower tiers. Again, I'm trying to 
level-set the disconnect.
    But what they're saying is they're hearing a lot of 
conceptual frameworks and concepts, but you know, the rubber--
having run a business, the rubber meets the road when they need 
to sharpen their pencils and figure out if this still makes 
sense for their company as a sub.
    General Van Ovost. No, I understand.
    Mr. Waltz. So I would just encourage you to reach out 
directly.
    And Admiral Phillips, can we just talk a minute about the--
the mariner shortage. Do you have--have we had--if the balloon 
went up for some type of global contingency and we had to send 
out the Ready Reserve fleet, could you staff even 50 ships? 
Could you, with the growth from 45 to 50, could you staff all 
of those ships with mariners today?
    Because we're pulling from the same pool of credentialed 
mariners to crew both the sealift fleet and any commercial 
vessels needed for future large-scale military operations. Are 
you confident all of those ships will be manned?
    Admiral Phillips. Mr. Chairman, thank you for that 
question. I am not confident all those ships would be manned. I 
think I should be extremely straightforward there. We know we 
have a marine shortfall.
    The last numbers we have predate COVID. They are an 
estimated 1800 in an uncontested environment over a 6 month 
cycle of activating the Ready Reserve.
    As you state, we're competing with active ships, we're 
competing with our U.S. flag vessels, our 85 internationally 
trading, privately owned foreign trading vessels.
    And the merchant marine and the Ready Reserve force are 
aging vessels. That means there are skill sets required to 
operate some of them, those remaining that are steam, as an 
example, that not a lot of mariners have right now.
    I will add that one of our biggest challenges is 
understanding exactly, as you point out, who do we have, what 
qualifications do they have, and will they sail. So therein 
lies our large challenge.
    As mentioned in my testimony, I have convened last fall 75 
stakeholders to talk about what we wanted to do about this 
across industry and labor. We settled on four lines of effort: 
recruit, train, retain, and reduce barriers. And we are working 
in----
    Mr. Waltz. I find that----
    Admiral Phillips. ----Sectors to try to make a difference.
    Mr. Waltz. Everyone here should find that incredibly 
alarming. That is a red star cluster. That is a blinking red 
light. First of all, I don't know that all the ships would even 
sail, frankly, and according to some exercises. And yet we 
don't have the mariners.
    So can you just--I don't want to take up too much time, but 
I think it's an incredibly important issue. We've gone from the 
first Gulf War at about 400 ships now to 40, and now we can't 
even staff the 40. And these are the ships we need to move our 
ground forces all over the world.
    Specifically, how are you going to rely on private 
providers and how can we help you with private providers, in 
addition to the academies, produce more mariners in this 
country?
    Admiral Phillips. So thank you for that question also, Mr. 
Chairman. As you know, we have a Centers of Excellence Program 
within the Maritime Administration where we may designate 
institutions that train mariners at Centers of Excellence.
    In the 2023 NDAA, we received an authorization to support a 
grant program by which we could provide them perhaps additional 
capacity. We would have to develop and design that program. 
Unfortunately, that program was not appropriated, there was no 
money put against it.
    So we are able to designate Centers of Excellence. However, 
we can't provide them any additional funding at this point in 
time.
    I would also add that we work closely with labor, with the 
union schools, both licensed and unlicensed. They are certainly 
intent on expanding their capacity. And I would add that in 
order for them to do that, we have to have ships for those 
mariners to sail on.
    Because it's incumbent upon having a flow of mariners, a 
pull of mariners, and a consistent need to be able to justify 
to people why they want to come into this community and into 
this industry, and why they want to stay there.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Admiral Phillips. Ranking Member--
Ranking Member Davis.
    Mr. Davis. Thank you so much, Mr. Chair.
    And I would always recognize our great leader, our ranking 
member. So, always great to see you, sir.
    General Van Ovost, I have a question I would like to start 
out with today. We've seen the impact of years of under-
resourcing sustainment across the jurisdiction of the Readiness 
Subcommittee. This is affecting every military department and 
it trickles down to our soldiers, sailors, and airmen.
    Can you please describe to us how the lack of resources 
towards air and ship sustainment affects TRANSCOM?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you for that question. Readiness 
is--we demonstrate readiness every day around the globe in all 
of our operations as recently as Ukraine and in earthquake 
relief. But I am concerned about long-term readiness.
    Our ability to ensure that all of our fleets can meet their 
mission-capable or availability rates and the consistent under-
funding does erode.
    So what we absolutely require to ensure our readiness into 
the future is a consistent funding, a budget on time, because a 
CR, a continuing resolution, is one of the ways it absolutely 
erodes our capabilities and our ability to do new starts and to 
develop modernization and implement modernization programs that 
will ensure our capacity is credible out into the future.
    So I would ask for the budget to be on time and for your 
support of continued readiness fundings throughout all the 
services for our equipment.
    Mr. Davis. Okay. And General Van Ovost, as China and Russia 
have expanded cyber in anti-access area denial capabilities, 
what concerns does TRANSCOM have regarding Chinese or Russian 
investments in ports and the potential limitation those impose 
on TRANSCOM's options for providing strategic lift into 
theater?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you for that question. Cyber 
operations pose, you know, significant threats to logistics. 
They target vulnerable supply chains. They go after our command 
and control structure.
    And their ability to disrupt, delay, or even deny our 
ability to move around the globe is a serious concern from the 
cyber perspective. So we're doing a lot of work, both on the 
military side and with our commercial partners, to ensure we 
have cyber security and we're hardened from those elements.
    Mr. Davis. And how is TRANSCOM planning to ensure key 
logistics nodes remain active and resilient in a contested 
environment? And in a contested environment, what efforts has 
TRANSCOM made with combating--commands to identify alternate 
ports of disembarkation?
    General Van Ovost. Yeah, the alternative points, resilience 
in our ports, in our nodes, for the full network, our lines of 
communication. Things like posture, both for fuel on the water 
as well as fuel distribution points. And pre-positioned storage 
forward and storage forward and distributed locations where 
it's not a target are the one--some of the many things we're 
doing with posture.
    Of course we could not project and sustain a joint force 
without our allies and partners, which provide us that access-
basing and overflight and opportunities to enter into 
agreements where we'll be able to forward-provision. In other 
words, provide other ways to get support to our forces forward.
    And I would also want to be reluctant to mention that we 
couldn't also do this without our commercial partners, our 
airlift and sealift partners around the globe that ensure that 
not just our networks and allies' and partners' networks are 
resilient, but their networks are as well.
    Mr. Davis. Thank you. Mr. Chair, yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you. Chairman Kelly.
    Mr. Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    General, first I just want to say we need to continue the 
trend in the right direction that we have right now, which 
means more newer operational ships and planes in our fleet that 
are manned by crews that are capable of carrying out those 
duties.
    And I kind of go back to Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams 
when he said build it and they will come. If we don't have 
ships that are operational, I can assure you we will not have 
mariners to man those ships. So I think those things go hand in 
hand.
    And General Van Ovost, in your statement, you identify the 
inventory of 466 total air-refueling aircraft as sufficient, 
but at an elevated risk. Should the Air Force increase the 
total number of tankers in its inventory?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you know, 
you know, air refueling is absolutely critical to our ability 
to rapidly deploy forces around the globe. And it's really 
foundational, and it is our asymmetric advantage. So we want to 
be able to preserve that capacity, which also means we have to 
preserve the readiness.
    So when we have found that our assessment against the 
National Defense Strategy makes the 466 total inventory 
sufficient at an elevated level of risk, I am concerned about 
the readiness of this aging fleet.
    And I'm fully supportive of the Air Force plan to 
accelerate a next-generation air refueling system so that we 
can develop a system that can operate in these highly contested 
environments.
    Meanwhile, continue an uninterrupted recapitalization of 
the KC-135 refueler. And then targeted modernization to ensure 
that airplane, when we get the last KC-46 right now that's on 
contract, those airplanes will be 67 years old and we'll have 
287 of them.
    So we got to make sure that they're credible and they are 
ready. So their readiness, modernization, and ability to see 
the battle space on board and secure connections. Some very 
targeted capabilities that can ensure our capability in the 
future.
    Mr. Kelly. Thank you. And Rear Admiral Phillips, can you 
preview the timeline and next steps for the Tanker Security 
Program?
    Admiral Phillips. Yes, sir, thank you for that question. We 
expect to be able to announce the next ten vessels very 
shortly. We anticipate we'll be able to announce them. We look 
forward to doing that.
    As you are aware, we owe our report after the--as a result 
of the 2023 NDAA that will help outline how we want to move 
forward with the program, particularly in the context of how we 
will man the program, train mariners to support the console 
needs and deploy and implement the console needs and 
requirements for this program.
    You're also aware we have an authorization to go to 20 
ships in 2024. We anticipate being able to do that, and we in 
our budget request believe that we will have funding to be able 
to support 20 ships based on existing funding for the 2020--the 
year 2024. After that, we will need funding that would need--
that would support maintaining a 20-ship fleet at this point in 
time.
    Mr. Kelly. And General Van Ovost, just real quickly, I 
think you talked a little bit how you envision addressing the 
requirements for transporting fuel within theater and other 
fuel distribution needs with smaller capacity vessels.
    So if you want to add anything to that, but keep it real 
quick because I have one more question. And how many of these 
vessels will we need to be ready?
    General Van Ovost. Certainly. For the number of vessels, 
the Tanker Security Program is a first good step. We did some--
they had a classified study that has those information for 
intertheater and intratheater. So appreciate your support. You 
listened to the concerns and you responded, and you have 
already bought down some of our operational risk.
    But the entire fuel system now, we need to look at it from 
an end-to-end perspective. We have not done that before and 
that's the role of U.S. Transportation Command to be able to 
synchronize across there to ensure that in a contested 
environment, we'll be able to deliver fuel to the warfighter.
    Mr. Kelly. And then finally, General Van Ovost, the 
increasing age of our sealift vessels is making 
recapitalization of this fleet a more pressing issue. The 
President's request seeks funds to purchase two used sealift 
vessels for commercial industry. But is this two vessels per 
year enough?
    And double tapping on what Ranking Member Courtney said, do 
we also need to be building some of those vessels, and what is 
the plan that we should be doing to have some--so that we can 
know and that the suppliers can know how many ships they need 
to build in the future?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you, sir. Two a year is a great 
start, but at two a year we will not be able--not finish a 
recapitalization until about 2032. And when I think about the 
work and the decisive deco, we must be able to recover the 
capacity and the readiness of those ships. So I advocate for an 
accelerated rate when conditions are favorable.
    And then with respect to a build-new strategy, that could 
absolutely be part of the longer strategy and to the future. 
But I want to make sure that, again, a near-term, again, 17 of 
44 ships are already over--50 or over, and they'll just 
continue to get older and older. So anything we can do to 
accelerate the recap while considering the future would be 
helpful.
    Mr. Kelly. And just a final comment. I really think we need 
to get a greater sense of urgency. I don't think 2032 or 2035 
or 2030 is the year. I think we need to be preparing for 2028 
at the latest.
    And so with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Chairman Kelly. And I certainly 
second those remarks. I think we have--are consistently seeing 
a disconnect between the timelines the intelligence community 
is giving us and then the timelines for a number of these 
programs to maintain deterrence.
    Ranking Member Courtney.
    Mr. Courtney. Thank you, Chairman Waltz.
    And one timeline, which again, Admiral Phillips, you did 
allude to in your testimony, I appreciate it, was that right 
now at the Philly Shipyard, there are four vessels under 
construction.
    Again, that cadence is swift and on schedule. I mean, 
really, Mr. Wittman and I deal with a lot of shipbuilding 
programs over the year. There haven't been too many where 
particularly the lead ship was on time and under budget. And 
yet that's exactly what's happening there.
    And you know, I would like to just sort of drill down for a 
second on the fact that, you know, something's going on there 
that's different than what the Navy had proposed in terms of 
its recapitalization efforts, which is that there's a different 
contracting model that, again, MARAD and our committee worked 
together to put into place, which is a vessel construction 
manager.
    That's a private sector model which again, tries to, you 
know, shrink the requirements. You know, just, you know, get on 
schedule, fixed prices, as delivered and designed. And that's 
working, as I said.
    And I mean, you would agree with that, right? I mean, 
that's really the core of why that program is so--is so 
promising.
    Admiral Phillips. Yes, sir, we would agree with that. It is 
on time, it is on budget.
    Mr. Courtney. So last year's NDAA, we authorized ten 
sealift new constructions using the vessel construction manager 
model. Again, it passed both chambers, President Biden signed 
it into law. Unfortunately there is no funding in the budget.
    Instead we're going into, again, the commercial market, 
which is two used vessels that are here. I mean, I certainly am 
ready to do everything I can to talk to the appropriators about 
the fact that, you know, we really should not just put all our 
eggs in the commercial market.
    Which I would just say that, you know, we are hearing 
anecdotally that the price and availability is not steady right 
now in terms of what's out there. And again, 2032 is the end 
date. I mean, to sort of put our eggs in that basket in terms 
of how we're going recapitalize the fleet I think is just very 
risky.
    One request that I would make, and then I'll yield is just 
that this committee deserves better information in terms of 
what's out there in terms of the commercial market. If you're 
asking us to authorize two more used vessels in commercial 
market and have that as the pattern in the coming years, we 
need to get some visibility in terms of what that market looks 
like.
    Because as I said, the input that we're getting from 
industry is that this is not something that you can really 
count on as a steady state in terms of a horizon. Whereas 
building them in the U.S., we know exactly what the cost is and 
we know exactly what the timeline is. That's a less risky 
strategy in terms of addressing this issue.
    With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Ranking Member Courtney, I look 
forward to working with Seapower Committee on that, because I 
agree. I think we're seeing a pricing issue in the United 
States. The only way to get at it and get at the labor 
shortages is to actually reinvigorate the market.
    So with that, I yield to Mr. Wittman.
    Mr. Wittman. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I'd like to thank our witnesses for joining us. General Van 
Ovost, Rear Admiral Phillips, thanks again for all the great 
work that you all do.
    General Van Ovost, I want to begin with you. As you look at 
the OPLANs [military operation plans] in theater, my concern 
centers around this: the logistics behind getting and 
sustaining the Army and the Marine Corps in any sort of 
scenario that we look at in that particular theater.
    And can you give me an idea what types of delays will you 
experience in being able to put forward all the necessary 
elements of personnel and materials and supplies and ammunition 
in that scenario? And in my mind, it's particularly acute for 
those forces that are CONUS [continental United States]-based, 
because we know the logistics of having to do that.
    All you have to do is to look at the logistics of what we 
went through in the first Gulf War in trying to get everything 
there to Kuwait, which took a long period of time with massive 
numbers of ships, which we don't have today.
    And how successful do you think TRANSCOM will be in the 
case of a dislodgement campaign with Taiwan? It's different 
than having things in theater. If you have to be able to push 
things in in a contested environment, the whole scenario 
changes.
    Give me your perspective on how those challenges have to be 
dealt with by TRANSCOM.
    General Van Ovost. Well, thanks for that question, that is 
something that keeps us up. But this is what we do, we analyze 
the national defense strategy against the plans to execute to 
meet our national objectives.
    And here's what we learned. In a contested environment, 
just about every aspect of mobilities risk will increase if not 
sufficiently mitigated. So we have gone about to understand 
where the highest risks are we're getting after them.
    So on the posture side, as you mentioned, you know, what--
what does late look like. It looks like how do you forward 
position in multiple distributed locations both on the land and 
on the water with our squadrons of our PREPO [Pre-Positioned 
Force, Equipment, or Supplies] on the water.
    It's how do we have multiple nodes, multiple seaports and 
airports that we can use as lily pads to work forward. How do 
we re-posture the fuel where it makes sense to be able to put 
it both on the water and in locations so we're going to have 
ready access to it during conflict.
    And how do I have ready capacity that could actually fight 
through contested logistics, meaning cyber, GPS [global 
positioning system] interference, you know, the survivability 
aspects, PNT [Position, Navigation, and Timing]. And as we pull 
all those together, I have to be able to understand and incense 
the battle and be able to move the highest priority stuff to 
meet the joint force commander's needs.
    So I think about our ability to understand the data, to use 
AI [artificial intelligence], to try to sense the fields and 
sense the nodes so that we can apply the right capacity at the 
right time.
    So it's challenging, but it's absolutely doable, and we are 
working at it. In fact, this summer on a large-scale global 
exercise, there's about a 120-day period in the Indo-Pacific 
where we have not only joint exercises, but service-specific 
exercises.
    In fact, next week we have one with the Army that's looking 
at their Multi-Domain Task Force and how we're moving them 
around. I'm sending my deputy out there to understand and to 
try to make sure that we can link in and help them in their 
maneuver. Because they're maneuvering, and they need 
sustainment.
    Mr. Wittman. In that realm in the contested logistics area 
of the INDOPACOM, how important is the Marine Corps LSM 
[Landing Ship Medium] in being able to deliver intra-theater 
logistics?
    And in that realm, how important is the capability of LSM 
to self-defend versus other threat defense logistics that could 
otherwise be put out there for the LSM? And the LSM by the way 
is Landing Ship Medium for the--yeah, because it's not a 
warship.
    Anyway, go ahead, I'm sorry.
    General Van Ovost. No, look, thanks for that question. It's 
super important that, as the joint deployment and distribution 
enterprise, that we synchronize from end to end. So all service 
concepts have to be exercised, and we have to be able to get to 
the LSM to be able to support them.
    We have to understand where they're going to maneuver in 
the first and second island chain, where do they expect to get 
their fuel and their provisionings and their ammunition. And 
that's exactly what we're doing this summer.
    You know, their concepts of operation are not yet solid, 
but we have been providing advice all along the way on how we'd 
be able to work with them. And again, that's some of the work 
that we're doing here this summer to actually do the execution 
to see how hard or how easy it's going to be.
    Now, with respect to the defensive systems on that weapons 
system, I can't comment to that, I leave it to them. But just 
know that, again, my job is to synchronize that. I've got to be 
there when they need to be there. And if that's their weapon 
system of choice, we will absolutely adapt to support them.
    Mr. Wittman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Mr. Wittman. Mr. Deluzio.
    Mr. Deluzio. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
    General Van Ovost, Admiral Phillips, good morning. 
Unsurprisingly I'm sure to many of you, our committee's broader 
work has focused on our strategic competition with the Chinese 
Communist Party, and frankly, the ever-increasing size of their 
fleet relative to ours. And that delta increasing, which is 
worrying to me and my colleagues I'm sure as well.
    Look, the inability to modernize our fleet and build ships 
on time, much less do the required maintenance, it concerns us. 
We are decommissioning ships faster than we can build them and 
maintain them. And we've seen drastic consolidation of the 
defense industry, including in shipbuilding and shipyards. It 
worries me.
    But to come back to--you're both--you're the administration 
and Transportation Command. One of the things you said, 
General, that worried me, I saw in your testimony the age of 
our--the average age of our roll-on, roll-off military cargo 
ships being 44 years old, 17 I believe being 50 years old or 
older. That's an aging fleet, which of course has increasing 
costs to maintain.
    You know, we are, and similarly much of our discussion 
today, Mr. Courtney mentioned it and I'll dig in a bit too, 
relying on purchasing foreign-built used ships rather than 
building them here.
    Put simply, without Federal investment, additional Federal 
investment and strong investment, we will not have sufficient, 
a sufficient fleet and we'll need to rely on foreign ships, 
whatever it might be in our next conflict. It worries me.
    And so Admiral Phillips, I'll start with you. As I explain 
this phenomenon to my constituents, who can't understand it, 
please explain as plainly as you can why is it that we've 
landed in a place where we have to purchase foreign-built ships 
rather than make them in this country.
    Admiral Phillips. Congressman Deluzio, thank you for that 
question. To answer that question, you would need to be a 
student of history.
    And I can condense it simply by saying time and again 
within this country, in World War I, in World War II, we 
accelerated to build a fleet to support our needs in time of 
war and when the time of war ended, that fleet was sold off, 
sent to other places, allowed to deteriorate.
    We are in a similar circumstance now with 45 Ready Reserve 
force vessels and 85, as I've said, foreign-flag, U.S. flag 
foreign trading vessels that are privately owned. That that is 
essentially the extent of our capacity that we'll be able to 
support General Van Ovost's needs in a time of war.
    So the challenge there is to have ships, you need to have 
mariners. And to have enough manpower, you need to have ships 
that have cargoes to carry. All of these things have to go 
together to be able to ensure we support and sustain a fleet.
    But you've asked briefly about maintenance. Our maintenance 
capacity, as you have described, our shipbuilding capacity has 
dwindled. It largely supports the Defense Department.
    However, as Congressman Courtney pointed out, the success 
of the NSMV program in Philadelphia, and other programs, there 
are other yards capable of building such ships around the 
country, shows that this can be done here. And it can be done 
with a very successful outcome, as we are demonstrating with 
the NSMV.
    Mr. Deluzio. Admiral, I want to pick up on that piece, that 
it can be done here. What does this committee, what does the 
Congress need to do to make that happen to support that?
    Because I think as a national security imperative, that we 
do have the shipbuilding capacity, the maintenance capacity to 
not have to rely on foreign-built vessels for--for our fleet.
    Admiral Phillips. Congressman, thank you for that question. 
I would refer to the authorization within the 2023 NDAA to 
construct ten vessels, that it does not have an appropriation. 
Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Deluzio. Thank you. General, anything you want to add 
to that? I think that's the direct answer.
    General Van Ovost. It is, but let me just also just 
reinforce again what the Administrator said about our mariner 
force, all right.
    Right now the, I appreciate the full funding of the 
Maritime Security Program, the Tanker Security Program, cargo 
preference laws, all of them ensure that we can have a strong 
mariner force. All of them buy down the operational risk that 
we're taking.
    Mr. Deluzio. Thank you. I yield back, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you. I now recognize Mrs. Kiggans.
    Mrs. Kiggans. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    And it's great to see you, again, General Van Ovost, and 
welcome to both of you.
    So I represent Virginia's Second Congressional District and 
a lot of shipbuilding. And I certainly--a lot of military and 
Navy there, and I certainly appreciate, you know, the work you 
all do to transport our ships throughout the world.
    So doing some reading in preparation for this committee, I 
read about the Turbo Activation exercise from 2019, where the 
results of that exercise were 60% of those ships were 
considered ready, and then only 40% were able to steam out of 
port.
    Now today, given that 17 of the 45 ships in the Ready 
Reserve force are over 50 years old, you know, are you 
confident these vessels will be ready if immediately pressed 
into service? Did we learn things from that exercise that we've 
been able to correct now in the year 2023?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you, Congresswoman, for that 
question. That is something that we take close track of. We 
just completed another Turbo Activation here in 2022 and 
provided that report.
    And this last Turbo Activation, I am more confident in our 
ability to assess the fleet. And I--some metrics have shown 
improvement.
    But it's only been about a year and a half since we've got 
the increase M&R [Maintenance and Repair] funding, the 
readiness funding for those ships and the targeted performance 
to plan--planning that the Navy has done with MARAD to 
understand how to better target the health of each of these 
ships.
    So we have not yet seen that return on investment, but I do 
appreciate the Navy's investment, and they committed to us 
about a 20% increase in funding on that, on that piece of it.
    And we did revise our strategy on which ships to activate. 
As we're now able to use data more and more, as we're capturing 
more data and using data and analytics to understand which are 
the best ships to activate so we can get them up and running 
and test them, versus ones that we know that might do just 
fine, right. So we want to--we want to target that work, just 
like the performance to plan.
    And let me finally add that I appreciate a strong mariner 
force. They volunteer to do this. It's not easy to do a Turbo 
Activation working very hard for 10-12 days, and then they're 
off the ship. So I appreciate them volunteering to do this 
work.
    Mrs. Kiggans. And I certainly want to just reiterate, you 
know, Ranking Member Courtney and what he said about the, you 
know, domestic production of our ships. And we have a lot of 
ship-owning in my district as well.
    But you know, aside from funding, which you just mentioned 
about an NDAA authorization, you know, what are the other 
barriers to that domestic production that we could work on from 
this committee?
    General Van Ovost. I'll pass that to the MARAD 
Administrator.
    Admiral Phillips. Well, Congresswoman Kiggans, thank you 
very much for your question. Certainly barriers to domestic 
production include the cost of production. But also capacity. 
And I'd really like to land on capacity in particular.
    More broadly as we work to repair, maintain the Ready 
Reserve force and build new vessels, we struggle with enough 
capacity within the country, with enough dry dock capacity, and 
that applies across both Active Duty military and Ready Reserve 
and the Military Sealift Command. And other agencies as well, 
Coast Guard, Army Corps, we're all struggling and fighting for 
the same dry dock capacity, which is very limited.
    We're struggling for some of the same maintenance capacity 
and capabilities. And that impacts our ability to provide a 
ready force over time. And as ships age that gets even more 
challenging, they spend more time in dock, more unusual, 
unexpected things come up.
    So additional capacity in maintenance and construction is 
an urgent need to continue to maintain a ready force here.
    Mrs. Kiggans. And if I may just interject, I know that last 
week we closed four of our West Coast dry docks, which is we 
have I believe 22 dry docks, so now we're down to 18, including 
the only West Coast dry dock that's able to service an aircraft 
carrier. So we--that was 22% of our dry dock capacity.
    So this is an issue that I believe we need to prioritize 
and highlight, because you're right, these are old ships we're 
trying to keep at sea. We got to have places to repair them.
    So that issue of where are we going to build those dry 
docks. And the maintenance, the manpower that goes with that. 
And that's something that I believe this committee needs to 
prioritize.
    Along those same lines, wanted to ask, I know both of you 
have talked about the manpower issue. Again, my district, heavy 
military. I've been in office almost 3 months now and the only 
letter I have received from a parent that's complaining about a 
service academy is about the Merchant Marine Academy.
    And this was an issue with the Superintendent, Joanna 
Nunan, and it was about I believe her covering up a painting at 
the--at the Academy. I just want to know if you all are aware 
of this? It was a Christ on the Water picture that they're--the 
painting is covered, they are not allowed to use the room 
anymore.
    The parent who wrote to me was concerned about--and I too 
am concerned about recruitment and retention for our mariners. 
So it's the little things, right, the little things like this.
    But there's no room for this type of--they thought it was, 
you know, a breach on their constitutional rights. This is a 
painting that I guess has traditionally been in the room.
    So I just wanted to know if you were aware of that issue 
and if anything was being done about it.
    Admiral Phillips. Thank you, ma'am, for that question. Mr. 
Chair, I will exceed my time if I may continue. The painting, 
known as Christ on the Water, today is hanging in Astronaut 
Elliot M. See Room at the Merchant Marine Academy. It is 
uncovered.
    The display of that painting in that painting in that 
particular space we believe is a violation of the Establishment 
Clause. However, the room is currently not being used for 
official business. The painting is there, midshipmen can see 
it.
    Our intent in the long term is to relocate the painting to 
the chapel. We are making preparations to do that. Once there, 
it will be restored, and it will remain on view for Academy 
midshipmen. Thank you.
    Mr. Waltz. Admiral Phillips.
    Admiral Phillips. Thank you.
    Mr. Waltz. Unfortunately your time has expired. If you want 
to provide a more----
    Admiral Phillips. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Waltz. ----Fulsome response for the record. Now 
recognize Mr. Veasey.
    [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix 
on page 77.]
    Mr. Veasey. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I wanted to 
ask Admiral Phillips what is MARAD's strategy for managing and 
maintaining the DOD's fleet of civilian crewed ships and how 
does it ensure these assets are ready to support contingency 
operations.
    Admiral Phillips. Sir, thank you for that question. I 
believe you're referring to the Ready Reserve force, 40 ships 
that we maintain and provide what--upon request for TRANSCOM to 
support needs. I would offer that our current readiness of that 
fleet today is 76%, although it varies, and that is a high from 
the past several months.
    I would also offer that we have eight of those vessels 
underway today supporting not only TRANSCOM needs, but also 
exercises in other needs around the globe.
    We continue and we thank DOD for the additional support in 
the President's budget fiscal year 2024 to expand maintenance 
capacity for this force. And we also thank DOD for its 
continuing support for the vessel acquisition program by which 
we are buying used vessels.
    And also thank this committee for the authorization to 
build new should that be needed. It is really tripartite 
strategy that the Department of Defense would like to execute 
to ensure that we have a Ready Reserve to respond as required 
by TRANSCOM's needs and the Department of Defense needs. Thank 
you.
    Mr. Veasey. Thank you very much.
    General Van Ovost, I wanted to ask you how is the moving of 
the household goods, the contract that there were some, you 
know, issues with back in 2020, 2021, timeframe, how is that 
going now
    General Van Ovost. Yeah, thank you for that question. We 
are, you know, transforming the way we provide moving services 
to our families. And we are in the transition phase to the new 
contractor, to HomeSafe.
    But as they take, begin to take on, they'll start after 
peak season this year. But we have not stopped with our 
improvements for our families. We have instituted some digital 
management tools. We have simplified the claims process. We've 
enhanced communications the capability with help desks.
    So we are moving forward with improvement as we--as we wait 
to bring them on. And we are meeting and partnering with 
HomeSafe to ensure that they have the quality capacity 
necessary and that processes necessary.
    We are also training all of our service members, all the 
different service leads for movement to make sure they 
understand the new system, and that they're improving their 
capabilities as well.
    Mr. Veasey. Yeah, what type of feedback are you getting?
    General Van Ovost. So because the HomeSafe has not yet 
moved any goods underneath that flag----
    Mr. Veasey. Okay.
    General Van Ovost. There's nothing there. But we're getting 
great feedback on the improvements that we've made. In fact, we 
have a big spouses' panel we bring in, bring them in. We also 
go to the services and we have forums where we listen directly 
to their feedback and we incorporate those changes into our 
program.
    Mr. Veasey. Well, good, good, thank you very much. I was 
also wondering if you can talk a little bit how TRANSCOM is 
working to ensure readiness and resiliency of the global 
logistic networks and what are you guys doing to modernize the 
network to meet the demands of future operations.
    General Van Ovost. Thanks. Future operations is exactly 
what we think about all the time. And readiness is job one, and 
we need to be ready today and into tomorrow. And we do 
demonstrate that daily.
    In fact I want to thank, you know, we have been able to 
quickly respond to requirements around the globe, to include 
when Russia had a full-scale invasion into Ukraine, we were 
able to immediately deliver forces onto the continent to 
support the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization] eastern 
flank.
    But that was made possible, do so quickly due to European 
defense initiative. So, appreciate the support that allowed us 
to have a PREPO ship set there and opened up some fields and 
avenues for us. So we really leveraged European deterrent 
initiative.
    And this year in budget you'll see Pacific deterrent 
initiative, which will do the same. It'll allow us to get 
posture, basing, PREPO, and support out in the Pacific so we 
can respond just as quickly to there. So that of course 
increases all of our readiness.
    But we are focused on the future. When I think about a 
contested environment, I think about secure command and 
control, having battle space awareness onto our assets. Cyber 
security is a major thing that we are looking at.
    We are very focused on that, both on the military and with 
our commercial partners. They have been working with us. They 
have contract compliance measures also that hardens their 
security. And they're partnering with us and CISA 
[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency] to ensure 
that they're a hard target.
    And of course precision navigation and timing and 
survivability. Those are some of the things that we are working 
on to be able to ensure that we can be ready out into the 
future.
    Mr. Veasey. Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr. 
Chairman, thank you.
    Mr. Waltz. Mr. Wilson.
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And I'd like to thank each of you. Readiness, and seapower, 
and projection has never been more important. We have the 
global war on terrorism is continuing, of 9/11. It continues 
unabated.
    But then at the same time we have competition between 
democracies, with rule of law being opposed by authoritarians 
with rule of gun. And we see that with the murderous invasion 
by Putin, War Criminal Putin, into Ukraine. We see the threats 
from the Chinese Communist Party to the 24 million people of 
Taiwan.
    And then we see the regime in Tehran continuing their 
capabilities of ICBMs [Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles] to 
fulfill their hopes of vaporization of the people of Israel and 
vaporization of the people of America.
    And so what you are doing has just never been more 
important of providing for peace through strength. And so 
General Van Ovost, I want to thank you and your--for your 
service and leadership in the U.S. Transportation Command.
    Especially I'm grateful for the service of the members of 
the 437th Airwing Station at Joint Base Charleston from the Air 
Mobility Command that is under the command of TRANSCOM.
    Joint Base Charleston, my birthplace, is a great example of 
joint readiness across the force, and that is due to the 
leadership within TRANSCOM enterprise. However, we must always 
ensure in--our readiness remains high in order to counter the 
threats from peer competitors.
    Could you explain the key TRANSCOM mobility readiness 
concerns that hinders logistics, enterprise, and the ability to 
maintain global power projection to maintain peace through 
strength?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you for the question. Having been 
stationed at Charleston, the mighty 437th, and had been on the 
ports there, you have a seaport there as well that really 
support us. So when I think about readiness, especially when I 
think about our strategic airlift fleet, it's very important 
that the services continue to fund the readiness funds and the 
flying hour funds which you will see in this budget to ensure a 
healthy C-5 and C-17 fleet.
    The C-5 is showing its wear and aging. And I'm a little bit 
concerned about its readiness. So we need to continue to focus 
on that.
    The C-17 is doing great work as you've seen around the 
globe, Afghanistan, Ukraine. The C-17 has been there, and it's 
a fantastic aircraft. But I think about our crews, right?
    Our people are the most important aspect of what we do, 
ensuring that they're trained and ready. So making sure that 
they have the flying hours, the simulator hours, and that they 
have the unique scenarios. And I don't just want to say from 
the air side, but from the sea side.
    Are we training our mariners to be able to operate in a 
contested environment, to do consolidated refueling underway, 
and to use secure communications to ensure they understand the 
battle space? So all of that comes together to ensure a ready 
force, the people and the assets. And we're very focused on 
that.
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you. And I appreciate you referencing the 
Port of Charleston. They just completed the dredging of 52 
feet. It is now the deepest port on the East Coast.
    It also celebrates the largest export of cars from the 
United States worldwide. We want everybody to have a BMW X5 
worldwide and a Volvo too and then Sprinter vans on the side. 
So the Port of Charleston is just so invaluable.
    With that in mind, the chairman of being ahead of the 
curve, Chairman Mike Waltz, the lack of mariners, this has just 
got to be addressed. And what is being done to identify, again, 
institutions, training centers, opportunities to serve as 
mariners? And it is particularly critical because I hope also 
that projection is in place and pre-positioning of equipment.
    It concerns me that when it was announced that America was 
going to be providing 31 tanks to the people of Ukraine, it was 
reported that we had no more. And of course, I looked into it. 
We have 8,000 more. But it just really frightened the American 
people. And then how can we accelerate delivery?
    Admiral Phillips. Yes, sir. And I'll be brief in response 
to providing additional opportunities for mariners just earlier 
this morning, we have a Centers of Excellence program. We can 
designated Centers of Excellence in support of mariner 
training. We also work closely with State maritime academies 
which provide mariners for our ports.
    And at Kings Point, the Merchant Marine Academy is overseen 
by the Maritime Administration. That's our predominate source 
of strategic sealift officers. And of course, we work very hard 
to ensure we have as much capacity as possible there as well. 
And I'll defer to the general on the additional services.
    General Van Ovost. We're working closely with the Army on 
the Abrams tanks and where they want to source them and how 
we're going to deliver.
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you very much. I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Mr. Wilson. I recognize Mr. Panetta.
    Mr. Panetta. Outstanding. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General 
Van Ovost, I was glad to see that you signed a charter with 
U.S. SOUTHCOM [United States Southern Command] last June for 
regional humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
    Now obviously, Latin America experiences a number of 
natural disasters, including earthquakes like we've seen in 
Haiti unfortunately. However, looking at the Indo-Pacific, just 
between 2014 and 2017, that region appears to have more natural 
disasters than most with 55 earthquakes, 217 storms and 
cyclones, and even 236 cases of severe flooding. It is these 
types of extreme weather conditions that I think as you 
understand pose considerable risk to our command and control 
and ability to mobilize troops and are the main awareness.
    And so I have been working with my colleagues, Mr. 
Gallagher, Mr. Scott, Mr. Gimenez, on legislation that would 
conduct tabletop exercises to test our current stockpiles and 
our abilities to deter threats in the Indo-Pacific while under 
these types of extreme weather conditions. General, what is 
your opinion as to whether or not we are properly accounting 
for these types of natural disasters in our strategy in dealing 
with a potential CCP [Chinese Communist Party] invasion of 
Taiwan?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you for that question. Having been 
an airlifter all of my life, I have been very focused on HADR 
[Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response] events around 
the globe. And frankly, when I think about our ability to 
project and sustain a force around the globe, there's no 
greater opportunity than delivering hope to someone, right?
    Our allies are assured by the fact that we can be there 
once we commit to support them, just like we did during that 
devastating earthquake for Turkey, providing a hospital as well 
as the search and rescue crews are on their way within 24 
hours. So we absolutely looked at it. In fact, we're doing 
additional exercises in the Indo-Pacific, specifically with the 
Philippines, providing HADR and looking at forward positioning 
HADR sets so that we would have immediate access from that 
point to move to any of the islands in support of them.
    Mr. Panetta. Okay. All right. Now in regards to the 
challenges that we talked about, especially in the Indo-
Pacific, if we were to conduct a whole of government tabletop 
exercise to prepare for climate events, what should that 
include from a transportation perspective? Is there anything in 
particular that you're focused on?
    General Van Ovost. Absolutely. When we think about climate 
change and its effects on our infrastructure, we think of the 
ports or the rising sea levels. We have to be sure that we have 
plans, which we do, for our strategic port programs.
    We do assessments through our transportation engineering 
agency on strategic ports, providing them what we think are 
their vulnerabilities during high sea levels. And so being able 
to mobilize the force and deploy forward to a port to push out 
is one of our most concerning areas. And so as we look at that, 
what is that infrastructure, the road, the rail, and the 
seaport, necessary to do that. And so I would say that should 
be part of the TTX [table top exercises].
    Mr. Panetta. Switching regions, looking at Africa, 
obviously with China's desired--well, one, that they do have a 
military base in Djibouti and now is looking to put a second 
one in Equatorial Guinea. On top of building out a military 
presence in Africa, the CCP is maneuvering around the continent 
through the Belt and Road Initiative as we know about. I guess 
in looking at some of our allies which is obviously one of your 
chief concerns and strengthening the relationships, at least a 
hedge against some of these threats from the CCP.
    But there are certain restrictions. Obviously, when it 
comes to security and the security environment in some of these 
countries, what have we done? How productive have we been to 
prepare our African partners to not only deny Chinese gains? 
But is TRANSCOM integrating with AFRICOM [U.S. African Command] 
to ensure that the assistance we offer is tailored to their 
needs and implemented?
    General Van Ovost. Yeah, that's an important question, as 
you mentioned, not just in Africa but around the globe as China 
continues to use their malign influence to get into port 
infrastructure and frankly the Digital Silk Road with their 
ability to use data management systems to infiltrate and then 
aggregate that data and send it back to China from a logistics 
flow which is a key vulnerability. So we have been working a 
whole of government effort with State Department, Department of 
Commerce to look at Chinese investments in Africa and around 
the globe and marshaling U.S. resources to try to understand 
how can we limit that, how do we engage with that nation. But 
from a transportation command perspective only, we have a 
community of interest across the intel committees with our 
allies and partners to demonstrate to them how important it 
would be that they do not let them invest in their ports.
    Mr. Panetta. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you. Mr. Gimenez is now recognized.
    Mr. Gimenez. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
As mayor of Miami-Dade, we ran Port Miami which is the Cruise 
Capital of the World, probably home to the about 20 of the most 
beautiful cruise ships you are ever going to see. Admiral, do 
you know how many of those are built in the United States?
    Admiral Phillips. I do not directly know, sir. But I 
suspect none.
    Mr. Gimenez. Zero were built in the United States. And so I 
believe, Mr. Chairman, that the problem that we have is not 
only that we don't have the production capacity. And there's no 
reason why it can't be built in the United States.
    Those cruise ships, actually a lot of them are built in 
Europe. So you really can't say it's cheap labor costs. 
Something else is going on, why ships are not being built in 
the United States.
    Difference between now and the time between World War I and 
World War II is America probably led the world in ship building 
in that time. That's why we were able to ramp up so quickly 
during World War II and basically out-produce everybody. And we 
were the arsenal democracy because we produced everything.
    We don't do that anymore. And so my ask of you, Mr. 
Chairman, is that we look at the committee's jurisdiction and 
see what it is that we're doing here in the United States to 
shut down production or stymie the production of the things 
that we need and we know we need for producing the materials 
that we need to conduct a war.
    And so shifting gears a little bit, Admiral, you said that 
we have a shortage of mariners. Is a career in--a maritime 
career, is that a career that somebody can have a good quality 
of life, a good middle class quality of life, a mariner? Does 
it pay well?
    Admiral Phillips. Yes, sir. It pays well. However, you have 
to go to sea.
    Mr. Gimenez. Okay. I understand that. Do you need a college 
degree to be a mariner?
    Admiral Phillips. You do not need a college degree to be a 
mariner.
    Mr. Gimenez. Okay. You said that you are looking at 
shortages right now. How many mariners do we need now? And how 
many mariners are we going to need in the future?
    Admiral Phillips. Our numbers are based on a study that was 
done in 2017 which is directed by Congress and shows we're 
short at least 1,800. We would expect that number to grow over 
time.
    Mr. Gimenez. To what?
    Admiral Phillips. I will take that for the record, sir. But 
we don't know. It all depends on what our needs are in the 
future.
    [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix 
on page 77.]
    Mr. Gimenez. Where do you get them from now, the mariners?
    Admiral Phillips. Get them from our six State maritime 
academies. We get them from Kings Point, our primary source of 
mariners--licensed mariners with a naval Reserve obligation. 
And we get them from union schools across the country which 
support both licensed and unlicensed mariners.
    Mr. Gimenez. What are you doing to address the shortage?
    Admiral Phillips. We are working across a whole of 
government. And as I described previously, this is a whole of 
government and industry and other stakeholder challenge. We are 
under the Biden-Harris administration growing the fleet. As 
I've said, we need more ships if you want to have a sustained 
career path for more mariners. TSP program will help us with 
that.
    We're building the NSMV program which will support mariner 
training and our six State maritime academies with brand-new 
state-of-the-art vessels. We're working with industry and other 
stakeholders to develop options and opportunities to do more, 
to advertise this as a path that young people can take to move 
forward. And we're working on safety at sea.
    I described the EMBARC program earlier in this hearing, 
sir. As you know, safety at sea is absolutely paramount for us. 
And in particular, women are under-represented in the maritime 
industry. So 50 percent of our population is only represented 
by about 7 percent of the population within the maritime 
industry. So be able to recruit more people to come into this 
industry, earn a good living as you say, and stay with it over 
time for a career is absolutely paramount.
    Mr. Gimenez. Are these schools located in a certain area of 
the country? Or are they all over the place?
    Admiral Phillips. They're located all over the country.
    Mr. Gimenez. Are there any in South Florida?
    Admiral Phillips. Yes. Well, the Maritime--American 
Maritime Officers facility is located in Dania Beach, Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida.
    Mr. Gimenez. Thank you. Do you work with high schools or do 
you advertise this as a----
    Admiral Phillips. We do work with high schools. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Gimenez. Because one of the things that I am working on 
down in my town is that we have a real big shortage of pilots 
and working with the school system there, trying to see if we 
can open up charter schools or magnet schools that deal with 
aviation. Maybe we should be doing the same thing around the 
world with maritime and the maritime industry because, again, 
one of the things that we want to stress is that you don't need 
a college degree. And you can actually have a very good career 
without saddling yourself with half a million dollars in debt 
and give your family a good quality of life. Thank you, ma'am. 
I appreciate it, and I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. The gentleman's time has expired. Thank you, Mr. 
Gimenez. Ms. Tokuda is recognized for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I understand that 
TRANSCOM was not handling global bulk fuel distribution at the 
time of the fuel leak that we experienced in Hawaii at Red 
Hill. But since the leak, last year's NDAA appointed TRANSCOM 
is a single manager of bulk fuel.
    Even as we move towards defueling and the permanent closure 
of Red Hill, bulk fuel posture will remain a focus for Hawaii 
given, as we have discussed often in this room, Hawaii's 
strategic location in the Indo-Pacific theater. General Van 
Ovost, as TRANSCOM is planning and preparing the single manager 
of global bulk fuel, what are the implications of a contested 
environment on bulk fuel capacity distribution?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you, Congresswoman. Being the 
manager for global bulk fuel, a single manager, really it's a 
different approach to managing fuel. It allows us to 
synchronize a complex system of systems to ensure we can get 
from source to the point of need in a contested environment.
    So we're going to be operating differently in the contested 
environment. So we're looking at things in the posture in the 
Pacific and how we plan and how we execute. We had multiple 
studies and war games that came to this conclusion that we had 
multiple gaps.
    And I would say that we're attacking those gaps, the first 
of which is the tanker security program which is buying down 
some of the risk. But we're also doing fuel planning with 
Admiral Aquilino in the Pacific where we need to posture that 
fuel, where we need to store it to include storing on the water 
so it'd be the most effective location. And then we have 
resilient locations so that if one is lost, we still have 
others to be able to feed the fight.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. But would you please also provide 
given all of the work that you have done, the timeline for 
executing the new bulk fuel posture and when TRANSCOM will 
provide an update on the distribution of work to members of 
this committee?
    General Van Ovost. Yeah, thank you. We are working with 
INDOPACOM and doing the bulk fuel assessment now and multiple 
engagements with them. We expect that we should have this done 
by early fall in which case we'll bring back to Admiral 
Aquilino and we'll work with the Department to finalize the 
posture and, of course, with DLA [Defense Logistics Agency] as 
well who is a key partner in all of this and to where the 
locations need to be. I'd probably be a mixture of contractor 
own, contractor operate, all the way to government owned, 
government operated, both on the land and on the water.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. If I could just move on with the 
remainder of my time to military sealift in the Indo-Pacific. 
Our sealift capacity to move materials and troops out into the 
Western Pacific is critical to our ability to deter aggression 
and, if necessary, sustain and win any conflict that may occur.
    However, we have seen our country's capacity to build large 
commercial ships, useful for sealift purposes, decline in 
recent decades--we have had this discussion--leading to a major 
shortage of these ships that meet a critical national security 
need. At the same time, we also have a shortage of skilled 
certified mariners. And we have talked a little bit about it 
today, that can operate these ships in a surge environment 
during an extended major conflict. General, what are the 
implications and risks that the current situation poses to our 
national security, especially our ability to deter foreign 
aggression in the Indo-Pacific?
    General Van Ovost. Thank you for the question. This is 
something we think about all the time as we do the assessment 
of our sealift capacity against a national defense strategy. 
And that is how we set the limit for the number of ships and 
frankly the number of square feet of capability we need to have 
in the Ready Reserve force and also why it's so important that 
we have the maritime security program and now the tanker 
security program to bring civilian capacity to bear. So we are 
managing that between civilian and military. But I'll tell you 
it's very important that we maintain readiness which is why we 
need to ensure the sealift recapitalization rate is steady so 
that we can gain the readiness back of the ship so we can gain 
the capacity back.
    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. And Rear Admiral Phillips, not to 
leave out of this discussion, how can we protect and build up 
our commercial sealift capacity while also developing the 
workforce needed to sustain and expand in capacity?
    Admiral Phillips. Ma'am, thank you for that question. And 
as General Van Ovost has stated, the two go together. In order 
to provide more billets for mariners to man, you need more 
ships for them to sail into--or work into.
    So what we do to expand our U.S. flag fleet, including as 
the general has discussed maintaining MSP [Military Spouse 
Preference] and CSP [Career Skills Program] but also expanding 
TSP, the type of security program that provides more billets 
for mariners. And in that context over time, we find that we 
have additional capacity. And that helps us to not only meet or 
needs for national economic security but continue to expand our 
capacity for both mariners on the commercial and on Ready 
Reserve force side.
    Ms. Tokuda. I yield back my time.
    Mr. Waltz. I recognize Mr. Johnson.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Van Ovost, it 
was great visiting with you last week in our office. One of the 
things we discussed was your focus on infrastructure and how it 
impacts TRANSCOM's ability to provide power projection 
capabilities to the joint force.
    We were talking about the conditions of roads and ports and 
railways and pipelines and all the rest. It is critically 
important for these transportation routes around the country. 
So I wonder if you would just say a quick word about the 
importance of those components to achieving TRANSCOM's mission 
and anything that Congress can do to ensure these lines receive 
adequate consideration for funding to ensure that you are able 
to provide the power projection capabilities to the force.
    General Van Ovost. Thank you for that question. Through the 
Transportation Engineering Agency, we look very closely at the 
roads, the railway, and the seaports and our ability to go from 
a power projection platform to a seaport and push out in time 
of national crisis. And frankly, our adversaries are also 
looking at this as well because if they could stop us here in 
the United States where we have 85 percent of our force 
elements, then we cannot respond and we cannot deter.
    So I am concerned about the national infrastructure. It is 
sufficient today, but I'm watching it crumble. So especially as 
we're working with the Federal Highway Administration, about 
6,000 miles of roads that are really important for us for 
national security, I ask for your support to provide an 
authorization in the NDAA that promotes the consideration of 
military needs when prioritizing the funding on public 
highways.
    That would be very important for us to recapitalize. Of 
course, it also provides an economic benefit. But as we look 
and we rack and stack the priorities to ensure that we can get 
a free flow, multiple ways from a power projecting platform to 
a seaport and we outline those areas, we ask that the States 
actually follow through and apply for those grants and support.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you. We can't lose sight of the 
importance of that. Admiral Phillips, I'd like to ask you 
briefly about Title XI ship financing that program. It's my 
understanding that authorizations and appropriations for that 
program have remained relatively consistent for the past 
several years. Is that right?
    Admiral Phillips. It is. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Johnson. And looking at the data from MARAD on the 
website, it appears that there is several large ship building 
contracts coming up that are looking to utilize Title XI. And 
many of these ships look like they will qualify for their 
preference given to vessels for offshore wind construction and 
maintenance. So can you talk to us very briefly about the 
military usefulness of ships built using Title XI financing and 
that program and whether increased detention of that program 
from Congress would alleviate some of the challenges that we 
have been talking about today.
    Admiral Phillips. Sir, thank you for that question. Title 
XI supports a number of different kinds of ships. Right now, we 
have designated offshore wind vessels, vessels of national 
interest.
    And as we may do, as we have the authority to do under the 
program, they are the first vessels such designated and--or so 
designated. And we do, in fact, have a considerable amount of 
interest there. However, we have interest in other vessels as 
well.
    And we're working a total of seven different opportunities 
right now, loan applications in the Title XI program. So Title 
XI can do all kinds of things. We have approximately 35 million 
in the program right now which will allow us to support up to 
475 million worth of additional borrowing capacity.
    And we've seen an uptick in interest in that program over 
the last year caused by a number of things. Certainly there's 
an interest in offshore wind. But also interest rates are 
changing and this program provides some additional capacity 
there.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you. A less comfortable question is 
about the controversy at the Merchant Marine Academy with the 
painting. And I just want to know is it try that while the 
superintendent of the academy there, Admiral Joanna Nunan made 
a decision to cover the historic painting, Christ on the Water, 
that is hung on the way of the room at the Merchant Marine 
Academy for nearly 80 years. She made the decision to cover it 
initially.
    But she also approved and endorsed, I am told, a prominent 
display to promote and celebrate, quote, ``different 
sexualities and gender identities.'' Are you aware of that? Is 
that true?
    Admiral Phillips. Thank you for that question, sir. 
Certainly, I'm aware of both issues. The painting is 
problematic because it expresses a specific preference of 
religion.
    Mr. Johnson. Well, let me stop you. Hang on a second.
    Admiral Phillips. And the other wall is less problematic 
because it----
    Mr. Johnson. Okay. Hang on just a second. Apparently, she 
also said that she explained that all of this is her effort to 
promote a culture change at the academy. I'm a former First 
Amendment lawyer. I used to defend religious freedom.
    I can tell you that is not a violation of the Establishment 
Clause. Anybody who told you that doesn't what they are talking 
about. They need to read the court cases.
    But there's a group of alumni and parents that are deeply 
concerned about this because they think all this shows a 
hostility towards religion and it may affect recruiting efforts 
at the school. I am almost out of time. But I think these 
things need to be top of mind because we are all talking about 
the crisis in recruitment.
    And if you show a hostility towards a large group of 
students and the religious heritage of the institution, I think 
that has a negative effect on it. If you can respond. I am out 
of time, but if you would respond to that.
    Admiral Phillips. Thank you, sir. There is no hostility 
towards religion at the academy. There are quite a few affinity 
groups that are religious-based that are very active. In 
addition to that as described by Congress, there are other 
affinity groups that we have been tasked under the NAPA 
[National Academy of Public Administration] report which you 
may be familiar with to elevate and expose and talk about. And 
the wall in question is a way that supports affinity groups 
across the academy and provides notice of their activities 
which we were directed by Congress to specifically consider as 
one of the NAPA report recommendations specifically highlighted 
to address post-2023 NDAA.
    Mr. Waltz. The gentleman's time has expired. I recognize 
Mr. Norcross.
    Mr. Norcross. Thank you. We have had discussions on my last 
two committees from strat [strategic] forces to workforce and 
education, talking about the next generation workforce. 
Certainly in the remarks that you had earlier, we are talking 
about that unknown of when is the next generation.
    We have seen capacity for ship building in our country 
diminish over the last 50 years but certainly the last 10. I 
just want to jump on the discussion that Mr. Courtney had with 
you concerning the projects going on at the Philly Yard. And 
quite frankly, I was shocked when I heard that that ship was 
within one percent of the budget. But putting all that aside, 
capacity to build things in this country has been diminished. 
And certainly the shipyards, either private or public, are part 
of that equation.
    Ms. Phillips, if you could talk to us about why we wouldn't 
expand a program that is successful and use the capacity that 
is being built but also is learning to do this in such a way, 
quite frankly, we are not seeing much of that anymore. For a 
private company to go out on a limb and invest this, but more 
importantly the workforce which takes years to develop. Why 
aren't we looking at that to expand the program that was set 
into place in another model?
    Admiral Phillips. So sir, thank you for that question. If 
you are asking in the context of the way the NSMV is being 
built, the vessel construction manager program which is 
successful.
    Mr. Norcross. Yes. But it's the workforce behind it that we 
are developing as a country that is something that is very much 
in need. And the fact that program so far by any measurement we 
are getting is working quite well.
    Admiral Phillips. So sir, I agree with you certainly that 
it is working quite well. And the way to continue to expand 
that capacity is to continue to expand the opportunities to 
build vessels in U.S. shipyards. And of course, Philly has 
shown that they have this capacity and they have this ability 
and they have orders past the five ships that we will build for 
them which I would consider a success. The challenge is what 
are the next opportunities to provide capacity for yards and 
orders for yards so that they may continue to build and develop 
this workforce as well.
    Mr. Norcross. Buying a new ship is not going to get us 
there for the next generation. But I just wanted to reiterate 
how important that is to build that capacity. We talk about 
research and development for so many of the items, incredibly 
important.
    But the one that takes the longest and is most fragile is 
our physical workforce. So thank you. General, let's talk about 
our flying tankers, and you might've addressed it when I wasn't 
here. But would you give us the most recent update on the 
visual system on the KC-46 and when we reasonably can expect 
that to be employed not only for those that are already in 
service but those that are coming off the line?
    General Van Ovost. Yeah, thanks for that question. First of 
all, I want to thank the Air Force for submitting the budget. 
We have 15 KC-46s in the budget to continue the multi-year 
program.
    The remote visual system, next generation of that, is--they 
have tested it. Boom operators have tested it and they like it. 
I'm looking forward to them placing it onto production 
airplanes and to cut in about the '25-'26 time frame.
    Until then, I was happy that the air mobility command 
commander did authorize full employment of the KC-46. In fact, 
we are flying the KC-46 around the globe. I have it for testing 
authority, and we're using it. And they're asking for it in 
many of the high-end exercises because of its incredible 
capabilities.
    So I am optimistic. But until we get the full capability of 
the airplane, I am concerned about just maintaining readiness 
and making sure that we can continue to get crews trained and 
qualified. As you know, we're transitioning from KC-10s and KC-
135s into that. So keeping the pipeline going and keeping the 
readiness overall of the fleet to include the KC-135s which we 
must be focused and do targeted modernization and readiness 
programs which the Air Force is supporting.
    Mr. Norcross. So the boom operators who are working with 
the system that is present in place, early on, there was 
concern and notably so. But if they are liking it and they are 
enjoying the ability to do what they are doing under the 
current visual system because now we are moving towards the 
next generation. Would you say that the boom operators are 
working well with the system that is in place?
    General Van Ovost. The boom operators are able to function 
with the system in place. It's not optimal. And that's why we 
absolutely are pressing Boeing to get the new visualization 
system in as soon as possible.
    Mr. Norcross. Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Mr. Norcross. Mr. Moylan.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to our 
witnesses, contacting my office ahead of time and having good 
discussions. I appreciate that. So this question is going out 
for both of you, please. Of course, I'm focused on the Guam and 
Indo-Pacific area.
    And so I would like to know, what are the benefits of 
utilizing Guam as a forward staging area given that it is part 
of the United States? We are talking about our allies, but Guam 
is part of the United States. Despite the proximity to East 
Asia and importantly, if you can also touch on some time lines 
that, of course, I know you would know about and if there's any 
red tape that we should be concerned about to expedite the 
process on ensuring that Guam is well protected for national 
defense.
    General Van Ovost. I thank you for that question. And Guam 
has received a lot of attention for great reason. It is 
absolutely a key part of our programs, and it provides us a 
forward location from which we'll get additional access-basing 
and overflight to be able to work more readily with our 
partners out in the Pacific.
    So I thank you for your support. A lot has been going on 
with respect to Guam. The air defense system, you've seen it in 
the fiscal year 2024 budget and in the unfunded priority 
request by Admiral Aquilino to ensure that we have the adequate 
defenses there as they're building up there on the base and 
multiple layers that gives us the resilience.
    You see us re-posturing, both air, land, and sea assets, to 
be able to use Guam most effectively. And so that's been very 
helpful. I think about our ability to--as I think about re-
posturing fuel in the Pacific as well as pre-positioning.
    It also provides us a great location to work from. So we 
could not do without. And we talk about geometry of the battle, 
that's a key geometric location.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you, General. And aligned also with U.S. 
TRANSCOM, the role that you play in ensuring that the civilian 
population of the U.S. citizens in Guam is reliably supplied in 
times of war and other disasters. My colleague from California 
talked about the disasters and how helpful we will be to 
especially like our allies.
    You discussed about in the Philippines some exercises that 
we were doing in that concern too. I am interested in the 
exercises that we would have for Guam, especially natural 
disasters where we have the typhoons and earthquakes as well. 
And unfortunately, we don't have the--we can't truck things in. 
We can't do much other than using your effective forces to 
ensure that the civilian population of less than 170,000 are 
well taken care of as well also with our military presence 
there too.
    We all share one resource there, power of water and food 
supplies. And we are reliant upon one another. So I am hoping 
you can help me understanding on how you project that would 
help. And if there is any--of course, the timelines that we are 
concerned with and any red tape that we can help reduce.
    General Van Ovost. As you mention, we have a number of 
exercises that we do on the Pacific that are HA--humanitarian 
assistance response-oriented. And we have kits that are forward 
deployed. And I really--I will defer. I could take that 
question for the record.
    But really we're working in PACOM [Pacific Command]--
because I don't have the numbers of exercises and the timing of 
those exercises. But from a TRANSCOM perspective when I think 
about the infrastructure at Guam, I think about your ability to 
withstand high seas and typhoons. And as we built the new 
standards, we build climate control, we build to the standards 
of hurricanes or typhoons so that they will be able to 
withstand those operations. But I will have to take that one 
for the record.
    [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix 
on page 77.]
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you, General. And Rear Admiral, what 
would you say would be some of the most useful improvements to 
Guam's ship repair capabilities--capacities for the military 
sealift command? Of course, we understand with Admiral 
Aquilino.
    We had the field issue as well. But specifically just 
talking about the ship repair facilities, at one time, that was 
a very big industry on the island. It is no longer.
    But with our strategic location, what is your feelings on 
that? Would this be helpful? And are we behind the time frame, 
or do we have some red tape issues that we have to address?
    Admiral Phillips. Congressman Moylan, thank you very much 
for that question, sir. In the context of ship repair, 
particularly in response to DOD needs, certainly as you are 
aware, I've been stationed there in the past on a U.S. Navy 
ship. However, I would defer for a current state of repair and 
the needs of DOD to the Department of Defense. Certainly, we 
appreciate the circumstances surrounding the need for that 
capacity on the island of Guam and appreciate your interest and 
support in it. And I think I'd defer to the general for 
additional context.
    General Van Ovost. And I would defer to the Navy. We'll 
have to take that.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Mr. Moylan. I recognize Ms. Mace.
    Ms. Mace. Thank you, and I want to thank the chairman and 
ranking member for this hearing today. I want to thank our 
witnesses for being with us as well. General and Rear Admiral, 
I appreciate your time today.
    South Carolina's 1st Congressional District is in a 
critical location as you all know for TRANSCOM and MARAD. Due 
to its strategic location, extensive transportation 
infrastructure from I-95 to the Port of Charleston to Joint 
Base Charleston, the Port of Charleston is one of the busiest 
ports in the U.S. and is a critical hub for the movement of 
cargo and personnel. It is a deep water harbor and has 
significant gateway for U.S. TRANSCOM sea base logistics 
operations, including the transport of military equipment and 
supplies, including in January of this year when more than 60 
Bradleys were shipped overseas as part of the aid package to 
Ukraine.
    Additionally, Joint Base Charleston is a key U.S. military 
installation providing support for all branches of the 
military, including U.S. TRANSCOM. It is home to the 628th Air 
Base Wing which provides support services for U.S. TRANSCOM's 
airlift and refueling operations. We are home to the C-17 
Globemaster IIIs which participated in many of the airlift 
evacuations out of Afghanistan.
    General, my first question today is for you. You stated in 
your testimony the joint deployment distribution enterprise 
relies on both government and commercially owned and operated 
infrastructure. Our number one pacing threat, the PRC [People's 
Republic of China], continues to leverage the commercial 
industry and operate in a very gray zone in some cases.
    As the TRANSCOM commander, how are you looking at 
technology, cybersecurity, AI, technological innovations to 
ensure your mission in protecting and sustaining all combat 
operations? Is it interrupted or threatened by the PRC and 
their continued aggression?
    General Van Ovost. I think I am concerned about PRC 
activities, their continued espionage, their coercion, 
especially as they use cyber and space. With respect to the 
significant amount that we depend on our commercial partners, 
we have been working with them to ensure cybersecurity 
standards on their networks so that they can defend themselves 
safeguard defense information. And through our contracts they 
annually assess against what are loosely the NIST [National 
Institute of Standards and Technology] standards.
    And they provide us reports on their hardening. And we also 
collaborate with them and we read them in. And we also share 
intelligence. And they're able to leverage the no-cost 
cybersecurity options that the Cyber Collaboration Center and 
the DIB Cybersecurity Program offer them.
    So I think we've made some really good headway. The C 
Suites are paying attention to it. And it's really been 
important. And we see it because as you know, great examples 
right now with Russia-Ukraine with Russia in cyber.
    And they want to slow down logistics flow, right? And so 
let me just add that the intelligence that's collected via the 
FISA [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] 702 program has 
really been proven to be a vital tool for us to understand 
where the enemy is. And that FISA 702 is going to expire at the 
end of this year. So I would appreciate consideration for how 
do we keep those kinds of authorities available because it's a 
significant amount of intelligence we're getting from the FISA 
702.
    And think about AI. Again, my ability to respond to the 
greatest need requires me to be able to sense all the ports, 
see all of the assets in motion, and then predict the 
requirements of the joint force, wherever they might be based 
on if there's a hurricane somewhere or if there's a conflict 
going on somewhere. So I use AI data. Nirvana would be that I 
would see and sense everything and be able to maneuver the 
force fluidly to respond.
    Ms. Mace. Are you able to do that now?
    General Van Ovost. We are not able to do that now. That 
is--that is a--it's a high level requirement. But we're working 
with Advana. We have an incensiation of data and analytical 
tools. And we're going to bite this elephant one at a time, 
right?
    Ms. Mace. What do you need to get there? What will it take?
    General Van Ovost. What we're doing right now is exposing 
the data and grabbing the data, structuring it so that we can 
use it. We have the data. It's just we're pulling it together.
    We've been working with the Department of Defense on their 
AI data accelerator. And we're using their resources, so I'm 
very appreciative of that. And then eventually when we have our 
own program, we will probably require a little manpower and 
some funds for analytical tools. But I don't have that 
requirement this year.
    Ms. Mace. Got it. Thank you so much, and I yield back.
    Mr. Waltz. Thank you, Ms. Mace. Again, I want to thank you 
both. These are incredibly important issues. In the 5 years 
that I have been here, we have all been--Chairman Kelly shares 
my concern. We have all been pulling our hair out on the 
criticality and your shortages and your needs, particularly in 
the sealift fleet.
    We are determined. I was just talking to some of the staff 
to press our appropriations colleagues on getting you the 
appropriations that you need and continuing to get you the 
authorities that you need to rebuild much of what has atrophied 
over the years. With that, the hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:47 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

             RESPONSE TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MR. GIMENEZ

    Admiral Phillips. It is difficult to estimate how large the mariner 
shortage could grow given the variables involved in calculating the 
availability of qualified mariners. For context, the study prepared by 
the Maritime Workforce Working Group and released by MARAD in 2017 
found that the U.S. was approximately 1,800 mariners short of the 
number of mariners with unlimited tonnage credentials needed to sustain 
a full activation of the Ready Reserve Force (RRF) and our commercially 
operated vessels concurrently to meet sealift needs.
    Specifically, the 2017 analysis determined that, based on the U.S.-
flag fleet at the time, concurrent operations of the commercial U.S.-
flag fleet and sustained military sealift operations would require 
13,607 U.S. mariners with unlimited credentials. In 2017, the estimated 
pool of actively sailing mariners was comprised of 11,768 active, 
qualified mariners--documenting a deficit of 1,839. These estimates 
were based on the consensus that many commercial ships enjoy a billet 
ratio of 2:1--for every mariner serving onboard in a billet, there is 
one mariner ashore on leave, waiting to relieve the mariner at sea.
    This scenario assumed that all qualified mariners would be both 
available and willing to sail. The number of ships under our flag 
determines the number of commercial billets available to all our 
commercial mariners. The Tanker Security and Cable Security Fleet 
Programs provide billets for additional mariners. However, these 
programs alone do not address the deficit in the number of qualified 
mariners.
    During the six years since the 2017 study was released, the U.S. 
Merchant Marine underwent continuing changes in technology and in 
globally standardized credentialing requirements as well as the impacts 
of an unprecedented global pandemic, all of which have impacted the 
size of our mariner pool.   [See page 27.]

    General Van Ovost. I defer to the Maritime Administrator to respond 
on this issue.   [See page 21.]
    Admiral Phillips. In early January, USMMA received a First 
Amendment complaint citing the Establishment Clause regarding the 
painting located in the Astronaut Elliot M. See Room. This room had 
been used to conduct mandatory USMMA business, including proceedings 
held to determine whether a Midshipman had violated USMMA's Honor Code.
    The ``Christ on the Water'' painting was carefully transferred to 
an art conservation facility for cleaning and restoration, which we 
expect to be completed late this Summer or early Fall. Once completed, 
the Academy plans to mount the painting in the Mariners' Memorial 
Chapel. Prior to having the painting restored, it was displayed, 
uncovered, in the Elliott See Conference Room, and members of the 
community had unrestricted access to the space while no official USMMA 
business was conducted in the room. The Academy remains deeply 
committed to ensuring that all members of our community are respected 
and supported.   [See page 21.]

              RESPONSE TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MR. MOYLAN
    General Van Ovost. There is a well-established relationship between 
the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies to include 
FEMA, ensuring that when needed, the federal response to natural 
disasters is swift and coordinated across the whole of government. I am 
not aware of any recent large-scale Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster 
Relief exercises conducted on Guam, but USTRANSCOM will make every 
effort to support such an event should the opportunity present itself 
in the future. As you know, USINDOPACOM is the lead Combatant Command 
for the Guam region and USTRANSCOM stands ready to fully support them 
with the transportation of personnel, supplies, and equipment into or 
out of Guam as required.   [See page 34.]

              QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MEMBERS POST HEARING

                             March 28, 2023

=======================================================================

      

                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. WITTMAN

    Mr. Wittman. Companies in the moving industry who provide services 
to the Department of Defense as Transportation Service Providers (TSPs) 
have raised multiple concerns about the Department's decision to make 
several disruptive changes to the Defense Personal Property Program 
(DP3) through the program's 2023 Business Rules. They are especially 
concerned that changes to the carrier scoring system (Best Value Score 
2.0/BVS 2.0) will impact their ability to forecast moves and provide 
capacity for the Department during the coming peak moving season. Did 
the Department conduct a predictive analysis of the impacts to 
industry's ability to provide capacity before advancing these changes? 
If not, why was such an analysis not conducted given the importance of 
industry capacity to providing quality moving service to our nation's 
servicemembers?
    General Van Ovost. USTRANSCOM has not stopped with improvements to 
the current program for our families while we wait on the Global 
Household Goods Contract implementation. The Best Value Score change 
was a key transformation initiative implemented carefully and 
collaboratively. While we acknowledge the importance of capacity, this 
key change was necessary due to our concerns about the volume of 
``quality'' capacity provided to our nation's servicemembers, which 
continues to be unacceptable.
    USTRANSCOM conducted various levels of predictive analytics 
concerning how BVS 2.0 could affect the industry and accordingly, we 
collaborated with industry prior to implementation. This analysis 
allowed us to understand potential impacts of BVS 2.0 on industry, and 
we included a high level of collaboration with industry prior to 
implementation. As a result, the team made several key changes to scale 
back BVS 2.0, to reduce negative impact on industry while also 
delivering the necessary improvements to the program.
    This collaborative approach, and the analysis undertaken by the 
Command was important to help mitigate impact on industry; however, the 
need to implement BVS 2.0 was even more important. Since first 
providing the details behind this change in July 2022, we've seen a 
downward trend in missed required delivery dates (RDD) and an upward 
trend in Claims Satisfaction Survey results--both possibly due to TSP 
changing behavior to improve future scoring under new system. BVS 2.0 
was initiated in February 2023, and moving forward we believe BVS 2.0 
is critical as we also expect fewer missed pickups/RDDs, decreased 
personal property damage, improved overall satisfaction, and improved 
claims processes.
    Mr. Wittman. Historically the Department has faced challenges with 
securing responses from servicemembers on their satisfaction with their 
Permanent Change of Station Household Goods move (Customer Satisfaction 
Survey/CSS). This is an issue that Congress has raised in the past and 
the Department has made multiple attempts at addressing. The Committee 
understands that the Department is using a new contractor for these 
Surveys and that there has been some improvement in response, but 
responses continue to lag. Please provide an overview of the current 
CSS program, what response rate and distribution across locations and 
services would the Department consider as representative of industry 
performance, what steps the contractor is currently taking to increase 
responses by servicemembers, and what plans the contractor and the 
Department have in place should those efforts not be successful.
    General Van Ovost. The Customer Satisfaction Survey provides 
critical feedback from service members that also informs which 
Transportation Service Providers (TSP) are awarded future business. A 
contract was awarded in January 2021 to a company specializing in 
third-party surveys. The improved methodology and collection techniques 
independently assessed performance using commercial best practices. 
There was potential to improve response rates above the historic 
average of 22% and initial small-scale evaluation of the 2021 platform 
yielded up to a 40% response rate. However, after the full-scale 
rollout the response rates dropped back to historical levels.
    USTRANSCOM adjusted again by re-awarding the contract. As of 
January 2023, the program is now managed internally at USTRANSCOM with 
an average survey response rate of 27%. This exceeds the historical 
response rates of 22% and in alignment with market standards which 
denote 20-30% as typical, with higher response rates above average.
    The new survey methodology focuses on origin, destination, and 
claims services. Other improvements include more thoughtful timing of 
survey deployment and reminders, expanded survey windows, and analysis 
of variables such as survey type and service affiliation as they relate 
to response rate trends. When the new CSS is paired with improvements 
offered by BVS 2.0, the customer's voice is amplified, as are the 
objective measures already in-place in the program.
    USTRANSCOM's internal management allows ongoing coordination with 
the CSS contractor to continuously monitor, assess and adjust the 
program as necessary to optimize response rates. This approach aligns 
with the Global Household Goods Contract, which includes CSS as a key 
performance indicator.
                                 ______
                                 
                    QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. SCOTT
    Mr. Scott. What more work needs to be done with the U.S. Navy, 
other Military Departments, and the rest of the Joint community to 
collectively address future contested environments and the best means 
to protect deployment and distribution from the point of origin to the 
point of need?
    General Van Ovost. Recent operational exercises and future-focused 
wargaming experimentation and analyses highlight various challenges 
requiring continued investment and development to ensure the Joint 
Deployment and Distribution Enterprise (JDDE) remains postured to 
deliver and sustain the Joint Force from the Point of Origin to the 
Point of Need through increasingly contested environments.
    Sufficient ready capacity is a priority requirement and a proximate 
challenge. National objectives in times of crisis or conflict create 
significant, overlapping global demands to simultaneously satisfy 
multiple Geographic Combatant Commanders' requirements. Our airlift, 
sealift, and air refueling fleets are aging, highlighting the 
importance of the ongoing modernization and recapitalization efforts I 
mentioned during testimony.
    Additionally, our adversaries continue to develop and employ 
weapons of greater range, precision, and lethality to include a 
persistent threat of cyber effects, designed to oppose our ability to 
globally project and sustain forces. Support from our partners across 
the whole of government must continue as we pursue efforts enabling 
resilient JDDE movements from Fort to Port. Acceptance of my proposal 
for a Military Strategic Transportation Program within Title 23 
(Highways), and consideration for the importance of viable Strategic 
Seaport facilities within federal discretionary grant programs, are 
examples of opportunities to guide existing resources towards 
infrastructure projects with national security benefits. Extending from 
CONUS ports to global Points of Need are multiple Strategic Lines of 
Communication (SLOCs). Protection of these SLOCs require resourcing 
identified Joint and Service requirements to ensure operational 
concepts and sufficient enabling platforms can be developed, fielded, 
and employed. Also, the length and contested nature of these SLOCs 
against both China and Russia, and the tyranny of distance in the Indo-
Pacific region, creates dilemmas requiring the integration of logistics 
planning across all warfighting functions to support the joint 
warfight. U.S./coalition forces need to effectively traverse 
disruptions as we will not be able to eliminate friction and 
opposition.
    Mr. Scott. How can the United States Coast Guard be better 
integrated with USTRANSCOM?
    General Van Ovost. USTRANSCOM shares a unique and long-standing 
relationship with the United States Coast Guard and the command's 
mission directly benefits from the force protection that the USCG 
provides world-wide. One of the command's top priorities is 
recapitalizing a primary means to project power and support the 
warfighter, the Ready Reserve Force. USCG inspectors have worked 
tirelessly with us to thoroughly review newly purchased commercial 
Roll-On/Roll-Off ships, like the CAPE ARUNDEL and CAPE CORTES. Their 
efforts laid the policy foundation to streamline the implementation of 
the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) standards for safety and sea 
worthiness, ensuring the Ready Reserve Force meets or exceeds the 
standards in the future.
    Since 1991, USCG Reserve servicemembers assigned to the Joint 
Transportation Reserve Unit, one of two of my subordinate commands, 
have regularly contributed operational and augmentation support to the 
command. We also have a Coast Guard liaison officer on site in our 
Operations Directorate.
    Additionally, USTRANSCOM and the Coast Guard regularly interact 
through the National Port Readiness Network, a cooperative of nine 
federal agencies, chaired by the Maritime Administration and designed 
to ensure readiness of commercial ports to support force deployment 
during contingencies and other national defense emergencies.
    Finally, we are working closely with the Coast Guard as they 
develop their new Merchant Marine Licensing and Documentation system. 
This system will give USTRANSCOM and the Maritime Administration 
greater assurance that sufficient merchant mariners are ready to crew 
commercial and government owned sealift ships critical to our mission.
    Mr. Scott. Does the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force recognize that air 
defense must also include the protection of merchant ships delivering 
fuel and munitions to forward-operating aircraft? Should merchant ships 
be equipped with smaller and more portable air defense systems?
    General Van Ovost. Our integration and collaboration with the 
Geographic Combatant Commands includes planning and threat assessments 
to incorporate the importance of protecting merchant ships delivering 
fuel and munitions to forward-operating aircraft in their Areas of 
Responsibility.
    During contingency operations, the Armed Forces of the United 
States has afforded increased protection of merchant ships delivering 
fuel and munitions to forward-operating aircraft and troops via 
escorted convoy operations. The overall protection for merchant ships 
is based on the force protection measures required per the Numbered 
Fleet Commanders, such as the employment of Embarked Security Teams. My 
naval component command, Military Sealift Command exercises Operational 
Control and ensures all vessels meet the required force protection 
measures. Additionally, Tactical Advisors are used on these vessels as 
warranted to train and advise crews on operations in a contested 
environment and communications necessary to closely integrate with 
supported Geographic Combatant Commands. All practicable means are used 
to protect our merchant vessels.
    Mr. Scott. You testified, ``We are training our mariners to operate 
in a contested environment.'' Why are all of our sealift and naval 
logistics ships unarmed? Does the United States Navy lack the ships to 
escort our sealift and naval logistics ships?
    General Van Ovost. During contingency operations, the Armed Forces 
of the United States have afforded increased protection of merchant 
ships delivering fuel and munitions to forward-operating aircraft and 
troops via escorted convoy operations. Given the evolving nature of 
great power competition and the diversity and complexity of threats, 
the requirement to defend merchant ships from air, surface, and 
subsurface threats requires continued detailed planning and 
coordination. All practicable means will be evaluated to protect our 
merchant vessels.
    My naval Component Command, Military Sealift Command, exercises 
Operational Control over activated organic vessels and United States 
flag commercial vessels under time charter to the Department of Defense 
and ensures all vessels meet the force protection measures required per 
Numbered Fleet commanders, such as the embarkation of expeditionary 
security teams. Additionally, Tactical Advisors are used on these 
vessels as warranted to train and advise crews on fleet integration and 
operations in a contested environment. In addition to crew training, 
tactical advisors actively coordinate with regional Area Commands for 
escort, exercises, and operations. The Tactical Advisor program 
consists of Strategic Sealift Officers (Individual Ready Reserve and 
Selected Reservists) and a limited number of Unrestricted Line Officers 
also in the Navy Reserve. Since its inception in 2018, the program has 
grown to over 300 advisors.
    Mr. Scott. Is USTRANSCOM prepared for large scale combat operations 
against an enemy peer nation?
    General Van Ovost. Yes, USTRANSCOM is ready now and is evolving to 
meet tomorrow's challenges through efforts to enhance our Warfighting 
Framework of Global Mobility Posture, Global Mobility Capacity, and 
Global Command, Control, and Integration.
    Global Mobility Posture is the foundation of power projection and 
depends on operational access, basing, and overflight (ABO). Our 
regional posture enhances the flexibility and warfighting effectiveness 
of USTRANSCOM mobility forces. Investments in partnerships that expand 
access and support adaptive basing initiatives remain critical for 
success. We continue to expand and strengthen our global transportation 
networks to facilitate our ability to support the Joint Force.
    Global Mobility Capacity includes rail, motor transport, sealift, 
air refueling, airlift, and the ability to fully mobilize the Total 
Force at the point of need. With vast over- ocean distances involved in 
projecting power globally, and a premium on swift delivery of decisive 
combat power, our core mobility assets remain critical. Our commercial 
transportation, both sealift and airlift, are integral for supporting 
daily and wartime operations. We must continue to recapitalize our 
sealift and air refueling fleet so we can maintain this competitive 
advantage.
    Global Command, Control, and Integration is the exercise of 
authority and direction to plan, coordinate, synchronize, and control 
operations at echelon. We leverage advanced technologies to help sense 
and make sense of data at scale to create decision advantage for our 
leaders.
    USTRANSCOM's strategy is oriented towards the continual pursuit of 
maintaining our competitive advantage by constantly sensing and 
adapting as necessary based on the changing environment. This strategy 
will ensure that we are prepared for large scale combat operations 
against an enemy peer nation if ever called upon to deliver.
    Mr. Scott. What is the minimum activation rate needed for a Turbo 
Activation to best prepare MARAD and MSC for large scale combat 
operations against a peer enemy nation?
    General Van Ovost. The TURBO ACTIVATION program validates the 
ability of the surge sealift fleet to rapidly transition from the day-
to-day reduced operating status, to the fully operational status 
required to transport equipment and supplies across the globe. The 
Department of Defense requires these ships be able to complete this 
transition in 120 hours, or 5 days, to ensure sealift will be available 
when it's needed. When a ship is Turbo Activated, it completes the 5-
day transition and then conducts a brief sea trial to verify systems 
are operational.
    Our goal is to Turbo Activate a minimum of 15 sealift ships 
annually, and to activate each individual ship at least once every 3 
years. This provides a 95% level of confidence the combined results 
reflect the overall readiness of the fleet to make the transition to 
operational status on any given day.
    Mr. Scott. Are U.S. Merchant Mariners prepared or trained for war?
    Admiral Phillips. In general, merchant mariners who primarily sail 
on commercial vessels have not typically been trained for war. For the 
past several decades, our commercial ships have enjoyed relatively free 
sea lanes. When they have been called upon to enter areas of danger, 
they have typically been accompanied by Naval escorts or military 
protection of some kind which could include a Navy tactical officer 
onboard to facilitate safe passage and coordination with US Navy or 
Allies.
    That being said, merchant mariners who serve on vessels that are 
part of the Ready Reserve Force (RRF) or Military Sealift Command (MSC) 
are required to complete training specific to the military-oriented 
missions of these vessels on such topics as chemical, biological, and 
radiological defense, force protection and anti-terrorism, use of small 
arms for self-defense, and other specialized courses are needed based 
on the missions of the vessels on which they serve.
    Preparation and training for a wartime environment is a topic of 
discussion within MARAD and our partner Department of Defense (DoD) 
agencies to determine effective responses to operating sealift ships in 
contested environments to include protection procedures and any 
additional training requirements. Such training may be developed and 
provided by MSC and would be in addition to all the other training 
mariners are required to complete to maintain their merchant marine 
credential.
    Mr. Scott. When do you expect MARAD will complete its next national 
shipyard survey?
    Admiral Phillips. MARAD expects to complete the national shipyard 
survey and summary report by the end of fiscal year 2023.
    Mr. Scott. What cutting-edge financial engineering techniques 
should be adopted by the United States Governement?
    Admiral Phillips. MARAD is currently implementing section 3542(a) 
of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23 
NDAA), which requires the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary 
of Homeland Security to enter into an agreement with a federally funded 
research and development center to conduct a study of key elements and 
objectives needed for a maritime strategy. This strategy is intended to 
inform MARAD's preparation of a national maritime strategy, which could 
encompass the potential need for and application of financial 
techniques to support a merchant fleet.
    Mr. Scott. Should the U.S. Maritime Service (USMS) be reactivated 
to allow mariners to enroll and help track, provide and train them for 
a future war as we did in 1938? How much would it cost to reactivate 
the USMS?
    Admiral Phillips. The USMS was disbanded in 1954 and although the 
statutory authority exists for the Maritime Administration to support 
mariner training--including at the USMMA, a Federal service academy--
MARAD is neither resourced nor authorized to reactivate the types of 
training facilities that existed during WWII, when the USMS was an 
active training entity. Today, there are many merchant marine training 
pathways available to the public, (some supported directly by MARAD) 
such that there is ample training capacity, to include the ability to 
increase credentialed mariner training opportunities. Supplementary 
mariner training for operating in a contested environment remains an 
important consideration by the DoD, and there are existing programs to 
meet the current requirements.
    Mr. Scott. Is MARAD prepared for large scale combat operations 
against an enemy peer nation?
    Admiral Phillips. MARAD does not prepare for or conduct combat 
operations. Any questions regarding the combat readiness of any U.S. 
forces should properly be directed to DoD. MARAD is resourced by the 
U.S. Navy and implements the authorities assigned to it to the extent 
that available resources maintain the RRF, which is comprised of nearly 
50 vessels. The U.S. military activates these vessels to meet their 
specific sealift needs; upon activation, operational control passes to 
the military. DoD's current requirements for sealift force protection 
training and measures are being met. Future operations in a contested 
environment may alter the necessary training and protection measures 
that DoD will require MARAD and the sealift community to implement.
    Mr. Scott. What is the minimum activation rate needed for a Turbo 
Activation to best prepare MARAD and MSC for large scale combat 
operations against a peer enemy nation?
    Admiral Phillips. Questions regarding the rate of activations 
needed to prepare for any forces for any form of combat operation 
should be directed to the U.S. military. When directed to activate, 
MARAD strives for on-time activation for ships that are not out of 
readiness.
    Mr. Scott. John Konrad wrote the following in a March 15, 2023 post 
on gCaptain, ``Furthermore, the US Navy and US Coast Guard must work 
together with MARAD to create a comprehensive national maritime 
strategy that fosters innovation and attracts investment. This strategy 
should prioritize the adoption of cutting-edge financial engineering 
techniques, which can drive growth and reduce costs in the shipbuilding 
sector.'' What progress has MARAD made to date in fostering innovation 
and attracting investment? What goals does MARAD have for fostering 
innovation and attracting investment in FY 24?
    Admiral Phillips. Section 3542(a) of the FY23 NDAA, enacted on 
December 23, 2022, requires the Secretary of Transportation and the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to enter into an agreement with a 
federally funded research and development center to conduct a study of 
key elements and objectives needed for a maritime strategy. We are 
working to implement this requirement and look forward to the results 
of the study, which is expected to be completed in early 2024.
    In the short term we are supporting the construction of vessels 
through our Federal Ship Financing Program (Title XI), which provides 
full faith and credit guarantees to promote the growth and 
modernization of the U.S. merchant marine and U.S. shipyards. The Title 
XI statute was amended in 2019 to give MARAD the authority to designate 
``Vessels of National Interest,'' which grants those vessels priority 
in program funding and in the application review process. I recently 
designated the vessels that construct, maintain and repair offshore 
wind farm facilities as Vessels of National Interest. This has spurred 
a surge of interest in the program, resulting in 6 applications to 
finance construction of 18 new vessels in U.S. shipyards.
    MARAD's Capital Construction Fund (CCF) also continues to support 
reinvestment in commercial shipbuilding. Section 3545 of the FY23 NDAA 
expanded use of the CCF program to all U.S.-built, U.S.-flag commercial 
operations, allowing many more shipowners to accumulate tax-deferred 
funds for fleet expansion, replacement and upgrades. The program 
currently has over 110 American fundholders, including seven that have 
been approved in 2023, making use of the recently expanded authority. 
Finally, MARAD's Small Shipyards Grant program continues to make a 
positive impact on small U.S. shipyards and helps to improve their 
ability to compete for domestic and international commercial ship 
construction and maintenance opportunities. The President's FY 2024 
Budget requests $20 million for this program.

                  QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. GALLAGHER
    Mr. Gallagher. Can you provide an assessment, from the perspective 
of USTRANSCOM, of the threats posed by CCP investments in commercial 
port infrastructure around the globe?
    General Van Ovost. The CCP's investment in global commercial port 
infrastructure includes the operations and management of port 
facilities, port automation and smart technologies, equipment 
proliferation, commercial shipping facilities, and vessels. These 
activities create vulnerabilities that allow for PRC influence, 
exploitation, and surveillance opportunities on DOD logistics 
operations that could be used to impede USTRANSCOM operations during 
times of crisis or at a time of their choosing. The CCP actions could 
also be used to provide leverage over host nations to reduce U.S. 
access and basing.
    Mr. Gallagher. What actions has USTRANSCOM taken to incorporate 
innovative technologies and systems to develop greater advanced 
analytics capabilities and improve cognizance across the global 
mobility enterprise?
    General Van Ovost. USTRANSCOM remains committed to the pursuit and 
exploration of advancements in data management and data science. 
Computational processing technologies like artificial intelligence, 
machine learning, and advanced analytics continue to rapidly advance 
and have enormous potential to improve USTRANSCOM mission outcomes. The 
ability to manage data as a strategic resource remains foundational to 
USTRANSCOM's transformation to a data driven command and underpins 
implementation of business reform initiatives. USTRANSCOM is leveraging 
DoD enterprise data and analytics platforms to help sense and make 
sense of data at scale and to build, train, test, and deploy advanced 
analytics capabilities to create decision advantage. In the area of 
intelligence, we are currently working with the Defense Intelligence 
Agency to develop a machine learning capability in support of port 
foundational intelligence. To improve cognizance across the global 
mobility enterprise, USTRANSCOM is working with OSD, the Joint Staff 
and the Army to define the next generation In-Transit Visibility (ITV) 
architecture. Additionally, USTRANSCOM currently operates and is 
continually improving a Common Operating Picture on both the 
unclassified and classified networks which presents visual depiction of 
our modes, nodes, routes and movements across air, land, and sea 
domains. These movements are overlaid against current weather, 
environmental or other operational conditions on the ground. USTRANSCOM 
remains engaged in research to drive data standardization, provenance, 
governance, and analytics across the JDDE. Research interests include 
but are not limited to advanced big data management; manipulation and 
integration of large data sets; data discovery, predictive and 
prescriptive analytics; and deep learning algorithms.

                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. BERGMAN
    Mr. Bergman. Admiral Phillips, I understand that unlike MARAD, 
which accepts both U.S. and Canadian companies into its ballast water 
research program, Transport Canada is only accepting Canadian entities 
into its similar research program. Would you be willing to stop 
accepting new applications from Canadian entities?
    Admiral Phillips. The ballast water research program referenced is 
an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) program, and MARAD defers to 
EPA regarding the specifics of the program. For background, MARAD is a 
partner in a collaborative ballast water management research and data 
collection effort in the Great Lakes. Funding is appropriated to the 
EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), in which MARAD has 
been a participating agency since 2010. The research is being conducted 
to support the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA) of 2018. VIDA 
established a program to support the development of and achievement of 
type approval for ballast water management systems (BWMS) on commercial 
vessels operating solely within the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain 
Systems. As part of this collaboration, funds are provided by the EPA 
to MARAD. MARAD, through a cooperative agreement, allocates the EPA 
funds to the University of Wisconsin-Superior (UWS). UWS, in turn, 
manages the ballast water treatment technology program and advertises 
competitive requests for proposals (RFPs) in support of the program. 
Through four rounds of RFPs, only two U.S.- flagged vessel owners have 
applied for funding from UWS, and both have received funding. MARAD and 
EPA have had several conversations with Transport Canada as to who may 
apply for funding under their initiative. Transport Canada has 
indicated that non-Canadian entities may apply for funding with a 
Canadian partner.
