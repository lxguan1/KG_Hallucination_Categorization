 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BRETT GUTHRIE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
           CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY

    I want to note today that today marks the official end of 
the COVID-19 public health emergency. The expiration of the 
public health emergency comes after more than a year of 
Republicans on this committee calling for the unwinding of the 
COVID-19 public health emergency and months since the People's 
House voted to end the COVID-19 public health emergency. While 
I believe this should have happened a long time ago, I am glad 
we are moving beyond this perpetual emergency declaration.
    And today marks the end of Title 42 policy. I am extremely 
concerned about the flow of illicit fentanyl and other drugs 
into our communities from our southern border, especially 
without Title 42 in place. More needs to be done to stop 
illicit fentanyl from being trafficked into our communities, 
which H.R. 2, the Secure Border Act, would help address.
    But as for today's hearing, we are continuing our 
bipartisan efforts to prepare and respond more effectively to 
future public health security threats, including chemical, 
biological, radiological, nuclear, cyber attacks, or other 
infectious disease outbreak. This is the third hearing the 
Energy and Commerce Committee has held in the 118th Congress 
related to our response framework.
    We now have a unique chance to look back and ask ourselves 
what worked, what failed, and identify bipartisan solutions on 
how we can improve. We should not use this as a chance to point 
fingers or lay blame. Instead, today's focus should be on the 
core elements of our preparedness and response strategy to 
address all types of hazards. Several key programs and 
authorities that are crucial to the U.S. preparedness and 
response will expire on September 30th. These are programs we 
are examining and considering today.
    One area that can be improved is ensuring we are better 
utilizing the expertise of our private-sector partners before a 
threat or emergency strikes to be better positioned to respond 
to future threats. For example, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention did not have contracts with testing kit 
manufacturers until after the declaration of the COVID-19 
public health emergency. This presented significant challenges 
when attempting to standing--to stand up a nationwide testing 
scheme at the beginning of the pandemic. It caused delays in 
the delivery of supplies and negatively impacted patient care 
and caused challenges in grasping the full extent of the spread 
when time was crucial.
    When it comes to utilizing private-sector partners while 
responding to a pandemic or another threat, Operation Warp 
Speed was a successful private-public partnership and should be 
viewed as a model going forward.
    Fortunately, we have already taken steps to make reforms 
and restore trust in the core public health agencies. As part 
of the end-of-year omnibus, we improved the Strategic National 
Stockpile and put measures in place to hold our public agencies 
such as the CDC and NIH more accountable. This includes 
strengthening research integrity protocols at NIH and requiring 
Senate confirmation of the CDC Director.
    We must continue to build off this work by advancing 
policies to ensure our public health agencies are focused on 
their core missions. One of these agencies is Administration 
for Strategic Preparedness Response, or ASPR. ASPR announced 
last year it is moving from a staffing division to an operating 
division. I recognize ASPR and this administration are 
requesting new authorities in response to this change. However, 
before this committee can consider expanding the scope of this 
agency, we need to look at strategically how ASPR handled this 
most recent public health emergency, the effectiveness of its 
response, and determine if its already existing current 
authorities were utilized appropriately.
    In closing, public health security is national security. 
This committee will ensure we are better prepared when the next 
public health security threat--strike threats--threats strike. 
I look forward to hearing to--I look forward to hearing the 
testimony from administration and expert witnesses today and 
working alongside my colleagues on addressing these issues in a 
bipartisan manner.

    Mr.  Guthrie. I now recognize the gentlelady from 
California, m Eshoo, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ANNA G. ESHOO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Ms.  Eshoo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning to 
you, to colleagues, and to our star witnesses here today. Thank 
you.
    This hearing is an important first step to reauthorizing 
the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act, also known as 
PAHPA. It is a priority for me that the PAHPA reauthorization 
is a product of bipartisan negotiation and compromise, and I am 
proud to work with Congressman Richard Hudson, a terrific 
partner--it is a great way to start, when you have a terrific 
partner--to pass this law before the September 30th deadline.
    Representative Hudson and I issued a bipartisan request for 
information on February 27th to seek input on PAHPA, and we 
have received over 250 responses from a full range of medical 
and public health stakeholders. So this is an important and--a 
very important first step and start on this, and we are 
grateful to all the stakeholders for responding.
    My thanks to our witnesses for the valuable perspectives 
you are going to share with us today and for your important 
work on the front lines protecting, preparing, responding to 
public health emergencies.
    In 2001 our country endured the attacks of September 11th 
and the anthrax attacks shortly thereafter. That may be deeply 
buried in the past; it is vivid to me. And at that time, 
Congress realized our country was not prepared to coordinate 
responses to mass-casualty events or chemical attacks.
    I authored legislation with then-Representative Richard 
Burr, who was a member of this committee, that established the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and 
Response, ASPR, to be responsible for coordinating Federal 
responses, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development 
Authority, BARDA, to be responsible--and Richard and I did that 
law together, that legislation--to be responsible for 
developing desperately needed medical countermeasures for 
chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.
    That important bipartisan legislation was signed into law 
in 2006 and was most recently reauthorized in 2019, an effort I 
led with really another great, great partner--I miss her to 
this day--former Congresswoman Susan Brooks. She really served 
with distinction on this committee.
    Since its creation, BARDA has been hugely successful, and I 
am enormously proud of that. Its efforts have led to 69 FDA 
licensures, approvals, and clearances of medical 
countermeasures. Without BARDA's important work, we would not 
have been blessed with a safe and effective COVID vaccine as 
quickly as we were. BARDA now needs additional investments and 
authorities so that it can continue to develop technologies and 
platforms that can rapidly produce vaccines, therapeutics, 
diagnostics, and other tools to protect our Nation from 
potential threats.
    This PAHPA reauthorization has to meet the challenges we 
witnessed during the COVID pandemic and anticipate the 
challenges of the future. I will never, ever, ever forget the 
following: turning on my TV set, and seeing our Nation's 
healthcare workers wrapping themselves in black garbage bags, 
plastic garbage bags. And it was because they lacked proper 
personal protective equipment.
    Like many Members of Congress, I spent 2020 trying to 
secure ventilators, other essential supplies for the hospitals 
in my district. I know that you did it in yours. We have to 
make sure that our stockpiles are real and that they are 
adequate to prevent the chaos that we experienced.
    COVID also exposed the fragility of our supply chains, 
especially for pharmaceutical and medical products. These are 
critical goods that we can't live without. And our medical 
supply chain is broken in three devastating ways: shortages, 
especially during high demand in an emergency; subpar 
manufacturing; and an overreliance on foreign production.
    So today's hearing is especially meaningful. I will draw my 
comments to a close because my time is up. I look forward to 
everything that takes place in this all-important hearing.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Eshoo follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Ms.  Eshoo. And I yield back, Mr. Chairman, and thank you 
for holding this hearing.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. The 
Chair now recognizes the Chair of the full committee, Chair 
Rodgers, for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS, A 
    REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON

    Mrs.  Rodgers. Today's hearing is the beginning of our 
legislative process to make sure the Federal Government is 
prepared to handle any public health hazard threatening 
Americans' safety and well-being, whether it is chemical, 
biological, radiological, nuclear, a cyber attack, or another 
emerging infectious disease like influenza or COVID-19.
    We need to be prepared for all types of hazards, whether 
the cause is deliberate, accidental, or natural. We are 
evaluating existing programs and authorities originally created 
under the Pandemic and All-Hazard Preparedness Act, which will 
expire on September 30th, 2023. Our goal is to ensure America 
is prepared for and ready to respond to any public health 
security threat.
    I want to join in thanking Representative Hudson and 
Representative Eshoo for leading the request for information 
process and the eventual legislation related to this topic 
today.
    Today's hearing is an opportunity to review the 
Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, or 
ASPR. ASPR was established in 2006 to serve as the lead agency 
for our Nation's preparedness and response. While the agency 
and its leadership have been tested over the past two decades, 
no prior threat amounted to the scope or magnitude of COVID-19. 
In some ways ASPR stepped up, and in other ways the response 
could be improved.
    ASPR's authorities expire this year, and that requires us 
to review and examine ASPR's role in the preparedness and the 
response framework, as well as how ASPR should be viewed and 
operationalized moving forward.
    During COVID-19, especially in the early days, we witnessed 
Herculean efforts in so many of our communities, remarkable 
stories of Americans' goodwill, resilience, and people coming 
together during times of incredible stress and fear of the 
unknown. And these efforts inform what ASPR should be focused 
on in an emergency: facilitating, coordinating, and supporting 
innovation and initiative by private-sector, local, and State 
actors.
    But we have heard a number of concerns about how ASPR is 
going about this mission: questions around leadership and 
communication; questions about use of funding and transparency; 
questions about management of the Strategic National Stockpile; 
and generally, questions about whether the agency created to be 
our Nation's lead on preparedness and response was actually 
able to lead effectively.
    We all heard from hospitals and healthcare providers across 
the country who struggled to find masks, test kits, and other 
supplies. I heard from Americans who offered their ideas and 
services to BARDA to no avail. There is a lack of transparency 
and communication to medical stakeholders from this agency that 
has been tasked with developing and maintaining public-private 
partnerships.
    Questions continue to arise around ASPR's next steps. What 
is ASPR's role, moving forward? How should this agency be 
defined? How will it operate, both during and outside of public 
health emergencies? And that is what we are here to discuss 
today.
    I look forward to hearing from Ms. O'Connell on specific 
gaps exposed by the response to COVID-19 and how to address 
them for any type of future public health hazard. I hope better 
interaction and coordination with the private sector is at the 
top of the list, as ASPR's early COVID response was one crisis 
after another.
    In addition to the critical role of ASPR, CDC also plays a 
role in our preparedness and response framework. I recognize 
the administration has several requests for new authorities and 
programs before us today. Before considering any of these 
requests, this committee has several requests and questions of 
our own regarding decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Much more has to be done to build back public trust.
    Finally, as we saw demonstrated through Operation Warp 
Speed, FDA plays a role of granting emergency use 
authorizations to respond to emerging infectious diseases or 
other threats like smallpox or anthrax. This committee has 
broad jurisdiction over public health, and we are working on 
multiple fronts to rebuild trust in public health, in addition 
to today's work on preparedness.
    For example, our Oversight Subcommittee is looking at NIH's 
continued funding of risky research grant programs; Dr. Miller-
Meeks is leading an effort to look at CDC reform; there is 
plenty of concern with FDA regarding baby formula shortages, 
drug shortages, and the lack of therapeutics approved to treat 
severe cases of COVID-19, just to name a few.
    And with the Biden administration finally ending the COVID-
19 public health emergency, and with President Biden ending 
critical Title 42 border protections, there remain questions 
about transitioning out of the pandemic and managing the surge 
of migrants coming to our country.
    To start, the House should pass Rep. Lesko's bill that 
would help address the illicit fentanyl crisis at our border. 
All our work on these fronts is important for the health and 
the American people and to hold government accountable. That 
work will continue. But the focus today, in particular, is on 
preparedness and response authority so that we can be better 
equipped for the immediate response.
    It is critical that we work together so that the American 
people are prepared for the next threat that may come, and I 
look forward to a productive hearing.
    [The prepared statement of Mrs. Rodgers follows:]

    Mrs.  Rodgers. I yield back.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The Chair yields back, and the

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., A REPRESENTATIVE 
            IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY

    Mr.  Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased we are 
holding this important hearing today to consider the 
reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness 
Act.
    Reauthorizing PAHPA is of utmost importance for this 
committee and this Congress before it expires at the end of 
September, and I am glad we are beginning bipartisan 
conversations to ensure the programs within this legislation 
are reauthorized on time.
    Now, PAHPA was first enacted in 2006 to improve our 
Nation's public health and medical preparedness and response 
capabilities in the event of a public health emergency. And 
since then, the reauthorization of this law has become a 
critical legislative opportunity to review and consider the 
Federal Government's health, security, and response 
capabilities. It gives us the chance to review the current 
policy so that we can ensure we are doing everything possible 
to prepare for future pandemics and public health emergencies, 
and this includes considering how we can strengthen our public 
health workforce, enhance our healthcare supply chains, protect 
against new and emerging biosecurity threats, including cyber 
threats, and build a more nimble public health infrastructure 
that is able to effectively respond in real time.
    So today we will be hearing from the leaders of the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, the Administration for 
Strategic Preparedness and Response, and the Food and Drug 
Administration. And these agencies are central to the Federal 
Government's public health response capabilities. Each serves a 
unique and critical role in the event of a public health 
emergency, and I look forward to hearing about each of your 
agency's priorities as we prepare to reauthorize PAHPA.
    This reauthorization is extremely timely. It is the first 
time we are considering the reauthorization of PAHPA since the 
COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 brought unprecedented challenges to 
the Federal Government and our public health agencies. Over the 
last three years we have seen our public health infrastructure 
pushed to the limit from medical supply shortages, diagnostic 
test limitations, communication difficulties, and workforce 
constraints. We have learned a lot from these challenges during 
the pandemic, and it is essential that we take this opportunity 
to ensure we are improving our public health infrastructure. We 
must do everything we can through this reauthorization to 
protect our public health institutions and not tear them down.
    And this is an important opportunity to strengthen the 
authorities of our public health agencies where they are 
needed. I believe one area that needs to be strengthened is the 
authority to collect public health data in order to respond in 
real time and provide the most up-to-date guidance to the 
American people.
    It is also important that we explore policies that can 
better prepare our supply chains for the next public health 
emergency. This morning our Oversight and Investigations 
Subcommittee is holding a hearing to look into the critical 
issue of drug shortages. Shortages of drugs, medical devices, 
and other supplies repeatedly hampered health professionals' 
ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am hopeful 
that through these two hearings we will explore policies to 
prevent these shortages in the future.
    We also need to examine the implementation of the 
bipartisan Prevent Pandemics Act, which we passed into law in 
last year's Consolidated Appropriations Bill. It included 
important policies to improve our biosecurity, enhance the 
Strategic National Stockpile, and strengthen our medical 
response readiness. However, it is clear that we need to do 
more, and I look forward to working together with my Republican 
colleagues to ensure a timely reauthorization of PAHPA.
    Our Nation's public health preparedness and biosecurity 
cannot and should not be a partisan issue. Effectively 
protecting our country from the risk of future pandemics and 
biothreats requires a comprehensive and bipartisan response 
without ideological brinkmanship. And I hope we can continue to 
make important progress in good faith on this goal.
    So I want to thank Ranking Member Eshoo, Representative 
Hudson for their leadership on PAHPA reauthorization and their 
hard work on the bipartisan request for information that has 
allowed interested parties and subject matter experts to weigh 
in. This is an important part of the process as we work to find 
common ground on proposed legislative language in the weeks to 
come. We have to work together to find bipartisan solutions 
that enable our public health agencies to be prepared to 
respond to existing health threats as well as new risks.
    So thanks again to the witnesses for being here today. We 
welcome your statements and questions.

                  STATEMENT OF DAWN O'CONNELL

    Ms.  O'Connell. Chair Guthrie, Chair Rodgers, Ranking 
Member Eshoo, Ranking Member Pallone, and distinguished members 
of the committee, it is an honor to testify before you today 
about ASPR's ongoing work and the additional authorities we are 
seeking in the upcoming PAHPA bill.
    We are living in an increasingly interconnected world, 
where diseases and other threats can travel quickly unnoticed 
for days. We are also experiencing an increase in the frequency 
and intensity of natural disasters. As a result, ASPR is 
working on more high-consequence, no-fail missions than ever 
before. We are proud to lead so much important work on behalf 
of the country and want to be sure that we have the authorities 
we need to continue to execute that work with the excellence, 
efficiency, and expertise the American people deserve.
    As we move out of the acute phase of the COVID-19 response, 
it would be management malpractice for us to look the same and 
act the same as we did at the start of the pandemic. I have 
taken several important steps in the last few months to 
transform our organization and to incorporate lessons learned 
from the COVID-19 pandemic.
    For example, ASPR is now a stand-alone agency within HHS. 
This important change in our departmental status gives me the 
independence to build out ASPR's human resources, acquisitions, 
and finance infrastructure so it better supports our unique 
mission needs.
    I also just completed a structural reorganization that 
institutionalized important new capabilities that we built 
during COVID and need to keep using to be more prepared moving 
forward, like our domestic manufacturing work.
    I also made the Strategic National Stockpile an office that 
reports directly to me to increase visibility into and 
accountability of this critically important part of the 
Nation's preparedness and response infrastructure.
    With these changes, I have taken the two most 
transformational steps available to me to build a better 
preparedness and response organization. And now I need your 
help to ensure that I have the appropriate authorities to 
execute our mission faster and stronger. With the authorities I 
am requesting in PAHPA, I am trying to solve three key 
problems.
    The first problem I am trying to solve is how ASPR can 
procure more quickly the tools and supplies the country needs 
when responding to a biothreat or disaster. Early in the COVID-
19 response, it became clear that HHS could not procure the 
products our country needed at the speed in which our country 
needed them. As a result, ASPR entered into a memorandum of 
understanding with the Department of Defense in which they 
agreed to provide acquisition support on our behalf. Using 
their unique authorities, DoD executed more than $90 billion in 
contracts for us over the 3 years of the acute response.
    Our agreement with DoD comes to an end at the end of this 
fiscal year, which is why I am requesting similar authorities 
for ASPR. These include the ability to fund promising 
prototypes and then move the successful ones through the 
advanced research pipeline without having to recompete the 
contracts like we do now. We are also seeking the ability to 
quickly procure experimental supplies and important finished 
products. Each of these new authorities would allow us to do 
for ourselves moving forward what we had to rely on DoD to do 
for us during COVID.
    The second problem I am trying to solve is how ASPR can 
continue to invest in the expansion of the domestic industrial 
base for key PPE and medical supplies. To ensure we are never 
again in the position we found ourselves in in March 2020, when 
our doctors and nurses did not have access to the masks, gowns, 
and gloves they needed, ASPR has used the funds and 
construction authority given to us in the COVID supplementals 
to build new factories nationwide to produce the PPE and 
supplies we need in times of emergency.
    These investments also provide good-paying jobs to many 
hard-working Americans. But once the COVID-19 funds run out, we 
lose our construction authority and our ability to continue 
investing in similar projects. That is why I am requesting 
permanent construction authority for ASPR. It is important that 
we have funds and construction authority to sustain the work we 
have started and to expand this work to other parts of the 
public health supply chain.
    The third problem I am trying to solve is how ASPR can hire 
staff more quickly to surge critical teams during large 
response efforts. In the early days of the COVID-19 response, 
just as we relied on DoD for acquisition support, we also 
relied on FEMA and the Coast Guard to bolster our response 
staff. The ability to hire people quickly and compensate them 
appropriately for their long hours and sometimes hazardous work 
are important tools missing from ASPR's response toolbox, which 
is why I am requesting direct hiring and flexible pay 
authorities for ASPR.
    Direct hiring authority will allow me to quickly scale up 
our response efforts so we have enough people when we need 
them, and pay flexibilities will go a long way towards 
sustaining our staff through these dangerous missions and 
ensuring we do not lose these seasoned first responders and 
subject matter experts to the private sector, who pay much more 
and often require much less of them.
    To solve each of the problems I have just laid out, I have 
requested important new authorities for ASPR. I look forward to 
working with you to solve these important problems and many 
others as you draft the new PAHPA bill.
    Thank you again for inviting me to testify today. I look 
forward to answering your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. O'Connell follows:]

    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. I appreciate your opening 
statement.
    The Chair now recognizes Dr. Walensky for 5 minutes for 
your opening statement.

            STATEMENT OF ROCHELLE P. WALENSKY, M.D.

    Dr.  Walensky. Chair McMorris Rodgers, Chairman Guthrie, 
Ranking Member Pallone, Ranking Member Eshoo, and distinguished 
members of the subcommittee, it is an honor to be here today.
    I want to take a moment to acknowledge that today marks the 
expiration of the Federal COVID-19 public health emergency. The 
COVID-19 pandemic, the deadliest in over a century, has been 
marked by an unprecedented whole-of-government response. COVID 
remains a leading cause of death in the United States, and CDC 
will continue our commitment to reducing COVID's impact and 
leveraging lessons learned to be better prepared for future 
public health challenges.
    No matter the outbreak--H1N1, Ebola, Zika, COVID-19, Mpox, 
polio, or Marburg--since our founding in 1946, CDC has been 
offering world-class assistance to our partners in States, 
Tribes, territories, your local communities, and around the 
globe. These diseases don't respect national or State borders, 
and the increased frequency of outbreaks means we should not be 
asking if we will face another serious public health threat, 
but when and how many.
    For many, life has returned to normal after 3 years of 
COVID-19. Public health agencies like CDC and your State and 
local health departments' mission is to continue to remain 
vigilant and response-ready to protect Americans from any 
resolving or emerging public threat. We do this by actively 
supporting the core capabilities of public health, including 
state-of-the-art laboratories, a diverse public health 
workforce culturally competent to reflect the communities it 
serves, world-class data and analytics, rapid response to 
outbreaks at their source, and strong domestic and global 
preparedness.
    We are enhancing these capabilities through an all-agency 
review, ``CDC Moving Forward.'' We are committed to addressing 
the lessons learned from COVID-19, increasing accountability, 
and continuously improving how we deliver information to 
Americans.
    The end of the public health emergency once again reminds 
us that sustainable policy changes and funding are essential to 
readiness for future biothreats. CDC will continue to monitor 
COVID-19 and provide the information to which we have access. 
But the end of the PHE will mean that CDC will no longer 
receive certain data to share information many Americans have 
actually come to expect.
    For example, we announced last week that our COVID-19 
community levels will cease because some of the data informing 
those levels will no longer be submitted to CDC. The COVID-19 
community levels are being replaced by hospital admission data 
uploaded on a weekly basis, which we have been fortunate to 
demonstrate serve as a reasonable surrogate in this case. At 
the same time, other data used to make decisions about 
targeting resources will no longer be available because it is 
no longer submitted to us.
    For example, we will no longer have certain data on race 
and ethnicity vaccine administration, leaving policymakers with 
an incomplete national picture of health disparities. We will 
no longer have data on national test positivity, which is one 
of the most effective early indicators of disease spread. We 
will have inconsistent data on vaccine uptake, hindering our 
ability to measure vaccine impact, particularly urban and rural 
disparities.
    We will make do. However, this should worry us all, 
primarily because of what it says about the visibility we will 
have into the next outbreak. We will be back to square one, 
having to build and negotiate surveillance while we fight a 
pathogen.
    I know members of this committee are interested in 
advancing policy to better prepare for what comes next. For 
CDC, this means supporting the public health workforce to 
recruit the best of the best through improvements to student 
loan reimbursement authority. We must also be able to surge 
staff when needed, with simple changes to direct hire 
legislation and sufficient budget flexibility so bureaucracy 
doesn't stand in the way when an emerging threat arises.
    This also means maintaining the infrastructure our Nation 
stood up during COVID-19 to administer vaccines quickly and 
effectively. The Vaccines for Adults program not only provides 
America--Americans access to 14 lifesaving vaccines but also 
supports a response-ready capability that we will lose without 
continued investment.
    Finally, this means modernizing data policy to support 
access to better quality, standardized, and timely data so 
individuals and families can make informed decisions about 
their health, and policymakers can target interventions and 
resources to better prevent public health emergencies.
    The United States should have the most advanced and capable 
agency in the world when it comes to disease detection, 
tracking, and forecasting. It will take a more modernized, 
nimble, and collaborative CDC, and it will also take 
partnership with Congress to fully turn CDC into a response-
ready agency. I am committed to working with you to better 
protect Americans and our national security.
    Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.

    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you for your opening statement.
    The Chair now recognizes Commissioner Califf for 5 minutes 
for your opening statement.

              STATEMENT OF ROBERT M. CALIFF, M.D.

    Dr.  Califf. Good morning. Chairs McMorris Rodgers and 
Guthrie and ranking members Pallone and Eshoo and members of 
the committee, thanks for the opportunity to be here today to 
discuss the importance of preparedness and how FDA can work 
with Congress to ensure the country is ready for the next 
public health threat.
    PAHPA recognizes the key role FDA plays in public health, 
emergency preparedness, and response. The FDA has effectively 
used the authority provided under PAHPA to support our Nation's 
preparedness and response capabilities. However, there have 
been lessons learned about how these authorities could be 
modernized to ensure our actions can be even more effective.
    Providing greater transparency into supply chains, ensuring 
operational readiness and surge capacity within the FDA 
Inspectorate and its review staff, and improving laboratory 
testing regulation are priorities that will enhance national 
security and improve public health preparedness.
    For supply chains, there is a need for greater transparency 
into the supply chains of our medical products to both improve 
resiliency and ensure continued access for critical medical 
products. For example, under the CARES Act, FDA received new 
authority to require medical device manufacturers to submit 
shortage notifications during a public health emergency. FDA 
used this information to help mitigate approximately 350 
shortages. Unfortunately, these notifications will no longer be 
required following the end of the current COVID-19 PHE.
    However, we know medical device shortages occur in many 
situations that are unrelated to PHEs, including natural or 
human-made disasters, recalls, geopolitical conflicts, 
production shutdowns, and cybersecurity incidents. We also know 
that these shortages most often impact our most vulnerable and 
underserved populations, like children, rural populations, and 
our veterans in VA hospitals.
    Additionally, most drug shortages were historically due to 
manufacturing issues that disrupted supply for which 
manufacturers of drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients 
are required to notify the FDA. The agency has relied on these 
notifications to help prevent supply disruptions--approximately 
220 over the last year--by working closely with manufacturers, 
expediting review, and exercising temporary regulatory 
flexibility.
    However, we have recently seen an unprecedented demand for 
drugs that would benefit from similar notifications. The 
ability to require drug manufacturers and distributors to 
report surges in demand to FDA could help the agency prevent or 
mitigate shortages, including for some critical over-the-
counter drugs like we saw this fall.
    Additional improvements should include reporting API 
sources and the extent of manufacturer reliance on certain 
suppliers in the drug supply chain, and ensuring FDA has an 
opportunity to inspect certain over-the-counter drug facilities 
before such products are distributed.
    Preventing food shortages is also critical to public 
health, and we are grateful that Congress included a provision 
in the fiscal year 2023 omnibus to require manufacturers of 
infant formulas and medical foods to notify FDA of potential 
shortages. Looking forward, extending this authority to 
additional categories of foods during a declared PHE could help 
prevent future shortages in the food supply.
    Second, ensuring operational readiness and surge capacity 
is critical in emergencies. For example, FDA could achieve more 
effective and efficient oversight if it had the authority to 
require internationally harmonized master files for drug 
manufacturing sites and improved authorities for conducting 
remote regulatory assessments. Congress expanded FDA's 
authority to request records in advance of or in lieu of an 
inspection to devices and bioresearch monitoring sites in the 
fiscal year 2023 omnibus. However, the agency could better 
assure the safety of products, even in times of crisis, if this 
records request authority were expressly extended to all FDA 
regulated products.
    Additionally, during COVID-19 we saw that FDA staff had to 
be pulled off other work, and I have been working relentlessly 
on pandemic issues for the past 3 years, leading to a 
significant backlog in certain areas and quite a bit of 
fatigue. Through the creation of the specialized program to 
defend against emerging pathogens and other threats, the agency 
would be well positioned to respond in emerging and identified 
threats of concern.
    Third, and finally, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the 
importance of both diagnostic test access and test accuracy and 
the critical need for modernized regulatory framework that 
applies to all in vitro diagnostics. This will be integral to 
ensuring the U.S. is better prepared for the next threat and to 
realizing the full potential of diagnostic innovation.
    When I look at the list of requirements, a striking 
observation is that these measures would not only help the FDA 
serve the public well in times of crisis, but they would also 
enable us to help prevent catastrophic outcomes and conduct our 
everyday work more effectively and efficiently.
    Thanks, and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Califf follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. Thank you for your opening 
statement.
    We will now move in--the period of the subcommittee on--for 
Member questions. Each Member will be recognized for 5 minutes, 
and I will begin by recognizing myself for 5 minutes for the 
purpose of questions.
    Secretary O'Connell, the GAO placed HHS's leadership in 
coordination of public health emergencies at its high-risk 
list--on its high-risk list in January of 2022, in part due to 
the deficiencies in HHS's management of countermeasures. GAO's 
analysis of the Strategic National Stockpile Reviews shows the 
Strategic National Stockpile contained most medical 
countermeasure types recommended, but often not in the 
recommended quantities. I know you are familiar with that.
    So my questions are, how does ASPR make decisions on which 
countermeasures are procured and deployed in the stockpile, 
including how State and local officials engage in the process?
    And how does ASPR and the public health emergency 
countermeasure enterprise ensure products that are not 
commercially available are involved in stockpiling 
determinations?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Chair Guthrie, thank you so much for this 
question.
    So focusing on the Strategic National Stockpile has been 
one of my chief priorities during my tenure at ASPR. It was 
really, you know, instructive to see what happened in March 
2020, when it didn't have those things that we thought it 
should need. So I have placed an important emphasis on making 
sure that it is restocked and ready to go against whatever 
comes next.
    And I have been grateful for the funding Congress has given 
us in order to do that for PPE. That was one of the 
capabilities that was missing in the Strategic National 
Stockpile. They had not purchased PPE since the H1N1 outbreak 
in the--you know, 2009. So it had been years, and much of that 
has expired. So we focused on building that capability and 
spending the money well that Congress has appropriated for us 
to be able to do that in the supplementals.
    But in the regular order, in the regular annual budget for 
the Strategic National Stockpile, we are well underfunded, and 
it is a worry of mine. We just released the multiyear budget, 
which is a 5-year budget looking at the entire countermeasure 
enterprise, and in that the Strategic National Stockpile should 
receive $2 billion a year in order to keep up with 
countermeasures against the threats that have been identified 
by the Department of Homeland Security. We currently receive 
$934 million a year, so we have less than half of what the 
experts have identified we need in order for us to be prepared.
    So my job in this role is to make sure that we all 
understand that, that given the funding we have, we are doing 
what we can against the threats that we see. But we need 
additional funding in order to be fully prepared in the way 
that you expect us to be and I expect us to be. So I have been 
carrying that message forward. I think it is really important.
    Mr.  Guthrie. OK, thank you.
    Dr. Walensky, the CDC's data modernization initiative was 
launched in 2020. And over the course of the pandemic Congress 
has appropriated at least a billion for this program. Yet State 
and local governments have received very little financial or 
technical support from CDC as part of this data modernization 
initiative.
    In addition to this, Congress--this spending, Congress more 
recently appropriated more money in the CDC consolidated 
appropriation--to you in the Consolidated Appropriations Act. 
Can you detail how the money has been spent by CDC, including 
how much has been allocated, and what remains unallocated and 
unobligated?
    Dr.  Walensky. Sure, I would be happy to. And we can 
provide you State information on the moneys that have been put 
forward.
    As you note, it has been about $1 billion. But I will also 
note that major health systems, including the one that I came 
from, cost over $1 billion themselves individually in order to 
upgrade to Epic. So we are talking about $1 billion for the 
whole country, when a single health system would need that much 
money in and of itself in order to upgrade their entire system.
    What we have been working with--and in fact, I spoke to our 
State and local health departments just on Tuesday--is a North 
Star architecture, a common architecture where all of our State 
and local health departments are using similar data highways 
such that all of the data can be easily transferred, even if 
they are not exactly the same, that the highways meet and match 
so that they are all similarly transferred. The data come in 
and can be brought out such that when data come in to CDC, we 
can bring it back and send it back to the local health 
departments to not only tell them what is happening in their 
health department but in all of the areas and regions around 
them.
    And so that is the work of our data modernization 
initiative. Again, there is not enough money, and I have single 
health departments that have told me they could use the entire 
CDC budget.
    Mr.  Guthrie. OK, thank you. In addition, Congress gave you 
more data authorities--or the CDC more data authorities in the 
December Consolidated Appropriations Act. Can you provide us an 
update, a status update on the implementation of the newly 
granted authorities that was established just recently?
    Dr.  Walensky. I would be happy to chat with you about 
that. What I will say is we had more responsibility but not a 
lot of more authority. So there was an expectation in that 
appropriations that we would be able to receive all of those 
data. But in fact we didn't receive the authorities in order to 
be able to do so.
    So--and in fact, with the end of the public health 
emergency, as I know it, we will lose some of those 
authorities.
    We did, in the--it took 6 months during the COVID-19 
pandemic in order to receive hospitalization data, for example. 
And it took us about 3 months in monkeypox in order to receive 
vaccination data, for example.
    For us to be ahead of a pathogen, for us to be ahead of an 
outbreak, it can't take months for those data to come in. What 
we would like to see is--there is a rare thing that is 
happening in California, and a rare thing is happening in 
Maryland--when those both come in to us, we say trigger. That 
is a--that is something that we have to act on, these things 
are happening at the same time. They would otherwise not know. 
If we don't have those data authorities to see what is 
happening, we will be behind before we ever get started.
    Mr.  Guthrie. OK. Thank you. Thank you for your comments.
    The clock didn't start exactly when I started, so I used my 
full 5 minutes. So I will yield back, and I will recognize 
Ranking Member Eshoo for 5 minutes for questions.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to each 
one of you, the witnesses. Excellent testimony.
    Secretary O'Connell, you are in charge of the National 
Stockpile, BARDA. You are the lead agency for preparedness. So 
I want to start with you.
    The United States and--has and remains dangerously 
dependent on foreign countries for our supply of critical, 
lifesaving drugs, lifesaving equipment. So as a result, during 
the pandemic we couldn't outfit our first responders --I raised 
that in my opening comments--without relying on China and 
others to supply us. You have said that ASPR has invested 16 
billion in 87 different contracts for the domestic 
manufacturing of PPE. What have those contracts bought you?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Ranking Member, thank you so much for that 
question----
    Ms.  Eshoo. Because if another health threat happened where 
there is a high demand for PPE and other essential supplies, do 
you have the authority to ramp up production of U.S. masks, 
respirators, syringes, diagnostics?
    I mean, I practically became an overnight so-called expert 
in this, trying to find it and what time--what some ship was 
coming in to get something to a major--you know, major 
institutions.
    Ms.  O'Connell. Ranking Member, thank you so much for that 
question. This has been an important focus of ours, as you have 
mentioned, and we are grateful for the support from Congress 
for the funding and the construction authority we received in 
order to be able to invest in domestic manufacturing of some of 
these critical PPE and medical supplies.
    Ms.  Eshoo. So where do we stand now, though? What capacity 
do we have? I mean, do--would our country have the capacity now 
to meet that demand for production?
    Ms.  O'Connell. So we are continuing to build that 
capacity, and we are doing it in two ways. We have the 
investments in the construction and the manufacturing supply 
lines, bringing those foreign--you know, the things that were 
manufactured in other countries, bringing them here, 
manufacturing them here, we are doing that with raw----
    Ms.  Eshoo. But, I mean, how would you grade the system 
now? Where are we? Are we in the middle of building this 
capacity? Are we 10 percent there? Are we 72 percent there?
    You know, one of my biggest regrets--not in working with 
Congresswoman Brooks, but--we worked so hard on the stockpile, 
but I am kicking myself that I didn't ask witnesses, ``What is 
in the cupboard? What is in the cupboard?'' Jesus, we got this 
thing hit, and all hell broke loose. And that is why I am 
asking this. You know, we need the answer to that to chart 
what--where we need to go in the future, so that we do not 
experience this again.
    This is a great nation, and we were on our knees. So tell 
me where you think we are now.
    Ms.  O'Connell. So we have 87 contracts invested in things 
from raw materials to the consumables to the finished product. 
But I would agree with you, we are not far enough, and that is 
the reason why I am requesting construction authority in the 
new PAHPA bill. We have gotten a head start, and we are farther 
than we were.
    And we are doing something else too. The Strategic National 
Stockpile, as we are restocking it, we are restocking it with 
the domestically manufactured goods. So we actually have a 
market, and we are, you know, buying those things. That is 
where we are going to be able to incentivize----
    Ms.  Eshoo. OK.
    Ms.  O'Connell [continuing]. These private companies to 
ramp up manufacturing.
    Ms.  Eshoo. I have 1 minute and 20 seconds left.
    Have you submitted to Congress the required report on the 
contents of the Stockpile for 2022?
    Ms.  O'Connell. I just reviewed it, and it is on your way--
on the way to you all.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Yes, yes.
    Ms.  O'Connell. Thank you.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Yes, because it is past due.
    Ms.  O'Connell. Yes, thank you.
    Ms.  Eshoo. It is past due. OK.
    Dr. Califf, it is great to see you. Can the FDA get the 
information it needs from manufacturers to identify sources and 
suppliers of API?
    I have been on this API for a long time, and I don't think 
that the needle has moved. That is my overall take on this.
    Dr.  Califf. I know you have limited time, so I will be 
brief. We can talk at long length.
    I have personally worked in the private and university 
sector in both India and China. The problem we have right now 
with regard to what you spoke about is we don't have the 
designation of the source of the API when it gets moved and put 
into a pill. And we are asking for the authority to require 
that of the industry, that essentially the chain of custody of 
the supply chain from the API to the finished pill to the 
retail store, or however it is distributed----
    Ms.  Eshoo. So that is the only way for you to actually 
know----
    Dr.  Califf. Otherwise, we have no way of----
    Ms.  Eshoo. You have no way of knowing.
    Dr.  Califf. Other than phone calls, which is not a very 
efficient way in a crisis.
    Ms.  Eshoo. No, or maybe one day API in the United States 
of America. Do you see that in our future?
    Dr.  Califf. It has to be in our future.
    Ms.  Eshoo. I mean, we are dependent----
    Dr.  Califf. There is a hearing going on about drug 
shortages----
    Ms.  Eshoo [continuing]. Totally dependent on China, China 
and India, and India is dependent on China. I mean, what a----
    Dr.  Califf. Well----
    Ms.  Eshoo. What a Rube Goldberg plan that is.
    Dr.  Califf. We need to work on it. But the hearing also 
occurring at the same time is going to go through some of the 
issues.
    The economics of this are not favorable for fixing the 
problem the way it is currently working. So we have some real 
work to do there.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Well, I have been working on it.
    Dr.  Califf. Not just tracking things, but the basic 
fundamentals of the economics.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Thank you.
    Dr.  Califf. Thanks.
    Ms.  Eshoo. I am going to submit, obviously, Dr. Walensky 
and to each one of you, written questions for the record. Thank 
you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. The 
Chair now recognizes Chair Rodgers for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mrs.  Rodgers. Director O'Connell, I want to start with 
you.
    Like every State, Washington State currently has a set of 
crisis standards of care that they can rely on, given serious 
surges and demands for care. And the COVID-19 pandemic brought 
to light that many States like Washington State have incredibly 
discriminatory crisis-of-care standards that discount the lives 
of people with disabilities and other marginalized populations. 
These concerns have been repeatedly reiterated by the Office of 
Civil Rights and advocates in the disability community who have 
helped push States to consider alternative measures for their 
crisis standards.
    To this point, I would like to discuss ASPR's request to 
Congress to extend the National Advisory Committee on 
Individuals with Disabilities and Disasters until at least 
September 30th, 2025. Is NAC involved in or working with other 
partners, including State and local governments, to ensure that 
we don't have something like this happen again?
    Ms.  O'Connell. We have really benefited from the view of 
our outside experts that have served on this committee. And it 
is very important to me, and I have made that clear in my 5-
year strategic plan that we are not prepared if everybody is 
not prepared, if we aren't thinking about those communities and 
special populations that you mentioned.
    So we are continuing to work with--and are leading experts 
in this space to make sure that we are accounting for all of 
their views and incorporating those in the work that we do 
ahead.
    Mrs.  Rodgers. OK. Do you support furthering Federal 
standards that would ensure that these crisis standards of care 
do not discriminate against people with disabilities?
    Ms.  O'Connell. It is really important that we incorporate 
all of the needs of these special populations as we move 
forward in preparing for and responding to disasters and 
emergencies.
    Mrs.  Rodgers. OK, thank you.
    On cybersecurity, when this committee last considered 
ASPR's authorities in 2018, cyber was a known threat but not 
really top of mind when it came to preparedness. In the last 
couple of years, we have seen an increasing number of cyber 
attacks on the healthcare sector corresponding to an increase 
in response efforts.
    Just earlier this year, ASPR, working in coordination with 
the Health Sector Coordinating Council Cybersecurity Working 
Group, released their Cybersecurity Framework Implementation 
Guide to help public and private sector prevent cybersecurity 
incidences. Do you view cybersecurity preparedness and response 
as a primary function and responsibility of ASPR?
    And if not ASPR, who at HHS is responsible for cyber 
threats?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Thank you, Chair. So there are other 
players within our department that have various 
responsibilities in the cybersecurity space, but we are the 
sector risk management agency for the healthcare sector when it 
comes to cybersecurity. So we do have an important function in 
coordinating with the health systems and hospitals to make sure 
that they know best practices and that we work them through if 
they have had vulnerabilities, how we identify those gaps and 
moving forward.
    I don't know that we are doing enough, and I have requested 
a doubling of my budget in fiscal year 2024 so I can add 
additional staff to work against this highly complex and 
evolving problem. So I would welcome the support of this 
committee in moving that forward.
    Mrs.  Rodgers. Well, I would like to work with you on how 
we make sure that we are addressing this growing and evolving 
threat.
    Dr. Walensky, in 1997 Congress directed the FDA to develop 
and adopt good guidance practices to provide more transparency 
and public input. And since the early 2000s FDA has abided by 
such good guidance practices, and it requires FDA to solicit 
public comments and responses, including standardized 
statements regarding the nonbinding nature of the guidance, and 
be publicly posted in a standardized, searchable, and 
comprehensive database.
    In addition, FDA's practices provide exceptions for 
emergency situations where interim guidance may be appropriate 
and a process for revisions in situations where the guidance 
may need to be changed.
    Throughout COVID-19 and even now, I continue to hear 
concerns and questions on CDC recommendations and the guidance, 
whether it is parents, scientists, doctors, others in the 
community. Does CDC have or has CDC considered adopting 
something similar to good guidance practices that would dictate 
how recommendations across CDC are made available, allow for 
comment, and allow for responses to comments?
    Dr.  Walensky. Yes, thank you so much for that question. So 
much of what we learned in ``CDC Moving Forward'' is the 
importance of accountability and transparency and partnership, 
and working with people who are going to be the implementers of 
this guidance.
    In terms of public comment, as we are putting out guidance 
in the context, for example, of a public health emergency, one 
of the other things that we learned in ``CDC Moving Forward'' 
is that we have to be nimble and we have to be fast, that we 
were operating too slowly. Of course, a period of public 
comment would take months, a couple of months to potentially--
--
    Mrs.  Rodgers. OK, thank you. I am going to run out of 
time. I am just going to highlight FDA indicates it finalized 
114 documents in 2019; 163 in 2020; 91 in 2021. So there is a 
way that you can do it quickly but keep it public and available 
for comment.
    I will yield back. My time has expired.
    Mr.  Guthrie. The----
    Dr.  Walensky. May I just comment that part of what we are 
doing is standardizing and being more transparent about how we 
are getting that feedback as part of ``CDC Moving Forward.'' So 
thank you for that question.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. The 
Chair recognizes the ranking member of the full committee for 5 
minutes for opening--for questions.
    Mr.  Pallone. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    As the COVID-19 public health emergency ends today, we 
should be applying the lessons we have learned over the last 3 
years when determining how we can build up our public health 
infrastructure rather than look for ways to tear it down.
    So I wanted to ask each of our three witnesses in terms of 
each of your respective agencies: As the public health 
emergency comes to an end, what is the ongoing vulnerability in 
our preparedness and response capabilities that you are most 
concerned about, and how can we address that concern?
    And I know each of you could probably talk an hour about 
it, but we only got 5 minutes, so I will start from the left, I 
guess, my left.
    Ms.  O'Connell. Well, thank you so much, Ranking Member.
    It was very clear to us that we had to rely on other 
departments for support. Just as I laid out in my opening 
statement, DoD gave us assisted acquisition support. We 
couldn't move out fast enough against the needs that we were 
seeing the country had--really important that we, as HHS, are 
able to move out on our own next time. We will--may not always 
have the benefit of other departments being able to come in and 
help. So with our acquisitions authority, DoD came in. We would 
like similar authority so we can stand on our own.
    FEMA and U.S. Coast Guard came in and helped us surge our 
staff so quickly. There are direct hiring and flexible pay 
authorities that I am going to need moving forward because I 
might not always have FEMA and U.S. Coast Guard available to 
come in and help--really important HHS has what it needs, 
moving forward.
    And then construction authority. We have talked about how 
weak the supply chain was, and how important it is to have 
domestic manufacturing of these critical medical supplies. But 
that construction authority that I have right now goes away 
with the supplemental dollars. As soon as those are spent, I 
can no longer continue these investments. I would like to have 
permanent construction authority so I can keep that going, so 
we no longer have those doctors and nurses wearing the plastic 
bags Ranking Member Eshoo mentioned.
    Mr.  Pallone. Thank you. Dr. Walensky?
    Dr.  Walensky. Thank you for that question. So we tackled 
COVID-19 with a frail and underinvested public health 
infrastructure, to start. There were some that estimated before 
the pandemic we had--we were 60,000 public health workforce in 
deficit. So our workforce is a big challenge.
    The second big challenge in our infrastructure has been our 
data systems. You have heard me talk about data modernization. 
We have been getting data through faxes. I know in your State 
of New Jersey, electronic case reporting increased 66 percent 
during the pandemic because of the rapid need for data. But in 
our electronic case reporting we are now up to about 25,000 
health systems can do so. That is about 25 percent of our 
healthcare systems. So we have a lot of work to do in our data 
modernization initiative and resources for that.
    And then finally, laboratory infrastructure. Lots of 
interest now in genomic sequencing and wastewater surveillance 
and all of these things. We do not have a laboratory 
infrastructure in this country that can support all of those 
efforts. And I would urge all of you, if you haven't visited 
your State lab, to visit your State lab and ask if they can do 
genomic sequencing. Thank you.
    Mr.  Pallone. Thank you, Doctor.
    Mr. Califf?
    Dr.  Califf. Sure. I am going to mostly echo what has 
already been said, so I will be very quick.
    We got holes in our data that I have highlighted that we 
need in order to deal with crises when they come up.
    We very much need the surge capacity capability, 
particularly as it relates to pandemic issues that may arise 
where we need our staff and biologics, for example, to be ready 
to go with excess capacity to deal with it.
    And I am very concerned about laboratory testing. If you 
don't have good laboratory testing at the front end, you are 
really in trouble when it comes to figuring out what to do with 
treatment.
    And then finally, as we have already discussed a little bit 
here, we need to fix our peacetime economics, things like the 
generic drug industry and the commodities. The less we are able 
to economically afford to produce the products in the United 
States, the more we are going to depend on an enormous 
investment in stockpiling. Stockpiling is time-limited. And so, 
if we don't fix those fundamental economics, we are going to 
have--we are very concerned about it right now.
    Mr.  Pallone. Well, thank you. I think I can fit in another 
question to you, Dr. Califf.
    The problem that our Members have seen in just the last few 
months is the shortage of drugs that seem to be related to 
increases in demand. And currently, drug manufacturers are 
required to report to FDA when there is a discontinuance or 
interruption in the supply. However, when the shortage is 
driven by demand rather than supply, manufacturers are not 
required to report to FDA.
    So can you explain how FDA can help address drug shortages 
when they have more information from drug manufacturers?
    Can FDA apply those tools if they know of an unanticipated 
spike in demand?
    You have got, like, 20 seconds.
    [Laughter.]
    Dr.  Califf. All right, very quickly, every company keeps 
projections on what it needs to produce to meet the demand that 
it expects. When the demand goes up beyond what they can 
produce, they need to let us know so that we can look across 
companies and see how we can make up for that problem. That is, 
essentially, the basic issue.
    Each company doesn't know what the other company is doing, 
because they are competing. When there is a shortage in one 
company, we need to be able to coordinate across these people. 
Government should not be involved in private enterprise when 
things are working fine, but when there is a problem we have to 
have a mechanism for government to help out, as we have seen in 
many cases over the pandemic.
    Mr.  Pallone. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair now recognizes Dr. Burgess for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Burgess. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I have had this discussion with most of you individually. I 
may not have had it with you, Ms. O'Connell. You are asking for 
a lot of things, and we should consider those things, the 
regulatory authorities, the budgetary authorities. But as I 
have stressed before, you have a credibility deficit with the 
public, and we have to remedy that. Mostly, that will come 
through transparency, I believe.
    But at the same time--and Chair Rodgers mentioned this--
when you come forward with guidances and proclamations, think 
about what the impact this is going to have on everyday 
Americans, because there is a certain amount of pandemic 
fatigue out there in the country right now, and they tune you 
out. I am just telling you that. They do not believe you 
anymore. And that is a serious, serious problem. And so no 
amount of budgetary authority, no amount of regulatory 
authority can reestablish that credibility. We need you all to 
reestablish that credibility through becoming your own centers 
of excellence and transparency, and just day to day, every 
member of your agencies must recognize that job one is 
reestablishing credibility.
    Ms. O'Connell, let me ask you, during the run-up to the 
last reauthorization of the preparedness bill, it seems like we 
had a lot of internal discussions. In fact, some we even had in 
a classified setting. And--but placing ASPR at the center of 
the eye of the storm, if you will, when trouble hit, and that 
seemed--if I recall correctly, that seemed to be the consensus 
that those of us who were on the committee back then--that is 
where we arrived. It didn't fare exactly as I would have 
anticipated then, when real trouble hit.
    So are we doing some sort of ongoing reevaluation? Should 
you be the center? Should the ASPR be the center? I believe it 
should. But are there ways to ensure that you stay at the 
center of that authority during the time of crisis?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Congressman, thank you so much for that 
question. You know, of course, I wasn't here at the last PAHPA 
reauthorization, or in this role, and came into this role in 
June 2021, when the response was already in full swing and 
structures were already in place.
    The Department has been very clear that I am responsible 
for coordinating our department and making sure that I am the 
principal interlocutor with the Secretary on issues around 
public health emergency and response. And I have played that 
role since I have been in this seat and have had the pleasure 
of coordinating with my fellow panelists today on any number of 
very complex issues.
    I also coordinate very closely with the White House. And, 
you know, through the various responses I have led and other 
roles I have played within the Department over previous 
administrations, I have interacted with either NSC, DPC, now a 
White House COVID team, and I am pleased to coordinate with 
however--whichever President it is chooses to organize the 
White House, I will be that conduit from the Department to the 
White House on these issues, and look forward to continuing to 
play that role.
    But again, I have only been in this seat since June 2021, 
and have been able to do that since that point on.
    Mr.  Burgess. And in fact, I think this is your first 
appearance in our subcommittee. So we welcome you and are 
grateful for that, and look forward to many more--many, many 
more such sessions.
    So during the height of the pandemic, HHS and Department of 
Defense developed a fairly successful partnership. This success 
relied partially on ASPR's use of existing DoD authorities. Is 
there a way to look to continuing those authorities so that it 
doesn't have to be something that is stood up anew at the time 
of another crisis?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Well, that is one of the reasons why I am 
asking for some of the acquisitions authorities that DoD has 
for ASPR, because DoD--we live in a very complex threat 
landscape right now, and I think the country is going to need 
DoD to be able to do DoD things.
    Mr.  Burgess. Sure.
    Ms.  O'Connell. HHS should do HHS things. So we need 
similar authorities so I can stand up and get going and not 
have to negotiate an agreement with DoD.
    Mr.  Burgess. Easier to get you those things if you have 
credibility. It does go back to that.
    Dr. Califf, before I run out of time, we came through this 
pandemic, we are all glad that the public health emergency is 
over, but there were a number of flexibilities that were 
required--us to give the FDA so we all didn't die. What have 
you done to sort of codify those flexibilities? And is there a 
way to make you a more nimble agency, going forward?
    Dr.  Califf. Well, of course, as you may have heard me say, 
we are number one in innovation in the U.S. No one disputes 
that. And we still are. We intend to keep it that way.
    And one of the most important ways is through the constant 
communications that we have with the industries that actually 
invent and produce the products. We don't make them, we just 
regulate them. So a lot of the methods that have been used, 
like remote assessments, of some note we have talked about in-
person versus virtual meetings. It turns out two-thirds of the 
time now that we are offering in-person meetings, the industry 
is choosing virtual because it is easier for them to not have 
to assemble all those--their people and have them fly to Silver 
Spring to meet with us.
    So things like that that just make it easier to 
communicate--we will still have a role when things are not 
right to exert our authority to do that. But communication is 
really the key, and we have learned a lot of lessons in the 
process.
    Mr.  Burgess. Well, I have requested a meeting with you, 
and I look forward to following up with that. We can speak at 
the--to some degree of--we can get into deeper detail. So thank 
you.
    And I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, the 
Chair recognizes Mr. Cardenas for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Cardenas. Thank you very much, Chair Guthrie, and also 
Ranking Member Eshoo, for holding this hearing to discuss ways 
to improve our health system preparedness through PAHPA. We 
call it PAHPA here, but what that means is Pandemic and All-
Hazards Preparedness Act reauthorization process.
    I also want to thank our witnesses for joining us today and 
providing testimony on the needs of the Federal Government to 
best respond to crises.
    We have seen the most--excuse me, we have seen the cost of 
being flat-footed in the face of a public health emergency in 
real time. While I think we have learned many lessons from 
COVID-19, I am still concerned that we have real weak spots in 
our preparedness, especially when it comes to kids.
    This past winter we experienced what public health 
officials called tripledemic, when cases of RSV, flu, and 
COVID-19 overlapped, making many of our kids sick and 
overwhelming our hospital systems. This tripledemic prompted 
greater scrutiny of our pediatric care system and highlighted 
severe pediatric facility and workforce shortages which must be 
addressed.
    This is especially problematic because children have a 
unique set of mental and physical health needs that are 
separate from adults. We cannot leave our kids behind, and I am 
worried that if we approach PAHPA reauthorization too narrowly, 
without expanding pediatric healthcare capacity, we will repeat 
mistakes and remain unprepared to protect children in the event 
of a future emergency.
    I have a question for Dr. Walensky.
    Doctor, how do pediatric workforce and facility shortages 
leave us vulnerable in the event of a future pandemic or other 
public health threat?
    Dr.  Walensky. Thank you so much for that question. I am 
going to sort of speak to it from a public health standpoint 
and the workforce that we need in public health, as well as 
in--at CDC specifically, and just speak to some of the 
challenges that we have.
    We train some of the best people in the world. It is really 
competitive to get a fellowship at CDC, but we don't have 
noncompetitive fellow conversion. They have to apply for jobs 
after we have trained them. We don't have tax-exempt student 
loan repayment. And I will tell you, pediatricians, if you look 
at the salary scale, are not the highest-paid clinicians out 
there. We could use direct hire authority. We have 
pediatricians that go out in the field to care for people or 
to--not to care, actually, to do infection control and 
surveillance in Ebola outbreaks, and yet they don't get danger 
pay.
    So there are a lot of things in our direct--in our hiring 
authorities that would really help us sustain a pediatric 
workforce, especially a workforce that has--you know, may leave 
medical school with $200,000 of debt, on average.
    Mr.  Cardenas. And--well, that sets up my next question. 
What can Congress do to better prioritize the unique needs of 
children through the PAHPA reauthorization?
    Dr.  Walensky. So from a public health standpoint, I would 
say those hiring authorities and workforce authorities that I 
just mentioned would go a very long way. And I think, from the 
clinical standpoint, I would defer to my colleague.
    Mr.  Cardenas. Please.
    Ms.  O'Connell. Thank you so much, Congressman. So we have 
created something called the Regional Pediatric Disaster Care 
Centers of Excellence, where we bring various experts across 
the regions to leading children's hospitals and create a 
consortium where we are able to share best practices for 
children in trauma, children in disasters, how to care for 
them. And it has also become a place where our pediatric care 
providers can get support, share lessons learned with each 
other. But it is really critical that we educate all of our 
providers on how to take care of children in this very unique 
emergency situation.
    We also have the National Advisory Committee on Children 
and Disasters, and leading experts have been advising us on how 
to make sure we incorporate their special needs as we move 
forward and prepare the country to respond to what comes next.
    Mr.  Cardenas. Speaking of educating, can you please share 
with us what you would recommend to Congress what we can do to 
strengthen the efforts of the National Advisory Committee on 
Children and Disasters as we work to prepare for future 
emergencies?
    Ms.  O'Connell. The authorization of that committee will 
end with this PAHPA bill. And so, as you reauthorize, it would 
be important to include that.
    I have also requested $7 million for the Pediatric Centers 
of Excellence, and that would be another important thing to 
fund to make sure those providers that are in our communities 
have that support in place where they can share best practices.
    Mr.  Cardenas. You said 7 million, not 70 million, not 700 
million, not 7 billion. Again, how much?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Seven million.
    Mr.  Cardenas. Seven million.
    Ms.  O'Connell. It is part of our National Disaster Medical 
Services System budget.
    Mr.  Cardenas. I love that number.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr.  Cardenas. I would hope and pray that we can meet that. 
Thank you so much, and I appreciate all of you very much.
    And I yield back the balance of my time.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair recognizes Mr. Latta for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Latta. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to 
our witnesses for appearing today.
    Secretary O'Connell, your office is looking to end the 
Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and 
Manufacturing Program and replace it with new programs called 
BioMaP and IBx. Will you explain to the committee the 
background and rationale for establishing these programs, and 
ASPR's plan for implementation?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Congressman, thank you so much for that 
question. It is a really important question.
    So the CIADM program that you referenced was established 
several years ago, and it was to reserve capacity across the 
country in case we needed to ramp up vaccine or therapeutic 
manufacturing. It was a way that we had manufacturing lines 
that were essentially mothballed but could be turned on when 
needed.
    What we found in the COVID response was capacity is one 
thing, capability to run those lines is something else. And so 
what we are looking to do moving forward is not just reserve a 
manufacturing line--mothball it, you know, keep it warm until 
we need it--but make sure that we, in addition to having the 
manufacturing lines, also have the workforce, the capability to 
run those lines so mistakes are not being made when vaccines 
are manufactured. And that is where we are looking to go and 
the reason why we are making that change.
    Mr.  Latta. OK, let me just follow up real quick, because I 
tell you, when I am out in my district--and I am sure everyone 
else--you just mentioned workforce. Every place you go, the 
same thing. Everybody needs, you know, workers out there. So 
how are we going to maintain that workforce out there?
    Because, I mean, I go to places right now, they could 
double what they are manufacturing and doing right now. They 
can't because there is no workforce. So how are we going to do 
that with what you are advocating?
    Ms.  O'Connell. So one of the first things that we are 
going to do is ensure that the organizations in which we have a 
relationship with moving forward have a workforce and are able 
to turn the capability on, as well as the capacity on when 
moving forward. But you are absolutely right. The skilled 
workforce is something that we need to invest in.
    I know Dr. Walensky has been thinking about that in the 
public health space, is how we make sure that we have the 
experts that we need who can run these lines when we need them. 
And we are--part of our investments will be in making sure that 
workforce and capability are there.
    Mr.  Latta. OK, thank you. You know, moving forward we need 
to preserve domestic drug manufacturing and stockpiling and 
mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities to enable continuous 
manufacturing capabilities and active pharmaceutical 
ingredients.
    Dr. Califf, what steps should Congress take to further 
protect access to and further safety of pharmaceuticals while 
preventing supply chain shortages?
    Dr.  Califf. Well, as we have already discussed, better 
information for FDA to coordinate when there is an impending 
shortage, and basically using talk therapy with the industry to 
get cooperation and collaboration where it is needed--because 
normally, they are competitors.
    But in the long run, we have got to deal with the fact that 
many of these commodities and generic products are very low 
cost. There is a--there is intense competition. And when the 
price gets below what can support--you mentioned a highly 
qualified workforce, investment in facilities--then the 
pressure to offshore comes in, which we have also talked about. 
So we have got to deal with these adverse economics that are 
occurring.
    That is well beyond the FDA's remit, but it is a very 
important part of it. But we specify in our documents what--in 
our requests what we need to fill in, those data parts where we 
can deal with it with the situation that we are currently in.
    Mr.  Latta. Well--and again, because I know when--we were 
all getting calls.
    And are there any particular category of drugs we should 
prioritize first before targeting others? Because again, you 
are talking about offshore, because I know that when we had 
committee hearings, we heard about all the different drugs that 
all of a sudden we didn't have, that we had to have, you know, 
coming from someplace else.
    But what drugs do we absolutely have to essentially have? 
Do you think that--we prioritize at the top of the list that we 
start with, and then we start backfilling everything else and--
from there?
    Dr.  Califf. Sure, there have been several essential 
medications lists, and there is a global list. We are just 
finalizing a synthesis of all those. It is pretty much all the 
same, the things that hospitals and healthcare facilities would 
depend on at a time of crisis.
    But I should also point out, you know, if you had told me 
that Tylenol or ibuprofen would be a major issue, you know--I 
am a cardiologist. I am used to dealing with life or death. But 
it turns out, when the surge went up, there was no way our 
American manufacturing could meet the demand in the U.S., and 
it was a global thing.
    So we do need to start with the highest priority, and that 
is what we are doing. But I think we shouldn't fool ourselves 
to think we can only deal with life-or-death drugs and devices. 
We are going to have to deal with the whole picture.
    Mr.  Latta. OK, thank you. You know, I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to reauthorize PAHPA and build off 
these lessons we have learned from COVID-19.
    And lastly, I will be submitting the following QFRs, Mr. 
Chairman, regarding clinical laboratory capacity and diagnostic 
testing for our Strategic National Stockpile.
    And I yield back the balance of my time.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair recognizes Mr. Sarbanes for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to 
all of you for your great work and being here today to share 
your perspective on how we can be prepared for what comes next.
    At the subcommittee's February hearing on the pandemic 
response, we talked about some of the work CDC is doing to 
improve data collection and communication channels with State 
and local public health officials, other partners out there, 
just to kind of build that picture, that ongoing surveillance 
of what is happening with disease. And I kind of wanted to 
build on that a little bit more, maybe broaden it out to talk 
about all the dimensions of information sharing that needs to 
happen, and so forth, because we know one of the big lessons we 
learned from the pandemic was how indispensable it is to get 
this information and to have it at our fingertips real-time, 
interoperable, all the rest of it.
    We pointed to some efforts that were stood up. Hopkins did 
a good job with their dashboard that they created. That is 
being closed down now, as you know. So it makes us think about 
where does that capacity reside on an ongoing basis. CDC is a 
natural place for that kind of function.
    But even as we are celebrating the--celebrating is the 
wrong word--even as we are exhaling when we see some of the 
pandemic behind us, I have a sinking feeling in the pit of my 
stomach that we are closing up shop. We are seeing across the 
country that the public health officials are sort of closing up 
shop on what was a pretty impressive, in many instances, 
ability to respond to pandemic. And going beyond the baseline, 
we need to maintain. Going below the baseline, we need to 
maintain in order to be ready for the next thing so we are not 
just starting from scratch.
    So I think, Dr. Walensky, maybe you are the best one on the 
panel because you have that perspective, that overview to talk 
about that, and maybe address some of that anxiety. But, you 
know, I am reading articles every day about local health 
operations, public health operations, where they are saying, 
``OK, pandemic is over, we don't need X, we don't need Y, we 
don't need Z.'' Well, we might still need X and Y on an ongoing 
basis to be ready for the next thing. And frankly, we need X 
and Y just to do public health well. Forget about a pandemic 
coming.
    But I think we are going to lean--the pendulum is going to 
go too far in the other direction. So talk about how, both in 
terms of the data collection, the communication, the workforce 
that you have talked about, how do we--like, do we blow a 
whistle to the local health officials and say, ``Stop, look, 
and listen,'' like, ``before you take everything apart again,'' 
or like, ``Put this in a closet somewhere, or out back by the 
dumpster.'' Like, ``Think about whether it could help you in 
the next round, and think about, frankly, whether it is a 
critical part of the infrastructure you should have every 
single day just to have a good public health system across the 
country''?
    So if you could talk to that, I would appreciate it.
    Dr.  Walensky. Sure. There is a lot to be said there. Thank 
you so much for that question.
    First, let me say that we have been hard at work on the 
data issues. I think COVID-19 unroofed a lot of the challenges 
that we have in data, data management, data collection across 
our public health, and integrating within CDC and around the 
country. We did release a public health data strategy that 
really looks at bolstering public health data at the local 
source: visualization, interoperable data. And all of that is 
part of a 2-year public health data strategy.
    Your point is really well taken, though, with regard to 
COVID data. As I mentioned, it took us 6 months to get to the 
point that we were getting COVID-related hospitalizations. We 
will continue to get those. But to this day I can't tell you 
who is vaccinated in the hospital. We still don't have the 
capacity to this day. There is an important balance that I 
think we have to recognize, and that is all of the data that is 
being collected for COVID and has been collected for COVID is 
only for COVID. There are many other public health threats out 
there that we really need to have similar data for. And so the 
balance is going to be what is enough for COVID, and how do we 
bolster everything else such that we have that capacity?
    I will give you the example of Mpox. We had a public health 
emergency that was declared for Mpox on August 4th. If you now, 
in hindsight, look at our epidemiologic curves, we had our 
maximum number of cases of Mpox in this country 3 days before 
the public health emergency was declared. If we wait for that 
public health emergency in order to get the data authorities 
that we need, we are already on the down curve, or we are 
already on the down curve of Mpox.
    So we need it, not only for COVID and for preparing for 
pandemic flu, but we need it for all infectious and non-
infectious risks across public health. And that is what we are 
advocating for here to--for our data authorities, to be able to 
have line of sight of that. Thank you.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. Thanks very much, and thanks for your 
service.
    And I yield back.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair recognizes Mr. Bilirakis for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Bilirakis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it 
very much.
    Our Nation's preparedness efforts remain vital. From COVID-
19 to Hurricane Ian, over the last 5 years we have seen our 
healthcare system's strengths as well as some of the biggest 
challenges. I am sure you all agree.
    Unfortunately, this administration's lack of appropriate 
communication between the Government agencies, siloed work 
product, duplicative and conflicting agency recommendations, 
and arduous bureaucracy has been all, in my opinion, on full 
display.
    Dr. Walensky, throughout the course of the COVID-19 
pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology has been used 
effectively by State and local governments, Federal agencies, 
universities, private businesses to monitor, spread, inform 
public health responses and help predict case levels in a 
community several days in advance. WBE produces cost-effective, 
aggregated, and anonymized--I am sorry--data from the community 
wastewater samples, avoiding difficult personal data and 
privacy issues.
    It is my understanding that CDC established a national 
wastewater surveillance system, or NWSS, in late 2021, which 
has been much--very successful and a positive. It has gotten a 
positive reception. However, it is also my understanding that 
NWSS has become siloed within CDC's National Center for 
Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases and is restricted to 
known infectious diseases. This is unfortunate, considering 
NWSS could possibly be utilized to track high-risk substances 
such as fentanyl.
    We are in the middle of a fentanyl overdose crisis, as you 
know. Under the Prevent Pandemics Act passed as part of the 
fiscal year 2023 omnibus, Congress authorized the CDC 
directly--Director to continue leveraging public-private 
partnerships for activities that would include wastewater-based 
epidemiology.
    As we think about CDC being more nimble and evolving to 
keep pace, can you tell me why CDC is not currently utilizing 
wastewater epidemiology to its fullest extent?
    Why has CDC not engaged with private-sector partners to 
utilize wastewater epidemiology beyond just the Center for 
Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases?
    If you could, answer that question.
    Dr.  Walensky. Yes, I very much appreciate that question, 
because wastewater has been such an interesting and informative 
way that we have been able to track COVID-19 novel, new way, 
and has a lot of promise for things like antimicrobial 
resistance and many other things.
    As you mentioned, this is a young field. We have, over the 
last 2 years, been able to develop now up to 1,400 wastewater 
sites that cover about 140 million Americans. And through that, 
not only have we been able to track COVID-19, but we have been 
using it for polio in our paralytic polio case in New York as 
well as for other pathogens like Mpox, which we have been using 
and tracking with Mpox, as well.
    You actually ask a really important question. First, we are 
engaging in industry partnerships through our wastewater 
surveillance. It has been important, as we have learned--been 
learning and studying. But one of the key questions that you 
asked is, how can we use wastewater in a key area of research 
for other things?
    Importantly, what we really want to know from wastewater 
is, are there metabolites of fentanyl or opioids that we can 
detect in the wastewater before we might detect them in 
emergency room surveillance that we could act on?
    And so that is actually the research question that we are 
asking right now to say would we detect it in the wastewater in 
a sensitive and specific way that would lead to acute public 
health action in a way that would be better and faster than the 
surveillance that we are already doing through our State 
unintentional drug overdose reporting or our other emergency 
department surveillance systems. With that question, which we 
are actively addressing, we intend to sort of expand it in 
other ways.
    The other thing I might say is it is a real important time 
to comment on laboratory infrastructure. And I would again 
invite you to go to your State lab and say, ``Do we have the 
capacity in our State lab to do wastewater surveillance here?'' 
Many of our State labs do not. Really, as we think about these 
new and novel ways to address infectious and noninfectious 
threats, do we have the resources across the country in the 
machinery and the laboratory infrastructure and the analysts in 
order to scale it up? Thank you.
    Mr.  Bilirakis. Thank you. Well, my time has expired, but I 
will submit the questions for the record.
    Please keep us informed on that issue.
    Mr.  Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes Dr. Ruiz for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Ruiz. Thank you. Thank you for holding this important 
hearing today.
    As we have said many times over the past 2 years, there is 
a lot that we learned from the COVID pandemic. It is our 
responsibility to take those lessons and make the necessary 
changes so that history doesn't repeat itself.
    Before I get to my questions, I would be remiss if I didn't 
mention a bill that I have worked on for several years with my 
friend, Dr. Bucshon: the Good Samaritan Health Professionals 
Act of 2023. The bill would simply expand liability protections 
for doctors who volunteer during national or public health 
emergencies by allowing them to help in places of need, 
regardless of State boundaries. This was passed as part of the 
CARES Act for doctors to be able to respond to COVID needs, but 
I urge its full inclusion in the reauthorization of the 
Pandemic All-Hazards Preparedness Act as the legislation moves 
forward. I look forward to working with the committee on this 
in the coming months.
    Dr. Walensky, thank you for being here today. It is good to 
see you again. We have had several conversations over the past 
couple of years regarding the need for a more robust public 
health workforce. While healthcare worker shortages are common 
across many specialties, there is an acute need when it comes 
to the public health workforce.
    Why do we need and what should we be doing to bolster our 
public health workforce on the local, State, and national level 
in the context of preparation for future public health 
emergencies?
    Dr.  Walensky. Thank you so much, Dr. Ruiz, for that 
question.
    So much of what we need in our public health workforce is a 
workforce that is diverse as the communities we serve. It is 
those trusted people on the ground that can reach and know 
where to reach communities and know the culturally competent 
messages that they need to hear in order to actually get 
implemented guidances to better public health.
    As part of those authorities that we need at CDC, and I 
would say across public health in general, are things like 
student loan repayment, noncompetitive fellow conversion, 
direct hire authority, overtime and danger pay. These are all 
things that, if we are going to be a response-based agency, 
that we have to have the same authorities that--like FEMA has, 
in terms of being response-based.
    Mr.  Ruiz. Thank you. A robust workforce is key to creating 
and implementing adult vaccine programs, which are a critical 
component to preparedness. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted 
gaps in access to vaccines and treatments for the most 
vulnerable in our communities. As we think about future 
outbreaks, it is critical that we make sure everyone has access 
to these lifesaving therapeutics.
    Dr. Walensky, can you say more about how the proposed 
Vaccine for Adults Program would address these gaps so that, in 
the case of another pandemic, we are not starting from square 
one?
    Dr.  Walensky. We absolutely--thank you so much for that 
question, because we have a really robust Vaccines for Children 
Program, which has saved trillions of dollars and millions of 
lives. We do not have a similar vaccine program for adults. 
That is, there are 14 actively approved and recommended 
vaccines for adults that uninsured adults do not have access to 
in the absence of a Vaccines for Adults program, and we don't 
have one.
    That is why we need for COVID-19--a bridge plan for COVID-
19 vaccines over the next 2 years to be able to deliver those 
vaccines to uninsured adults. But that leaves out influenza 
vaccines and shingles vaccines and pneumococcal vaccines and 
hepatitis vaccines. All of those vaccines are uncovered, and we 
don't--we are not positioned to be able to sustain this for 
another public health emergency for flu vaccines, for example. 
Thank you.
    Mr.  Ruiz. Thank you. Pivoting to another important issue 
that we need to address moving forward, and that is one of data 
sharing, we have talked about the need for CDC to have better 
access to data. But as we have heard today, the FDA would also 
benefit from additional data-sharing authorities.
    Dr. Califf, what does FDA need in terms of data authorities 
from States, and why is the current process of working with 
each State individually ineffective during a public health 
emergency?
    Dr.  Califf. Thanks very much. And, you know, while CDC is 
focused on the public health needs, we are focused largely on 
the biomedical needs for things like vaccines and treatments, 
how they are doing in the real world. And as I have been 
listening to this, I have thought of an analogy that may make 
it easy to understand what the issue is.
    We largely do share data sources with CDC, and analyses. We 
talk about them all the time when we have them. CDC inherited, 
when Dr. Walensky came in, a system where their pipes were 
corroded. So if you imagine a system where there is a spigot, 
the data flows into a common receptacle, it gets processed and 
sent back to people to figure out what to do with. The people 
controlling the spigot are the States and the counties. And if 
every time we want to do something we have to go ask every one 
of those people with every one of those spigots, a huge amount 
of time goes by, up to months.
    And in the meanwhile, we are going down the road, 
particularly in an emergency, having to make decisions without 
the data, so much so that I have had to call Israel several 
times to figure out what is going on, because they have a 
system with electronic health records where the data is ready 
instantaneously. We need that in the United States. It is not 
for us. It is not for the public health agencies. It is for the 
person who gets sick or has a problem that needs their 
physician or healthcare provider to know what happened to other 
people like them in real time.
    Mr.  Ruiz. Hey, thanks for what you do. Thanks for keeping 
our Nation safe despite the attacks and the personal attacks. 
It takes courage to be a good, honest, truthful public health 
expert these days in this country. So thank you for doing it.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and the 
Chair now recognizes the leader on our side of the dais on this 
issue, and working well with the Ranking Member Eshoo--and I 
just appreciate you all's efforts--I recognize Mr. Hudson for 5 
minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Hudson. Thank you, Chairman Guthrie, and thank you for 
making this a real priority for our subcommittee. And I want to 
thank Ranking Member Eshoo for your partnership and leadership. 
I have learned a lot from you, and I have enjoyed working 
together and look forward to all we are going to accomplish 
working together.
    Thank you to our witnesses for your time here today and 
your important testimony. I am going to try to cover a lot of 
ground here, so I am going to dive right in.
    My focus on this reauthorization has been a thorough 
process. And last year, I led the Healthy Futures Task Force 
Subcommittee on our side of the aisle. We solicited extensive 
feedback from the private sector, we hosted roundtables with 
Members, and most recently, working with Representative Eshoo, 
we put out an RFI to engage stakeholders in ways that our 
Nation can improve and avoid similar mistakes we have made in 
the past and capitalize on a lot of the successes that we have 
had.
    But I want to be clear to everyone listening: This is not a 
COVID response bill. This reauthorization will ensure that our 
Nation is prepared for all public health security threats, 
including natural disasters, cyber attacks, and biothreats 
alike, and in that light will focus on overall solutions.
    Ms. O'Connell, great to see you again today. Under PREVENT, 
and as part of the end-of-year omnibus, Congress directed the 
creation of the White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and 
Response Policy. This position is to be appointed by the 
President and serve as the principal advisor to the President 
on all issues related to pandemic and preparedness policy, 
including making recommendations and coordinating Federal 
activities. The Director will have limited staff and serve as a 
cochair of PHEMCE, the Public Health Emergency Countermeasures 
Enterprise, along with you, the person in your position.
    The President has yet to appoint a Director, nor has there 
been any word on a possible appointment or plans for an 
appointment. Can you speak to the status of this appointment 
process? Are you aware of any timeline for an appointment to 
this position?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Thank you, Congressman. I cannot speak to 
the status, of course. That is a discussion that the President 
is having at the White House.
    Mr.  Hudson. Well, thank you. Well, how do you see your 
role as ASPR interfacing and coordinating with this Director, 
both as leads in our Nation's pandemic preparedness and 
response efforts as cochairs of PHEMCE?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Well, I will look forward to the 
collaboration and the partnership with whoever the President 
picks to run that office.
    It is important to me that ASPR leads where ASPR can lead 
and that we are role players and strong role players where we 
need to be. And when we are a partner with someone at the White 
House, that will be just fine, and we will look forward to 
having a very collaborative relationship with the PHEMCE in 
this cochair role.
    Mr.  Hudson. Well, currently, in the case of disagreements 
among PHEMCE members or recommendations, the HHS Secretary has 
the final decision-making authority. Will this chain of command 
remain, even as it appears the intent of the new position will 
be to create a direct line of communication between the 
Director and the President on these issues? Do you--how do you 
see this playing out in real time, a real-case scenario?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Well, as I understand it from the 
legislation currently, the PHEMCE reports to the Secretary, and 
that will continue to be--unless that is changed in the new 
bill, that will continue to be the way that we do this.
    Mr.  Hudson. Well, and I appreciate that, and I think one 
of the things that this committee has got to kind of resolve 
and work through with this reauthorization is what is that 
really going to look like. And, you know, I would appreciate 
your feedback through this process, including any concerns you 
might have about structural problems, or any ideas you have of 
how we can make the chain of command more clear.
    You know, I think, in practice, when we have had 
emergencies, when we have had outbreaks, the White House always 
takes control of the communications piece, regardless of 
whether it is Republicans or Democrats. This--but in practical 
terms, they are the ones that the public sees, yet your office 
is the one that has got the authority to direct, within HHS, 
the response.
    And so, you know, there is--I think there is a lot of work 
we need to do and could do to make that work better. And so I 
would appreciate your feedback as we go through this process. 
And any thoughts you have that you would like to submit to us, 
we would welcome those.
    Now, I have heard from many stakeholders requesting a 
mechanism by which industry partners could play a role in 
PHEMCE, and the feedback we have gotten from private sector--
there have been some problems. We have heard stakeholders that 
have faced issues with lack of communication and transparency. 
I know you have said it is a priority under the 2019 
reauthorization. It is--was codified that there should be this 
interaction.
    Do you--is there any current formal process by which 
private industry can interface with PHEMCE?
    Do you think having an advisory council formally created 
for private industry would help any--I am out of time, but any 
thoughts you might have?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Just real quickly to say we can't do the 
work of developing these countermeasures without private 
industry. It is a public-private partnership, and so their role 
is critically important. I say that every opportunity I can.
    I am happy to talk with you as you are thinking this 
through about what, you know, a mechanism might be, but we 
bring this to our stakeholders and our private-sector partners 
all the time. It is really important to me that they are 
engaged.
    Mr.  Hudson. Well, I think we have got to figure out how to 
do it a little bit better.
    But with that, Mr. Chairman, I am way over my time, so I 
will yield back. Thank you.
    Mr.  Guthrie. We appreciate it, and appreciate your efforts 
on this.
    The gentleman yields back, and the Chair recognizes Ms. 
Kuster for 5 minutes for questions.
    [Pause.]
    Ms.  Kuster. Sorry, there we go, there we go.
    Opportunities where we can do more--ensuring everyone has 
access to lifesaving vaccines is a key opportunity for 
improvement. For centuries we have relied on vaccines to 
protect and defend against severe illness, and the COVID-19 
pandemic demonstrated the importance of effective vaccine 
information. Sadly, the COVID-19 pandemic also showed that 
Americans who don't have insurance struggled to get the 
vaccine. All Americans should have access to vaccines, 
regardless of their insurance status, and I appreciate that HHS 
is working to make vaccines available to all Americans through 
the Bridge Access Program.
    However, more must need to be done. As we prepare for the 
future, I am working on a proposal to establish an uninsured 
adults program that would close the gaps in coverage for 
necessary vaccines. Dr. Walensky, you have previously spoken 
before E&C about the importance of a robust infrastructure for 
adult vaccination, including an idea for a Vaccines for Adults 
program. Can you describe how such a program would help provide 
greater coverage through expanded access during public health 
emergencies?
    Dr.  Walensky. Thank you so much, Congresswoman. We have 
had conversations about the critical importance of this. We 
have a robust Vaccines for Children program that covers 
uninsured children and has demonstrated its value in saving 
millions of lives and trillions of dollars.
    We do not have a similar program for adults, for the over 
20 million adults who are uninsured. They do not have access to 
a flu vaccine or a shingles vaccine or a COVID vaccine. It is 
because of that that we have needed to build this Bridge 
program. But this is a short-term fix, and it is only for one 
vaccine. And there is so much that we could do to prevent 
disease and infectious disease if we had this coverage in a 
Vaccines for Adults program.
    Additionally, it would provide consistent statutory funding 
for vaccines and an infrastructure such that when we have a new 
public health threat we have that infrastructure ready to go 
for the next vaccine that we need to deploy acutely. Thank you.
    Ms.  Kuster. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you for your 
years of leadership at the CDC. We are very grateful.
    Dr. Califf, I would like to ask you about how FDA regulates 
medical devices and how this changed during public--changes 
during public health emergencies.
    As we all know, medical device labeling plays a critical 
role in the use and ongoing safety of medical devices, 
everything from MRI machines to glucose monitors. As we saw 
during COVID-19, the FDA was able to use its authority to make 
changes to medical device labeling electronically. This allowed 
them to respond to public health needs in real time, and keep 
patients and providers in touch with the most up-to-date safety 
information without waiting for an updated paper manual.
    However, outside of a public health emergency, existing 
laws continue to require that device manufacturers distribute 
physical paper versions of the updated labeling.
    Asking Dr. Califf: How would electronic labeling for 
devices and diagnostics help ensure providers and patients have 
more timely access to accurate and up-to-date information?
    Dr.  Califf. Thanks for raising that. As a graduate of 
Silicon Valley in my private life, of course, if you can make 
an instantaneous change for the entire country in a label, that 
is a good thing. And so we are very much in favor of moving in 
that direction.
    But we also caution that there are parts of America and 
people who are not facile with the technology, particularly for 
devices that are used at home by people who still need the 
paper copy, because that is what they depend on. And so, as we 
move in this direction, I think we all anticipate over the next 
decade or so more and more electronic labeling is going to be 
good, but we have got to nestle that in also with maintaining 
the paper system where appropriate.
    Ms.  Kuster. Great. Thank you very much.
    And with that, let it reflect that I am yielding back with 
the 31 seconds that my colleague went over.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr.  Guthrie. The gentlelady yields back. The Chair now 
recognize Mr. Johnson for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Johnson. Thank you, Chairman Guthrie, and thank you to 
our witnesses for being with us here today.
    You know, here we are, more than 3 years removed from the 
outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gone are the days of the 15 
days to slow the spread and disjointed, ever-changing 
recommendations from the CDC about how to go about living our 
daily lives. Schools were shut down, loved ones isolated, and 
everyday American life was brought to a standstill.
    From the outset of this virus, birthed and then covered up 
by China, to now, we have learned a lot. And it is with the 
benefit of hindsight that we must look at lessons learned to 
better ensure we are prepared for the next pandemic or natural 
disaster.
    But there were some silver linings. Telehealth, for 
example, has become a widely used and accepted form of care, 
reducing barriers to access and ensuring that rural communities 
like the one I live in and represent are better able to manage 
their healthcare.
    Another outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic was the Strategic 
National Stockpile, or SNS. It has largely become a household 
name. The pandemic highlighted the importance of an 
appropriately stocked SNS filled with a variety of 
countermeasures to address a host of health threats that face 
our country.
    This past October the Government Accountability Office 
released a report titled ``HHS Should Address Strategic 
National Stockpile Requirements and Inventory Risks.'' In this 
report GAO found that SNS contained most medical 
countermeasures types recommended, but often not in the 
recommended quantities.
    American families must live within their budgets, and I 
believe that the Federal Government must do that, as well. But 
sadly, this administration doesn't seem to feel that way. If 
they did, we wouldn't be in this position with regards to the 
debt ceiling.
    So the answer is not always to just throw more money at the 
problem. Instead, I think we need to look at how we can better 
allocate resources to ensure the SNS is adequately stocked with 
the medical supplies necessary to ensure the health and safety 
of the American people.
    So my first question is for Ms. O'Connell, and it is a 
really simple question: Are you meeting all stated 
requirements, as outlined by the Strategic National Stockpile 
Material Threat Determinations?
    Ms.  O'Connell. We currently do not have funding in order 
to have all of the requirements filled----
    Mr.  Johnson. So you are not.
    Ms.  O'Connell. We do not have----
    Mr.  Johnson. So you are not meeting those.
    Ms.  O'Connell [continuing]. The funding to fill all the 
requirements.
    Mr.  Johnson. OK. Outside of increased budget requests, how 
can ASPR ensure it has the appropriate processes in place to 
ensure the SNS is appropriately supplied?
    Ms.  O'Connell. So we have talked a lot about the PHEMCE 
already, and the PHEMCE is the interagency group of subject 
matter experts that advises the Strategic National Stockpile 
and BARDA on what the material threat determinations are that 
DHS has given us and what countermeasures we need in order to 
prepare the country against those threats.
    Now, one of the things I am doing right now is I am 
reviewing all of the requirements. When I came into this seat 
in June 2021, some requirements had not been reviewed in 10 
years. It is important to me that the stockpile is meeting 
requirements against current threats. What do we need now? Do 
we have the right countermeasures for the current threats? Do 
we need to reprioritize across the current threat landscape? 
That conversation is happening with our subject matter experts.
    Mr.  Johnson. Yes, I--you just took my question in a 
different direction. I agree with you that we have to be 
looking at current threats. But I can tell you from my 27 years 
in the United States Air Force, it is the threats down the road 
that we also have to be concerned about. We have got to be able 
to anticipate threats. I mean, we never anticipated the 
pandemic, but look where we ended up.
    Let me ask you one final question, because I want to be 
able to yield back some time like my colleague did. How 
specifically does Administration for Strategic--how does ASPR 
aim to bridge the gaps faced between the required amounts and 
the current stockpile?
    Ms.  O'Connell. So again, we are looking at the 
requirements to make sure that we have got the right things 
against the right threats.
    We are also asking for additional funding, funding that 
meets the need, so people understand that as we add more 
threats, we add more countermeasures, that requires us to pay 
more for what we have.
    But what we are also doing is BARDA is investing in threat-
agnostic countermeasures. We are no longer one bug, one drug. 
We are looking for countermeasures that work against many of 
the threats we face. And that is one of the things down the 
line as we continue to innovate that will benefit all of us 
moving forward, including making sure the stockpile is stocked 
with those things that we need against the threats we face.
    Mr.  Johnson. OK, thank you. And I will yield back an 
entire eight seconds, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr.  Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes Ms. Kelly for 5 minutes for questions.
    Ms.  Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you to Chair 
Guthrie and Ranking Member Eshoo for holding today's hearing, 
and thank you to all the witnesses for being here today.
    Technology has become a significant part of our healthcare 
delivery system. In the last few years, we have witnessed the 
increased adoption of telehealth services to the increased 
usage of remote technologies to monitor vital signs or blood 
glucose levels. We are no longer in a world where health 
information is shared with the confines of a building. While 
our ability to share data is important, our ability to 
safeguard health information is vital. Cybersecurity breaches 
compromise our response to coordinate and deliver care.
    Dr. Califf, the 2023 omnibus bill that was enacted last 
December included important provisions regarding cybersecurity, 
specifically on medical device cybersecurity. The law requires 
the Secretary of HHS to update public information provided by 
the FDA regarding improving the cybersecurity of devices within 
180 days of enactment. Would you provide an update on how that 
process is coming along, and any examples of what FDA is 
planning to share with the public?
    Dr.  Califf. Sure. I appreciate the interest in this, and 
we have been hard at work, particularly CDRH within the FDA, 
holding a variety of public sessions, the websites have been 
updated, videos that are available to the public, and many 
discussions with the industries that are involved.
    So requirements to provide information and guidance to the 
industry and to the public, I think, is being met as specified 
in the law. But I do want to emphasize this is a race where the 
threat continues to increase at a very high level, and we are 
going to need to add more on our side of the equation to make 
sure, for example, laboratory-developed tests could be an entry 
for cyber--entry into healthcare systems. And it is all part of 
a composite picture that we are working on.
    Ms.  Kelly. Thank you for your response.
    Dr. Walensky, good to see you. Thank you for your service. 
As today marks the end of the Federal public health emergency 
for COVID-19, we must ensure that we are prepared, as you know, 
for any future pandemics. In your testimony you speak about the 
need to build a more robust, interoperable data and analytics 
public health system.
    How can the Federal Government support your efforts to 
build out a national data infrastructure for all hazards, 
whether it is hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes--not just 
pandemics--that is capable of efficiently sharing important 
public health information amongst [audio malfunction] bad 
actors do not have unintended access to data?
    Dr.  Walensky. Yes, thank you so much for that question.
    So we are hard at work in our data modernization efforts to 
ensure that our data systems are interoperable, that the data 
highways can flow. And that has been a lot of work that is 
happening at CDC.
    What we need to make sure of after that--and we need your 
help with--is to make sure that there's actually cars on the 
highway once we build those highways. We don't currently have 
the authorities for those cars to be on the highways.
    If there is an acute rare event that is happening in one 
State and an acute rare event that is happening in another, if 
they are not reported to CDC they will not be connected. And 
what we would like to have the authorities to do is to see 
those rare events that are occurring or not-so-rare events that 
are occurring, so that we can actually send the data back to 
the States, they can recognize maybe we are not alone in this.
    I gave the example of Mpox, and I will give it again. We 
had a public health emergency that allowed us more data 
authorities on August 4th. We had our peak number of cases of 
Mpox in this country on August 1st. Things were already 
trending down before we had line of sight of all the data that 
we needed. And after we had it, it took us 2 months to get data 
use agreements in place so that we could see where vaccine was 
being utilized.
    We also need, from a public health emergency preparedness 
standpoint and our public health emergency grants, to make sure 
that we are not simply focused on pandemic flu, that we are 
focused beyond pandemic flu. Because we have seen, certainly in 
my last 2\1/2\ years, that there are many more infectious 
threats, including Mpox, paralytic polio, measles, Ebola that 
potentially could come our way. So we do need to expand that 
beyond pandemic flu alone. Thank you.
    Ms.  Kelly. Thank you so much for your response and, again, 
thank all of you for your service.
    And I am yielding back 22 seconds.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr.  Bucshon [presiding]. The gentlelady yields back. I now 
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    I first want to say, Dr. Walensky, thank you for your 
service to your country. I appreciate it. I appreciate the 
opportunity to learn more today about many important things our 
Government agencies do to try to prepare for potential hazards. 
I mean, this is really a critical hearing.
    Be it chemical threat, biological threat, cyber attack, or 
infectious disease, this bill, PAHPA, is about much more than 
COVID-19. Of course, with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, all of 
us now have more real-life experience with some of these 
programs than we probably ever wanted or knew that we needed.
    I do think it is important that we assess what happened and 
learn from those experiences, so I will start with a question 
related to that. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic we 
have heard a lot about testing, diagnostic capabilities, and 
the challenges that arose when some of these capacities were 
strained and outright inaccurate.
    As my colleagues and Dr. Califf know, I have had some 
thoughts in the past about how the FDA should restructure to 
approach diagnostic testing, and I have legislation called the 
VALID Act, which has specific provisions that would help 
accelerate FDA review of diagnostic tests in a pandemic 
situation.
    But on a broader level, Assistant Secretary O'Connell, HHS 
and ASPR does not have a testing and diagnostics preparedness 
plan in place. Is that correct?
    Ms.  O'Connell. We do have a testing and diagnostics 
working group that sits within our industrial base management 
and supply chain work that is currently working against the 
testing challenges that we face.
    Mr.  Bucshon. Yes, so that is the one that you are in the 
process of developing a more definitive plan.
    Do you think something explicit along these lines would be 
helpful to better facilitate future efforts to develop, scale, 
procure, and distribute diagnostics during a public health 
emergency, a really specific ASPR plan as it relates to that?
    Ms.  O'Connell. We have seen how important it is to have 
tests and diagnostics available at the beginning of any 
outbreak or pandemic, and so we continue to work against those 
challenges to make sure that we are able to provide the tests 
that are needed.
    Mr.  Bucshon. Great. I would also like to ask about the 
sterilization process.
    As you all likely know, EPA has recently issued a proposal 
on ethylene dioxide, or--I will call it EtO. I am concerned 
about these regulations and the potential impact of EtO 
facility closures, and the subsequent impact on patient safety 
and device supply.
    Dr. Califf, the FDA is on record as having serious concerns 
about the potential impact of EtO limitations. In 2020 the FDA 
published a list of critical devices to respond to a pandemic, 
60 percent of which were sterilized by ethylene dioxide. As we 
examine domestic capability to respond to future health 
security threats, do you consider domestic medical product 
sterilization capacity critical to ensuring the U.S. can 
protect the American people?
    Dr.  Califf. The short answer to that is yes.
    Mr.  Bucshon. Yes. And so, on this situation with ethylene 
dioxide, if that--if the EPA does, for example, restrict that 
substantially, what do you see as our viable alternatives to 
maintain our preparedness?
    Dr.  Califf. Well, as you know, we do have concerns. And 
just a sudden restriction would create substantial difficulty 
with critical medical devices. So EPA is in the lead in this. 
We are working on it. There is an interagency process.
    We are also working with the industry to come up with 
alternatives. I wish I could say there is a ready alternative 
in a short period of time.
    Mr.  Bucshon. Yes.
    Dr.  Califf. There is not, but we need a national 
investment in those alternatives.
    Mr.  Bucshon. Thank you.
    Assistant Secretary, do you have any comments on that?
    Ms.  O'Connell. We will continue to support our FDA 
colleagues in this process.
    Mr.  Bucshon. Thank you. Good answer. Pretty definitive. 
Doesn't tell me a lot, but it is still definitive.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr.  Bucshon. There has been a lot of talk about data 
today. Unfortunately, the public--and Dr. Walensky, we have 
talked about this--there is a lot of public mistrust, you know, 
at--with CDC, which I think is just horribly unfortunate.
    I mean--and so, as it relates to the data and authorities 
provided during the public health emergency, you know, how are 
we going to be able to give you more authority, especially 
when, you know, the situation is--you still haven't been able 
to--what extent those authorities will be used, and how they 
will be used, I mean, when we have a lack of public confidence?
    I had legislation on--somewhat related to this, and we--and 
it really kind of blew up, politically and otherwise.
    Dr.  Walensky. Yes, I am really grateful for the question 
and for your efforts here.
    So much of what you commented on early in terms of 
accountability and transparency has been our efforts in ``CDC 
Moving Forward,'' and we have had discussions about that, 
increasing our communication towards the American people, 
moving our data faster, having guidelines that's implementable 
and on the ground.
    In terms of the data authorities, I also want to just 
highlight that it is the local health departments that need 
individualized data. It is not the CDC. The CDC is really 
looking for population-based data. When there is contact 
tracing that is happening, that is happening at the local 
level. The data that we are looking for is really population-
based data, so that we can actually feed it back to 
populations.
    And so I do really want to be clear. We are not looking for 
identifiable information----
    Mr.  Bucshon. Great.
    Dr.  Walensky. That happens at the local level. It is the 
population-based data we are looking----
    Mr.  Bucshon. Right, and I understand that. How do we get 
that message out is difficult. It is de-identified, population-
based data. I understand.
    I yield. Now I recognize Ms. Blunt Rochester for 5 minutes 
for questions.
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking 
Member Eshoo, and to our witnesses for your presence, and also 
for your service.
    This hearing focuses us on preparing for and responding to 
future public health security threats. Although the pandemic 
highlighted the fragility of our drug supply chains, the United 
States was dealing with persistent drug shortages prior to the 
pandemic. We continue to experience drug shortages to this day. 
Every month, my constituents write to me describing their 
struggles and frustrations with drug shortages, ranging from 
Adderall to children's Tylenol to medications for diabetes. 
They are imploring us to take action.
    So I thank you. I thank you all for being here today to 
explain how the administration plans to keep Americans safe 
from existing and future supply chain and public health 
disruptions.
    Dr. Califf, the FDA is requesting additional transparency 
authority to require manufacturers to tell you which suppliers 
provide them with the ingredients they use to manufacture their 
drugs. Can you describe the gaps FDA still has in its 
understanding of the drug supply chain and how what you are 
requesting will benefit the American people?
    Dr.  Califf. Sure, thanks. This is a difficult problem that 
we are all struggling with, and very noticeable, as you point 
out.
    The primary gap we have is that what we need is the API, 
active pharmaceutical ingredient. Essentially, the raw material 
gets processed in one place, sent to another place, where the 
pill is made, and then sent through a distribution chain to 
where it eventually lands. We have in sight--line of sight into 
parts of that chain but not all of it. And in particular, the 
API which often is coming from India or China right now, we 
have very little insight into how that is working.
    How would we use the information if we had it? As long as 
things are fine, we have no interest in interfering with the 
private business of medical product distribution. But when 
there is a problem or an impending problem, we need to work 
across the manufacturers who otherwise don't share data--it is 
confidential commercial information--and we need to get them to 
coordinate to make up for if there is a deficit one place, to 
make up for it in another place. And there are four or five 
ways we do this that we can go into in detail.
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester. So why is the data already required 
to be submitted under current law insufficient to help FDA 
understand which suppliers the manufacturers rely on?
    Dr.  Califf. Because the requirement right now is only for 
part of the information that we need in particular aspects of 
the distribution system. We do get--and when it is required, we 
get good data, and we have beautiful graphics now to show it. 
But we are missing these key elements. It is like holes in the 
system that we can't see that turn out to be critical elements 
of the system.
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester. Yes, I would agree with you. I 
actually, as part of my comments, mentioned the fact that the 
lack of data and the supply chain transparency make it 
difficult to estimate the precise share of the key U.S. drugs 
and APIs imported from abroad. But we can guess that a lot of 
them, as you just suggested, come from China and India.
    My legislation, the Supply Chains Act, would support the 
creation of manufacturing jobs in the United States and the 
relocation of critical supply chains to the U.S. or U.S. allies 
and key international partners. So I believe we have the same 
goals in mind.
    In June of 2021 the President released a report that 
assessed supply chain vulnerabilities across four key products. 
Pharmaceuticals and APIs were one of them. To reverse the 
decades-long decline in U.S. manufacturing and economic 
leadership, Congress has invested heavily in onshoring critical 
manufacturing.
    Dr. Califf, as we ramp up domestic API and pharmaceutical 
manufacturing, what are the top three things we can do in the 
short term to address and mitigate drug shortages?
    Dr.  Califf. Well, I would put at the top of the list the 
better information that we talked about. The authority to make 
that happen is very important.
    And then there is the communication that needs to occur 
across the companies that I described, very important for us to 
be able to do.
    And then there is coordination within the Government.
    Also, because Ms. O'Connell and I spend a lot of time 
talking about this right now, about how to put the pieces 
together--because, again, very often with medical supplies you 
can make up for a shortage by doing something else and 
compensate for it. But I want to stress again this doesn't 
solve the fundamental economic problem that----
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester. Right.
    Dr.  Califf [continuing]. Onshoring is going to require 
that we have a viable system whereby American companies can 
actually make a profit if they are in the business in 
peacetime.
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester. Yes. Thank you so much.
    I just want to end by saying Congressman Buddy Carter and I 
have introduced the Essential Medicines Strategic Stockpile Act 
to provide that short-term solution, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues across the aisle to make sure we 
address these issues that affect our health, our wealth, and 
our national security.
    Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize 
Mr. Carter for 5 minutes for his line of questions.
    Mr.  Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for 
being here.
    Dr. Walensky, I want to thank you for hosting us at the CDC 
a few weeks back, a delegation of--the Georgia delegation, as 
well as members of the Doctors Caucus that I led down there. 
Thank you very much, and thank you for your service, and good 
luck in your future endeavors.
    Folks, you know, I have always said there is a difference 
in knowing something and realizing it. And I think that we knew 
we were too dependent on foreign countries for our 
pharmaceuticals, for our PPE. But we realized it during the 
pandemic, when all of a sudden we couldn't get it, and it was a 
big problem.
    One thing that concerned me was that in the Doctors Caucus 
we were told by, I think, a very reliable source that although 
we didn't know about the pandemic until about February of 2020, 
there was actually a downtick in the amount of PPE that was 
coming from China that could be traced all the way back to the 
fall of 2019. They knew that there was a problem. They knew 
that they had a problem over there, and they were hoarding PPE. 
That was told to us. So that tells us and it gives us an 
important lesson to be learned there, and that is that we need 
to be prepared. And that is essentially what we have been 
talking about all day and essentially what we are trying to do.
    One of the things that I wanted to mention--and I 
appreciate Representative Blunt Rochester mentioning this--is 
that I have legislation--she and I together have legislation 
called the Essential Medicines Strategic Stockpile Act, and 
this will allow private and public sectors to partner with--or 
the private sector to partner with the Federal Government, so 
that we can stockpile generic drugs that are at a risk of 
shortage.
    We know what this causes. As a pharmacist, I have 
experienced this. I have seen the horrible situation that we 
can get into when we have a shortage, particularly now as we 
are experiencing with amoxicillin, essential antibiotics, and 
that.
    I wanted to ask you, Ms. O'Connell, I wanted to get your 
thoughts on this approach of the Essential Medicines Strategic 
Stockpile Act that, as I say, would give the private sector the 
opportunity to work with the Federal Government so that we can 
stockpile generic drugs that we know could be at a risk of 
shortage.
    Ms.  O'Connell. So as the facilitator, of course, of the 
Strategic National Stockpile, we would be pleased to engage in 
a technical assistance process as you are thinking about this 
legislation, some things that have worked, some things that 
haven't worked, if there is any benefit to--you know, to doing 
it as you propose.
    You know, one of the things that we are approaching, just 
so you know, is making sure the supply chain is strong but that 
the stockpile is the backstop for that. So we are looking at a 
continuum across both and would be really happy to engage with 
you on that.
    Mr.  Carter. Well, and I hope that we will be able to work 
with you, and I hope that we can have your commitment that you 
will work with us, and--because it is something we need to 
address and something--we certainly feel like this is a good 
approach to it.
    We also have another piece of legislation that deals with 
State stockpiles. And please understand that this is not to 
replace the national stockpiles. But instead, it is to 
complement it. And this is--this would be a pilot program. And 
in fact, there were some--some of the provisions of this were 
actually passed in the recent legislation and the recent 
omnibus. And I wanted to ask you, do you know, Ms. O'Connell, 
if any of this is working or not?
    Ms.  O'Connell. So thank you for that provision in the 
PREVENT bill, and we are aware of that. No additional funding 
came with that, but we continue to provide that technical 
assistance to States.
    And it is interesting, you know, as States undertake this, 
there is a challenge on what you keep in, what you move out, 
how often you replace, how much you need. And we are very happy 
to work with them to give advice on how we face these complex 
problems, as well.
    Mr.  Carter. Good, thank you.
    Dr. Califf, I wanted to ask you, because I am reading a 
book now, ``China Rx,'' and it talks about the API and how we 
really--the labeling process by which the FDA requires the 
manufacturers to label this, can you explain that to me? 
Because in the way the book describes it, it is kind of 
haphazard.
    Dr.  Califf. Well, that--I would hate to describe it as 
totally haphazard; maybe kind of haphazard in Southern talk.
    Mr.  Carter. Kind of. Yes, well----
    [Laughter.]
    Dr.  Califf. It would be a good description.
    Mr.  Carter. We do like Southern talk around here.
    [Laughter.]
    Dr.  Califf. So you talk of it--you think of it as a bulk 
substance, which then is made into a pill. There is no tracking 
mechanism right now required that we know where that bulk 
substance comes from and where it goes as it gets into the 
final pill which is then distributed in the U.S. and to the 
public.
    So as your colleague pointed out on the other side--and 
thank you for working on this together, I think it is really a 
good thing--that means that we can't keep track of how 
dependent we actually are. We know we are very dependent right 
now. And I would point out there is a report from FDA in 2019 
that lays this out in great detail. And I think, because the 
pandemic hit shortly after, it sort of--everyone was swept up 
in dealing with it.
    But having--just think of it as chain of custody. Like many 
other things we do in life, we start with the bulk substance. 
There should be line of sight into the entire chain of custody.
    And I would stress again it is commercial confidential 
information. We do a pretty good job at FDA at keeping 
commercial confidential information. But if we have to 
reconstruct it, much like Dr. Walensky was saying, for public 
health when there is a crisis, it takes forever. We need to be 
able to look when it is needed to preempt these problems.
    Mr.  Carter. Great. Well, I am out of time, but I do want 
to talk further about this and see how we can assist you in 
getting to that common goal.
    Dr.  Califf. I look forward to it. I can't resist saying we 
are almost in seersucker time here again.
    Mr.  Carter. We are, almost, and I got mine ready.
    Dr.  Califf. I look forward to meeting with you then.
    Mr.  Carter. Thank you.
    Ms.  Eshoo. OK.
    Mr.  Guthrie. The gentleman yields back.
    Ms.  Eshoo. That is enough of Southern talk.
    Mr.  Guthrie. I recognize Dr. Schrier for her 5 minutes.
    Ms.  Schrier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for all 
being here today. I just want to start first by saying we 
worked a lot, all of us, during the pandemic. And there were 
frustrations along the way, and lots of challenges. I want to 
thank you for working with me. And, you know, in retrospect, we 
really did do, and thanks to you, a pretty remarkable job in 
dealing with a crisis amid a lot of public pushback and 
misinformation that made whatever we provided, whether that was 
masks or tests, a challenge in the real world.
    I would love to talk with you today about lessons learned, 
and I would like to start with Assistant Secretary O'Connell.
    We have talked many times before, and, you know I am a 
pediatrician, so I am focused on children. And I appreciated 
your answer to Mr. Cardenas. I also wanted to make sure that in 
future disasters children are a first thought and not an 
afterthought. They are not just little adults. And part of that 
is making sure that we have healthcare providers who are 
available and ready to surge.
    We already have a threatened shortage of pediatricians, and 
I am not going to ask you a question about how to increase the 
pipeline for pediatricians. That is a bigger scope. But I am 
going to ask you, you know, how can we ensure that there is 
surge capacity to make sure that in an emergency we have the 
workforce needed to address children's needs?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Congresswoman, thank you so much for that 
question. That is a concern of ours, you know, making sure that 
the special populations--the children, the seniors, those with 
disabilities--are accounted for in all of our plans moving 
forward, that their care is taken care of and provided in an 
appropriate way.
    So we have the National Disaster Medical System, which are, 
you know, teams of clinicians that go out and decompress 
hospitals when they are overwhelmed. And we keep pediatricians 
and pediatric nurses on those teams. And when we need to, we 
will go into a NICU or a PICU to make sure that, if those 
hospitals are overwhelmed like we saw with RSV and flu this 
winter, that there is a team that can come in and help those 
care providers on the scenes by adding additional surge 
capacity, as you suggest--really important that we don't lose 
sight of how important that care is in these times.
    Ms.  Schrier. And I would even suggest, as a community 
pediatrician, like, really even more assertive outreach so that 
people understand that this system exists. And, you know, all 
pediatric hospitals were strained at the same time, so it is 
very hard to do without pulling people from outside the 
hospitals to get them to work in the hospitals. And I am happy 
to work with you on that.
    I had another question. This one is about the Strategic 
National Stockpile and making sure that we have enough in order 
to meet children's needs. This came up when we were even facing 
a formula shortage and thinking, ``Oh, gosh, you know, this is 
kind of like a medicine, kind of like food. We should have this 
in the stockpile.'' And so I was just wondering if, you know, 
what are you doing to make sure that there's appropriately 
sized masks and appropriately sized intubation kits, formula, 
other needs, dosing guides for children?
    Ms.  O'Connell. So, whenever possible, the stockpile 
procures the things that children can use in times of 
emergency. So that is really important. And when that is not 
possible, they work very closely with subject matter experts 
and specialists to figure out how to repurpose what they do 
have in ways that children will be taken care of. But whenever 
possible, they look to procure things that the children can 
use.
    Ms.  Schrier. Thank you. It is--this was a disease that 
mostly hit adults, and we were lucky this time, but we don't 
know what the next one will bring.
    I am not sure where my time is because I think that clock 
is wrong. But Dr. Califf, I am going to just go to you until 
you cut me off. I wanted to ask you about--well, first, thank 
you for your work with me on tests.
    I read in your in your statement, your testimony, about 
drug shortages, what we are doing to prevent them, how to have 
an early warning system. So I just perused this morning the 
list of shortages of medications. And with the eye of a 
pediatrician, I noticed albuterol solutions on there, 
lidocaine, epinephrine, amoxicillin, these--saline.
    These are a really big deal for kids. And so I am wondering 
if you have started to make any of the changes to address these 
shortages. Like, how is it working in this transition period to 
make sure we don't get in and stay in this situation?
    Dr.  Califf. I have described it as plugging the holes in 
the dike. And we have gotten better and better at that, because 
if you look at the number of impending shortages, it is going 
like that. We are up in the multiple hundreds, whereas the 
number of actual shortages is staying at around 40 or so per 
year. But that is too many. And these impending shortages do 
create stresses, as you know, in practices and the hospitals.
    So we have got to fix the fundamental underlying issues, 
which I know is the subject of another hearing that was going 
on this morning. Most of that, we believe, is not in the 
purview of the FDA. It has to do with the economics, 
particularly of sterile, injectable medications and issues like 
antibiotics, where--I don't know about you, even in a not-for-
profit pediatric practice, if I said I have got a great deal 
for you, you can see all the patients in the world and you are 
going to lose money on every patient you see, I just don't 
think that that is something that people are going to sign up 
for very easily.
    Ms.  Schrier. Yes, we do need to address----
    Dr.  Califf. So we have got to----
    Ms.  Schrier [continuing]. The economics, for sure.
    Dr.  Califf. Yes.
    Ms.  Schrier. Although the economics are pretty darn good 
for ADHD medications, and we are even in shortages of those.
    Dr.  Califf. Well, if I may, I think that is a different 
issue that is very complicated because of the role of the DEA. 
And as much as I am in favor of telehealth and very excited 
about continuing it, there has been a misuse of telehealth by 
companies giving bonuses for the number of prescriptions 
written. So I think the Adderall situation is a very different, 
complex set of issues. I am happy to discuss----
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentlelady's time has expired.
    Ms.  Schrier. I agree, thank you.
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentlelady yields back. I yield to Dr. 
Dunn for his 5 minutes.
    Mr.  Dunn. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate 
the opportunity to begin the discussion surrounding the 
reauthorization of the Pandemic Preparedness Act.
    When I came to Congress, I had no idea how many disasters 
we would be dealing with: hurricanes, war in Europe, and a 
global pandemic. You know, I appreciate the opportunity to make 
improvements in this preparedness.
    We got many things right with the COVID-19 pandemic, but we 
got some things wrong too. Operation Warp Speed was a success. 
Failures included the unnecessary shutdown of society, much to 
the detriment of our children, and inconsistent messaging from 
our public health agencies who thereby lost the trust of the 
American people.
    In Florida our Governor questioned the Federal authorities 
when appropriate. He followed the science and did what he 
thought was best for the health and well-being of Florida.
    One of the biggest failures of the pandemic was the general 
lack of attention paid to possible therapeutics, both new and 
old, off the shelf.
    Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, my staff 
and I were inundated with offers to help the Nation's response, 
and it was actually inspiring to see the innovation of the 
American people. It included everything from PPE manufactures, 
new drugs, old drugs, well known, anything could be repurposed. 
I was encouraged when we set up BARDA's Tech Watch, which I 
understood was supposed to field and vet all these offers.
    Unfortunately, it seemed the Government was only interested 
in a certain narrow range of vaccines, monoclonals, and new 
pharmaceuticals. So I--we often heard from stakeholders that 
BARDA had told them after meetings that some product didn't 
meet what they were looking for, although it seemed very 
successful and useful. You know, the COVID-19 pandemic was 
evolving and different needs at different times.
    Secretary O'Connell, can you speak to how BARDA Tech 
prioritizes the research and development of medical 
countermeasures, including vaccines? Whatever you got on your 
fingertips: vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, or devices.
    Ms.  O'Connell. Thank you, Congressman, and thank you for 
that question and for your interest in BARDA's Tech Watch 
program.
    They open up their doors to those that are looking at 
innovative solutions to any number of problems that we have, 
and offer these meetings that can be 30 minutes to an hour to 
go through the technology that the meeting holder is seeking to 
put forward. And--but it is market research that is done. You 
know, it is understanding what is out there, figuring out what 
the needs are.
    And then there is another system that BARDA has for 
actually applying for funding. So there's two different ones 
that is in their BARDA broad agency announcements.
    But regardless, if your constituents are having trouble 
accessing BARDA, please let me know. Please work with my--have 
my staff work with your staff, and I would like to make sure 
that you don't have that problem moving forward, or anybody 
doesn't have that problem moving forward.
    Mr.  Dunn. I appreciate that. We certainly spoke to then-
Secretary--or Assistant Secretary at the time.
    In thinking about this, Secretary O'Connell, if you think 
about future pandemics--you mentioned the importance of the 
seven viral families that are most likely to cause a pandemic, 
and the need to develop medical countermeasures to defend 
against these threats.
    What is being done, you know, to help BARDA sort of think 
outside the box when it comes to advanced R&D on these threats?
    And specifically, you know, what responsibilities, not 
just--in general, not just specific treatments.
    Ms.  O'Connell. So it does worry me, the seven viral 
families, you know, we had this head start with COVID because 
we had done the work on coronaviruses because of MERS and SARS. 
And now we know the seven viral families most likely to cause 
the next pandemic, and we have asked for funding both in fiscal 
year 2023 and now fiscal year 2024 to be able to jump start the 
development of the prototype vaccines, therapeutics, and 
diagnostics so we can put them on the shelf and pull them down 
when that viral family hits, should it hit, and be able to ramp 
up manufacturing very quickly.
    So it is part of that preparedness, making sure we have got 
a library of prototypes available. And in that process we are 
looking at a lot of different innovations, and appreciate that 
question. Among them, you know, right now we do vaccines 
through a needle in a syringe. We are also looking at what it 
would mean to do a patch with a microneedle, so it is easier 
to----
    Mr.  Dunn. So, if I may, I am concerned there is--of 
course, the public is all fascinated with vaccines. But, you 
know, traditionally the response to an epidemic or pandemic is 
therapeutics, not vaccines. I mean, medicines, if you will. 
And, you know, we seem to have fastened on the vaccines almost 
to the exclusion of other options.
    I know we did--Remdesivir didn't work. I know we did--
monoclonals are always going to be very, very, very specific 
and expensive, you know, so, I mean, we could think of, you 
know, therapeutics in terms of small molecules, like we do 
antibiotics.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, my time has expired. I yield back.
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize 
Mrs. Trahan for her 5 minutes.
    Mrs.  Trahan. Well, thank you to the witnesses today, and 
thank you to the Chairs and ranking members for holding this 
important hearing.
    We have a unique opportunity to take the lessons learned 
over the past few years in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic 
to use them to legislate in a way that better prepares our 
health system to respond to future unknown public health 
threats.
    Two years ago my colleague across the aisle on the full 
committee, Mr. Balderson, and I cofounded the bipartisan 
Pandemic Preparedness Caucus. Now, alongside our cochairs, 
including another member of this subcommittee, Mrs. Miller-
Meeks, we are coordinating closely with committee members to 
reauthorize PAHPA. I encourage all the members of the 
subcommittee to join the caucus and help support policies we 
want to see in the reauthorization of this critical law.
    It is no secret that a major issue during the pandemic was 
the lack of visibility into the exact quantities of critical 
medical equipment, supplies, and drugs that were on U.S. soil 
at any given time. As a result, there was a surplus of products 
in many parts of the Nation while hard-hit communities were 
operating in crisis mode.
    As we relied on community organizations like Community 
Health Centers to respond to the pandemic, the lack of clarity 
into PPE and other supplies was an extreme challenge that 
hindered provider ability to deliver and inform care. So, 
Assistant Secretary O'Connell, what were some of the challenges 
the Nation faced due to the lack of clarity into the supply 
chain?
    And how would our future response efforts improve if we 
established an automated data collection infrastructure that 
enables real-time, accessible data that expands the visibility 
into the entire supply chain?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Congresswoman, thank you so much for that 
question. It is exactly one of the problems that we witnessed 
in March 2020, when everybody needed the exact same thing at 
the exact same time, and it was manufactured somewhere else.
    So improving on that has been one of the priorities that we 
have had, and using the COVID dollars that you all have given 
us over the course of the supplementals, we have continued to 
invest in domestic manufacturing to bring some of that 
manufacturing home. That gives us line of sight into what we 
have. When it is manufactured here it is easier for us to tell 
what we have and what we don't have.
    We also know it was a problem that States and local 
governments didn't know how to access the Strategic National 
Stockpile. Now, the Strategic National Stockpile didn't have 
all the things we needed at that time, but that was--would have 
been an important thing for States to understand and to know. 
And so we have done a lot of education and a lot of outreach to 
States and local governments to make sure they understand what 
is in it, and how often they can access it, and under what 
circumstances.
    We--as part of the PREVENT bill that came through, the 
omnibus, we released a 60-day guidance for States and locals on 
how they would access the Strategic National Stockpile.
    The SNS is also doing Tribal consults to make sure that 
those governments understand how to access what they need in 
the stockpile. So we are trying to do an education in places 
where we know people didn't have clear visibility.
    Mrs.  Trahan. That is helpful. You know, I had a Lessons 
Learned Pandemic Preparedness roundtable recently in my 
district, and one thing I heard from those participants is 
their, you know, frustration with the lack of coordination 
between, you know, Federal, State, and local governments.
    And you brought up what we were doing in the way of 
awareness and education. And certainly, we want to figure out 
what that means to us as we legislate. So are there ways that 
we can leverage, you know, State response capacity to improve 
our initial emergency response?
    And has ASPR--you know, I think you are thinking through 
forward-deploying with guardrails some SNS supplies to States 
during nonemergency times so that they are in a better position 
to quickly respond to future emergencies. And is there--and I 
am just wondering, beyond what you are doing at ASPR, how 
should we be thinking about legislating that?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Well, I think one of the most important 
things that we are very aware of--and I know you are, as well--
is that that--you know, these outbreaks start locally. And so 
to have real clear communication between the local governments, 
the State governments, and the Federal Government is really 
important for them to know what we are doing, for us to know 
what they are doing, for them to know what we are not able to 
do, and what they should be doing. All of that is critical in 
those early days.
    And one of the things that we continue to do where we do 
our outreach calls, make sure that we are coordinated with our 
State health officials and others. I know CDC is actively 
engaged in those communications, as well. We can't have 
daylight between us. We are in this together.
    Mrs.  Trahan. Yes. Well, I appreciate that. I just glanced 
up at the clock, and I am sorry you saw my eyes move.
    I don't have any more time to ask, Dr. Walensky, my 
question that I had for you, but I will say that you will be 
missed, although we won't miss you up in Boston. We look 
forward to having you back. Thanks.
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize 
Dr. Joyce for his 5 minutes.
    Mr.  Joyce. Thank you for yielding, Mr. Chairman, and thank 
you for the panel for appearing today.
    Dr. Califf, just a few moments ago you mentioned about 
shortages, and shortages that occurred during the pandemic. I 
know that you and your colleagues are aware of another 
potential shortage, because the FDA has raised concerns with 
the EPA about the risks of sterile medical device shortages 
from their proposals to limit the use of ethylene oxide.
    I am concerned that the EPA's rules would limit our 
domestic sterilization capacity for critical medical and 
surgical products. I raised these issues with EPA Administrator 
Regan at yesterday's hearing, and he committed to brief the 
Energy and Commerce Committee and our staff alongside the FDA 
to discuss these issues and take steps to ensure that any final 
rules don't adversely impact physicians' and patients' access 
to sterile equipment and treatments.
    Dr. Califf, would you commit to appearing at a joint 
briefing for the committee alongside with the EPA Administrator 
before May 24th to address this important issue?
    Dr.  Califf. As we discussed earlier with Dr. Bucshon, this 
is a great concern to us. EPA is in the lead, and there is an 
interagency process. So we will certainly work with EPA and you 
to get these issues resolved.
    Mr.  Joyce. Thank you. I appreciate that commitment.
    Assistant Secretary O'Connell, the administration has 
requested another 5 billion for their project, NextGen, for 
COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. As a physician myself, this 
cost and the administration's COVID-19 vaccine and drug 
development track record is not that good.
    At the time President Biden chose to dismantle Operation 
Warp Speed, the country had three approved vaccines across two 
different vaccine platforms, with a fourth vaccine using a 
third platform going through approval. And despite 
unprecedented levels of funding because of decisions by the 
Biden administration, unfortunately we only have two vaccines, 
and both of them using the new mRNA platform.
    Therapeutics tell a similar and similarly disappointing 
story. The Biden administration's major therapeutic development 
programs, the NIAID-led Antiviral Program for Pandemics and the 
joint NIAID-BARDA Antiviral Drug Discovery Centers for 
Pathogens have yet to produce a single therapeutic, despite 
spending 3 billion of taxpayer money and promises in June of 
2021 of new treatments by year's end. Paxlovid and Lagevrio are 
both developmental programs, but they are the only two that 
remain for COVID-19 therapeutics. We currently have no 
effective monoclonal antibodies.
    Secretary O'Connell, can you provide us with an update of 
what promising COVID treatments we can expect to have coming 
out in the programs in the next 6 months?
    Ms.  O'Connell. Congressman, thank you so much. So the next 
generation of COVID vaccines and therapeutics are critical to 
keeping the American public safe. You know, we know that we are 
one or two mutations away from what have been effective 
vaccines and antivirals from no longer being effective. So it 
is really important that we continue to seek out this research 
and development and--against a virus that has been nothing, if 
not unpredictable.
    One of the things that this program is going to focus on is 
trying to find a monoclonal that is not--that is resistant to 
any of the variants, that--one of the things that has impacted 
the monoclonals that we have had are the various variants and 
subvariants that have come out and rendered them ineffective. 
So finding one that does not--that is not impacted by the 
variants is going to be critical. So that is one of the places 
where this program is going to focus.
    We do need to have a range of therapeutics available. We 
are lucky that we have the antivirals right now. But again, we 
know that this virus has been nothing if not unpredictable, and 
really important that we stay ahead of it.
    Mr.  Joyce. The first awards were made a year ago, and as 
best as I can tell the program hasn't generated a single 
additional approved therapeutic. Can you please keep us 
apprised as these developments occur? Because it is necessary 
that we have all applicable, approved therapeutics available, 
and I think that you have the resources to provide us with that 
information. So I would appreciate being informed as this 
continues to evolve.
    Director Walensky, communication with public about 
infectious disease events, particularly during public health 
emergencies such as COVID-19, is crucial to a successful 
response. You have publicly stated this, and I agree with you 
on that. For many of my constituents, public trust in the CDC 
has been decimated due to the guidance and public statements 
that have been made by the administration. They don't match the 
facts. And public data specifically regarding acquired immunity 
seems to be something that has not been adequately addressed.
    Can you please outline specifically efforts that the CDC 
has in the timeliness and accuracy of guidance and 
communications to the public, and how we can restore that faith 
in the CDC?
    Mr.  Bucshon. Can----
    Dr.  Walensky. Thank----
    Mr.  Bucshon. Dr. Walensky, his time is expired. Could you 
answer that in maybe a written form, or----
    Dr.  Walensky. I am happy to.
    Mr.  Bucshon [continuing]. Maybe as a followup on another 
Member's----
    Mr.  Joyce. Thank you. I would appreciate that.
    And again, thank you for presenting yourself to us here 
today.
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentleman yields. I recognize Mrs. 
Harshbarger for her 5 minutes.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me 
OK? These allergies, it is bad.
    Thank you for being here. Thank you for your service, Dr. 
Walensky. I enjoyed meeting you and talking with you down at 
the CDC when we came in April.
    My first question is, Dr. Califf, you know I have been a 
compounding pharmacist for 36 years, and compounded medications 
played an important role during the pandemic in meeting--
helping to meet these drug shortages, especially in 
distribution to hospitals and COVID patients, items like hand 
sanitizers, fentanyl for the ventilators, and I could go on and 
on where we had to step in and do that due to shortages.
    You know, I can look at the FDA website any given day and 
see hundreds of drug shortages like you talked about, and I 
have done that over the course of all those years I have been a 
pharmacist. Shouldn't the FDA have a regulatory framework in 
place for compounding pharmacies to help mitigate shortages, 
including shortages of drugs urgently needed by providers to 
administer in clinical settings?
    Dr.  Califf. Well, thanks for bringing that up. I actually 
was a compounding physician earlier in my career, when IV 
nitroglycerin on coronary care units was needed, so we ran a 
little compounding facility.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Well, we have that----
    Dr.  Califf. So I understand the issues very much.
    I think we feel like right now we have a lot of flexibility 
when there are--emergencies do occur, as happened here. But 
your idea of thinking about a permanent solution or guidance on 
that flexibility, I think, is a good thing to work on.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Well, I am here to help you, trust me, 
you know, because right now we have these policy guidances, and 
they are issued, basically, when you have a drug shortage.
    So does the FDA shortage list adequately capture regional 
shortages and shortages at the wholesale level?
    Dr.  Califf. Well, the term ``adequate'' is a bit 
subjective, but I would say it could be better because, I mean, 
particularly for rural areas----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Califf [continuing]. What we have learned with infant 
formula, for example, is we are above where we were before the 
recall, but there's still some rural areas that have shortages.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Oh, yes.
    Dr.  Califf. So understanding the total distribution system 
is difficult.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. I have--exactly. And we are here to help 
you with that, believe me.
    Would you consider recognizing the American Society of 
Health-System Pharmacists' shortage listing? It is even a more 
complete listing.
    Dr.  Califf. Well, I guess--what is the right political 
word? Everything is on the table.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Great, thank you.
    Dr.  Califf. We will consider----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. I appreciate that.
    Dr.  Califf. I can't commit to anything, of course, but----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. OK, no worries.
    Dr.  Califf [continuing]. We will talk.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. We will follow up.
    Why does the FDA issue guidance related to compounding of 
certain things like your ibuprofen products, but you haven't 
taken similar steps to increase the supply of other medications 
like acetaminophen?
    And you mentioned that you are compiling a list of critical 
medications, a global list. And I hope to goodness you have 
antibiotic therapies on there as well as chemotherapy drugs. 
And, I mean, I could probably make the list myself, but----
    Dr.  Califf. You know, I once--I was involved in trying to 
recruit Dr. Walensky to come to Duke to head up our infectious 
disease division.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Well----
    Dr.  Califf. Ever since then----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. She is going to be available, she says.
    [Laughter.]
    Dr.  Califf. It seems like every time she talks, she 
reminds me of the antibiotic issue. And we are well aware it 
is----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. There you go. It is a huge----
    Dr.  Califf. It is a very special problem. We--I mean, on a 
serious note, antibiotic resistance and the need to have 
antibiotics in reserve----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Oh, totally.
    Dr.  Califf [continuing]. Is a really serious issue.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Well, that brings me to this: What about 
a priority on friendshoring with allied nations?
    You mentioned that the database in Israel--how complete the 
healthcare database was, and we know that--for its citizens. 
Why not create a new staging ground for manufacturing with 
Israel and the Abraham Accord countries, are you open to that?
    Dr.  Califf. I am open to----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. You are open.
    Dr.  Califf. Like I say, everything on the table----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Everything is on the table.
    Dr.  Califf. Remember, my career was largely spent doing 
international global clinical trials.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Califf. And I feel like I have a deep knowledge of 
what happens in multiple countries. There is a lot to trust.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Califf. There is a real opportunity in working----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. A lot of innovation.
    Dr.  Califf [continuing]. With people. But, just like with 
compounding pharmacies, there are things that can go wrong.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Well----
    Dr.  Califf. So we do need----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger [continuing]. That is just the world----
    Dr.  Califf. We do need regulations and----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger [continuing]. That we live in.
    Dr.  Califf [continuing]. And checks in the system.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes. Thank you, sir. Yes.
    Ms. O'Connell, you know we are looking at things to ensure 
American taxpayer dollars are not--are spent not only to 
prepare for potential disasters but also prioritize and support 
domestic production. And, you know, we need to look at tax and 
trade policies to promote that. It is kind of like--what did we 
just have? We had an amoxicillin shortage. I have the only 
plant in the country that makes amoxicillin, and it is in my 
district. But do you know what? They don't have a Government 
contract, and they ship their--their first line was shipped to 
another country.
    So there's things that we need to look at, and things that 
I may be able to help you with that--where we could--even 
repurposing drugs, Dr. Neal and I talked to a geneticist. We 
have 7,500 drugs we can repurpose with the DoD just for such an 
emergency as the next pandemic. There's a lot--I have got a lot 
of ideas, just ask me.
    And I know I am out of time.
    Mr.  Bucshon. Yes, the gentlelady is out, time has expired.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. OK. I will get with you later. Thank 
you.
    I yield back----
    Dr.  Califf. Could I give one quick anecdote?
    Mr.  Bucshon. Yes.
    Dr.  Califf. I worked in that plant that you are talking 
about 30 years ago, when it was SmithKline. So----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Califf. And I talked with the CEO multiple times this 
year, so we will talk.
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentlelady yields back.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms.  Eshoo. You got a lot of talking to do.
    Mr.  Bucshon. I recommend--I now recognize Dr. Miller-Meeks 
for her 5 minutes.
    Mrs.  Miller-Meeks. OK. I don't know how to follow that, 
but thank you, Mr. Chair, thank you to our panelists for being 
here.
    Dr. Walensky, let me just echo my colleagues in thanking 
you for your service. Having been the former director of a--
just a mere State department of public health, I think the 
challenge in coming in to an agency such as the CDC at the 
height of a pandemic is extraordinarily difficult, and I 
appreciate your service. That doesn't mean I am going to be 
easy or not going to have some concerns and questions.
    And first and foremost, since I heard the mention of 
infection-acquired immunity, I just wanted to have entered into 
the record a letter from the Doctors Caucus to the CDC 
September 28th, 2021, asking for clarification on infection-
acquired immunity.
    And the reason the issue is important is that we are 
talking about capacity, surge capacity, allocation of 
resources. And when our agencies are not nimble enough to look 
at the science and the research, dissect through that research, 
and put forward reasonable proposals and recommendations, then 
we misallocate resources, both personnel, workforce, as well as 
vaccines or other supplies, especially when they are things 
that are extraordinarily expensive.
    And we have talked about having a surge capacity, and that 
is not only a workforce surge capacity, that is a testing 
capacity, as well. And that goes into reagents, swabs, all of 
the things which we found that we were lacking at the top of 
this pandemic. And it also is how you allocate the people at 
your disposal and those who are not under your agencies, which 
means how do we utilize our research laboratories? How do we 
utilize our public-private partnerships to have them as part of 
our surge mechanism? And if those are not in part of our 
pandemic plan, then Congress will direct you, because there's 
plenty of us here that have ideas on both Strategic National 
Stockpile and workforce issues.
    One of the things that I think Dr. Bucshon had mentioned 
earlier was talking about H.R. 550 and data, and data 
collection. And so, Dr. Walensky, the CDC continues to engage 
Congress and push for increased data authority, which has--it 
has been a key part of your testimony today. And you also say 
that the data authority will enable information to travel more 
seamlessly to those who need it, eliminating duplication, 
making data sharing less complex.
    The duplicative comment is interesting, because the CDC 
currently operates over 100 public health surveillance--and you 
might have addressed this earlier--surveillance systems that 
collect ongoing data from more than 3,000 State, local, 
territorial, and Tribal partners. And this would appear to 
cause some major reporting burdens, duplication of efforts, 
discrepancies among the data elements, and the need to use 
multiple IT systems, which may also lead to increased costs as 
well as some difficulty in communication.
    It would seem to me that the CDC needs to address its data 
systems in house before requesting even more mandated data 
authority. Do you agree with this or not agree with this?
    Dr.  Walensky. Maybe two points. First I just want to 
address the letter that you had sent to us in September of 2021 
on infection-induced immunity and note that we had our first 
scientific brief that was posted in October 2021 outlining the 
totality of the science as we were aware of just a month later. 
So that was something that has been key on our mind.
    Mrs.  Miller-Meeks. Change recommendations.
    Dr.  Walensky. That was--we can have another--I mean, I am 
happy to chat about that. And we have, actually.
    You know, I do want to talk about the data, because one of 
the things that we are--and we are working to actually 
streamline the data that comes into us to make it easier. I can 
give you an example out of Oregon Health Information Systems, 
where their streamlining in their data modernization saved them 
145,000 person-hours over just 11 months because they were not 
doing manual data entry. That is the goal that we are actually 
working towards, not only distributed across the States, but 
within the CDC.
    While we are doing that, as we are building those highways 
and streamlining those, decreasing those person-hours so 
everything is more automated, we will have those highways, but 
they will be free of data if we don't also have the authorities 
to get that collection in.
    Mrs.  Miller-Meeks. And then I only have a little bit more 
time. So when we went into our legislative pause as I was a 
State senator, one of the things I had suggested was, having 
been in the military, to set up a reserve force. And so I think 
that we are trying to have that same concept within the CDC. 
And I am wondering if you can address the U.S. Public Health 
Service Commissioned Corps and how were they utilized.
    So my understanding is that, at the height of the COVID-19 
pandemic, that only half of the officers were actually 
deployed. So were these officers at the CDC? Were they at 
regional offices? And why were so few deployed in the actual 
surveillance mechanisms and vaccination efforts? If you could, 
address that quickly. Thank you.
    Dr.  Walensky. Thank you for that question. I would be--
first I would love to thank you all in Congress and--for our 
ability to actually execute on the Public Health Service 
AmeriCorps, because that is among the things that we are 
looking to hire 3,000 reserve public health workers for exactly 
that reason.
    You talk about the Commissioned Corps, and I am happy to 
come back to you with some definitive data on that, except to 
say that many of those Commissioned Corps within CDC and were 
deployed within CDC. So I don't know that they would have 
actually counted as deployment. They were deployed to a 
response, but they were--might have been working in our center 
on, I don't know, meningitis, but they were, you know, deployed 
to the COVID-19 response, and that might not have been tallied 
in your numbers. Thank you.
    Mrs.  Miller-Meeks. If you could give us in writing some 
more clarification on that, that would be appreciated.
    Dr.  Walensky. I am happy to.
    Mrs.  Miller-Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I yield back my--
--
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentlelady yields back. I now recognize 
Mr. Griffith for 5 minutes.
    Mr.  Griffith. I thank the gentleman.
    Dr. Califf, in 2020 the CARES Act gave FDA enhanced data 
collection to help mitigate drug shortages. In your response to 
our March 27th, 2023, letter on drug shortages, you claimed 
only 44 percent of registered facilities have complied. Is that 
correct?
    Dr.  Califf. That was true at the time, but it is gradually 
getting better.
    Mr.  Griffith. Have you--has the FDA enforced any actions 
against the noncompliant facilities?
    Dr.  Califf. I will have to get back with you on that. I am 
not aware of any particular actions or exactly what the actions 
would need to be, other than reminding them of their 
responsibilities.
    Mr.  Griffith. Yes, we--and I would love for you to get 
back with me on that and send me a written response. I would 
appreciate that.
    We heard in the drug shortage hearing that was happening 
downstairs earlier today that the economic pressures are a big 
factor in causing shortages, particularly in the generic field. 
This has led to one in four generic medications being filled in 
the U.S. The companies--one in four--have received FDA warning 
letters.
    Do you agree that there are economic factors at play that 
we must address, such as group purchasing organizations, if we 
are going to be able to have a better supply chain for our 
generic medications?
    Dr.  Califf. It sounds like the hearing downstairs is 
getting to the core of the issue. There are economic--like I 
was saying before, if I offered you the chance to produce a 
drug and guaranteed you would lose money on every pill you 
made, it is unlikely you would go into that business. And you 
might also skimp on your quality systems and manufacturing, 
which then leads, when we do inspections, to find problems.
    So we have got to fix the core economics if we are going to 
get the situation fixed. We can plug the holes with the things 
that we have talked about, with better data and talking to the 
companies to make up for problems when they occur, but we need 
to prevent them.
    Mr.  Griffith. Well, one of the things that we got into 
downstairs--and you never have enough time to get into 
everything when you only get 5 minutes of questions, but one of 
the things we got into was the fact that we are heavily reliant 
on China and heavily reliant on India for the API to make the 
medications in the United States. Most of it is coming from 
Asia.
    And part of the concern was that we do such a job on 
inspecting American manufacturers and holding them to a high 
level, but then we don't do inspections overseas. And so not 
only is it cheaper from a labor standpoint, but it is also--you 
are not likely to have as many inspections from the FDA at your 
overseas locations. Doesn't that force our manufacturing 
offshore and make it more difficult for us to supply medicines 
for Americans?
    Dr.  Califf. I have had the privilege and experience of 
working in both China and India in my private and academic 
life. We inspect in India and hold India to the same standards 
as we do the U.S. We have had a problem in China the last 
several years, as you well know. And during the pandemic it was 
also difficult to get to India during times of surges.
    But in general, we are holding India to the same standard. 
And as we are allowed back into China, we will do the same 
thing there.
    Mr.  Griffith. Well, but should we be allowed back into 
China, and will they let us back into China? I mean, one, I 
don't know that we want to be dependent on China. Two, under 
their interpretation of their laws, your inspections may now be 
a crime in China. So why do we continue to think that that is 
our answer?
    Dr.  Califf. I certainly don't think that is our answer. I 
have started--helped start a university in China. I know a lot 
about Chinese laws and customs.
    I will point out two-thirds of the world's population lives 
between India and China and the ASEAN nations in between. So 
they need to have their own API manufacturing, all that.
    Mr.  Griffith. I am not against them having their own, I--
--
    Dr.  Califf [continuing]. But we need----
    Mr.  Griffith [continuing]. Just don't want them strangling 
ours.
    Dr.  Califf. We need a balanced system where we do our part 
in the U.S.
    But again, I will just say no American businessman is going 
to go into a business where the economics say you are going to 
lose money. And so we have got to fix the fundamental 
economics.
    And if you tell me we shouldn't inspect to make sure of the 
quality----
    Mr.  Griffith. No, no, no, no----
    Dr.  Califf [continuing]. I would say no, please, let's 
don't do that.
    Mr.  Griffith. No. And in fact, one of the concerns that I 
raised downstairs--and that I think you would agree with--is 
that this race to the bottom on pricing has affected the 
quality and the assurance that we will actually have the 
medicine available for the American consumer when they get 
sick.
    We had a mom down there testifying that her daughter was 
going through some leukemia treatment, and on three different 
occasions during her treatment they did not have the medicine. 
They did not have the medicine. And while her daughter has 
survived, she mentioned cases that she knows of--because she 
started a nonprofit group to help people find the medicine--
where doctors have told her that it impacted the health of the 
patient or even led to death. This is unacceptable. Don't you 
agree?
    Dr.  Califf. This tears us up at the FDA, and we are 
frequently caught with these manufacturing issues, but it is an 
essential medicine.
    And you are referring to cis-platinum, which is a drug that 
we gave as interns decades ago. I won't say how many decades 
for you, but it was four decades for me. It should be 
available. But for all the reasons that you gave, we are seeing 
lapses due to the economics.
    Mr.  Griffith. All right. I yield back. We will work 
together to fix it.
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize 
Mr. Crenshaw for 5 minutes.
    Mr.  Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for 
being here. I really want to focus on our ability to detect 
diseases, to do surveillance on diseases domestically and 
globally. You know, it is concerning.
    And I will submit this GAO report for the record that, you 
know, 15 years after we have passed a law that instructs HHS to 
have these surveillance systems in place, they are really not 
implemented, not even close.
    This comes on the heels of the end of Title 42 this week. 
You know, recently, New York City health commissioner issued a 
public letter to New York healthcare providers urging them to 
take precautions and conduct additional tests to prevent an 
alarming trend of diseases spreading among illegal foreign 
nationals arriving from the southern border. I am submitting 
that for the record, as well. This letter warns against polio, 
chickenpox, tuberculosis, et cetera. How are we addressing 
this?
    You know, one of the problems is I am not even sure who I 
should ask, because this is the problem that is brought up in 
the GAO report. Is it CDC, or is it Ms. O'Connell?
    Like, I--this is a problem here, where no one seems to be 
in charge of the detection and surveillance of diseases coming 
into our country. So whoever answers is fine, but what are we 
doing specifically about Title 42 being ended, where is the CDC 
on this?
    Dr.  Walensky. Maybe I will start and say we have a--
numerous platforms of surveillance systems through our 
emergency departments, through our public health departments.
    One of the real challenges, as we have talked about this 
morning, has been that not all of those surveillance systems 
have required reporting to the CDC. So even if there is 
something detected locally that--we may not know it at the CDC, 
and we might not be able to actually then give that information 
back to the neighboring local health departments or across the 
country to say, ``Red flag, we see something out there, you all 
should be on the lookout for it.''
    With regard to Title 42, among the things that we have done 
and put out as we have seen infectious threats come in is our 
health alert networks. We have done so when there is a measles 
outbreak and other things. And likely what happened in New York 
is similar health alert networks to recognize we may have 
undervaccinated people who are settling in communities, and we 
need to watch out for infectious threats----
    Mr.  Crenshaw. I mean, are there----
    Dr.  Walensky [continuing]. Most clinicians haven't seen 
yet.
    Mr.  Crenshaw. I guess what I am getting at, you got tens 
of thousands of people, tens of thousands of people coming 
across the border. Do we have CDC personnel doing what I think 
any American would expect the Center for Disease Control to be 
doing, which is, I don't know, randomized testing, right? 
Randomized testing of wastewater, fecal matter, whatever it is. 
Do we have teams on the ground that do that kind of thing in 
order to detect--or are we completely reliant on the reporting 
that you get?
    Dr.  Walensky. I would--I am not sure I understand the 
question, partially because randomized testing of what, who, 
and where? There are a lot of----
    Mr.  Crenshaw. Well, in this case on the southern border, 
but----
    Dr.  Walensky [continuing]. Infectious and noninfectious 
threats, and wastewater, as you know--and we are really--I 
think is an incredibly promising new diagnostic capacity, but 
it is not for every infectious threat. And we don't know for 
every infectious threat whether, if, and how it is sensitive or 
specific in detecting it. If you don't see and--a pathogen in 
the wastewater, does that mean it is not there? Maybe not for 
many of these.
    Mr.  Crenshaw. But we definitely don't know----
    Dr.  Walensky. If you do detect it----
    Mr.  Crenshaw [continuing]. If we are not testing it. We 
definitely don't know.
    Dr.  Walensky. We don't necessarily even know what to test 
for, what fragments to test for. It doesn't come out in whole 
genome sequences.
    Mr.  Crenshaw. Maybe it is not--maybe that is not the 
answer, but it seems to me there is no plan.
    And again, I want to submit this for the record. So 15 
years later, the only thing that has been implemented by HHS is 
to adopt technical and reporting standards, and that is a theme 
that I always hear back from you all, is, well, you know, ``We 
have reporting standards, we have our partners on the ground, 
whether it is the local public health authorities, whatever it 
is, they report back. Sometimes they do, sometimes they 
don't.''
    Is the CDC just some academic institution, or is it an 
operational institution?
    Here is the one glaring issue that I see in this GAO 
report. Well, here is the problem: ``There is no lead 
operational division with defined roles and responsibilities 
for implementing these statutory requirements.''
    Who is in charge of this? Who is putting people on the 
ground, whether it is globally or whether it is at the southern 
border, where we actually have some kind of legitimate 
surveillance system on global pandemics or diseases?
    Dr.  Walensky. So we at CDC work in 60 countries to prevent 
and work towards global health security, both in surveillance 
and disease detection, as well as working towards medical 
countermeasures in those countries. We are working closely with 
DHS and, at their request, when they need help on public health 
in their--public health support in their entry--ports of entry.
    Mr.  Crenshaw. OK, but the--OK. So--but for Title 42 
ending, I didn't see anything in the administration's plan for 
CDC at all on the southern border. Is that correct, or is it--
--
    Dr.  Walensky. Well, we are working with DHS, per their 
request, for their public health requests.
    Mr.  Crenshaw. Doing what?
    Dr.  Walensky. You know, I think it depends on the request, 
and it depends on----
    Mr.  Crenshaw. They haven't requested anything yet.
    Dr.  Walensky. I would have to get back with you as to the 
nature of their request.
    Mr.  Crenshaw. I am sure----
    Dr.  Walensky. We have been working closely with them for 
the last 3 years.
    Mr.  Crenshaw. OK. I am out of time, I yield back.
    Mr.  Bucshon. Mr. Crenshaw, you have two documents you want 
to submit for the record?
    Mr.  Crenshaw. Correct.
    Mr.  Bucshon. Without objection, the documents Mr. 
Crenshaw--is being submitted to the record.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentleman yields back. I now recognize 
Ms. Castor for her 5 minutes.
    Ms.  Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all 
for being here to help the Energy and Commerce Committee update 
PAHPA. But mostly, thank you for all of your hard work during 
the public health emergency. All of your professional teams, we 
are grateful for all that you do to help keep Americans safe 
and healthy.
    We need to apply some of the lessons learned to the update 
of PAHPA, and I am sorry that my colleague from Florida already 
left, and--because he had said something like Florida was a 
shining example during the pandemic. And I wanted to remind him 
that our current surgeon general has been rebuked by medical 
professionals across the country for spreading COVID-19 
misinformation, implying that there were particular health 
impacts from taking the COVID-19 vaccine that were really 
debunked across the board.
    Plus, in Florida, unfortunately, out of the five largest 
States, we had the second-highest case rate. We had the second-
highest death rate.
    One of the problems over time, too, was the--at the State 
level, when some of the data became--when some of the cases, 
infection rates, became--they became--politicians became very 
sensitive to it, they started to hide the data. And the only 
places we could go would be to the hospital reporting and, 
unfortunately, to medical examiners. And that is, of course, a 
very late lagging indicator. So it has been apparent even 
before the COVID-19 pandemic that we have got to modernize data 
collection across the country. And I know that we have provided 
significant resources to do it.
    But it seems like what I am hearing at home is they are 
still frustrated with the outdated nature of reporting 
standardization. They want to be able to compare rural 
communities and urban communities. They want to be able to get 
into disparities.
    So, Dr. Walensky, you have probably been asked about this 
already today here, but what else did--does Congress need to do 
to provide CDC and our public health officials at home with 
modern reporting systems?
    Dr.  Walensky. I appreciate that question, and I appreciate 
your recognizing some of the challenges when there is 
motivation to not report. We don't get those data, and we can't 
have full line of sight.
    One of the things that we are actively working as part of 
our ``CDC Moving Forward''--and really, through this pandemic--
on data modernization across the United States, we have gotten, 
you know, over $750 million in order to do that. But that means 
local health departments may only get $10 million in order to 
modernize their data systems. I can tell you, in the hospitals 
that I used to work with to upgrade their healthcare systems to 
Epic, they required over $1 billion themselves.
    So as we think about $1 billion for the country and 
recognize that that is not going to go as far as we need to go 
in our data modernization efforts nationally, we are working 
really closely--just Tuesday I had a conversation with our 
State health officials. We have been working with our State and 
local epidemiologists, State and territorial epidemiologists to 
really understand what is the North Star architecture that we 
are putting together so that all of those data highways 
connect.
    The challenge is--and that work is ongoing, and we have 
made huge progress, and we have a public health data strategy 
that was just updated for the next 2 years for that 
interoperability--if we don't have authorities, those highways 
will be empty. Those data highways will be empty, and we will 
have challenges again. If there is a motivation to not report 
public health data to CDC, you will continue to be blind 
because we----
    Ms.  Castor. And it is so costly. I mean, this can be a way 
for taxpayers to save money down the road. I know there is an 
upfront investment, but there is a significant societal cost if 
we cannot detect disease and then stamp out pandemics before 
they spread.
    Dr.  Walensky. I will say it is costly both in terms of 
dollars, and in terms of sickness and morbidity and mortality.
    And the example that I previously gave was in the Mpox 
outbreak. The Mpox outbreak, we started to be able to get data 
authorities because of the public health emergency that was 
declared on August 4th. We had our peak number of cases in Mpox 
on August 1st. So we were already seeing downward trends in the 
number of cases before we could even start negotiating with a 
public health emergency to have data authorizations.
    Ms.  Castor. Well, thank you very much for your service, 
and you are going to be missed.
    Dr. Califf, we had a very good bipartisan hearing on drug 
shortages, and the witnesses all said that FDA is doing a 
decent job, but we still have these shortages. They highlighted 
the importance of building public-private partnerships, giving 
FDA additional ways to incentivize that behavior and the 
transparency of being able--in real time--again, this is a data 
modernization issue to be able to see what is really happening 
in real time and be able to respond.
    Dr.  Califf. It is nice to get a compliment. Sometimes we 
go days without that.
    [Laughter.]
    Dr.  Califf. So I really, really appreciate that.
    Mr.  Bucshon. The last witness--the last Member.
    Dr.  Califf. Well----
    Mr.  Bucshon [continuing]. Finally, right?
    [Laughter.]
    Dr.  Califf. Working on it. But I do want to make one point 
related to Dr. Walensky, because we share this, and it has come 
up earlier. She uses highways, I use spigots and faucets.
    She inherited a CDC system that I think everyone agrees had 
corrosive pipes and obstructions, and it just was not a modern 
system. I got an independent assessment from Micky Tripathi, 
who is the head of the Office of the National Coordinator for 
Health IT. They now have shiny pipes, but the spigots are not 
turned on because of this issue we have between States and 
counties and the Federal component. And we won't know how good 
the pipes are, really, until the data starts flowing through.
    I grew--I had a world where I was used to looking at 
geospatial--that is, you know, rural, urban, specific areas, 
and time. And if you want to run a public health system, there 
is nothing technically holding us back. It is all human 
interactions now. But Dr. Walensky's counterpart who comes in 
next, she will be able to say, ``Here is exactly where the 
problem is, and here is where it is going. We are going to 
deploy forces to that area in real time, not 3 months later, 
not 6 months later.''
    Ms.  Castor. Thank you.
    Mr.  Bucshon. The gentlelady yields back. This concludes 
the Member questioning, or panel one. I would like to thank all 
the witnesses for your testimony and for your time, and we will 
now proceed to the second panel. And so thank you very much.
    [Pause.]
    Ms.  Eshoo. May the force be with you, Dr. Walensky.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms.  Eshoo. Thank you.
    [Pause.]
    Mr.  Guthrie [presiding]. The subcommittee will come back 
to order, and I thank all of you for agreeing to testify.
    I will introduce our witnesses and call on each one for a 
5-minutes opening statement.
    The first witness will be Tom Inglesby, director of Johns 
Hopkins Cancer Center--or Hopkins Center for Health Security 
and the Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    Also we have Randall Lutter, senior fellow at the Manhattan 
Institute.
    Our next witness after that will be Erik Decker, chairman 
of the Cybersecurity Working Group at the Health Sector 
Coordinating Council.
    Our final witness this morning--this afternoon now--is Mary 
Denigan-Macauley, a director of healthcare and public health--
and private health markets at the U.S. Government 
Accountability Office.
    So we will begin with opening statements, and I think most 
of you testified before.
    You have 5 minutes. You will get a yellow light. As you 
approach--as you see the yellow light, begin to start wrapping 
up. And the red light will mean your time has expired, and we 
will try to stick close to that, but we are getting a lot of 
good information today, so we have been a little lenient with 
it, but we are going to try to stick close. We have another 
hearing starting this afternoon.
    So I will now--Dr. Inglesby, I will recognize you for 5 
minutes for your opening statement.

   AND MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY, Ph.D., DIRECTOR, HEALTH CARE, 
                GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

                STATEMENT OF TOM INGLESBY, M.D.

    Dr.  Inglesby. Chairman Guthrie, Ranking Member Eshoo, and 
distinguished members of the committee, it is my pleasure to 
appear before you today to discuss this year's reauthorization 
of PAHPA. My name is Tom Inglesby. I am the director of the 
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and professor in the 
Department of Environmental Health and Engineering in the Johns 
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. And the opinions 
expressed herein are my own, and do not necessarily reflect the 
views of Johns Hopkins.
    Today I was asked to provide comments on the history of 
PAHPA, its original intent, how it has changed during prior 
reauthorization, and how the COVID-19 pandemic may inform its 
2023 reauthorization. I have had the opportunity to testify 
several times during the original PAHPA and for its 
reauthorizations, and I am grateful for the chance to testify 
before you again today, and continue to serve in this trusted 
capacity for Congress and this committee.
    PAHPA has a strong bipartisan history of Congress working 
together to address our Nation's changing health security 
landscape and protect the American people. The last three PAHPA 
bills all showed major recurring themes: they adjusted to the 
changing threat landscape, focused on challenges identified 
since the prior bill, and considerably strengthened our 
Nation's health security with each reauthorization.
    The threat landscape clearly has changed since the last 
reauthorization. This reauthorization, too, should focus on the 
challenges identified since the prior bill and learned from 
COVID-19. I will now summarize the last three PAHPA bills and 
then turn to lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic that could be 
used to inform this year's reauthorization.
    The first bill laid the groundwork for national pandemic 
and emergency preparedness and response to accidental and 
deliberate threats. The second bill provided agencies with more 
flexibility to achieve their missions, and the third 
implemented a recommendation that I supported, which required 
assessments of national security threats to guide our health 
security. It also highlighted the importance of innovation for 
medical countermeasures and working with local authorities.
    Since the last reauthorization, we have learned many new 
lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, and I will highlight four.
    Number one, we need to make, produce, and distribute 
medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics more rapidly. That should 
include investment in platform technologies, placing high 
priority on medical countermeasures that can protect against 
the viral families we are most concerned about, and contracting 
processes that allow the Government to rapidly partner with 
private-sector developers and manufacturers.
    Number two, we need to better prepare the healthcare and 
public health systems to respond rapidly to public health 
emergencies, and that should include the right protective 
equipment for our healthcare workers in a system that is 
resilient to supply chain disruptions, ensuring medical care is 
fully covered for all people in that kind of crisis, and 
stronger local and public health departments.
    Number three, we need to strengthen Federal agencies 
responsible for preparing for and responding to pandemics. 
There is really no alternative to a strong ASPR and CDC, for 
example, which need to be fast-moving, operationally skilled, 
have the right technology, and the ability to rapidly hire the 
workforce for the job.
    And finally, number four, we need to recognize the great 
significance of the work being done to prevent future 
pandemics. To name only some of it, that would include strong 
early warning systems, a commitment to international data 
sharing in the earliest hours of a new pandemic, good animal 
husbandry practices to lower the risk of spillover, prevention 
of the synthesis of dangerous viruses, strong codes of 
scientific conduct, and stronger attribution science and 
planning to make sure we are better prepared to identify the 
source of future pandemics.
    Finally, PAHPA legislation has evolved as our understanding 
of different biological and other threats have evolved. It has 
reflected lessons learned over 15 years of policymaking and on-
the-ground experiences on these issues. Its evolution has been 
a remarkable congressional achievement and a truly bipartisan 
effort.
    Preparedness for biological threats and for responding to 
national health emergencies is something that can continue to 
be a priority for all of us. Thank you again for the 
opportunity to testify, and I look forward to your questions.

    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony.
    The Chair now recognizes Dr. Lutter for 5 minutes for your 
opening statement.

               STATEMENT OF RANDALL LUTTER, Ph.D.

    Dr.  Lutter. To Chair Guthrie and Ranking Member Eshoo, 
distinguished members of the subcommittee, I am honored and 
grateful to have the opportunity to testify about how best to 
prepare for and respond to future public health security 
threats. My key points are--all relate to enhancing private-
sector biodefense and may be useful for PAHPA reauthorization.
    First, there needs to be more actionable information and 
financial incentives for effective emergency preparedness and 
response by the private sector.
    Second, there should be more public involvement in CDC's 
risk communications.
    And third, we need greater transparency in federally 
supported research about public health and communicable 
diseases.
    Pre-COVID pandemic warnings lacked actionable information. 
Information on probability and severity of--was missing but 
necessary to calculate the merit of costly additional 
preventive and mitigation measures. Private executives could 
not have justified costly investments in, say, improved indoor 
ventilation without evaluating their cost effectiveness in 
protecting building occupants. Such evaluations require 
information about the probability of a new infectious 
respiratory disease of given infectivity occurring by a 
specific date--information that was and still is lacking.
    Three complementary approaches to actionable quantitative 
estimates of pandemic risk are worth pursuing.
    First, Bruin and all in 2006 applied structured expert 
judgment to address pandemic influenza risks from the bird flu 
known as H5N1. They concluded there was a 15 percent chance of 
efficient human-to-human transmission within 3 years. Such 
explicit and easy-to-interpret estimates are not found in 
Federal reports on pandemic preparedness, but they could offer 
useful insights about pandemic risk, especially if issued 
periodically.
    Second, Nobel Prize-winning economists have long argued for 
prediction markets to aggregate information from large numbers 
of people about the likelihood of uncertain events. A 2016 
study of prediction markets in Taiwan considered 5 disease 
indicators such as severe and complicated influenza and flu-
like illnesses. For three out of five disease indicators, 
market predictions outperformed conventional surveillance. The 
longer-lasting markets with more participants might perform 
even better.
    Three, big data solutions would estimate the risk of a 
pandemic by collecting, organizing, and synthesizing big data 
through early warning systems. This approach would require 
upgrading and updating USAID's now-defunct PREDICT program, 
including surveillance and testing of livestock, poultry, 
wildlife of special concern for viruses, either novel or of 
special interest. It would be time consuming and require more 
investment and international cooperation and new data 
integration systems, and it would go beyond the 2022 National 
Biodefense Strategy by explicitly seeking a quantitative risk 
assessment for new pandemics.
    Congress should support all three approaches to improve 
pandemic risk assessment: the periodic structured expert 
judgment, prediction markets, and big data solutions.
    Catastrophe bonds could offer firms a better way to manage 
pandemic risks. Such bonds could be modeled in part on the 
pandemic catastrophe bonds developed and marketed through the 
World Bank and benefiting from bank-related subsidies. Medder 
and Schwarcz recently suggested that unsubsidized pandemic 
catastrophe bonds for unintentional pandemics could be 
feasible.
    Congress should ensure that there's no legislative or 
regulatory obstacles inappropriately hindering the development 
of prediction markets or pandemic catastrophe bonds.
    Last year the CDC Director acknowledged substantial public 
dissatisfaction with COVID-19 risk communications in justifying 
her proposals for reform. FDA's 2000 Good Guidance Practice 
regulations is a good model for the CDC to use. That regulation 
establishes a standardized process for nearly all formal use of 
statements about what non-Federal entities should or ought to 
do.
    The FDA guidance documents explicitly state that entities 
need not follow FDA recommendations if they meet existing 
statutory regulatory requirements. FDA's process requires it to 
open a public docket to get public comment on all guidance it 
issues. FDA solicits public comment both on draft guidance and 
on final guidance that it determines it must issue without 
prior public comment, as happened during the pandemic. Congress 
should direct CDC to adopt good guidance practices rules like 
those of FDA.
    The pandemic undermined confidence in public health 
policies and in the role of science in informing health policy. 
Scientific journals controlled by HHS are exceptions to the 
widespread practice of top scientific journals, including 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and Science, 
to make public access to computer code and data a condition of 
publication. Emerging Infectious Disease, Environmental Health 
Perspectives, and Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report--all 
three Federal journals controlled by HHS--have no comparable 
transparency policies.
    Congress could and should require federally controlled and 
supported peer-reviewed health journals to adopt transparency 
measures comparable to that of the PNAS.
    I am happy to take questions. Thank you.

    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony. The 
Chair now recognizes Mr. Decker for 5 minutes for your opening 
statement.

                    STATEMENT OF ERIK DECKER

    Mr.  Decker. Thank you, Chairman Guthrie, Ranking Member 
Eshoo, and members of the subcommittee. I am Erik Decker, 
chairman of the Health Sector Coordinating Council 
Cybersecurity Working Group and vice president and chief 
information security officer, Intermountain Health. Thank you 
for the opportunity to speak on public health security threats 
and how this interrelates with the reauthorization of PAHPA.
    I believe we are at an inflection point. Our adversaries 
are becoming increasingly sophisticated at penetrating our 
cyber defenses just as we are becoming increasingly reliant on 
digital data and technology. The ability of our adversaries to 
monetize and capitalize on our business operations, data, 
intellectual property, and vulnerabilities is a significant 
part of the reason why our sector continues to be a top focus 
for cyber attack.
    The study just released this week titled ``The Ransomware 
Attack Associated with Disruptions at Adjacent Emergency 
Departments in the U.S.'' suggests secondary effects occur on 
hospitals adjacent to those disrupted by cyber attacks, 
resulting in long wait times, increased census, and increases 
in high-acuity cases such as strokes. This demonstrates that 
the need to treat cyber attacks as disasters requiring 
coordinated planning and response is necessary.
    Without proper cyber foundations in place, this velocity of 
digital transformation could become the equivalent of driving a 
race car at maximum velocity without brakes. Thus, the mission 
of the Cyber Working Group is to develop and disseminate, free 
of charge, sectorwide recommendations and guidance to help 
facilitate resilience to cybersecurity threats.
    Thankfully, the public-private partnership between the 
health sector and the U.S. Government has matured significantly 
over the last several years. Despite the partnership's growing 
strength, certain parts of the health sector, primarily smaller 
and less resourced entities, lag in their cyber capabilities 
and must be buttressed. As we like to remember--remind 
everyone, cyber safety is patient safety.
    Since 2018 the Cyber Working Group has produced 21 best 
practice publications to aid all 7 subsectors of health and 
public health. I want to highlight two recent publications 
jointly branded with HHS. One is called ``The Health Industry 
Cybersecurity Practices,'' otherwise known as HICP. First 
published in 2018, HICP provides cyber hygiene recommendations 
for small, medium, and large-sized organizations. It was built 
in partnership with the HHS 405(d) program and 150 experts 
across the industry. Last month we released HICP 2023.
    Also in April we released the ``Hospital Cybersecurity 
Landscape Analysis,'' another publication. This first-of-a-kind 
study took on the daunting challenge of determining the current 
state of the U.S. hospitals' cybersecurity resiliency to thwart 
cyber attacks. The study found that progress has been made at 
improving our cyber posture, but significant improvements are 
needed in core cyber hygiene capabilities. This study would not 
have been feasible without the direct support of the HHS Deputy 
Secretary, the support of the HHS 405(d) program, and the 
countless hours donated by the Cyber Working Group.
    In June of last year, former National Cybersecurity 
Director Chris Inglis invited the CEOs of the Cyber Working 
Group to the White House for a Cabinet-level cybersecurity 
summit to discuss how best to secure healthcare from cyber 
attacks in the future. Mr. Inglis charged us to set up our 
critical infrastructure in such a way that we would need to 
``beat all of us to beat one of us.''
    Securing the health sector from cyber attack might seem 
daunting, but I am confident that we can meet this challenge if 
we begin with the following three steps.
    One, the continuation of the joint 5-year strategic 
planning exercise, which is contemplating what stable condition 
looks like for cybersecurity in the health sector by 2029.
    Two, the continued expansion and improvement of the HHS 
405(d) program, which is a core vehicle of partnership with the 
health sector and HHS. It is a shining example of joint 
partnership, cobranding, and joint release.
    And three, we must continue to build partnership and 
cohesion between CISA, HHS, and the health sector. CISA, as 
experts in cybersecurity, produces many useful tools and 
services.
    With mandated reporting of significant cyber incidents on 
the horizon, we are excited to work through the specifics of 
how we will incorporate this threat intelligence consumed and 
received from all 16 critical infrastructure and provide them 
into our proactive defenses. However, since HHS is our sector 
risk managed agency, we need to leverage HHS as the front door 
to all Federal agencies.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide my perspective. 
Several other recommendations are in my written testimony, and 
I encourage any questions you might have.

    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you for your testimony.
    The Chair now recognizes Dr. Denigan-Macauley for 5 minutes 
for your opening statement.

           STATEMENT OF MARY DENIGAN-MACAULEY, Ph.D.

    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Great, thank you.
    Chair Guthrie, Ranking Member Eshoo, and distinguished 
members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to 
discuss GAO's work related to preparedness and response.
    Strengthening our Nation's capability to prepare for, 
respond to, and recover from disasters and other emergencies is 
no small task, particularly with ever-changing threats. This is 
not something the Federal Government can do alone. It requires 
a whole-of-nation effort with Federal, State, Tribal, 
territorial, and local authorities, the private sector, 
nongovernmental organizations, and communities all working 
together from the same playbook. As the past 3 years have so 
acutely shown, preparedness and response cannot happen in 
silos. Instead, we must work together to anticipate, prevent, 
and prepare for future events, all while responding to ongoing 
emergencies and other threats as they arise.
    GAO's work on the Federal efforts go back decades and 
embrace the One Health approach by considering human, animal, 
plant, and environmental threats. While many plans, some 
successes, and good intentions underlie these efforts, our work 
has shown that the Department of Health and Human Services must 
do better in order to save lives, mitigate severe economic 
impacts, and prepare the Nation to respond to multiple 
simultaneous threats. In 2020 alone, HHS responded to 
hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and infectious diseases, and 
including the pandemic.
    The systemic and persistent deficiencies we identified have 
hindered our Nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and 
past emergencies precisely when Americans rely on seamless and 
swift action. For example, undefined roles and responsibilities 
for the myriad of partners involved have created confusion, 
placing responders and communities at risk.
    Delays in testing and incomplete data have prevented HHS 
from understanding the nationwide spread of disease and 
targeting response efforts, including those disproportionately 
affected.
    Poor communication and a lack of transparency have eroded 
trust in the Federal Government.
    Not knowing the resources response partners will bring to 
an emergency have resulted not only in inefficiencies but the 
deployment of the wrong resources for critical care.
    All of these problems placed lives at risk and slowed 
response exactly when our Nation should have united to move as 
quickly as possible.
    A crisis is not the time to be figuring out what to do. 
Preparedness needs to happen before the crisis hits. Likewise, 
a full and timely recovery can only be achieved through 
sufficient preparedness.
    While fundamental in appearance, these deficiencies are 
complex in nature and complicated by competing priorities. 
Overcoming them will require many things, including significant 
coordination within HHS and across all of the response partners 
identifying the needed resources to get the job done right, 
including a workforce with the skills and competencies to 
address the risks raised.
    Additionally, it will require strong and sustained 
leadership. This is concerning, as we have already seen high 
turnover at FDA: 10 Commissioners in 10 years, NIH without a 
Director, and now the CDC Director stepping down in the midst 
of reform.
    Since 2007 we have made over 150 recommendations to HHS, 
with more than half of them not addressed. Fixing the systemic 
deficiencies we have raised will take time. Not knowing when 
the next threat will arrive can dull our resolve. But inaction 
is not an option, as a new public health emergency will 
certainly arrive.
    Reform efforts recently announced by HHS agencies have the 
potential to help address concerns we have raised, if 
implemented successfully. We have met with HHS to provide 
guidance based on key practices GAO has identified for 
successful agency reform. However, given the critical nature of 
this issue, we placed HHS leadership and coordination of public 
health emergency on GAO's High Risk List. This risk --this list 
includes Government operations in need of transformation. In 
this case, transformation is needed to protect the security of 
our homeland and to save lives.
    Mr. Chair, Ranking Member, distinguished subcommittee 
members, this concludes my prepared statement. I look forward 
to our discussion today, and welcome any questions.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Denigan-Macauley follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. That concludes our opening 
statements. We will move to Members' questions, and the Chair 
will recognize Mr. Hudson for--the leader of this effort on our 
side of the aisle, along with our Chair Eshoo and--or Ranking 
Member Eshoo in a bipartisan way. So thanks.
    So, Mr. Hudson.
    Mr.  Hudson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for--
again, thank you for making this a priority for our 
subcommittee.
    And thank you to Ranking Member Eshoo for your leadership 
on this for many years and for allowing me to work with you.
    Thank you to our panel. This is your--all of your 
testimonies have been extremely helpful to us. And thank you 
for making time to be here today. I will start with Dr. 
Inglesby.
    Thank you. Your testimony touching on the history of the 
legislation, I think, was very helpful. It is also helpful in 
understanding congressional intent through these authorization 
processes, as well as kind of the overarching all-hazard 
preparedness framework. If--very briefly, if we were to rerun 
the clock and we are now having to respond to COVID-19 without 
PAHPA, without ASPR, BARDA, SNS, what would that world look 
like?
    Dr.  Inglesby. You know, if you kind of--if you roll back 
the clock before ASPR and BARDA, we didn't really have a 
procurement mechanism in place for new medical countermeasures. 
We didn't have a system of requirement setting for all of these 
products that we need. We had no diagnostic strategy. We had a 
small SNS, but it really was focused on very, very specific 
threats, and it really didn't connect up with the rest of the 
Government.
    So all of the structures that have been built over these 
previous--the original bill and the reauthorizations have been 
absolutely fundamental to getting us where we are, even though 
we have now seen shortcomings. But it is an infinitely stronger 
base upon which to build the next reauthorization. So----
    Mr.  Hudson. Yes, I appreciate that. And as we talk about 
sort of the architecture of the structure of this, you know, 
with PREVENT Act last year, we have created this new White 
House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy. How 
do you see that structure now working where you have got that 
office that, unfortunately, hasn't been set up yet, but advisor 
to the President, you have got ASPR, with their role in 
advising the Secretary but also administering these other 
programs.
    How do you see that working? Do you have any concerns about 
that? Do you have any suggestions for us as we prepare this 
reauthorization of how we could improve that structure?
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes, I do think that biosecurity and 
pandemic response is inherently interagency, because it draws 
on many elements of HHS but also intelligence on the delivered 
side, State, DoD. So it is really important to have a White 
House presence, a coordinating presence.
    And I think we have seen both in the Ebola response some 
years ago and then in the COVID response the very high value of 
having White House dedicated, strong leadership helping to 
coordinate the agencies. I don't think it is a requirement to 
be day-to-day managing all programs, but certainly in crisis it 
is very valuable to have White House engaged with leadership at 
CDC, ASPR, NIH, FDA, other agencies. I do think it worked 
fairly well, having been part of that process during COVID and 
watching, for example, ASPR O'Connell coordinate with the White 
House and with her colleagues across HHS, I thought, was a 
really good model.
    So instituting this new office and kind of making sure it 
stays in place even though COVID is going away, I think, is a 
very good development. I think it is--I know the White House is 
actively searching for leadership and putting its structure in 
place, but I think it is going to be very valuable.
    Mr.  Hudson. Great, I appreciate that.
    Dr. Lutter, over the pandemic there were dozens of 
authorities used across agencies. DoD played a significant role 
in the development and manufacturing, hiring capabilities that 
they could bring to the table for procurement. You know, and as 
we are looking forward now, we have been asked by HHS, by ASPR 
to give them the authorities that DoD has when it comes to 
acquisitions.
    What I am trying to grapple with personally is what makes 
the most sense as far as effectiveness, return on investment 
for the American taxpayer. Does it make sense to create an 
authority that already exists at DoD over at HHS, or does it 
make more sense to maybe more formalize that relationship in 
times of emergency that DoD will play this role?
    I don't know if you have any thoughts, and I would open it 
up to anybody else that might be able to help me wrestle with 
this as we try to figure out--do you need to give those 
authorities the DoD has to HHS, particularly ASPR, or is it 
better just to--more efficient to keep them where they are but 
make sure that it will be available when we need it?
    Dr.  Lutter. That is a good question, but I think I am 
going to kick it to GAO or somebody else who has thought about 
it more than I have. I wish I could help you.
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. I can briefly say that we do have 
concerns of relying on DoD, because they have a separate 
mission. I mean, if they are called off to a war and they are 
not available at that time--we saw that they have stepped in 
heavily on numerous occasions. So----
    Mr.  Hudson. Well, I have run out of my time. If any of you 
that would like to would answer that in writing, again, I think 
that is something that Ms. Eshoo and I are wrestling with and 
would love to have your feedback on.
    Dr.  Inglesby. Congressman, I am happy to do that because I 
did have very close interaction with the DoD contracting 
partners.
    Mr.  Guthrie. If you have a half-minute, if nobody objects, 
because that is a good----
    Ms.  Eshoo. Sure, go ahead.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Can you give us a quick--yes.
    Dr.  Inglesby. All I would say is that HHS relied very 
heavily on DoD contracting specialists. DoD had contracting 
specialists from across the Department of Defense, which they 
drew in during the emergency. HHS had almost no contracting 
specialists to be able to do this mission. And DoD has been 
really very clear with HHS from the beginning that they needed 
all those people back. And so, even though they have been 
generous with their people and their experts, they really want 
those people back. They feel like they have full-time work.
    And so I felt very strongly after being at HHS, that HHS 
needs to have strong contracting capability. They are the 
ones--ASPR, in particular, and BARDA--need to be able to work 
with industry very quickly, very, very effectively. And without 
having to loan--to work with contracting officers on loan, I 
think, is a very bad position for them. We expect them to be 
able to move quickly, and they can't do it now without DoD.
    Mr.  Guthrie. OK, thanks. We would still like your--any 
responses you would like to make in writing, as well. Thank you 
very much for that.
    And the Chair now--the gentleman yields back. The Chair now 
recognizes the ranking member, Ms. Eshoo, for 5 minutes.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank 
you to this panel. Thank you for waiting, for your patience.
    To Dr. Denigan-Macauley: Based on the GAO's work, does HHS 
know who in the agency is responsible for different responses 
in a health disaster?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Clearly, ASPR is designated to work 
with the Secretary during an emergency. But our reports have 
shown time and time again that there are not clear roles and 
responsibilities, and there is a lack of understanding.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Thank you.
    To Dr. Inglesby, thank you. You said that one goal of the 
PAHPA legislation is to ``put someone in charge.'' What changes 
should be made in the next iteration of the legislation to make 
clear who is responsible for biosecurity response?
    Dr.  Inglesby. Congresswoman, I think it is very important 
to have clarity around leadership for different 
responsibilities. I think within HHS there is clarity around 
that, but I--it is also true that, outside the Government, that 
there is confusion at times from State and locals or from other 
critical partners. And so I do think there would be value in 
the Secretary or, presumably----
    Ms.  Eshoo. Let me ask you this. Yes, let me ask you this.
    Dr.  Inglesby. Or--yes.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Do you think that ASPR and CDC are adequately 
empowered to make stronger and faster decisions in the wake of 
a health threat?
    And if you had the power to make any legislative change to 
make the U.S. faster at making vaccines, medicines, 
diagnostics, what would you do?
    Dr.  Inglesby. I think, for the last part of your question, 
we should establish a program for rapid countermeasure 
development for unknown threats. I think some people call that 
a Disease X program, which allows preparation----
    Ms.  Eshoo. I understand what it is.
    Dr.  Inglesby [continuing]. And moving through viral 
families quickly. I think that is really important.
    I think establishing contracting authorities precrisis, so 
that there is already existing structure between government and 
industry is very important.
    And I think, to your first question, I think clarifying 
what ASPR is in charge of and what CDC is in charge of could be 
very helpful for--especially for outside of the Government. 
ASPR clearly is in charge of operational response, contracting 
private sector response, but CDC is going to need to remain in 
charge of technical guidance, scientific guidance to the States 
and locals. So they are going to continue to have leadership 
responsibilities, as well.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Let me ask you this. Obviously, I think we are 
rightly focused on pandemic preparedness because, you know, our 
experience with COVID, I mean, it is----
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes.
    Ms.  Eshoo [continuing]. Searing experience for everyone in 
some way, shape, or form, really searing. How do you think we 
should be preparing for new and evolving health threats?
    They have been mentioned today. If you heard some of the 
things----
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes, yes.
    Ms.  Eshoo [continuing]. That were said from the first 
panel, such as gene synthesis, where a virus can be made from 
scratch in a laboratory. Many of my Republican colleagues have 
spoken to that, or the use of open source AI----
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes.
    Ms.  Eshoo [continuing]. Models to provide a step-by-step 
guide to create a deadly virus. How would you approach this?
    Dr.  Inglesby. Well, first of all, I want to commend you on 
your letter to the National Security Advisor and to OSTP on the 
risks of AI and national security. And I think you were 
absolutely right to ask the administration to be developing 
security--or to be requiring security and safety guidance for 
the AI companies that are in this space. And I think there are 
AI risks that relate in particular to biothreats, which I think 
is one of the concerns here, and they need to be directly dealt 
with.
    I think in terms of genome sequence screening, I think it 
is now time for HHS to require, through a regulatory process, 
that genome synthesis providers are screening both the orders 
that come in and the people who are requesting those orders. 
That is something that the U.S.--most U.S. companies are 
already doing on a voluntary basis, but to level the playing 
field around the world and make the entire industry safer, we 
can't have companies--some countries in other parts of the 
world synthesizing dangerous viruses or components of them and 
sending them around the world so we can recreate smallpox.
    Ms.  Eshoo. That is why I am asking you about.
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes. So I think we need a regulatory 
structure.
    Ms.  Eshoo. That is most helpful. Most helpful. Well, thank 
you very much.
    And I yield back. These are such high-value discussions. It 
is----
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The----
    Ms.  Eshoo. It is exhilarating that we have such brilliant 
Americans that come and testify.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you.
    Ms.  Eshoo. And that we draw so much from. Thank you, thank 
you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr.  Guthrie. The lady yields back, and--the gentlelady 
yields back, and Mr. Johnson from Ohio is recognized for 5 
minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Johnson. Thank you, Chairman Guthrie.
    As many of my colleagues know, but you folks certainly 
probably do not, I come from an information technology 
background. Both of my degrees, graduate and undergraduate, are 
in computer science, and I spent about 40 years in the 
business. I have seen this space grow and develop into what it 
is today.
    And cybersecurity is so vitally important to not only 
preventing ransomware attacks on hospital networks and ensuring 
the safety of patients' personal data, but also to our national 
security. Nobody is on the front lines with that issue more 
than hospitals are, fighting cyber threats daily.
    I believe it is imperative to make cybersecurity an 
integral part of the conversation on how America responds to 
pandemics and disasters that occur inside our borders. And as 
we navigated the pandemic, cyber criminals saw their moment to 
strike, taking advantage of the chaos and uncertainty by 
repeatedly going after hospital networks when they were at 
their most vulnerable.
    So what does this mean? It means hospitals are forced to 
push resources away from other areas where they are desperately 
needed, away from patient care and more toward their 
infrastructure or their technology. It means cuts to emergency 
services, canceled lifesaving procedures, and ultimately 
increased death rates that would have otherwise been totally 
avoidable. These cyber criminals are not simply stealing our 
data or shutting down networks. They are essentially taking 
American lives with them when they leave, or when they get 
there.
    When this committee last considered PAHPA's reauthorization 
in 2018, cyber was a known threat but not truly at the top of 
anybody's mind when it comes to preparedness, as evidenced by 
the fact that the last bill only had one provision related to 
cybersecurity. This provision required HHS to develop a 
strategy for public health preparedness and response to address 
cybersecurity threats.
    In the last couple of years, however, we have seen an 
increasing number of cyber attacks on the healthcare sector. 
Each of you spoke to the seriousness of this rising threat in 
your testimony.
    So Mr. Decker, I would like to go to you. I know the answer 
to this question, but I want to hear yours: Why should 
cybersecurity be considered in the context of all-hazards 
preparedness and response?
    Mr.  Decker. Well, cyber is very capable of turning into a 
kinetic problem. So when situations--when hospitals are shut 
down, when they are attacked, when volumes and censuses go up 
and the ability to care for patients goes down correspondingly 
to that--because we are so reliant on the technology these days 
and because healthcare has become digital--when that technology 
is disrupted for a prolonged period of time, the hospital 
systems have a very hard time managing through that for a 
prolonged period of time.
    Mr.  Johnson. Got you. How can Congress, Mr. Decker, use 
this reauthorization process to improve our Nation's 
cybersecurity preparedness and response?
    What do you think we need to do? It is obviously not one 
measure.
    Mr.  Decker. That is correct. This--it is a combination of 
multiple things.
    I do believe that incentivization is something that needs 
to continue to be explored, especially for some of the smaller 
and more medium-sized organizations that do not have the 
resources to apply, you know, into cyber capabilities. So you 
could have a small rural or critical access hospital that are--
that is under water. And the choice between an MRI machine or a 
cyber capability tends to go towards the clinical capability. 
So there needs to be more incentives, reimbursements, et 
cetera, to help support and bolster that. And hygiene is 
incredibly important.
    Mr.  Johnson. Got you. Well, in your opinion, how should 
cybersecurity roles and responsibilities be structured across 
HHS?
    Does the Department need more organizational structure or 
clarity to address its own enterprise cybersecurity needs and 
its responsibilities as the sector risk management agency for 
the healthcare sector?
    Mr.  Decker. Yes, there has been a lot of work on this, and 
HHS is, for sure, doubling down on that structure.
    I think it is hard for me to answer the question of how HHS 
should be organized. But for sure, from a sector's perspective, 
we are looking for that one party to work with and get through 
that. We are providing them with recommendations on how things 
can work. But ultimately, I think that is up to HHS.
    Mr.  Johnson. It is a never-ending challenge. Thank you 
very much, Mr. Chair. I yield back.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and the 
Chair now recognizes Ms. Blunt Rochester for 5 minutes for 
questions.
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking 
Member Eshoo, and I appreciate the opportunity to hear from our 
witnesses today on this second panel on preparing for and 
responding to future public health security threats.
    The COVID-19 pandemic devastated the global supply chain 
for medical countermeasures such as masks, gloves, 
manufacturing components, and many lifesaving drugs. Our 
reliance on foreign manufacturing made the issue worse. And as 
a result of these shortages, there were many instances where 
medical personnel had to treat patients without the proper 
protection or equipment.
    Dr. Inglesby, what concrete actions can Congress take to 
protect our medical professionals and ensure that we are less 
susceptible to supply chain failures during a future pandemic?
    Dr.  Inglesby. Congresswoman, thank you for the question. I 
would suggest two things.
    The first is, wherever possible, that we begin to shift to 
reusable products that do not require us all reaching for the 
same supply chain needs around the world. The single-use, 
disposable products that we use do place enormous burden on the 
supply chain. And to the extent we can develop, for example, 
respiratory devices that can last 100 uses, 1,000 uses, that 
will decrease pressure on the supply chain.
    The second thing I would say is that there is a new office 
at ASPR, the industrial base and manufacturing supply chain 
office, which is now organizing--working to organize supply 
chain issues. They have said that it will be really important 
for domestic manufacturing purposes to ensure the stockpile is 
able to pay for domestic manufacturing, where there is 
typically a 20 to 30 percent higher cost than international 
manufacturing. If they don't have the funds to buy domestic 
products, then even if we set requirements for that, they won't 
be able to do that. So having an SNS focused on that with the 
budget.
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester. Thank you, thank you. I actually have 
been working on supply chains legislation and also stockpile 
legislation with my Republican colleague, Buddy Carter.
    GAO has consistently identified data systems as critical to 
inform the response to a public health emergency. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, GAO noted that HHS relied on incomplete and 
inconsistent data highlighting the longstanding concern in this 
area. GAO has asked HHS to prioritize the development of an 
interoperable network of systems to allow for real-time public 
health situational awareness.
    Dr. Denigan-Macauley and Dr. Inglesby, as we transition out 
of the Federal public health emergency declaration, how will 
HHS's ability to obtain timely and complete public health data 
be affected?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Thank you. And first of all, I love 
going back to the State, to my alma mater, for a Blue Hen game.
    Yes. So we have 12 open recommendations alone just from our 
recent report. I think we have, like, almost 200 
recommendations completely on how they really need to improve 
on getting this real-time data and getting this system 
implemented. So it is a very important question, and it is one 
that we are tracking quite closely. And, I mean, as was 
discussed earlier, they don't even know who is in charge of it, 
so it is very concerning.
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester. Doctor?
    Dr.  Inglesby. I would make two quick recommendations.
    The first is that CDC has made very clear that they do not 
have the authority in many cases to collect the data they need, 
even simple data: How many people are sick, how many people are 
dying, what are the trends?
    And so, in the example of monkeypox, it took 3 months from 
the beginning of monkeypox to the point where they could have 
data agreements with all States in place. And we expect the 
data to be there immediately. So the first thing is data 
authorities for CDC and HHS.
    And the second is that, in the realm of diagnostics, as 
people are beginning to report data that is collected--for 
example, diagnostics--we should have, really, one system, one 
system that HHS has set up in collaboration with the States. We 
can't have it so that everyone is reporting in 30 or 40 
different systems that are not interoperable. So driving 
towards a single data collection system, I think, should be our 
vision.
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester. Well, first of all, I want to thank 
you for your answer. But secondly, thank you for preempting my 
next question, which was really about the authority that is 
needed.
    And I think it is a real message for us in Congress to do 
our part to make sure that they have that authority and the 
resources to make sure that our public health system is strong 
and prepared----
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes.
    Ms.  Blunt Rochester [continuing]. For any emergency. Thank 
you so much.
    And I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr.  Guthrie. The gentlelady yields back, and I will now 
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
    And so Dr. Denigan-Macauley, in August of 2022 GAO 
reviewed--there was a GAO review that interviewed eight 
hospitals throughout the country. The report found that all 
eight hospitals in GAO's review reported multiple challenges 
related to staff supplies, space, information.
    And under the last PAHPA reauthorization, Congress required 
HHS to develop guidelines for regional hospitals and other 
facilities relating to treating patients and increasing medical 
surge capacity. The reauthorization also created a demo pilot 
program for regional healthcare preparedness and response 
systems. And do you know the status of both the guidelines and 
the demo--demonstration project?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. I do. We have recently completed 
work on this, and the guidelines have been delayed. They have 
not been implemented. We were actually asked under PAHPA to 
look at those guidelines, and we were unable to follow through 
on that.
    Mr.  Guthrie. How about the demonstration project?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. And the demonstration project, I 
would have to get back to you on that. I know that we did look 
at it. I think that they are in the process of trying to 
determine its applicability going forward to do in more areas.
    Mr.  Guthrie. OK.
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. But I need to be definitive on that.
    Mr.  Guthrie. And do you know who at HHS is responsible for 
the----
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. ASPR.
    Mr.  Guthrie. ASPR is responsible for the guidelines?
    So I--when the Secretary was here earlier, I asked her a 
question about--they were put on the high-risk designation, 
GAO's high-risk designation, and the deficiencies you guys 
described, particularly not--maybe having product in the 
Strategic National Stockpile but not sufficient quantities was 
the question for that.
    Do you have any updates on where they are, or have they 
worked with you on that at all or reported back?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. So we have not seen--I know she 
reported out that they had--that they were in the final review 
of the 2020 threat-based review that would talk about the 
stockpiles. We have not seen that, it has not been provided to 
us or to Congress is my understanding.
    So our latest report is that they certainly still have not 
met their goals.
    Mr.  Guthrie. OK. My other--I was talking to Dr. Walensky, 
as well, and she was talking about CDC data collection. And 
this is for you, as well, this question, and it has been the 
topic of concern for most of us on the subcommittee and to 
local health officials, in addition to the public. And CDC has 
received billions throughout the pandemic, and in certain cases 
for purposes of data modernization.
    So my question is, has GAO done work to understand which 
data authorities agencies like CDC and ASPR have, and how these 
authorities have been used during COVID-19 and other public 
health emergencies, and whether any existing data authorities 
CDC and ASPR have are redundant and unnecessary?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. I would have to get back to you on 
the data authorities, whether or not we have reported out on 
that. I don't have that at my fingertips.
    Mr.  Guthrie. OK. We would just like for you to commit to 
the committee to work with the subcommittee on tracking all the 
data collection authorities CDC has accrued during the public 
health emergency as well as through the American Rescue Plan 
Act and December Consolidated Appropriations Act. I am sure we 
can work together to track these down.
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Absolutely.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.
    I know there is another committee about to meet, as well, 
so I am going to step down for just a few seconds. But it seems 
to me, when we look at the Strategic National Stockpile, we 
have got two things that we have. We have, like, anthrax 
vaccines and so forth that we need to have stockpiled, and we 
don't need them every day, and we don't ever want to need them, 
but we want them in case we have them.
    We also saw during the pandemic that we had things that 
hospitals use every day, but no hospital could stay in business 
if they had to store the inventories required if they had to 
have a surge. And so that is part of the Strategic National 
Stockpile.
    So I think I am just going to make a point that I think 
what we need to think about, those types of items, PPE, all the 
other things that hospitals use every day, instead of going 
from manufacturer, some to the hospital, some to some Strategic 
National Stockpile, that there just be a buffer between, so--
and you--and it doesn't go sit in a warehouse and go stale over 
time.
    I know we have some things we won't use every day, and we 
have to do that and rotate as we need. But they go from the 
manufacturer to a supplier or so forth that sits for inventory, 
and then it flows through. So the first in there will be the 
last out of there. So we are always having product flow.
    But if we just--I know we need to have substantial 
inventories at our regional hospitals and other providers in 
hospitals, but we also need to have excess, just in case. And I 
think that is something that the Government pays for with the 
Strategic National Stockpile.
    And I see you are raising your--shaking your head, Dr. 
Inglesby. Do you want to comment on that, that it just--it is a 
flow.
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes.
    Mr.  Guthrie. It continues to flow with us paying for the 
inventory.
    Dr.  Inglesby. Absolutely. It needs to be a flow, and we 
have to rotate it through so that it doesn't expire on the 
shelves. There is a shelf life extension program that can be 
granted, but in general, I mean, one of the concepts that has 
been around for a while is this concept of vendor-managed 
inventory. So the people who are making the products, they 
actually control them and do exactly as you just described, 
they move them out. But there is a big bubble of inventory in 
case the Government needs it. The Government owns it, it needs 
it, but otherwise it doesn't expire.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. I appreciate it for verifying what 
I have been thinking. So I appreciate it very much, and I will 
yield back, and the Chair will--I think Dr. Harshbarger is 
next.
    But if you will come to the chair, because I have got to go 
check into another committee, so I am sorry.
    She is going to ask her questions from the chair.
    [Pause.]
    Mrs.  Harshbarger [presiding]. Thank you all for being 
here. Sorry I missed your opening comments, but I want to start 
out and talk to Dr. Denigan-Macauley.
    In a 2022 report, the GAO found significant management 
challenges related to the Strategic National Stockpile. 
Specific concerns cited included a 3-year gap in the SNS 
reviews, which impacted inventory decision making; lack of 
documentation regarding reviews; and SNS management not being 
in accordance with the 2019 PAHPA reauthorization.
    This is my question: If the GAO recommendations are left 
unaddressed, how might ASPR's ability to prevent, prepare, and 
respond to health emergencies be compromised?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Yes, we have extensive work related 
to the Strategic National Stockpile and pointed out the 
inconsistencies with what PAHPA was asking them to do. And if 
they don't fulfill these--I mean, we have talked about trust in 
the past panel. We have to have an understanding of what is in 
the stockpile. We recognize that there are homeland security 
concerns there----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. But we have to understand who all is 
a part of making that decision and working with Congress as 
well as the stakeholders to ensure that the stockpile has what 
it is supposed to have and that they even get their mission. I 
mean, changing the mission midway in the middle of a pandemic 
is not the appropriate thing to do.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Well, I think we learned a lot from the 
pandemic. And I have been a pharmacist 36 years. So what we 
found out--and a compounder, at that--so when it comes to APIs, 
we are at the mercy of adversarial nations. And that is just 
the bottom line.
    So this is really for any of the panelists, but mainly Dr. 
Inglesby. Though not directly related to PAHPA reauthorization, 
the issue of our country's dependency on foreign countries for 
our drug supplies is a continued concern for public health. Do 
you know approximately what percentage of prescription drugs 
used by Americans are based on active pharmaceutical 
ingredients produced in China? Do you know that percentage?
    Dr.  Inglesby. I do not know the answer to that. I know 
that it is a serious concern, but----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Oh, it is a terrible--I mean, you know, 
just from my practice, I know they can say 72 percent in the 
notes, but I guarantee you it is over 90. And yes, over 90 
percent. And it is a problem. You know, the shortages, any 
given day there will be up to 300 shortages on an FDA list, and 
so that is when we would step in.
    But hypothetically--now, this can go to anybody--if China 
were to cut off that supply, what would the immediate and long-
term impacts be on healthcare in the United States?
    Anybody?
    Yes, ma'am. Yes, sir.
    Dr.  Lutter. I used to work at FDA, and dealt with 
shortages there.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Lutter. So I think the answer is very large but 
uncertain. We had some internal analyses indicating for 
particular drugs, where we knew there was particularly old, old 
generics----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Lutter [continuing]. Were the biggest concern, often 
injectables. And there could be only one API manufacturer that 
was approved.
    FDA lacks data on the--it knows the number of approved 
entities, it knows the number of approved facilities, but it 
doesn't know the output per facility per entity.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Lutter. So therefore, if there is one in China, it 
doesn't know that it is making 10 percent or 90 percent of the 
total volume. It is blind in that regard.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Lutter. However, that doesn't mean to say there is no 
concern, because the concern is if it is making 90 percent and 
FDA doesn't even know that, then it could be shut down at 
substantial risk to public health to the U.S.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Well, look, we had the facility making 
40 percent of the baby formula. That, to me, is not good. You 
should spread that out, and you should be able to have 
facilities to take that place at any given time. I can help 
you. I mean, really, this is something that we have had 
expertise in in my profession.
    But go ahead. Do you have an answer, as well?
    Dr.  Inglesby. I really don't have anything to add. I think 
I do think that FDA really began to change their practices 
around supply chain inventory and data during COVID, but I 
don't have the latest information about where they are now.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Inglesby. But I share your concern about single 
entities providing a lion's share of our products.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes, we have got a lot of information.
    Yes, ma'am. You had a comment?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. I was going to say something similar 
in that the majority of our manufacturing of our drugs is 
coming from overseas in China and India. And so when you have a 
global pandemic like you saw, where the supplies--you know, 
every country needs the same supplies, and whether----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley [continuing]. It is a drug to be able 
to treat--you know, intubation, or whatever the case may be, it 
can have----
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes.
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley [continuing]. A serious impact. And 
we don't know the number of APIs.
    Mrs.  Harshbarger. Yes, the scary thing is they can't track 
the API into finished products. That is why we have healthcare 
systems that have been reported. They are checking their 
finished product for adulterations. It is crazy. It is crazy.
    Well, my time is up, so I guess I will yield back.
    OK, now it is your turn, Mrs. Mariannette Miller-Meeks.
    Mrs.  Miller-Meeks. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank 
you all for being here. We know you had to wait through another 
panel, so we appreciate your being here.
    And in some ways, this is the funner part of the hearing 
for some of us. The reason I say that is that you were 
mentioning about vaccines, vaccine-acquired immunity, and the 
shortcomings of the CDC and the FDA and ASPR, as well, too. And 
my background is I was 24 years in the military. I was a nurse 
prior to becoming a physician. And I was the director of the 
Iowa Department of Public Health. So I filled a variety of 
those roles in a variety of different capacities.
    And one of the things I introduced into the record at the 
last hearing was a letter that the Doctors Caucus sent to Dr. 
Walensky of the CDC in September--I think it was September 28th 
of 2021--asking were they going to recognize--and I had in May, 
at a select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic, asked Dr. 
Walensky and Dr. Fauci about infection-acquired and herd 
immunity. And it was a very nonanswer. So we were again asking, 
as all of the evidence and research came out about infection-
acquired immunity.
    And the goal was not to tell people to go to COVID-19 
parties, as some wanted to allude. It was to allocate resources 
that were expensive and that were not voluminous. And so it is 
necessary for proper messaging, proper communication with the 
public in a pandemic, and then proper allocation, especially as 
we know our surge capacity missed.
    So Dr. Lutter, you have written extensively on the 
shortcomings of the CDC's effort to contain COVID-19 and how 
the Biden administration has impeded meaningful reform of the 
agency, which includes reversing a Trump regulation that 
required CDC to follow certain good guidance practices.
    Furthermore, you wrote that the CDC recommendations which 
led to school closures more likely than not seriously 
contributed to learning loss among America's students, as well 
as negative impacts on mental health.
    I sent out an RFI to the CDC to hear from--on the CDC to 
hear from constituents and stakeholders on how Congress should 
consider and implement reforms for America's top communicable 
diseases agency, which included a section on CDC's lack of good 
guidance practices.
    For instance, one of the things we asked was who they 
communicated with for information. And we were told ``with a 
variety of entities.'' And I said, ``Then why didn't you 
communicate with the Department of Education or the Governor of 
Iowa, who reopened schools in August of 2020?'' And we had no 
superspreading events or, you know, appreciable transmission in 
schools.
    So given that, you know, what existing good guidance 
practices from other agencies or the public, you know, should 
the CDC use as examples?
    Dr.  Lutter. Thank you for the opportunity to answer that. 
FDA is probably unique among the Federal agencies in having a 
good guidance practice reg, which dates to the year 2000, I 
believe. It adopted the reg at the insistence of Congress as 
part of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act reauthorizations.
    And I won't say that it is popular there, but it is very 
effective and very commonly cited among agency spokespeople who 
have to defend why the system works, because it is--embedded in 
it is the notion that the agency is not omniscient and always 
opens a docket to accept public comment on any formal use of 
the word ``should'' or ``ought to'' aimed at regulated 
entities. And the reg thereby marries, if you will, FDA's 
obligations to use the best available information with a 
posture of ``tell us what more you know on this topic that we 
don't--haven't yet received.''
    Furthermore, the--so that posture is very important, but 
then there is flexibility within the--within that reg that 
offers substantial opportunities for agency management to act 
quickly in times of stress. So the flexibility is that, if the 
agency determines on its own that issuing a guidance for--in 
draft for public comment is infeasible or inappropriate, fairly 
broad language, then it can go direct and issue the final 
guidance to take immediate effect, essentially, in emergency 
situations. But it still must open the docket.
    So even in those emergency settings, which were commonly 
used throughout the COVID pandemic, it still has the posture of 
``tell us how you want us to improve this guidance and, oh, we 
will come back and revisit it later.'' And my writings cite 
several examples where that has been used.
    Mrs.  Miller-Meeks. Thank you. My time is actually 
expiring, however. Thank you for that comment. It sounds like 
Congress needs to take up that initiative with other agencies, 
as we heard recently with the EPA's guidance on ethylene 
dioxide and how it--whether or not they have communicated with 
any hospitals or other individuals on what that impact will be.
    And then I would just like to have introduced to the 
record--and if you would respond in writing, Dr. Denigan-
Macauley--you--GAO published a report in January 2020 entitled 
``Significant Improvements are Needed for Overseeing Relief 
Funds and Leading Responses to Public Health Emergencies.'' In 
the report the GAO states that ``HHS's response to the COVID-19 
pandemic has highlighted longstanding concerns we raised about 
its ability to execute leading Federal public health 
preparedness,'' especially to public health emergencies.
    So if you could, detail GAO's existing concerns with HHS's 
ability to respond to public health emergencies such as COVID-
19, as well as why the GAO designated HHS's leadership and 
coordination of public health emergencies as high risk. If you 
could respond in writing, that would be tremendously helpful to 
us. Thank you.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr.  Guthrie [presiding]. Thank you. The gentlelady yields 
back. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Cardenas from California for 
5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Cardenas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Welcome, Doctor, Doctor, Mister, Doctor.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr.  Cardenas. I feel like I am at a hospital. Thank you 
for sharing your expertise and your opinions with us today, and 
help to enlighten us to what has been going on and hopefully 
what we can do to make things happen better in the future.
    COVID-19 taught us a lot about the state of health inequity 
in this country. As we move forward to discuss disaster and 
pandemic preparedness, we need to ensure we are implementing 
policy built for populations as diverse as our great country 
is.
    Dr. Inglesby, in your testimony you discussed the 
importance of addressing social inequities and access to care. 
How can we include equity considerations into reauthorization 
of PAHPA in what--and in what ways can we improve access to 
care, not just during an emergency but before emergency occurs?
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes, I think so much has been learned during 
COVID about how our preexisting inequities are terribly 
exacerbated in a crisis. And I think for--over the course of 
preparedness programs, often at-risk populations or special 
groups have been kind of an add-on to our preparedness 
programs. They need to be directly incorporated at the center 
of our programs, not as a kind of an additional thing.
    And part of that is also planning for the data to manage 
and make sure our products are getting to the right people. If 
we don't have demographic data or data on specific groups that 
are at higher risk when we are in the middle of a crisis, we 
won't know if vaccine is getting to marginalized groups or to 
at-risk populations. And I think they had--a lot of those 
systems had to be created on the fly during COVID, and it was 
pretty difficult to do for all the different providers.
    So I think making sure that we have all of that data built 
into our plans, and that we are able to collect it immediately 
so we know if we are off track and we are missing really hard-
to-reach people.
    Mr.  Cardenas. So to adhere to what you just described, in 
some cases, unfortunately, it does mean the difference between 
life and death, correct?
    Dr.  Inglesby. Absolutely.
    Mr.  Cardenas. OK, thank you. I am also concerned about our 
health data infrastructure and how it leaves us vulnerable to 
worsening inequity in disaster response.
    Dr. Denigan-Macauley, you mentioned the importance of 
complete and consistent data to maintain public health 
situational awareness. And how might deficiencies in our data 
infrastructure and limited Federal authority to compel data 
leave us vulnerable to assess how equitable our response can 
be?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Yes, there--the data, as you had 
mentioned, was not complete, and the data comes in many, many 
formats. The data is not just being able to track the disease 
coming from the disparate localities and jurisdictions that are 
collecting it. They were collecting it in different ways.
    We also were trying to track data, for example, during the 
hurricanes, and unable to follow patient movement. I mean, 
imagine losing patients as you are transferring them from one 
area to another during the middle of a hurricane.
    So there's many different aspects of data. And some of the 
authorities that came with COVID helped them to get better 
data, but some of those authorities are going to expire, the 
CDC and others talked about.
    Mr.  Cardenas. Also, Doctor, of the recommendations you 
made to HHS to improve our data systems, which will be most 
critical to ensuring an equitable response?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Yes, that is a tough question to 
know which is----
    Mr.  Cardenas. I know there's many----
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley [continuing]. The most important. 
Yes, I mean, we have over 200 recommendations on data, so it is 
quite--but I will say that, at the very least, you should be in 
compliance with the law, and they need to get the surveillance 
network so that they can get some real-time data.
    Mr.  Cardenas. OK, thank you. We have seen shortages in 
critical supplies and even in over-the-counter medications over 
the course of the COVID-19 public health emergency. How can 
Congress help to improve transparency and access to information 
to improve our ability to anticipate and address shortages, 
Doctor?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Yes, so drug shortages is a very 
complex issue. And so, as Dr. Califf talked about earlier, we 
need to ensure that we can--you have to have trust.
    There was a question earlier about--I mean, you have to be 
able to get the private sector to want to provide the data. So 
right now they are compelled to provide some data, but those 
authorities are going to run out. And so being able to be 
transparent about what data is needed, how it is going to be 
used, is going to be critically important.
    Mr.  Cardenas. So the compelling of data, some people 
describe that as red tape, it is too much government, et 
cetera. But in this context, it is really about making sure 
that the system overall can actually save lives, isn't it?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Exactly, exactly. You need to know 
where to send your supplies. You need to know, you know, who is 
vaccinated, who is not, whether it is Mpox or COVID.
    Mr.  Cardenas. OK. Thank you so much.
    My time having been expired. I yield back, Mr. Chair.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back. The 
Chair recognizes Mr. Griffith for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Griffith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it.
    I do want to take a minute to correct the record. Drug 
manufacturing companies are, in fact--after CARES was passed in 
2020--required to report volume as a part of the facility 
registration. Unfortunately, it is not happening.
    The FDA responded on May 9th, 2023, to a letter from the 
Chair of the full committee Mrs. McMorris Rodgers to you, Mr. 
Chairman, and myself, as chairman of Oversight, and said that 
only 44 percent of facilities are complying as of March 28th of 
this year.
    And as a part of this hearing, Mr. Chairman, if there is no 
objection, I would like to submit the full text of that letter 
dated May 9th, 2023, to the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
from U.S. FDA.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Seeing no objection----
    Ms.  Eshoo. Would the gentleman yield for a moment?
    Mr.  Griffith. Yes, ma'am.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Yes. I want to thank you for raising this. This 
was as a result of my getting that into the CARES Act. So we 
have a dual interest on making sure it works.
    Mr.  Griffith. Yes.
    Ms.  Eshoo. Thank you.
    Mr.  Griffith. And it is important to make sure that we are 
figuring out--as was said just a second ago, we have got to 
have the data to know where some of our problems may be 
developing on drug manufacturing.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Again, without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr.  Griffith. Dr. Inglesby, you testified previously--and 
as did Dr. Mary Denigan-Macauley in front of the Oversight and 
Investigations Committee where we were--or, our subcommittee--
on challenges to investigating the origins of pandemics.
    When talking about pandemic preparedness, do you think a 
large focus should be on--or at least a focus should be on--
ensuring our Federal agencies provide proper oversight into 
research being done by foreign entities that are funded by U.S. 
taxpayer dollars?
    Dr.  Inglesby. I do. I think it is very important that they 
are in compliance with all of the rules and guidances that are 
issued by our own Federal agencies. In particular, I have 
concerns about areas of research where viruses are being 
created that are more dangerous than those that occur in 
nature.
    So absolutely, whether it is domestic researchers or any 
foreign institutions doing that work, they really need to be 
governed very rigorously by HHS, and with White House 
oversight.
    Mr.  Griffith. And now I am going to ask you the tough 
question and put you on the spot. And if the grantees for a 
Federal agency doing research on viruses or other significant 
research that could be a pandemic if something goes awry, if 
that grantee is not complying with the requirements of the 
grant, should we both cease giving our money to them and then 
keep them from getting any new grants until they comply with 
the requirements of the old grant?
    Dr.  Inglesby. I do think, if it is determined that a 
grantee is doing work that is out of compliance with Federal 
guidance, particularly on those issues which are, you know, of 
particular high consequence and safety concerns, then I don't 
think they should continue to get funding until they are either 
in compliance or, if they can't be in compliance, then I don't 
think they should continue to receive funding.
    Mr.  Griffith. Yes, I agree with you. We are having a 
little spat right now with one of our agencies.
    All right. I previously mentioned that you came before the 
subcommittee that I chair on the pandemic issues, Dr. Denigan-
Macauley. Has GAO looked into what incentives are needed to 
bring more domestic manufacturing to the U.S. so that we are 
not reliant on foreign countries to produce certain items and 
ingredients? API, particularly, is what I am looking at.
    And if so, what is needed to help bring more manufacturing 
to the United States?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. We have most certainly, and our most 
recent report was looking actually at advanced manufacturing. 
It is what FDA considers to hopefully be able to be faster and 
bring that manufacturing home and realize the cost benefits of 
it. And so we are watching that quite carefully.
    It doesn't work for all drugs, though. And we also don't 
know, as we talked about before, what APIs that we actually 
need to be manufactured here. We don't understand the sources 
of them all. So we continue our work in this area.
    Mr.  Griffith. And it was interesting--I would just get 
your opinion on it--one of the witnesses in the hearing that I 
had previously this morning on drug shortages with--
particularly talking about generics--opined that because we 
can't bring it all onshore in a short period of time, that we 
ought to focus on the top 40, and that we take actions to try 
to bring the top 40 back onshore so that we have those API 
being made in this country and those medicines being made in 
this country.
    And of course, then that opens up the possibilities that 
they have--as long as they are doing 1 line, they might do 2 
lines, and it may be more than just the top 40. But what do you 
think of taking a look at focusing on those top 40 most popular 
generic medications and trying to bring those back as a 
starter?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Well, I know that we do have a 
national supply chain strategy that is put in place. And we 
have taken a look at some of the supply issues that they have 
had. And if it is implemented successfully, we feel that it 
will help with bringing that domestic manufacturing home.
    I will say, though, that we do have concerns. For example, 
saline was in short supply after Hurricanes Maria and Irma. So 
it is very--just because we bring it home, we still can't put 
all our eggs in one basket.
    So--but yes, looking at what is the most critical, 
prioritizing, and then making a plan for how we can bring that 
onshore, close to shore would be good.
    Mr.  Griffith. And I know I am over, Mr. Chairman, but I 
will just say I have to agree with not putting all of our eggs 
in one basket, because what we should do is we should have two 
or three sites across the country on something that is used 
daily like saline.
    I yield back.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back.
    Yes, you were a few seconds over, but you had a colloquy 
with the ranking member, so I will cede you those seconds 
there. So thank you.
    Ms.  Eshoo. A colloquy?
    Mr.  Guthrie. Colloquy.
    Dr. Schrier, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for 
questions.
    Ms.  Schrier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I enjoyed that 
conversation, as well, so I will give that same allowance.
    Thank you all for being here today, and the thoughtfulness 
that you have put into preparedness and what we can do next 
time--because there will be a next time--to guard our health 
security.
    Mr. Inglesby, it is wonderful to see you again. And in your 
testimony you discuss a more flexible public health response 
and adding greater emphasis on at-risk individuals. And I am a 
pediatrician. One of those special groups is children. And I 
have reflected many times during this pandemic, however awful 
it was, I have thought how much worse it would have been had we 
seen hospitals full of children on ventilators and children 
dying from this disease.
    And really, COVID was the exception. I mean, when we think 
about pandemic flu, it is kids and pregnant women who are the 
hardest hit in many ways. And so children become top of mind to 
me. I even have thought about whether the public response and 
resistance to masks and vaccines and those kinds of things 
would have been different had we seen our children, our 
neighbors' children at that kind of risk, whether it would have 
been more like polio.
    I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about these 
flexibilities and what Congress can do to help you or to help 
make us better prepared to handle children's needs during the 
next pandemic or other emergency.
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes, Congresswoman, thank you very much for 
the question. And I, first of all, share your concern that we 
don't move forward with the assumption that the next pandemic 
will necessarily look like the one we just went through. Kids 
could be disproportionately affected at higher risk of dying in 
future events, as they are with many infectious diseases. So I 
do think we need to be better prepared for pediatric response 
than we are now.
    Many emergency rooms can't handle the load of children they 
have in a normal flu season. We don't have enough beds for kids 
in intensive care units in many places in the country. Part of 
that is because reimbursement is poor for pediatric practices, 
and that could change, particularly with Medicaid. So I do 
think we need to be thinking about systemic changes for our 
healthcare system for pediatrics.
    Ms.  Schrier. Amen.
    Dr.  Inglesby. And I think that we also--FDA has 
acknowledged the importance of focusing on pediatric products, 
but often they come last for somewhat understandable reasons. 
People are concerned about the risks. But in those kinds of 
environments we have to move as quickly as we can for products 
that are--that will work and be safe for children. And that 
hasn't always been the case, but we should really press for FDA 
to have that at the top of their list.
    Ms.  Schrier. Thank you, I appreciate that. I mean, we--I 
was just listening to the conversation with Mr. Griffith about 
a shortage of saline and thinking that if the next thing is a 
cholera-type issue and what we need is abundant saline, that is 
so simple, but we might not have enough in this country.
    I wanted to turn to testing. I remember that in the first 
few weeks of the pandemic we were struggling, like, you know, 
tens of tests a day, sending them to the CDC. Meanwhile, South 
Korea was doing 10,000 tests a day, drive-through. And I know 
we have learned a lot of lessons and was wondering kind of 
where you think we are in terms of the next time this hits. 
Have we learned enough? Do we have enough resources? Do we have 
companies to call on so that we can ramp up quickly?
    Dr.  Inglesby. Congresswoman, I think we have learned an 
enormous amount about testing over the painful lessons over the 
last 3 years. I do think we know now what to do at a strategic 
level, but we don't have everything in place, going forward. 
Some of it is--will--has eroded or will erode at the end of 
this COVID response. But a couple of those things include what 
South Korea did, which is having the foundation for contracts 
in place with companies between government and the private 
sector before things start.
    We can't rely on only public health agencies carrying the 
entire weight of the country for testing. We have to include 
and use the testing infrastructure we have around the country, 
which is enormous. And once it got involved, I think we showed 
that we could test hundreds of thousands, we--millions of 
people a day at one point.
    So I think we have the structures. We have to have 
relationships between industry and government. We should have a 
forum that is enduring and sustained between government and the 
testing industry, that includes the leaders from the industry, 
that is scouting for new problems, ready to rock in the event 
of a crisis.
    We should have the report--the guidance system available 
from CDC, so that they are able to indicate to industry how 
many tests are going to be needed to be produced and on what on 
what scale, what timeframe. So I think we know what to do, but 
we need to do it.
    Ms.  Schrier. Thank you. And I think continuing these 
relationships that we built this time with universities, public 
medical centers, even veterinary teaching hospitals, to be able 
to rally all of those resources. Thank you.
    I will submit other questions.
    And I yield back my time.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentlelady yields back. The 
Chair recognizes the Chair of the full committee, Chair 
McMorris Rodgers, for 5 minutes. The Chair is recognized.
    Mrs.  Rodgers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Lutter, we--earlier this morning I had asked CDC about 
the possibility of implementing good guidance practices, and 
they had some concerns. Yet your paper explicitly addresses 
some of this, about how guidance can still be released in a 
responsibly--timely manner. And there is an opportunity for 
continued revision and public feedback.
    Would you explain the origins of FDA's good guidance policy 
and how it was initially proposed, passed in a bipartisan 
fashion?
    And would you speak to the specific benefits of potentially 
adopting a similar policy for CDC?
    Dr.  Lutter. Thank you, Chairwoman. The--there's many 
benefits.
    One is, in an FDA perspective--and it may be less important 
for CDC--is it allows a clearer distinction between what is 
required and what is recommended because the guidance documents 
state these--this document contains only recommendations. 
Requirements that you must abide by are already in statute or 
regs found elsewhere, and then they are cited. So that is very 
helpful to avoid a problem of regulation by guidance, which has 
sometimes befuddled the Federal regulatory agencies. So that is 
a fairly effective way of avoiding that problem.
    Probably more importantly, from a CDC perspective, is 
simply is there a recognized mechanism for the agency always to 
solicit comment on what it is recommending others to do. And 
the advantage of that is it can say publicly, ``This is our 
best guess. We want your advice, your technical information, 
any data you may have about the benefits and the risks of the 
recommendations that we are making, and we will pay attention 
to them. See here in the docket. And based on what we receive 
there, we will revisit as appropriate and necessary.''
    And the FDA good guidance practice reg requires the agency 
to respond to important--I think the word might be 
``influential''--public comments that it receives on the draft 
guidance. So when it issues the final guidance, in a normal 
world that is not plagued by a pandemic, it has to offer some 
response to public comments that it may have received. It is 
modeled, if you will, on the Administrative Procedures Act, 
that part of it.
    But--so I think the key virtue, from a CDC perspective, is 
to increase public confidence--and this is especially important 
in this postpandemic era--public confidence that the agency is 
paying attention to information that it may not already have 
from the public about the merit, the benefits, and the risks of 
the recommendations that it is making.
    Mrs.  Rodgers. Thank you.
    Dr. Denigan-Macauley, GAO identified five areas HHS has 
consistently fallen short during public health emergencies, and 
two of them, failure to provide clear and consistent 
communication and failure to establish transparency and 
accountability in order to build public trust, have been 
repeated today.
    Do you think adoption of good guidance practices at CDC 
that we were just discussing might be a first step towards 
addressing and resolving an--this area of concern?
    And would adoption of these policies help address HHS high-
risk designation?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Yes. So we are certainly familiar 
that--with FDA, with our work, and understand that they issue 
guidances. We haven't looked at it specifically to understand 
how it compares to the CDC, but we have repeatedly said that 
there has to be transparency. We found significant problems 
with CDC, not with--no scientific rationale for the changes in 
the testing guidelines, for example, for masking policies. So--
and with school, things that the--so we would strongly support 
any transparent and science-based communication through 
guidelines that would help improve communication.
    Mrs.  Rodgers. OK, thank you.
    Mr. Decker, we have heard a lot about health security 
threats today. Cybersecurity continues to be growing, and a 
serious threat that certainly has the potential to disrupt 
care, mission critical services. And they are coming from 
domestic and foreign adversaries.
    You speak to the coordination between HHS and the 
Cybersecurity Working Group in your testimony today, but also 
mentioned the need for increased collaboration with the private 
sector. Would Congress explicitly providing clear--clearer 
responsibility authority for a specific entity like HHS to help 
lead on cybersecurity help?
    And what do you see as some of the roadblocks to private 
sector participation?
    Mr.  Decker. Yes, I--for sure. I think the amplification of 
messages from the Government--across all the Government, HHS, 
Congress, et cetera--on explaining the need and importance of 
this is--would go a long way.
    I don't think that this is a problem where people don't 
understand that cybersecurity could become a risk. I think it 
is more of a problem of people recognizing when it can become 
actualized within their own organization. And in some cases, 
they don't necessarily even know how to engage.
    And so the message and the amplification of that engagement 
would go very far into getting better coverage. I think in my 
testimony I mentioned we have about 400 organizations that are 
part of the Cyber Working Group. There are way more than 400 
organizations that make up healthcare, you know, so we have a 
lot more to go.
    Mrs.  Rodgers. Super. Thank you, thank you, everyone.
    I yield back.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The Chair yields back. The Chair 
now recognizes Mr. Sarbanes for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you 
all for being here today.
    Dr. Inglesby, thank you for your testimony. I am going to 
ask you probably an unfair question, but on a scale of 1 to 10, 
before the pandemic hit, in terms of the amount and quality and 
usefulness of data, sort of public health data across the 
country and its--our ability to roll it up into a kind of 
surveillance perspective that was useful to us, what would you 
say--where would you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 before the 
pandemic hit?
    Dr.  Inglesby. I would say, depending on the topic, 
something on the order of 3 to 5.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. OK.
    Dr.  Inglesby. I think it got better because of the work 
that you all did that was temporary and required agency or 
States to send data to CDC.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. OK.
    Dr.  Inglesby. But that, obviously, is expiring now.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. Right, Right.
    Dr.  Inglesby. So----
    Mr.  Sarbanes. So did we finish at the high point at maybe 
6 or 7? Is that where you would put it because of that work, 
or----
    Dr.  Inglesby. It may--I would say maybe 7 because----
    Mr.  Sarbanes. OK.
    Dr.  Inglesby [continuing]. Of the requirement of the CARES 
Act and other----
    Mr.  Sarbanes. Yes.
    Dr.  Inglesby. [continuing]. Other work you did.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. OK. So one of my anxieties--and I expressed 
this to the first panel--is that, because the emergency 
situation is behind us, and I am reading every day articles 
about local health officials--``closing up shop'' is the term I 
am using--when it comes to their data, when it comes to even 
some of the other infrastructure they have built, workforce 
commitment because it was linked to the pandemic, and what 
happened was it linked everything about them. Their whole 
operation got linked to the pandemic.
    So now, with some of them putting that in the rearview 
mirror and our kind of blessing that new perspective to a 
certain degree, the danger is that a lot of the things that 
took us from the 3 to 5 rating up to maybe a 7 will slide 
backwards again.
    And if you could just speak to that sitting where you sit, 
and whether you have similar anxiety about it, because I think 
the argument could be, just from a basic public health 
standpoint, we should always be at a 7 so that, when a pandemic 
hits, we can get to 8 or 9 or, God forbid, 10. But the risk 
here is we are going to slide back to a 4 or a 5 or a 3, and 
then we are going to face the same challenge the next time out.
    So talk about that, because you are reading about how this 
is shutting down, and that is not happening anymore, and 
everyone is getting comfortable again, and then we are going to 
be caught. You know, we are going to be caught off guard.
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes, I think prior CDC Director Redfield 
said that when he got to CDC and he started hearing reports 
about data, that it was years old. And he said, ``I don't--why 
are we--it seems like we are an agency of history here, not a 
public health agency.'' So I think he himself said it very 
well. He was seeing data that was 3 years old, and it was the 
latest that they had.
    So we need to have systems. I think the American people, we 
all basically expect that our health agencies are collecting 
data in real time, but they can't if they don't have agreements 
that are really clear and strong and interoperable between 
Federal agencies and States.
    I think we generally all are on the same--have the same 
goals, but unless we----
    Mr.  Sarbanes. Are those kinds of agreements ones that 
those agencies, if they collaborate well, can put in place 
themselves and create expectations, even if it is for maybe 
voluntary, not mandated, contribution of data and other 
perspective from locals, or do you feel like there has to be 
more authorization, more legislation on the books that gives 
that authority?
    Dr.  Inglesby. I do think we need--CDC needs more 
authority. I think the monkeypox experience showed that they 
started to try to get these data use agreements in June, and 
they did not have them completed until September, and it was 
clearly, you know, declared a pandemic early on. So we were 
trying to collect information, but they didn't have the data 
they needed to know where vaccine was going and being used.
    So I think having something that is set up in statute, 
authorities that are clear ahead of time, would be very 
valuable for the public health response of the country.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. Can you get some percentage of the way 
towards the standard you would like to see just through 
administrative collaboration, absent some new authority? How--
what--how far can you get with that?
    Dr.  Inglesby. You can get partial.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. OK.
    Dr.  Inglesby. I think some States are going to agree to 
give data quickly and in a fashion that they and CDC agree to, 
and other States will have less interest in that or less 
ability. So I think having a standard playing field across the 
country so that we can all see what is happening at the same 
time, so you can see--Congress can see what is happening, I 
think, would require new authorities.
    Mr.  Sarbanes. Thank you, and I yield back.
    Mr.  Guthrie. The gentleman yields back. The Chair 
recognizes Mr. Carter for 5 minutes for questions.
    Mr.  Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank all of you 
for being here. This is extremely important. I have always said 
that we need to learn our lessons, what we did right, what we 
did wrong, what we can do different next time, what we can do 
better next time. And if we don't do that, then shame on us. So 
I consider this to be part of that process, and I want to thank 
you all for participating in that process.
    Last year Congress restricted the NIH from funding 
dangerous experiments that involve pathogens of pandemic 
potential or certain biological agents or toxins in foreign 
countries of concern. And I think that is a good thing. This 
development materialized out of the growing bipartisan concern 
for the oversight of U.S. taxpayer-funded experiments.
    So even after--but even after Congress blocked it, you 
know, the Government still funds some research in these nations 
around the world. And that is very concerning to me. This 
hearing here is concerned with preparing for and responding to 
future public health threats.
    Dr. Inglesby, I want to ask you, what steps can we take to 
be prepared for public health threats that, when we got 
potentially worrisome experiments being funded beyond our 
jurisdiction?
    I mean, if we have learned anything out of this pandemic, 
it is that the experiments going on in other countries, 
particularly countries that are adversarial to us, are very, 
very dangerous, and should be of concern to us.
    Dr.  Inglesby. Yes, Congressman, I absolutely agree that 
any kinds of experiments--I think the ones that you may be 
referring to in this case are experiments where researchers are 
able to transform pathogens and make them more dangerous than 
they exist in nature. And for that work, I think they should be 
following the most strict, rigorous policies that the U.S. 
Government is putting in place.
    I think there is now a review where the policies are going 
to become more strict, based on this review that White House 
and NIH led last year. I think that will be very important. And 
every country that receives research from our Government 
absolutely should be complying and fully transparent with the 
work they are doing in that space.
    Mr.  Carter. Dr. Macauley, I am sure you are aware--and we 
mentioned Dr. Redfield, a good friend, who coauthored an op-ed 
just recently on the potential dangers of gain of function 
research. And look, I will just be full disclosure: I am not a 
fan of gain of function research. You know, Einstein said years 
ago that the only thing more dangerous than ignorance is 
arrogance. And I consider gain of function research to be 
nothing more than intellectual arrogance. And I just--I have no 
tolerance at all for it.
    But just a few months ago there were two National Science 
Advisory Board for Biosecurity working groups that released 
their findings, their draft findings and recommendations. And 
the first finding is that the current definitions of a 
pandemic, potential pathogens, and enhanced pandemic potential 
pathogens are too narrow and could result in overlooking some 
research. And definitions are important, and it is important we 
get them right and to be all inclusive.
    Do you agree? Do you agree that the current standards 
governing pandemic potential pathogens--that were put in place 
in 2017, I might add, before the pandemic--that they could miss 
some risky experiments?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Yes, we have work in this area. And 
actually, HHS is the only agency, to our knowledge, that 
actually created oversight of this small type of gain of 
function research that is of concern. And the concern is that 
the--it does miss some of the other activities that that could 
be of high risk.
    Mr.  Carter. And HHS, as I understand it, has had a program 
to ensure that the U.S. could rapidly produce medical 
countermeasures if this were to happen again. Drugs, vaccines, 
and public health emergencies. Do you know if HHS has taken 
action to incorporate the recommendations that GAO made in 2022 
to address these kind of shortcomings?
    Dr.  Denigan-Macauley. Yes. So developing medical 
countermeasures is complex. It is not something that the 
private sector really wants to take on, because there is no 
return because it is something that you are creating for a 
what-if, and if it never comes. So it is something that the 
Government needs to step up and do.
    We said that HHS's efforts were not sufficient. We heard 
earlier they built for capacity but not for capability, and we 
had problems. And so our most recent report came out, and they 
have not had an opportunity yet to--it will take time to 
fulfill all of the--implement all of the recommendations that 
we have. But it is an area of concern.
    Mr.  Carter. Well, thank you. And again, thank all of you. 
This is extremely important. All of us have always heard the 
saying that, you know, ``Fool me once, shame on you, fool me 
twice, shame on me,'' and we don't need to be fooled twice. We 
need to be prepared. And that is why this hearing is so 
important. And so thank you. Thank you for being here.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back.
    Mr.  Guthrie. Thank you. The gentleman yields back, and I 
see no other Members present to ask questions, and thank you 
all so much. This has been so informative. It is so important, 
and I can guarantee the American people we are all working 
together to make sure we prepare better for the next pandemic 
in a way that--you can't think of everything, you can't 
accomplish everything, but we are certainly going to work 
together to get as far along as we certainly can.
    I do have a unanimous--I have a unanimous consent request 
to insert into the record the documents listed on the staff--
that has been distributed before.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information appears at the conclusion of the hearing.]
    Mr.  Guthrie. And I want to remind Members they have 10 
days to submit questions for the record. I think a couple 
people have mentioned today they want to submit some questions 
already. And I ask that you witnesses to respond to the 
questions promptly. Members should submit their questions by 
the close of business on May the 25th. So we will have those by 
May the 25th, and we ask for a prompt response.
    We really appreciate the time and effort. It is a--when you 
have a two-panel hearing, you are the second panel, it is a 
long day. But it means a lot to us, and it means a lot to the 
American people. And we certainly appreciate your time.
    And with that, without any other comments, the committee 
will be adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 2:43 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
