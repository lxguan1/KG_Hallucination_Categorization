    TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Economic Development, 
Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
    FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public 
Buildings, and Emergency Management
    RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Regional Commissions: A 
Review of Federal Economic Development Program Effectiveness''
_______________________________________________________________________


                               I. PURPOSE

    The Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, 
and Emergency Management of the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure will meet on Thursday, October 19, 2023, at 
10:00 a.m. ET in 2167 of the Rayburn House Office Building to 
receive testimony on a hearing entitled, ``Regional 
Commissions: A Review of Federal Economic Development Program 
Effectiveness.'' The hearing will analyze the role the 
different economic development regional commissions play in 
distressed communities across the country. At the hearing, 
Members will receive testimony from various regional 
commissions including: the Appalachian Regional Commission 
(ARC), Delta Regional Authority (DRA), Denali Commission, 
Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC), and the Southeast 
Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC).

                             II. BACKGROUND

    Currently, there are eight statutorily authorized regional 
economic development commissions; however, only five are 
active: ARC, DRA, Denali Commission, NBRC, and SCRC.\1\ Each 
Commission, with the exception of Denali, is composed of a 
Federal co-chair, who is appointed by the President and 
confirmed by the Senate, and the governors of the states in 
which the commission operates.\2\ The Federal regional 
commissions operate as partnerships with state governments with 
programming focused on infrastructure, energy, environment, 
workforce, and business development.\3\

               III. APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION (ARC)

    ARC's membership consists of all of West Virginia and parts 
of Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, 
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
and Virginia.\4\ ARC uses an index-based system to classify 
county's levels of economic distress (distressed, at-risk, 
competitive, and attainment) to direct funds to the most 
vulnerable communities.\5\ To date, ARC has invested nearly 
$5.3 billion over 33,000 different projects to help improve the 
region's economic position.\6\ ARC focuses their grant programs 
on investing in building Appalachian businesses, community 
infrastructure, and community capacity. The Partnerships for 
Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization (POWER) 
program focuses on the 360 counties in the region who are 
experiencing job loss due to a declining coal industry by 
preparing workers for opportunities in entrepreneurship, 
broadband development, tourism, and other industry sectors.\7\

    DRA's membership consists of 252 counties in Alabama, 
Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, 
and Tennessee, along the Mississippi River.\10\ DRA's mission 
is to help create jobs, attract industrial development, and 
grow local economies by improving public and transportation 
infrastructure, training the workforce, and building local 
leadership.\11\ DRA utilizes their States' Economic Development 
Assistance Program (SEDAP) to fund programs for basic public 
infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, business 
development, and workforce development.\12\ Additionally, DRA 
provides funding through their Community Infrastructure FUND 
(CIF) to provide direct investment into community

                          V. DENALI COMMISSION

    The Denali Commission was established to promote rural 
development and provide critical infrastructure investments 
such as power generation, transition facilities, communication 
systems, water and sewer systems, health care facilities, and 
transportation infrastructure throughout rural Alaska.\17\ As 
the Denali Commission only represents one state, the rest of 
the board is comprised of the Alaskan governor, the University 
of Alaska president, the Alaska Municipal League president, the 
Alaska Foundation of Natives president, the Alaska State AFL-
CIO president, and the Associated General Contractors of Alaska 
president.\18\ A notable project for the Denali Commission is 
the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability (TAPL) which funds bulk

    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT PERRY OF PENNSYLVANIA, 
    CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC 
              BUILDINGS, AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

    Mr. Perry. I would like to thank our witnesses for being 
here today to discuss the role and effectiveness of the 
regional commissions for economic development in distressed 
communities across the country.
    Today, we will hear from five regional commissions: the 
Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional Authority, 
the Northern Border Regional Commission, the Southeast Crescent 
Regional Commission, and the Denali Commission.
    These regional commissions are set up to work in 
partnership with their member State governments to support 
economic development activities. In addition to these regional 
commissions, the United States Economic Development 
Administration, commonly known as the EDA, a bureau of the 
Commerce Department, plays a similar role nationwide. There are 
also programs through other Federal departments that play some 
role in economic development, such as the Department of 
Agriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
and the Small Business Administration.
    Now, I would just let you know, frankly, I don't really 
believe so much in the Federal Government's role in so-called 
economic development. That's my opinion. These programs simply 
allow the Federal Government to, once more, in my opinion, pick 
winners and losers, and I hate to see the poor losers in that 
whole thing.
    To me, private investment and innovation should drive 
economic development. States and local governments should be 
positioning themselves to create pro-business environments 
through reducing regulatory hurdles and the costs of doing 
business, and that's how this country and this system was 
originally set up.
    On top of the duplication concerns that I have, these 
programs continue to proliferate and expand. For example, right 
now, it seems that the argument for a new regional commission 
is that, ``Other geographic areas have them, so, why can't our 
area have them?'' And you can certainly understand that. It 
just doesn't seem like much of a winning argument to me.
    Programs that started out focused on the basic needs of 
distressed communities to attract jobs have expanded to include 
activities that don't seem really directly related to job 
production at all.
    I am not blaming any of you. This place set this up. But it 
does mean that, at the very least, we should ensure that the 
activities you embark on and are funding are not duplicative. 
And we must ensure the funding is appropriately targeted and 
focused on truly distressed communities for activities that are 
directly related to attracting jobs and private investment and 
not just used to backfill State and local budgets that don't 
want to/can't afford to do these things or just don't want to 
pay for them. So, that is the mission statement here.
    Notably, all of you received significant increases in 
supplemental funding in fiscal year 2021 under the IIJA, the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act--in some cases, 400 
percent more than your annual appropriations, an important 
consideration as most of your agencies have authorizations that 
are expiring and are up for consideration.
    And I would just like to characterize in the remaining 
time, I have got a little bit left here, that I don't think 
that this is necessarily a partisan issue, although it is 
always kind of perceived as that.
    But Presidents on both sides of the political spectrum have 
said these commissions are duplicative and should not exist and 
that there are other agencies that are already doing this work. 
And we are spending that money, and what we are doing now is 
adding another layer for people to jump through.
    And so, again, I don't think it's a partisan issue, but 
it's our job as Members of Congress to perform the oversight 
function.
    And as you all know, I don't have to probably tell any of 
you, we have got a massive debt load in this country. We are 
going to take in $5 trillion in revenue this year, and we are 
going to spend $7.2 trillion. And that math just doesn't add 
up, I don't care where you live, which commission you 
represent, or what community you live in; that doesn't add up, 
and that's not a recipe for success.
    So, we have got to look at some ways to be efficient. And 
maybe the answer is to keep the commissions and get rid of 
everything else. I don't know. I imagine we will have some kind 
of conversation about that today.
    With that, I appreciate your traveling to Washington, DC, 
and being here today for the hearing.
    [Mr. Perry's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Hon. Scott Perry, a Representative in Congress 
 from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Chairman, Subcommittee on 
    Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
    I'd like to thank our witnesses for being here today to discuss the 
role and effectiveness of the regional commissions for economic 
development in distressed communities across the country.
    Today, we will hear from five regional commissions: the Appalachian 
Regional Commission (ARC), the Delta Regional Authority (DRA), the 
Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC), the Southeast Crescent 
Regional Commission (SCRC), and the Denali Commission.
    These regional commissions are set up to work in partnership with 
their member state governments to support economic development 
activities. In addition to these regional commissions, the United 
States Economic Development Administration (EDA), a bureau of the 
Commerce Department, plays a similar role nationwide. There are also 
programs through other federal departments that play some role in 
economic development, such as the Department of Agriculture, the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Small Business 
Administration.
    Frankly, I don't believe the federal government should have any 
role in so-called economic development. These programs simply allow the 
federal government to, once more, pick winners and losers.
    Private investment and innovation should drive economic 
development. States and local governments should be positioning 
themselves to create pro-business environments through reducing 
regulatory hurdles and the costs of doing business.
    On top of the duplication concerns, these programs continue to 
proliferate and expand. For example, right now, it seems that the 
argument for a new regional commission is that other geographic areas 
have them. That is, from my perspective, not a winning argument. 
Programs that started out focused on the basic needs of distressed 
communities to attract jobs have expanded to include activities that 
don't seem directly related to job production.
    Now, I am not blaming you, the witnesses here today, for this. But 
it does mean that, at the very least, we should ensure your activities 
and funding are not duplicative. And we must ensure the funding is 
appropriately targeted and focused on truly distressed communities for 
activities that are directly related to attracting jobs and private 
investment, not used to backfill state budgets.
    Notably, all of you received significant increases in supplemental 
funding in fiscal year 2021 under the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act--in some cases, 400 percent more than your annual 
appropriations--an important consideration as most of your agencies 
have authorizations that are expiring and up for consideration.

    Mr. Perry. And with that, I now recognize Ranking Member 
Titus for 5 minutes for her opening statement. I yield.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DINA TITUS OF NEVADA, RANKING MEMBER, 
  SUBCOMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PUBLIC BUILDINGS, AND 
                      EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

    Ms. Titus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Let me offer a counterposition to that. I was thinking my 
district is Las Vegas, and Nevada is not covered by a regional 
economic development commission. I was thinking it would be a 
good idea if we got one. But now I see that my arguments are 
going to have to be strengthened other than just that, having 
heard the chairman's comments on what he thinks about these.
    I, however, think they are a good thing. And thank you all 
for coming to share with us what you have done. And it is 
important to have this hearing because we haven't addressed 
this for several years.
    And you do economic development in very different ways 
depending on the area that you represent. You respond to what 
the needs are there. And oftentimes, local governments, maybe 
they are rural counties or small communities, don't have the 
resources to do it themselves.
    So, it makes sense that there is somebody else to bring 
together, to build up structure, to invest in things that we 
need, to replace things that have been lost.
    You heard a little bit of a description, and I know you all 
already know this, but just for the record, there are eight of 
these commissions. You five are here today. You are active, you 
are functioning, you are funded, and you are staffed.
    There is a sixth commission, the Southwest Border Regional 
Commission. It's in the process of organizing and hiring staff.
    Recently created, I believe last year, was the Great Lakes 
Authority, and it doesn't yet have a Federal Cochair. I know 
Marcy Kaptur has been working very hard to be sure that that 
exists and it's up and running and gets appropriations.
    And then the authorization for the Northern Great Plains 
Regional Authority--you will be glad to hear this [to Mr. 
Perry]--lapsed at the end of 2018.
    Now, among those of you who are active, you have each 
received between $20 million and $200 million for the fiscal 
year of 2023 to support your different various economic 
development activities.
    And they range in a variety of good projects. You invest in 
basic infrastructure, energy, the environment and natural 
resources, workforce and business development, and 
entrepreneurship programs to help build that private sector to 
carry development into the future that we heard the chairman 
talk about.
    Although you all are federally chartered, and you receive 
congressional appropriations, you have a Federal representative 
on the commission, but you are very much across Government type 
of agencies that work closely as a liaison between the Federal 
Government and State and local governments. A lot of input from 
what local governments need.
    And this is kind of a unique way of doing economic 
development because you are place-based, you are across 
Government, intergovernmental, and multifaceted. You bring 
together a lot of good qualities to move our economy forward.
    I believe Federal support is critical for regional economic 
development. For example, during the pandemic, southern Nevada 
experienced 35 percent unemployment, the highest in the 
country, because we are so tied to tourism and outdoor 
recreation. Airplanes were empty, hotels were empty, the Strip 
was closed down. It was like ``The Twilight Zone.'' So, 
naturally, that impacted employment, but also local businesses 
that were ancillary to gaming and tourism.
    I introduced the INVEST in Our Communities Act, which was 
part of the recovery provisions, to try to help economic 
diversity and resiliency in all areas that rely heavily on 
tourism and would be affected by a catastrophe, like COVID was.
    Scarcity of water is a problem affecting the Southwest, and 
we need to keep consumption top of mind when we are investing 
or looking for new industry or new businesses to come to an 
area. That's a role that you all could play.
    So, you each do it in a very specific way to your area, 
whether you have to respond to closing down old factories, 
closing coal mines, loss of tourism, or climate impacts.
    So, I commend you for what you do. I think it is valuable. 
And I look forward to learning some lessons from you in case we 
do have one in our area at some point in the future. So, thank 
you very much for being here.
    I yield back.
    [Ms. Titus' prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
  Prepared Statement of Hon. Dina Titus, a Representative in Congress 
from the State of Nevada, and Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Economic 
        Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management
    Thank you, Chairman Perry. I am pleased that we are having this 
hearing today as it has been several years since the Subcommittee 
examined the regional economic development commissions.
    Of the eight federal regional commissions and authorities, the five 
here with us today are active, functioning, funded, and staffed. Those 
are the Appalachian Regional Commission; the Delta Regional Authority; 
the Denali Commission; the Northern Border Regional Commission; and the 
Southeast Crescent Regional Commission.
    A sixth commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission 
(SBRC), is in the process of organizing and hiring staff. The Great 
Lakes Authority is inactive as it does not have a federal co-chair and 
has not yet received appropriations, and the authorization for the 
Northern Great Plains Regional Authority lapsed at the end of Fiscal 
Year 2018.
    Among the active commissions, each received $20 million to $200 
million for Fiscal Year 2023 to support their various economic 
development activities, which range from investing in basic 
infrastructure; energy; the environment and natural resources; 
workforce; and business development and entrepreneurship programs.
    Though they are federally chartered, receive congressional 
appropriations for their administration and activities, and include an 
appointed federal representative in their respective leadership 
structures, the regional commissions are quasi-governmental 
partnerships between the federal government and their constituent 
states. This partnership structure allows for substantial input and 
efforts at the sub-state level and represents unique federal approaches 
to economic development--ones that are place-based, intergovernmental, 
and multifaceted in their programmatic orientations.
    Federal support for regional economic development is crucial 
because we all have unique challenges. For example, during the 
pandemic, Southern Nevada experienced 33 percent unemployment due to 
our strong economic ties to travel, tourism, and outdoor recreation. 
Airplanes were empty, hotels and restaurants were closed, and 
entertainment venues were shuttered. This negatively impacted 
employment and local government revenues.
    That is why I introduced the bipartisan INVEST in Our Communities 
Act, which will help promote economic development and resiliency to 
future disruptions in regions that rely heavily on the tourism economy, 
while also investing in workforce development programs to help fill the 
nearly 1.2 million open positions in its ancillary sectors.
    The scarcity of water is also impacting my region, as cities and 
economic development agencies have to keep consumption top of mind when 
determining which businesses they want to attract to Southern Nevada.
    As you can see, every region requires a unique approach for 
economic development, and for districts like mine which are not covered 
by a commission, there are still lessons that we can take away. That is 
why I am happy to be joined by our witnesses today and look forward to 
hearing your testimony. Thank you.

    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
    The Chair would now like to welcome our witnesses and thank 
them for being here today: the Honorable Gayle Manchin from the 
Appalachian Regional Commission; the Honorable Corey Wiggins 
from the Delta Regional Authority; the Honorable Chris Saunders 
from the Northern Border Regional Commission; the Honorable 
Jennifer Clyburn Reed from the Southeast Crescent Regional 
Commission; and Mr. Garrett Boyle from the Denali Commission.
    Briefly, I would like to take a moment to explain our 
lighting system to our witnesses. I don't know if you have been 
here before or not.
    So, there are three lights in front of you with buttons 
associated with them. I guess you don't have the button. You 
have the button for the talk. If you are talking you have to 
push that button so we can hear you.
    But there are three lights in front of you. Green means go 
and keep going. Yellow means you are going to run out of time 
in maybe about a minute or so; so, you want to be kind of 
thinking about wrapping it up. And red means you are kind of 
out of time, and we would hope that you would conclude your 
remarks.
    The Chair now asks unanimous consent that the witnesses' 
full statements be included in the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    The Chair asks unanimous consent that the record of today's 
hearing remain open until such time as our witnesses have 
provided answers to any questions that may be submitted to them 
in writing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    The Chair also asks unanimous consent that the record 
remain open for 15 days for any additional comments and for 
information submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in 
the record of today's hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Given the number of witnesses here today, we were not able 
to invite all interested in this subject. So, the Chair asks 
unanimous consent to enter into the record written testimony 
submitted by David Ditch from The Heritage Foundation, Thomas 
Schatz from Citizens Against Government Waste, and Marc Joffe 
from the Cato Institute.
    Without objection, so ordered.

  Statement of David Ditch, Senior Policy Analyst, Grover M. Hermann 
 Center for the Federal Budget, The Heritage Foundation, Submitted for 
                     the Record by Hon. Scott Perry
     Regional Commissions: Good Intentions, Bad Policy, Real Costs
    My name is David Ditch. I am a Senior Policy Analyst at The 
Heritage Foundation. The views I express in this testimony are my own 
and should not be construed as representing any official position of 
The Heritage Foundation.
    This hearing represents something that ought to be commonplace: 
Congress reviewing the activity of federal agencies. The bloat and 
sprawl of the federal government means that too many programs and 
bureaucracies operate with minimal oversight or consideration.
    One factor behind this flawed approach is the prevailing (if 
largely unspoken) view within the capital beltway that federal agencies 
are indefinitely entitled to taxpayer resources. In turn, this means 
that the burden of proof is overwhelmingly placed on critics of the 
status quo.
    Unless Congress changes course, the regional commissions will 
likely spend $2 billion or more over the next decade.\1\ In the areas 
covered by regional commissions, millions of full-time middle-class 
workers earn around $50,000 a year. It would take the salaries of 
40,000 such people--working thousands of hours apiece--to reach $2 
billion. Accordingly, the burden of proof ought to be on supporters of 
the regional commissions to show that they are worthy of so much 
taxpayer sweat equity while diverting such a large amount of private 
resources away from sustainable industry growth.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The problems covered in this testimony are not exclusive to the 
regional commissions. However, the commissions are excellent examples 
of many dysfunctions that have festered within the federal government 
for decades.
                          Economic Development
    Fundamentally, the regional commissions exist to promote economic 
growth in areas with pockets of persistent poverty through the 
provision of grants for infrastructure, business development, 
education, and more. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) 
exemplifies this since parts of the region it covers have endured 
economic struggles for generations.
    In the 58 years since the ARC's founding, many states and regions 
across the country have experienced dramatic and transformational 
growth. From technology hubs on the west coast to oil and natural gas 
production in the upper Midwest and gulf coast to broad-based growth in 
the southeast, tens of millions of people have enjoyed wealth creation 
and economic opportunity.
    In contrast, much of the poverty that the ARC was created to 
address remains. This is because a federal program cannot create 
genuine, sustainable economic growth on its own. Factors such as 
geography, social conditions, and state and local governance are not 
matters of happenstance that can be solved with a federal grant--or 
even decades of grants.
    Meanwhile, the fact that some counties within the ARC's purview 
have made economic progress does not constitute proof of the ARC's 
effectiveness. Instead, it was primarily caused by hard work and smart 
investments in the private sector. If anything, the uneven economic 
results across the region demonstrate how little effect the ARC has.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Legislators often seek to tout themselves as ``job creators,'' but 
we now have centuries of proof that the best way to create jobs is 
reducing the extent to which governments direct economic activity, not 
the other way around.\3\ As such, regional commissions represent the 
wrong approach to delivering prosperity.

    Finally, it is worth noting that the ARC's most recent budget 
justification highlights the closure of job-producing coal mines and 
power plants in the region.\4\ The Biden Administration's agenda, 
following the legacy of the Obama Administration, includes radical 
regulatory impositions that would make things even worse.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     Political Economic Development
    Regional commissions are undeniably effective at providing one 
thing in particular: political benefits. A grant enables officials at 
the local, regional, state, and federal levels to issue press releases, 
pose for pictures, and tout the ``benefit'' they are providing to 
constituents (with taxpayer dollars).
    The idea that these projects represent economic progress relies on 
an economic fallacy referred to as the seen versus the unseen, where an 
economic activity is obvious, but its cost is obscured.
    For example, a local infrastructure project promoted by press 
releases is highly visible to residents in the area. In contrast, we 
are unable to see what might have happened with those funds had they 
remained with the families and businesses whose tax payments 
facilitated the project. If a particular grant funds a project or 
activity of negligible value at the expense of productive household and 
business investments, the country is left poorer as a result.
    The idea that the federal government should have a limited set of 
powers and responsibilities while most governance rests with lower 
levels of government (currently known as federalism) was a core 
principle of America's Founding. Regional commissions exemplify the 
breakdown of discrete local, state, and federal government 
responsibilities over the past century.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A local government would be best positioned to judge whether a new 
sewer line or hiking trail is a good investment, since residents would 
experience both the costs and the benefits. Introducing federal 
subsidies distorts the process and incentivizes local officials to seek 
funding for projects whose costs are greater than their value.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Waste and Duplication
    Perhaps the single most unavoidable flaw of regional commissions is 
the extent to which the entirety of their work is duplicative of 
efforts at all levels of government. This includes:
    <bullet>  Long-standing state and local provision of infrastructure 
for water and transportation;
    <bullet>  Grants for drinking water infrastructure provided by the 
Environmental Protection Agency and for transportation infrastructure 
provided by the Department of Transportation;
    <bullet>  The existence of the Rural Development bureau of the 
Department of Agriculture, which has authority to provide grants for a 
variety of economic development purposes;
    <bullet>  The existence of the Community Development Fund in the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is a de facto slush 
fund for local projects;
    <bullet>  Business development support provided by the Small 
Business Administration; and
    <bullet>  Job training and educational programs operated by a 
multitude of agencies, primarily in the Departments of Education and 
Labor.

    There is perhaps an argument to be made that regional commissions 
allow for an approach that is more tailored to their communities than 
one-size-fits-all nationwide programs. However, this would point 
towards devolving most non-defense federal activity to the state and 
local level rather than layering regional programs on top of nationwide 
ones.
    In addition to overlap, regional commissions also provide funding 
for activities of more nebulous or dubious value, including tourism 
promotion, arts and crafts, and conferences.\8\ Unfortunately, it is 
difficult to gauge the total amount of funding dedicated to such 
activities due to a lack of transparency, which is typical for federal-
to-local grant programs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        Real Costs of Government
    Regional commissions are part of a broader trend. In fiscal year 
2022, the federal government transferred $1.2 trillion to state and 
local governments. The scale of these transfers in both inflation-
adjusted terms and as a share of the economy has exploded since 1940 
and now touches every aspect of local governance.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/historical-tables/ (accessed October 16, 
2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Even this understates the cost of federal grant programs, since 
state and local governments employ cadres of bureaucrats to apply for 
and administer grants. The more layers of government a project touches, 
the larger the cost of bureaucracy. Further, this creates an ever-
growing gap between the government entity that raises revenue and the 
government entity that spends the money, as well as between those who 
pay for the project and those who benefit from it. This breaks an 
important link whereby voters would traditionally limit government's 
redirection of private resources.
    More broadly, Congress is addicted to deficit spending.\10\ From 
the start of the pandemic through the end of 2022, Washington went on a 
$7.5 trillion spending spree or over $57,000 for every household in the 
country.\11\ The national debt has surged to $33.5 trillion or roughly 
$258,000 per household.\12\ Even darker fiscal clouds loom on the 
horizon with $75 trillion in unfunded liabilities for Social Security 
and Medicare.\13\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The glut of deficit spending was a pivotal factor behind the wave 
of inflation that began in 2021 and has still not fully receded. In 
turn, the Federal Reserve has dramatically raised interest rates to 
combat inflation, causing turmoil in the financial and housing sectors, 
and, consequently, leading to slower and stagnating economic 
growth.\14\ Relatedly, markets are demanding higher interest rates on 
long-term federal debt, which will pose a lasting threat to economic 
growth.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ Ditch and Stern, ``The Road to Inflation.''
    \15\ Ditch and Greszler, ``The End of Business as Usual.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    None of this is to say that regional commissions are the primary 
cause of deficit spending. However, they are a perfect example of 
Washington's inability to prioritize federal activity or to place the 
national good ahead of special interests.
    To prevent a catastrophic debt crisis Congress will need to put 
Social Security and Medicare on firmer footing, ideally by slowing the 
growth of spending.\16\ However, given the politically sensitive nature 
of entitlement programs, this will require a massive undertaking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    With that in mind, a more reasonable first step to reduce the 
deficit and make the federal government more manageable would be to 
reduce the vast array of programs and bureaus that cater to niche 
political concerns.
                             Recommendation
    Congress should phase out and eliminate the regional commissions, 
ideally within less than five years. This should take place in the 
context of many related reforms, reductions, and eliminations to other 
aspects of federal activity.
    A smaller federal government that spends less and adds less (or 
ideally nothing) to the national debt would be a tremendous benefit to 
the entire country. More specifically, areas covered by the regional 
commissions would be better off with less inflation and lower interest 
rates than with more inflation and higher interest rates, but with a 
small chance of getting a federal grant for their area.
    America became the greatest country in the history of the world by 
embracing freedom and opportunity. If we want to remain great, we must 
exercise fiscal restraint rather than constantly looking to Washington 
for handouts.
    Thank you.

 Statement of Thomas A. Schatz, President, Citizens Against Government 
          Waste, Submitted for the Record by Hon. Scott Perry
    My name is Thomas A. Schatz, and I am president of Citizens Against 
Government Waste (CAGW). CAGW was founded in 1984 by the late 
industrialist J. Peter Grace and nationally-syndicated columnist Jack 
Anderson to build support for implementation of the recommendations of 
President Ronald Reagan's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control 
(PSSCC), also known as the Grace Commission, and other waste-cutting 
proposals. Since its inception, CAGW has been at the forefront of the 
fight for efficiency, economy, and accountability in government. CAGW 
has more than one million members and supporters nationwide, and since 
1984 it has helped save taxpayers more than $2.4 trillion through the 
implementation of Grace Commission findings and other recommendations.
    In 2021, 61 percent of the organizations' combined income came from 
individual contributors, while foundation and corporate contributors 
accounted for the remaining 39 percent.
    CAGW's mission reflects the interests of taxpayers. All citizens 
benefit when government programs work cost-effectively, when deficit 
spending is eliminated, and when government is held accountable. Not 
only will representative government benefit from the pursuit of these 
interests, but also the country will prosper economically because 
government mismanagement, fiscal profligacy, and chronic deficits soak 
up private savings and crowd out the private investment necessary for 
long-term growth.
    CAGW appreciates the committee's ongoing efforts to conduct its 
oversight responsibility for regional commissions during today's 
hearing, as well as your other legislative initiatives.
    The federal government operates several independent agencies that 
provide region-specific grants for infrastructure projects, economic 
development, and local capacity building. These agencies and 
commissions include the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta 
Regional Authority, the Denali Commission and the Northern Border 
Regional Commission. Each of former President Trump's budgets from 
fiscal years (FY) 2018 through 2021 proposed the elimination of these 
four agencies, stating that they are duplicative of other federal 
programs. The FY 2021 budget noted that money for the three commissions 
``is set aside for special geographical designations rather than 
applied across the country based on objective criteria indicating local 
areas' levels of distress.''
    The Denali Commission, created by Congress in 1998 to build 
infrastructure in rural Alaska, has been targeted for elimination by 
multiple administrations. Former President Obama recommended 
eliminating funding for the commission in his FY 2012 budget. His 
administration argued that Denali projects are not funded through a 
competitive or merit-based system, and that at least 29 other federal 
programs could fulfill the commission's mandate. Denali Commission 
Inspector General (IG) Mike Marsh stated in September 2013 that, ``I 
have concluded that [my agency] is a congressional experiment that 
hasn't worked out in practice. . . . I recommend that Congress put its 
money elsewhere.''
    A September 2014 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report 
found that the Denali Commission IG provided extremely limited 
oversight of the commission's major programs during FYs 2011-2013. 
According to the report, ``analysis of the 12 inspections completed by 
the IG found that the IG provided oversight for $150,000 of the $167 
million in grant funds disbursed during fiscal years 2011 through 
2013.'' The amount of funding inspected by the IG added up to less than 
1 percent of grants awarded by the Denali Commission over this period.
    Given that the state of Alaska's oil revenues pay an annual 
dividend to each resident of the state (in 2023, Alaskans will receive 
$1,300 each), an additional subsidy is hard to justify. The 
commission's statutory authorization expired on October 1, 2009. It is 
time for the federal appropriation to disappear as well.
    The Delta Regional Authority has also been frequently criticized. 
In addition to being targeted for elimination by the Trump 
administration, former President Obama's FY 2017 version of Cuts, 
Consolidations, and Savings proposed a $3 million annual cut. Moreover, 
each of the Republican Study Committee's budgets from FYs 2017 through 
2024 called for the termination of regional commissions, noting that 
they duplicate federal, state, and local programs.
    Regular readers of CAGW's Congressional Pig Book know that these 
programs have long been heavily earmarked. The Appalachian Regional 
Commission has received 14 earmarks totaling $413.8 million since FY 
1995 for projects in Alabama, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Since FY 
2000, members of Congress have added 31 earmarks costing $343.1 million 
for the Denali Commission, including Senate appropriator Lisa Murkowski 
(R-Alaska), former Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska), and the late Sen. Ted 
Stevens (R-Alaska) and Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska). Since FY 2003, 
legislators have added 18 earmarks for the Delta Regional Authority 
costing $177.9 million, including 14 earmarks costing $166.1 million 
between FYs 2014 and 2021, during the supposed earmark moratorium.
    These regional commissions and authorities are not only failing to 
meet the needs of taxpayers, but also duplicating state and local 
programs and wasting valuable resources that could be better used for 
other purposes. CAGW recommends that they all should be eliminated.

    Dear Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Members of the 
Subcommittee:
    My name is Marc Joffe, and I am a Federalism and State Policy 
Analyst at the Cato Institute. I am writing to you today to provide 
information and policy recommendations regarding the regional 
commissions that are under the Subcommittee's purview.
    The Congressional Research Service has identified eight regional 
commissions and authorities.\1\ Some of these entities have little or 
no public footprint. The Great Lakes Authority, established under the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, does not appear to have 
received any appropriations and has yet to begin operating.\2\ The 
Northern Great Plains Regional Authority was created in 2002, but its 
authorization lapsed at the end of FY2018. Finally, while the Southwest 
Border Regional Commission has $5 million in authorized funding and a 
confirmed federal co-chair, it does not appear to have a website, nor 
does it have any grant information on usaspending.gov.

    If a commission or authority is not active, it is clearly a 
candidate for sunsetting. With the national debt now exceeding $33 
trillion and large projected deficits over the coming decades, there is 
no fiscal space for adding new programs.

six active commissions and authorities:

Source: Congressional Research Service. ARC's IIJA appropriation was $200 million per year for five years.


    As the chart shows, most of these commissions received large 
supplemental appropriations under the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act (IIJA). Since much of these appropriations remain unspent, the 
commissions do not necessarily require FY 2024 appropriations to 
maintain their grantmaking activity at prior year levels.
    While terminating inactive entities and deferring future 
appropriations should be seen as commonsense measures, that leaves the 
bigger question of whether regional commissions and authorities are an 
effective and equitable use of federal tax revenues.
    There are other federal grant opportunities for communities in the 
regional commission areas, so it is not clear that the commissions are 
needed. For example, the IIJA provided $42.45 billion for a new state 
broadband deployment program and an additional $2 billion for the 
Department of Agriculture's rural broadband grant programs.\3\ Yet, the 
Appalachian Regional Commission recently issued a $6.3 million grant to 
a California-based nonprofit to help provide broadband across fifty 
Appalachian communities.\4\

    Small grantmaking agencies like regional commissions have two 
disadvantages relative to their bigger peers: higher overheads and less 
ability to professionalize selection and oversight processes. The 
federal co-chair of each body is a level III appointee of the Executive 
Schedule, entitled to a $195,000 salary plus benefits.\5\ Additional 
staff can add significant extra costs. In its FY 2024 Congressional 
Budget Justification, the Denali Regional Commission requested $3 
million for personnel compensation and benefits, representing 18 
percent of the $17 million appropriation it is seeking.\6\

    In its 2022 Annual Financial Report, Denali's Inspector General 
recommended that the Commission implement ``a framework to continually 
assess, identify and monitor risk'' implying that no such framework 
exists. In his response to the Inspector General, Federal Co-Chair 
Garrett Boyle agreed that the ``long-term monitoring of grants is a 
challenge,'' and noting that ``the fluctuating level of funds flowing 
into the Commission makes it difficult to strike the exact right 
balance between adequate staffing levels and over-staffing.'' \7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Further, there is arguably an appearance of familial connections 
and political considerations influencing the nomination and appointment 
of federal co-chairs. This may inhibit the ability of commissions to 
adequately implement risk controls.
    Admittedly the goals of reducing overhead burden and improving 
oversight could be achieved by consistently funding the Denali 
Commission at a higher level, but that would be a poor use of taxpayer 
funds given the small population positioned to benefit from the 
Commission's grantmaking.
    Alaska's population is 734,000, of which 541,000 live in the 
state's four metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas.\8\ Thus, 
the Commission's main purposes of supporting job training, economic 
development, and infrastructure in Alaska rural areas \9\ are focused 
on a population of less than 200,000 people.

    Finally, although these bodies are intended to help impoverished 
communities, their regions include areas that are more affluent. For 
example, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission's service area

Arlington County,\11\ which respectively rank 1st, 2nd, 6th and 10th 
among counties and county-equivalents in Median Household Income.\12\

    In summary, regional commissions and authorities are an inefficient 
and inequitable mechanism for distributing federal grant money to 
disadvantaged communities. To the extent that their grantmaking 
activities are deemed necessary, these activities can be easily 
subsumed by other federal agencies and state governments.

     TESTIMONY OF HON. GAYLE C. MANCHIN, FEDERAL COCHAIR, 
                APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION

    Ms. Manchin. Thank you and good morning. I am Gayle 
Manchin, and I am very proud to be here representing the 
Appalachian Regional Commission as the Federal Cochair.
    Since 1965, we have been reaching out to over 26 million 
people, helping them gain parity with the rest of American 
prosperity.
    And we have been grateful over the years for the bipartisan 
support from this committee that has enabled and empowered us 
to strengthen our initiatives, that we have been able to 
respond to the evolving needs of communities across 
Appalachia's 423 counties and 13 States that stretch from 
southern New York to northern Mississippi.
    We have already been authorized for 5 years in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. And so, this has 
positioned us to help Appalachia and seize opportunities moving 
forward.
    We, of course, are not seeking any amendments to our 
enabling legislation through the Appalachian Regional 
Development Act.
    It is important to note that the Appalachian region faces 
specific challenges: the isolating mountainous range; the 
dispersed population; the outdated or inadequate 
infrastructure, which includes broadband, water, sewer, roads; 
generational poverty; and the lack of capacity when it comes to 
applying for and receiving assistance from other funding 
opportunities.
    ARC provides an effective approach for addressing the 
region's unique challenges. Our flexible base funding program 
takes a bottom-up approach, enabling local communities to 
tailor the Federal assistance to their individual needs.
    But then ARC works in collaboration with the States as a 
partner to develop strategies from the local, State, and 
Federal level so that we are meeting the priorities at each 
level and not coming from the top telling them how to do it.
    This bottom-up partnership approach ensures that the 
initiatives reflect local, State, and Federal partnership. And 
we believe that the base funding, which gives a formula-
allocated amount to each State, allows Governors, too, to have 
a voice in funding opportunities.
    In addition to the base program, ARC funds several grant 
initiatives that are having transformative impacts across our 
Appalachian region. This includes our POWER initiative, which 
responds to job losses specifically due to coal-impacted 
communities with the downturn of coal in those areas.
    The Appalachian region has disproportionately suffered a 
major shift as the coal industry went down. Over 70 percent of 
coal mining jobs lost in the United States from 2011 to 2022 
were in the Appalachian region, leading to a loss of more than 
34,000 direct mining jobs.
    Up to this time, ARC has invested more than $420 million 
into 507 projects since POWER was established.
    The Appalachian region also continues to be 
disproportionately affected by the opioid epidemic. And so, in 
2018 we organized. We formed listening committees, focus 
groups. We studied and researched.
    And as a result, we launched the INSPIRE grant, which is a 
recovery-to-work initiative. So, training, not only the 
recovery, but giving support across--in this investment, we 
have given nearly $42 million across 126 INSPIRE projects.
    And then last year, we launched our ARISE, which is a 
multistate initiative to give greater impact as we respond to 
the challenges as a region rather than as 13 individual States.
    And then, through READY Appalachia, we have offered 
capacity training to build our local leaders and our nonprofits 
in a way that can strengthen their capacity in writing for 
grants, strategizing, and planning for projects in their 
communities.
    So, we have undeniably seen progress in our region.
    Highways have always been a key component. But in addition 
to the concrete highways, we now find that the broadband 
highway is another challenge in our mountainous isolated areas.
    So, we continue to work to meet the challenges, targeting 
our investments. We are a part of the White House Interagency 
Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities where we 
serve as a major member of that committee, working in tandem 
with other Federal agencies. So, not to duplicate but to 
complement one another in the funding that we are able to put 
forth through those coal-impacted areas.
    Our programs continue to work, they continue to thrive. We 
look forward to hosting a time when the Appalachian regional 
communities will not just thrive or survive, but they will 
actually be able to compete with the rest of the country in 
their efforts, and then we will know that we have reached 
parity.
    So, I thank you for this opportunity to speak before you, 
and I look forward to answering any questions that you may have 
that come up before us. Thank you very much.
    [Ms. Manchin's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
     Prepared Statement of Hon. Gayle C. Manchin, Federal Cochair, 
                    Appalachian Regional Commission
    Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:
    My name is Gayle Manchin, Federal Co-Chair of the Appalachian 
Regional Commission (ARC), and I am pleased to come before you this 
morning to discuss the progress that ARC has made in helping close the 
socioeconomic gap between Appalachia's 26 million people and the rest 
of the nation.
    ARC has been grateful for the bipartisan support from this 
committee over the years. You have helped us strengthen our initiatives 
and ensure that we are able to respond to the evolving needs of 
communities across Appalachia's 423 counties and 13 states. We were 
reauthorized for five years in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, and this has positioned us to help Appalachia seize the economic 
opportunities of the future. We are not seeking any amendments to our 
enabling legislation, the Appalachian Regional Development Act.
    Since 1965, the ARC has collaborated with local and state partners 
to create jobs, build infrastructure, and strengthen the regional 
economy. ARC provides an effective approach for addressing the region's 
economic challenges and advancing each of our strategic investment 
priorities: 1.) building Appalachian businesses, 2.) building 
Appalachia's workforce ecosystem, 3.) building Appalachia's 
infrastructure, 4.) building regional culture and tourism, and 5.) 
building community leaders and capacity.
    Our flexible base funding program takes a ``bottom up'' approach, 
enabling local communities to tailor the federal assistance to their 
individual needs. It makes use of local development districts to 
develop and implement effective strategies for local economic 
development. Through our federal-state partnership structure, ARC's 
projects reflect state priorities as well.
    Since ARC was founded, it has made considerable progress to move 
Appalachia closer to the nation's economic mainstream. For example:
    <bullet>  The number of high-poverty counties in Appalachia has 
been cut by over 60 percent.\1\

    <bullet>  The percentage of adults with a high school diploma has 
nearly tripled since 1960, and students in Appalachia now graduate from 
high school at nearly the same rate as that of the nation as a 
whole.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <bullet>  In the past five years, ARC-funded infrastructure 
projects have provided 251,890 Appalachian households with access to 
clean water and sanitation facilities.\4\

    ARC program investments totaled $867.3 million from FY 2018 to FY 
2022. Taken together these funds--
    <bullet>  leveraged over $1.4 billion in other public investment 
($1.63 per $1 ARC investment);
    <bullet>  attracted over $5.5 billion in private investment ($6.35 
per $1 ARC investment);
    <bullet>  resulted in 113,483 jobs being created or retained; and
    <bullet>  provided training and new skills to 172,403 students and 
workers/trainees.\5\

    In addition to our base funding program, which has been the 
mainstay of ARC over the years, and in which funds are allocated by 
formula to each ARC state for the Governor to recommend projects to us, 
I want to highlight for the committee three special initiatives that 
are positioning our communities to be competitive in the new economy:
    The first is our regionally competitive Partnerships for 
Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization Initiative 
(POWER) initiative for coal-impacted communities. POWER responds to job 
losses in coal mining, coal-fired power plant operations, and supply 
chain and logistics businesses that serve that industry.
    Appalachia has disproportionately suffered from the shift away from 
coal as an energy source. Over 70 percent of the coal mining jobs lost 
in the United States from 2011 to 2022 were in the Appalachian region. 
Since POWER's establishment in 2015, ARC has invested over $420 million 
in 507 projects impacting nearly 400 of Appalachia's coal-impacted 
counties. These ARC's investments are projected to create or retain 
more than 53,000 jobs and prepare over 142,000 workers and students for 
new opportunities in entrepreneurship, broadband, tourism, and other 
growing industries.
    The next initiative I'll highlight is called Investments Supporting 
Partnerships In Recovery Ecosystems (INSPIRE), which focuses on 
creating or expanding local substance use disorder (SUD) networks that 
lead to workforce entry or re-entry. In 2018, your committee recognized 
the way SUD was ravaging our region and you added a new authority to 
our statute for us to do work in this area. We created a substance use 
advisory council, convened a series of listening sessions around the 
region and launched INSPIRE as a result.
    Successful projects support the post-treatment to employment 
continuum, which could include investments in healthcare networks that 
support SUD recovery professionals, recovery-focused job training 
programs, as well as initiatives designed to coordinate, or link, 
recovery services and training that support the recovery to work 
ecosystem, among others.
    Substance use disorder poses a major threat to the economic 
prosperity of Appalachia. It's not just a public health and public 
safety issue; it's an economic development issue. It drains the 
region's resources, both human and financial.
    Since April 2021 when INSPIRE was created, ARC has invested nearly 
$42 million in 126 projects that address Appalachia's SUD crisis in 349 
counties--which is 83 percent of the region. Together, these projects 
are projected to improve more than 2,178 businesses and provide 
opportunities for nearly 9,772 students and workers in creating or 
expanding recovery ecosystems leading to workforce entry or re-entry 
throughout the region.
    Our newest initiative is ARISE (Appalachian Regional Initiative for 
Stronger Economies), which is funded by the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act and which seeks to drive large-scale, regional economic 
transformation through multi-state collaborative projects across 
Appalachia. ARISE rests on the premise that greater economic impact can 
occur from activities that are coordinated across state lines than 
would likely occur when these activities are conducted in isolation in 
individual states. It gives ARC a way to boost economic sectors or 
industry clusters that reach across multiple states, yielding greater 
economic payoff for the economies of those states. ARISE grants are 
strengthening the electric vehicle sector in our southern states, the 
textile industry in the Carolinas, green manufacturing in northern 
Appalachia, and regional tourism in Central Appalachia.
    Since launching ARISE last fall, we have made 13 grants totaling 
$48.6 million. We currently have 36 applications under review and have 
invited 14 more to apply.
    Doing this kind of multi-state work is not easy; it calls for all 
of us to think differently about how we build a stronger regional 
economy. But I've been very encouraged by what our first year of 
experience with ARISE has produced. It is changing the conversation 
about economic development, and it is driving home the benefits of 
partnerships that reach broadly across multiple states.
    Although Appalachia has seen progress as a result of ARC's program 
and initiatives, serious challenges constrain the economic future of 
too many Appalachians.
    <bullet>  Nearly one-fifth of Appalachia's counties still suffer 
from persistent and severe economic distress.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <bullet>  The region has been disproportionately affected by the 
loss of manufacturing jobs. During the period 2000-2021, Appalachia had 
a net loss of 625,000 manufacturing jobs (a 31 percent decline), while 
the United States lost around 4.7 million (a 26 percent decline).\8\

    So there is still much work to be done.
    In addition to leveraging our base funding program and special 
initiatives as mentioned previously, ARC tackles Appalachia's 
challenges by targeting its resources to the areas of greatest need, 
leveraging private resources into Appalachia, and partnering with other 
federal agencies to extend the reach of their resources into 
Appalachia.
    In FY 2022, 74 percent of ARC's grant dollars supported projects 
that primarily or substantially benefited economically distressed 
counties and areas.
    ARC is not duplicative, but rather complementary, of other federal 
programs. By using its grassroots delivery system, ARC can extend the 
reach of programs into some of the most economically distressed parts 
of the nation by providing the necessary training and gap funding to 
prepare economically distressed communities to compete successfully for 
funding from national programs.
    Similarly, ARC helps attract private sector investment to areas 
that otherwise would not likely be considered competitive investment 
opportunities. In FY 2022, investments of $239.7 million in grant funds 
across all ARC initiatives attracted an additional $389.5 million in 
other project funding, an investment ratio of 2 to 1, and $1.57 billion 
in non-project leveraged private investment, a ratio of 7 to 1.
    As previously mentioned, partnerships lie in the heart of how ARC 
is able to advance the economic health of the region. That's just as 
true in working with other federal agencies as it is in collaborations 
with the private and nonprofit sectors. ARC has strong relationships 
with U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Economic Development 
Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the Federal 
Communications Commission, and the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. We have a history of collaborating with federal agencies to 
achieve greater impact in Appalachia.
    ARC is a leading member of the White House Interagency Working 
Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization, 
spotlighting for the 11 member agencies the particular challenges that 
many Appalachian communities face because of the decline in the coal 
industry.
    Highways have always been a key component of the effort to narrow 
the economic gap between Appalachia and the rest of the nation. The 
Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS) was created to connect 
Appalachia to national and international markets and to compensate for 
the fact that the interstate system had bypassed much of the region. 
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provides dedicated 
funding of $250 million a year for work on the ADHS. IIJA also sets 
aside 25 percent of the funding for the Rural Surface Transportation 
Grant Program for the ADHS, which totals $500 million over five years. 
This will facilitate significant progress in completing the system, 
which is currently 91 percent under construction or open to traffic. 
While the current funding for the ADHS goes to the Federal Highway 
Administration, ARC maintains an active role in overseeing the system.
    ARC's program also helps fund reliable and affordable broadband 
infrastructure to rural Appalachian communities so they can compete and 
participate in the global economy. We have partnered with the Federal 
Communications Commission to help more Appalachians participate in the 
Affordable Connectivity Program, which helps reduce barriers by 
providing eligible households with up to $30 per month to help cover 
internet bills.
    However, we often hear from communities that they lack the capacity 
to take full advantage of ARC's resources or the funding opportunities 
at other federal agencies. In response, ARC has created READY 
Appalachia, which seeks to build capacity in four key pillars of 
economic and community development: nonprofit organizations, community 
foundations, local development districts, and local governments. We 
launched this program last year.
    Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration have made historic 
levels of funding available to communities across Appalachia--funding 
that will be used to support sustainable economic growth. By helping 
local leaders and nonprofit organizations to build on their capacity to 
develop infrastructure projects and workforce development initiatives 
in our communities, READY Appalachia will also help increase equity for 
our Appalachian people and ensure that the region's resilience and 
success will transform their future.
    ARC's emphasis on local building capacity, in addition to our 
POWER, INSPIRE, and ARISE programs, will complement ARC's traditional 
base funding program that advances basic infrastructure, workforce 
development, and business support.
    I like to say that the name of our agency isn't the ``13 States of 
Appalachia''; it's the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the more we 
can do things on a truly regional, multistate basis the greater the 
benefits will be for Appalachia and for the Appalachia states. If the 
Appalachian part of the state gets stronger, the whole state will get 
stronger, and the stronger the ARC states become, the stronger our 
national economy will be. Taken together, ARC's program and initiatives 
will help narrow the economic gap between Appalachia and the rest of 
the nation. I look forward to working with the Subcommittee in this 
effort.

    Mr. Ezell [presiding]. Thank you, Ms. Manchin.
    And, Dr. Wiggins, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your 
testimony.

TESTIMONY OF HON. COREY WIGGINS, Ph.D., FEDERAL COCHAIR, DELTA 
                       REGIONAL AUTHORITY

    Mr. Wiggins. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my 
name is Dr. Corey Wiggins. I serve as the Federal Cochairman of 
the Delta Regional Authority. Thank you for allowing me the 
opportunity to share with you the important work of the Delta 
Regional Authority.
    Since its establishment in 2000, the DRA's purpose has 
remained unchanged: to promote and encourage economic 
development in the DRA region.
    DRA's financial assistance programs provide targeted 
investments in the 252 counties and parishes across our eight-
State region. That includes parts of Alabama, Arkansas, 
Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and 
Tennessee.
    While home to 10 million residents, the DRA region is among 
the most economically distressed parts of the United States.
    The DRA invests in a broad range of initiatives that 
support four overarching goals, including investing in public 
infrastructure, developing the local workforce, promoting 
business growth and entrepreneurship, and supporting 
sustainable communities.
    Some highlights of DRA programs and their impacts include, 
from 2017 to 2022, project investments in the States' Economic 
Development Assistance Program, our partnership program with 
our Governors, resulted in over 500,000 families affected by 
infrastructure programs, more than 160,000 individuals trained 
in workforce development programs, and approximately 35,000 
jobs created or retained in the region.
    Since 2017, our Community Infrastructure Fund, which 
supports basic public infrastructure investments, resulted in 
more than 290,000 families affected by improved infrastructure 
projects, about 1,500 individuals trained in workforce 
programming, and over 8,000 jobs created or retained in the 
region.
    DRA invested a total of over $46 million in funding in the 
DRA region in fiscal year 2022. The expected impact of this 
funding from nearly 110 projects in the region includes nearly 
42,000 families affected via improved infrastructure, over 
1,800 jobs created or retained, and over 1,200 individuals 
trained.
    As DRA continues to assess its fiscal year 2023 project and 
impact data, some highlighted regional investments include: DRA 
awarded $11.7 million in investments to 28 projects in the 
region through our Delta Workforce Program.
    DRA also awarded over $600,000 to five communities in 
Illinois, Louisiana, and Missouri in its first round of funding 
through the Strategic Planning Grant Program, a new initiative 
to support capacity building in the region.
    Every 5 years, DRA, by statute, is responsible for creating 
a regional development plan with public input that is approved 
by our Governors. In February 2023, the authority approved and 
released ``Navigating the Currents of Opportunity: DRA Regional 
Development Plan IV.''
    Our strategic goals for the next 5 years include: DRA will 
expand and invest in the resiliency of the region's public 
infrastructure to improve residents' quality of life and 
increase economic opportunity.
    We will improve the networks of agencies, organizations, 
businesses, and educational institutions providing workforce 
development opportunities.
    We will strengthen the competitiveness of the region's 
employers, attract new employers to the region, and support the 
long-term growth of micro and small businesses.
    We will expand our efforts to enhance sustainable and 
inclusive local placemaking, quality of life, and community 
capacity.
    DRA has pursued its vision of the region as a place where 
people and businesses have access to economic opportunities and 
vibrant, sustainable, and resilient communities.
    One of DRA's legislative priorities includes 
reauthorization of the agency, which has been included in the 
farm bill in the past. It is vitally important that the agency 
continues to exist and provide critical resources to the heart 
of America.
    Additionally, the agency requests appropriations language 
to amend DRA's authorizing statute to remove section 382N of 
the Delta Regional Authority Act of 2000, thereby deleting or 
removing DRA's sunset language.
    DRA and its sister commissions serve a distinguished 
purpose and uniquely critical role within each of our regions. 
Our impact in the region is not just limited to the 
quantitative outputs from the agency investments, but is also 
connected to DRA's reputation as a regional partner working 
closely with local governments and local development districts 
to help find solutions to the challenges experienced in the 
region.
    It is critical that DRA remains a vital partner in the 
region to foster inclusive communities, strengthen regional 
collaboration, achieve sustained long-term economic 
development, and produce meaningful opportunities for all 
people in the DRA region.
    Again, thank you for allowing me to speak today. I look 
forward to our continued conversation.
    [Mr. Wiggins' prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
   Prepared Statement of Hon. Corey Wiggins, Ph.D., Federal Cochair,
                        Delta Regional Authority
    On behalf of the Delta Regional Authority (DRA), I am pleased to 
present the Delta Regional Authority's Written Testimony Regarding 
Regional Commissions: A Review of Federal Economic Development Program 
Effectiveness.
    Since its establishment in 2000, the agency's purpose has remained 
unchanged--to promote and encourage economic development in the DRA 
region. DRA's financial assistance programs provide targeted investment 
in the 252 counties and parishes within eight states in and around the 
Mississippi River Delta and the Alabama Black Belt. Member states are 
Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Missouri, and Tennessee.
    While home to 10 million residents, the DRA region is among the 
most economically distressed parts of the United States. Among the DRA 
region's 252 counties and parishes, most are characterized as 
distressed and persistently in poverty \1\ \2\. Despite these economic 
conditions, millions of Americans across the country rely on the DRA 
region for agriculture, manufacturing, textiles, and supply chain 
logistics, as well as natural resources.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ As of FY 2022, 230 (91 percent) of DRA's counties and parishes 
are economically distressed. In compliance with the statute, the DRA 
calculates distress criteria on an annual basis. To be deemed 
distressed counties and parishes must meet the following criteria: (1) 
An unemployment rate of one percent higher than the national average 
for the most recent 24-month period. (2) Have a per capita income of 80 
percent or less of the most recent national per capita income level.
    \2\ As of FY 2022, 136 (54 percent) of DRA's counties and parishes 
are in persistent poverty. The DRA follows the definition of persistent 
poverty provided by the USDA Economic Research Service that designates 
a county or parish may experience persistent poverty if it has poverty 
rates of 20 percent of the population, or more, for at least 30 years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Throughout its history, DRA has responded effectively to the 
region's challenges through its programs and investments. The DRA 
invests in a broad range of initiatives that support the four 
overarching goals of the DRA: investing in public infrastructure, 
developing local workforces, promoting business growth and 
entrepreneurship, and supporting sustainable communities. Some 
highlights of DRA programs and their impact include:
    <bullet>  The States' Economic Development Assistance Program 
(SEDAP), one of DRA's main investment tools, provides direct 
investments for basic public infrastructure, transportation 
infrastructure, business development, and workforce development. From 
2017 to 2022, project investments in SEDAP resulted in over 504,000 
families affected by infrastructure projects, about 164,000 individuals 
trained in workforce development programs, and approximately 35,000 
jobs either created or retained in the region.
    <bullet>  The Community Infrastructure Fund (CIF) supports projects 
that address flood control, basic public infrastructure, and 
transportation infrastructure improvements. Since 2017, CIF investments 
have facilitated nearly 299,000 families affected by infrastructure 
projects, about 1,500 individuals trained in workforce programming, and 
over 8,000 jobs created or retained in the region.
    <bullet>  The Delta Doctors program increases access to quality 
health care in DRA communities by using a J-1 visa waiver to allow 
foreign physicians trained in the United States to work in areas with a 
shortage of health professionals. From 2019 to 2021, the DRA sponsored 
440 physicians across the region, with about half of projects taking 
place in Alabama and Louisiana. About 25 percent of DRA-sponsored 
doctors work in a primary care role, with the remainder working across 
more than 18 specialties.
    <bullet>  In collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services (HHS), the Delta Region Community Health Systems 
Development Program enhances healthcare delivery by providing technical 
assistance to critical access hospitals, small rural hospitals, rural 
health clinics, and other healthcare organizations. From 2017 to 2021, 
the program supported 43 organizations (37 hospitals, five Rural Health 
Clinics, and one Federally Qualified Health Center) in 40 DRA 
communities across all eight DRA states. A total of approximately 
73,220 county jobs were supported due to hospital and clinic employee 
spending (2017-2021), which represents about 19 percent of all local 
jobs in these communities.

    DRA is essential to economic development in the 252 counties and 
parishes within our eight-state region. As noted by the Southern 
Economic Advancement Project, ``[t]he economic conditions within the 
Delta and the Black Belt regions continue to negatively impact the 
lives of the people there and the nation's overall economic health.'' 
\3\ The investments made via DRA for basic public infrastructure, 
transportation infrastructure, business development, and workforce 
development are vital to the economic development of these areas.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Additionally, as stated in the Congressional Research Service 
Report: Federal Regional Commissions and Authorities: Structural 
Features and Function dated April 7, 2023,\4\ DRA, along with other 
commissions, ``provide[s] a model of functioning economic development 
approaches that are place-based, intergovernmental, and multifaceted in 
their programmatic orientation (e.g., infrastructure, energy, 
environment/ecology, workforce, business development).''

crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45997.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An example of this approach can be highlighted in the demand for 
DRA's programs in FY 2022. Historically, DRA's appropriations have been 
around $30 million. However, the agency received a one-time $150 
million appropriation in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, or the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. By combining DRA's annual 
appropriations and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, DRA invested 
a total of over $46 million in funding in the DRA region in FY 2022. 
The expected impact of this funding for nearly 110 projects in the 
region includes nearly 42,000 families affected via improved access to 
infrastructure, over 1,800 jobs created or retained, and over 1,200 
individuals trained.
    One of the FY 2022 projects included a DRA Community Infrastructure 
Fund investment of $414,915 to Independence County, Arkansas. The 
investment funded two county-owned roads which were necessary to access 
the property utilized by American Stave Company. DRA funding was 
leveraged by the county to help execute the $23 million investment of 
private capital. American Stave is an international company established 
in 1912 and is the largest barrel maker in the world. The new stave 
mill will be the company's seventh domestic mill and an important 
addition to the supply of high-quality American white oak. The 
investment is helping to create 45 new jobs in an area where the 
poverty rate is nearly five percentage points higher than the national 
average (17.1 percent and 12.6 percent, respectively), and a higher 
unemployment rate compared to the national average (4.3 percent and 5.4 
percent, respectively).\5\

Estimates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As DRA continues to assess FY 2023 project and impact data, some 
highlighted regional investments include:
    <bullet>  DRA awarded $11.7 million in investments to 28 projects 
in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Missouri, and Tennessee through the Delta Workforce Grant Program 
(DWP). One of those investments included $450,000 to the Green River 
Area Development District to support a water and wastewater operator 
apprenticeship program serving residents in the Green River region of 
Western Kentucky.
    <bullet>  DRA awarded $630,400 to five communities in Illinois, 
Louisiana, and Missouri in its first round of funding through the 
Strategic Planning Program, including $150,000 to the Alexander-Cairo 
Port District located in Southern Illinois. The funding will be 
utilized to develop a master plan that will identify the scope for port 
development and the future of the riverport.
    <bullet>  DRA awarded a $3,539,000 investment that will boost 
economic development and improve the quality of life for current and 
future businesses and residents surrounding the BlueOval City 
automotive complex near Stanton, Tennessee. BlueOval City is Ford's 
largest, most advanced auto production complex in its history and will 
be home to the next-generation electric truck from Ford. Funding from 
this project is provided by the Community Infrastructure Fund. The 
investment will be matched by $8,140,000 in additional funds from U.S. 
Department of Agriculture Rural Development. The Town of Stanton 
investment project will provide water and sewer utility services to 
facilities critical to BlueOval City. The project is expected to create 
2,700 direct jobs and over 3,300 indirect jobs.

    Every five years, the DRA, by statute, is responsible for creating 
a regional development plan with public input that is approved by our 
board of governors. In February 2023, the Authority approved and 
released Navigating the Currents of Opportunity: DRA Regional 
Development Plan IV. This plan is not just a statement of our 
priorities but a driver of the actions we have begun to embark on to 
capitalize on tremendous opportunities, focus on rural and distressed 
communities, and strengthen regional economic development. DRA's 
strategic goals reflect the Authority's fourfold commitment to 
advancing infrastructure, job creation, business expansion, and local 
economies. Our strategic goals for the next five years include:
    <bullet>  DRA will expand and invest in the resiliency of the 
region's public infrastructure to improve residents' quality of life 
and increase economic opportunity.
    <bullet>  DRA will improve networks of agencies, organizations, 
businesses, and educational institutions providing workforce 
development opportunities. It will promote access to services, funding, 
and programs that enable career stability.
    <bullet>  DRA will strengthen the competitiveness of the region's 
employers, attract new employers to the region, and support the long-
term growth of micro and small businesses.
    <bullet>  DRA will expand efforts to enhance sustainable and 
inclusive local placemaking, quality of life, and community capacity.

    A part of DRA's commitment to build upon these priorities to expand 
its impact in the region includes outreach to DRA stakeholders, 
including local governments, nonprofit organizations, local development 
districts, community colleges and four-year institutions of higher 
learning. Some of these outreach and technical assistance efforts have 
included:
    <bullet>  Technical assistance and capacity-building training for 
Local Development Districts (LDD). In 2023, DRA conducted ten in-person 
and one virtual LDD training.
    <bullet>  Technical assistance and capacity-building training for 
the Workforce Opportunity for Rural Communities (WORC) Initiative, 
which is a partnership between the U.S. Department of Labor Employment 
and Training Administration, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), 
the DRA, and the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC), that funds 
grant projects within the Appalachian, Lower Mississippi Delta, and 
Northern Border regions. In 2023, DRA conducted one in-person Pre-
Technical Assistance training opportunity in Alexandria, Louisiana, for 
potential applicants applying for the WORC grant with over 80 attendees 
and one virtual Pre-Technical Assistance training opportunity.

    DRA has pursued its vision of the region as a place where people 
and businesses have access to economic opportunities in vibrant, 
sustainable, and resilient communities. To realize this vision, DRA has 
embraced its mission of applying innovative ideas and strategies to 
foster inclusive communities, strengthen regional collaboration, and 
achieve sustained economic development. One of DRA's recent initiatives 
in meeting these regional needs includes the Delta Revitalization 
through Innovation, Vision, and Equity (DRIVE) initiative in 
partnership with the University of Memphis Division of Research and 
Innovation. This project aims to support capacity building in selected 
small rural communities. DRIVE serves as a key component in the DRA-
supported research initiatives centered on economic and workforce 
development, economic recovery, transportation infrastructure, water 
and wastewater infrastructure, digital infrastructure, capacity 
building, business development and entrepreneurship.
    DRA's priority for reauthorization, which has been included in the 
Farm Bill in the past, is to continue to exist to provide critical 
resources to the heart of America. Additionally, it is important for 
the agency to seek out opportunities to improve upon its execution of 
its mission through amendments to its authorizing statute.
    The 2024 Budget included the following two proposals to amend DRA's 
authorizing statute:
    <bullet>  Adding ``Indian Tribes'' to Eligible Entities
       We propose an amendment to expressly include ``tribes'' in DRA's 
statute as an eligible entity. This amendment would be made, 
specifically and exclusively, to 7 U.S. Code Section 2009aa-2 Economic 
and Community Development Grants.

       Amend,

       ``(a) In General, The Authority may approve grants to States and 
public and nonprofit entities for projects, approved in accordance with 
section 2009aa-8 of this title'' to read ``The Authority may approve 
grants to States and local governments, Indian tribes, and public and 
nonprofit organizations for projects, approved in accordance with 
section 2009aa-8 of this title''

    <bullet>  Expand Grantmaking Language to align with other 
Commissions.
       We would like to add grantmaking language to align with the 
language of other regional commissions, including Southeast Crescent 
Regional Commission, Southwest Border Regional Commission, and Northern 
Border Regional Commission.

       The proposed amendment would be the addition of the following 
``new'' language as subparagraphs:
      (5)  to provide assistance to severely economically distressed 
and underdeveloped areas of its region that lack financial resources 
for improving basic health care and other public services;
      (6)  to promote resource conservation, tourism, recreation, and 
preservation of open space in a manner consistent with economic 
development goals;
      (7)  to promote the development of renewable and alternative 
energy sources; Causing renumeration of current subparagraph (5) to 
(8).

    In addition, the 2024 Budget included two legislative proposals 
through appropriations language:
    <bullet>  Allow User Fees.
       DRA requests authority to collect and spend discretionary user 
fees in conjunction with the Delta Doctors J-1 Visa Program. Consistent 
with Government Accountability Office (GAO) Redbook guidance on user 
fees, collections may only be spent on the cost to operate the visa 
program and may not be used to offset other agency programs or 
operations. The agency should set and announce the user fee for public 
comment consistent with the GAO Redbook.

       The Delta Doctors Program increases the number of doctors 
serving Delta residents. The program allows foreign physicians who are 
trained in the United States to work in medically underserved areas for 
three years by providing those physicians with J-1 Visa Waivers. 
Participants in the Delta Doctors program do not take jobs away from 
U.S.-born physicians. Instead, they provide services in areas where 
there would otherwise be a shortage of physicians. The impact of Delta 
Doctors in the region can be realized by the access to quality 
affordable healthcare and the economic impact the doctors make on the 
community in which they reside and practice. On average, each ``Delta 
Doctor'' is estimated to create five full-time jobs within their 
clinics and offices, and an additional 3.4 full and part-time jobs 
within the communities where they work.

       Under the proposed authority, DRA would collect user fees from 
health care institutions and spend the collections on the operation and 
staffing of the Delta Doctors Program.

    <bullet>  Deletion of sunsetting provision.
       DRA requests appropriations language to amend DRA's authorizing 
statute to remove section 382N of the Delta Regional Authority Act of 
2000. Currently, DRA continues to fulfill its mission notwithstanding 
the sunset clause because prior year appropriations language included a 
provision that allows the agency to continue to operate as long as it 
continues to have such funding available.

    DRA and its sister commissions serve a distinguished purpose and 
uniquely critical role within each of our regions. DRA's impact in the 
region is not just limited to the quantitative outputs from the 
agency's investments, but it is also connected to DRA's reputation as a 
regional partner working closely with local governments and local 
development districts to help find solutions to the challenges 
experienced in the region. It is critical that DRA remains a vital 
partner in the region to foster inclusive communities, strengthen 
regional collaboration and productive capacity, achieve sustained, 
long-term economic development, and produce meaningful opportunities 
for all people in the DRA region.

    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Dr. Wiggins.
    Mr. Saunders, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your 
testimony.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. CHRIS SAUNDERS, FEDERAL COCHAIR, NORTHERN 
                   BORDER REGIONAL COMMISSION

    Mr. Saunders. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Titus, members 
of the subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to appear 
before you today to discuss the impactful work of the Northern 
Border Regional Commission.
    This fall marks the 15th anniversary of the creation of our 
commission by Congress as part of the 2008 farm bill. And 
thanks to the continued investment and support of Congress, 
NBRC has quickly matured into a significant contributor to the 
economic development ecosystem in the northern border region.
    As the NBRC was modeled on the Appalachian Regional 
Commission and the Delta Regional Authority, it should come as 
no surprise that everything the commission does is rooted in 
partnership. We bring together the Federal Government and the 
leadership of our member States to utilize a regional lens to 
invest public dollars in local communities. This model doesn't 
just invite collaboration but requires it.
    We believe the ways in which we put this model into 
practice we are fulfilling the vision laid out by Congress to 
serve as an integrator of resources and a collaborator between 
all levels of Government.
    The commission is staffed by a dedicated team of 
professionals who live and work in the communities they serve 
and apply their knowledge and experience to shape the 
commission's programs and operations.
    Guiding this work is a vision that at its core, the mission 
of the NBRC is to build vibrant, rural communities and provide 
for the well-being of the residents that live there.
    We put this vision into practice in a variety of different 
ways, such as centering the needs of rural communities. The 
regional commission model was designed around the origination 
of projects at the local level. And we are pleased to share 
that in our latest grant round, of the 66 awards made, more 
than half were made to communities under 5,000 people. And just 
under half were made to communities that were first-time 
applicants to NBRC.
    We embrace the drivers of regional and local economies. The 
core of our territory is shaped by an ecological zone that is 
known as the Northern Forest, and that forest has experienced 
significant disruptions over the past three decades.
    Supporting the communities as they determine what the 
future of a forest economy means to them is a cornerstone of 
the commission's work. In some communities, this has meant 
supporting innovation in the wood products industry, while 
helping others to diversify their economies by investing in 
outdoor recreation infrastructure.
    As you have heard from my peers, many of our rural 
communities need significant investment in infrastructure. And 
I am pleased to share that as part of our Catalyst awards this 
summer, which is in part funded by the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, 50 percent of our awards were made to 
projects classified as infrastructure.
    We know that NBRC is very effective at leveraging other 
sources of funding. The commission has a strong track record of 
supporting projects that incorporate other funding sources. In 
fact, it is required in our project awards. And in this most 
recent round, our funds were matched at a nearly 1-to-4 ratio, 
turning $40 million of Federal investment into a total 
investment of $200 million across the region.
    NBRC is also addressing the capacity gap in rural areas.
    A limiting factor on many of our small communities to 
participate in Federal grant programs is a lack of access to 
capacity, namely people and organizations who play a critical 
role in the planning, development, and execution of economic 
development initiatives.
    The commission operates a State capacity program that is 
authorized in statute that builds human capacity at the 
statewide level and at local organizations and technical 
assistance providers.
    Similar to ARC and DRA, we are responsive to emerging 
needs. The commission evaluates what role it should play in 
addressing obstacles that limit economic opportunity in rural 
areas. And increasingly, housing and access to healthcare have 
emerged as barriers to growth. We are actively considering how 
best to leverage our resources in order to complement, not 
replicate, the work of other agencies in this area.
    Each of these points illustrates a way in which the 
commission is maximizing its unique structure as a regional 
agency to the benefit of rural areas.
    As I have noted, all our work is rooted in partnership, and 
we see Congress as a key collaborator in determining the 
commission's priorities.
    Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of Representatives 
introduced H.R. 4188, the Northern Border Regional Commission 
Reauthorization Act, and this bill has been cosponsored by 
nearly every Member of Congress from districts representing 
counties included in the commission territory.
    We appreciate the work that has gone into drafting this 
legislation and its companion bill in the Senate.
    We look forward to working with Congress, and I am pleased 
to answer questions regarding the commission's work to better 
our region.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look 
forward to your questions.
    [Mr. Saunders' prepared statement follows:]

      Prepared Statement of Hon. Chris Saunders, Federal Cochair,
                  Northern Border Regional Commission
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Titus, Members of the Subcommittee, 
thank you for the invitation to appear before the Subcommittee today to 
discuss the impactful work of the Northern Border Regional Commission 
(NBRC).
    This fall marks the fifteenth anniversary of the creation of our 
Commission by Congress as part of the 2008 Farm Bill. Thanks to the 
continued investment and support of Congress, NBRC has quickly matured 
into a significant contributor to the economic development ecosystem in 
the Northern Border Region.
    As the NBRC was modeled on the Appalachian Regional Commission and 
the Delta Regional Authority, it will come as no surprise that 
everything the Commission does is rooted in partnership. We bring 
together the federal government and the leadership of our member states 
to utilize a regional lens to invest public dollars in local 
communities.
    This model doesn't just invite collaboration, but requires it. We 
believe that in the ways in which we put this model into practice, we 
are fulfilling the vision laid out by Congress to serve as an 
integrator of resources and a collaborator between all levels of 
government; be they municipal, county, state or federal. The Commission 
is staffed by a dedicated team of professionals, who live and work in 
the communities they serve, and apply their knowledge and experience to 
shape the Commission's programs and operations.
    Guiding this work is a vision that at its core, the mission of the 
NBRC is to build vibrant rural communities and provide for the well-
being of the residents who live there. We put this vision into practice 
in a variety of different ways such as:
    <bullet>  Centering the needs of rural communities--The regional 
commission model is designed around the origination of projects at the 
local level. That is no different in the NBRC territory where we 
maintain a network of Local Development Districts that collaborate with 
municipalities and non-profits to develop and submit applications to 
the Commission for funding. The Commission continues to look for ways 
to prioritize delivering our funds to rural communities. We are pleased 
to share that in our latest grant round, of the 66 awards made, more 
than half were made to communities with under 5,000 people and just 
under half were made to communities who were first time NBRC 
applicants.\1\

NBRC%202023%20Catalyst%20Grant
%20Awards%20Press%20Release%20-%20August%202023%20FINAL.pdf

    <bullet>  Embracing drivers of regional and local economies--The 
core of the Commission's territory is shaped by an ecological zone 
known as the Northern Forest. Stretching across Northern Maine, New 
Hampshire, Vermont, and New York, the area represents one of the most 
densely forested regions in the country and at 26 million acres is the 
largest continuous forest east of the Mississippi. The economy and 
settlement patterns of the region were both shaped and defined by 
timber harvesting and paper making for nearly two centuries. The forest 
economy has experienced serious disruptions over the past three decades 
and supporting communities as they determine what the future of a 
forest economy means to them is a cornerstone of the Commission's work. 
In some communities this is supporting the commercialization of cross 
laminated timber utilizing local species such as hemlock, new wood 
fiber-based businesses such as new forms of insulation, or the 
residential and institutional conversion to modern wood heat. Other 
communities aim to diversify their local economy with many investing in 
their natural assets and outdoor recreation infrastructure. 
Accordingly, NBRC has recognized these areas as regional priorities, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and developed programs focused on supporting these industries.

    <bullet>  Investing in infrastructure--Like many rural areas, our 
territory needs investment in public infrastructure that will 
facilitate additional private and public investments. Congress has 
recognized this should be a priority funding area for NBRC, stipulating 
in our statute that a minimum of 40 percent of our grant awards should 
be made to infrastructure projects. NBRC meets and exceeds this 
threshold with its investments across the region on an annual basis. In 
our latest round of Catalyst awards, which is funded in part by the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), 57 percent were made to 
projects classified as infrastructure.

    <bullet>  Leveraging other sources of funding--While NBRC requires 
a local match for its funding, the Commission has a strong track record 
of supporting projects that incorporate other funding sources. In 
NBRC's most recent Catalyst round, our funds were matched at a nearly 
1:4 ratio, turning $43.6 million of NBRC funding into $208.5 million in 
total investment across our four-state region.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Id.

    <bullet>  Addressing the capacity gap in rural areas--A limiting 
factor on the ability of many small communities to participate in 
federal grant programs is a lack of access to capacity, namely people 
and organizations who play a critical role in the planning, 
development, and execution of economic development initiatives. The 
Commission operates a State Capacity Grant program as authorized in 
statute, that builds human capacity at the statewide level as well as 
at local organizations and technical assistance providers. The 
resources offer communities assistance and guidance in developing their 
project ideas and with understanding the requirements of applying for 
awards and successfully administering them once received. A number of 
our peer commissions have strong programs in this area and we continue 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
to look to their experiences and lessons to better serve our region.

    <bullet>  Responding to emerging needs--Additionally, the 
Commission evaluates what role it should play in addressing obstacles 
that limit economic opportunity in rural areas. Increasingly both 
housing and access to health care have emerged as significant 
priorities for many rural communities. While the Commission is able to 
fund projects in both of these areas, we are actively considering how 
to best leverage our resources in order to complement, and not 
replicate, the work of other agencies. One such strategy is 
establishing a J-1 Visa Waiver program that will allow for the 
recruitment of foreign-born physicians trained in the United States to 
rural areas. Another has been to contributing to the creation of new 
housing in the region by funding the water and wastewater 
infrastructure needed for these developments to move forward.

    Each of these points illustrate a way in which the Commission is 
maximizing its unique structure as a regional agency to the benefit of 
rural areas. Looking beyond the broad themes of our work, I am happy to 
offer some specific project examples that highlight how this work plays 
out in practice.
    In our most recent Catalyst round, the Commission awarded $2.25 
million to the Town of Killington, Vermont. While the town is well 
known as a ski destination, the majority of visitors to the area, and 
many neighboring residents, are less familiar with the ways in which 
failing infrastructure has inhibited economic growth, impaired drinking 
water, and have contributed to outmigration and a falling population in 
the county. The Commission's investment in public water and road 
infrastructure will help the town address a water supply contaminated 
by PFAS and make critical safety upgrades to a highly traveled roadway. 
The public investment of funds is the cornerstone to facilitating 
development of hundreds of housing units and nearly $285 million in 
private investment. These plans have been decades in the making and 
will now become a reality in part because of the Commission's 
investment.
    Nearly every community and business the Commission engages with 
raises workforce development as a challenge to economic growth. In the 
summer of 2022 NBRC awarded $285,000 to the North Country Chamber of 
Commerce located in Plattsburgh, New York, for an important workforce 
development project. Many of our communities are seeking ways to 
bolster domestic manufacturing and this project is providing trainees 
with the skills required to obtain a welding job at a number of North 
Country-based manufacturing employers. By aggregating the needs of 
multiple local manufacturers, and providing training at no-cost, this 
project offers just one example of the ways in which NBRC is helping to 
address both short and long-term workforce needs of the employers in 
our region.
    Economic development in rural areas often looks very different than 
it does in cities. One city block may be completely transformed over 
the course of one year with one large project. In contrast, the 
development of one building on a rural main street might take an entire 
year, if not longer. Rural communities often need to stitch together 
multiple sources of patient capital to undertake one project, but once 
completed that successful project can have a catalyzing impact on an 
entire town.
    Such is the case with the redevelopment of the Parker Noyes 
Building in Lancaster, New Hampshire, undertaken by the Northern Forest 
Center. An award from NBRC was a small portion of the capital stack 
assembled to renovate this cornerstone block in downtown Lancaster in 
order to transform it into a local food hub and six market-rate 
apartments. The redevelopment has sparked follow-on private investment 
on Lancaster's Main Street, with multiple other properties being 
purchased with the goal of renovating them into mixed-use developments. 
NBRC's investment played a small but meaningful role in ensuring the 
project could move forward, ultimately fostering increased economic 
development in the town.
    These three examples demonstrate the different ways rural 
communities utilize NBRC's flexible funding to achieve their aims. As 
the Commission continues its existing programs, we are also actively 
planning for the future. The Commission is part way through the writing 
of a new strategic plan that will help shape our work over the next 
five years. This work will complement the input and direction we get 
from our partners in Congress.
    Earlier this year, a bi-partisan group of Representatives 
introduced H.R. 4188, the Northern Border Regional Commission 
Reauthorization Act of 2023. The bill has been cosponsored by nearly 
every Member of Congress from districts representing counties included 
in the Commission territory. We appreciate the work that has gone into 
drafting this legislation and its companion bill, S.292, introduced and 
cosponsored by the Senators from our region. The proposed 
reauthorization contains a handful of administrative provisions with 
the objective of streamlining the Commission functions, and a few 
additional investment areas and provisions that mirror the statutes of 
our peer commissions designed to make federal funds more accessible to 
resource-limited communities.
    We look forward to working with Congress and am pleased to answer 
questions regarding the Commission's work to better our region. Thank 
you again for the opportunity to testify and I look forward to your 
questions.

    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    Dr. Reed, you are recognized for 5 minutes for your 
testimony.

    TESTIMONY OF HON. JENNIFER CLYBURN REED, Ed.D., FEDERAL 
        COCHAIR, SOUTHEAST CRESCENT REGIONAL COMMISSION

    Ms. Reed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Titus, 
committee members, and staff. Thank you for the opportunity to 
testify on behalf of the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission 
since being activated in January of 2022.
    I also want to thank the Members of Congress and President 
Biden for their confidence and support for this region. There 
is an abundance of greatness and potential here.
    Many thanks to the Members of Congress who have met with me 
over the past 22 months and offered support to SCRC as we 
create and formalize policies and procedures to meet the needs 
of its 51 million residents and generate jobs and opportunities 
within the 428 counties, spanning over 210,000 square miles.
    The region consists of seven States: portions of Alabama, 
Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, 
and the whole State of Florida. Currently, it is the largest of 
all the active regional commissions.
    I have much appreciation for State Cochair Governor Henry 
McMaster and the other Governors, Governor's alternates, 
program managers, and staff who have shown and continue to show 
their support and commitment to SCRC.
    Two years ago, I sat before the Senate Committee on 
Environment and Public Works as a nominee. At that time, I 
identified goals which included assessing the needs of each 
community, naming regional challenges, and determining the 
tools needed to transition counties from a distressed economic 
designation.
    Today, I will share what I have learned and how SCRC is 
progressing.
    Upon establishing the commission, we worked to develop an 
initial set of bylaws. A seven-State survey was disseminated 
with questions that centered around, ``What will make you love 
where you live?'' We hosted virtual ``Coffee and 
Conversations'' in each State to introduce SCRC and to glean a 
better understanding of each State's needs.
    SCRC also held collaboration sessions to hear how regional 
stakeholders thought economic growth, development, and 
sustainability should look.
    Information from these efforts led to the formation of 
SCRC's 5-year strategic plan. Additionally, partner States 
created State economic development plans, which illuminated 
each Governor's priorities.
    Feedback from the information-gathering efforts revealed 
six overarching goals: invest in critical infrastructure, 
improve health access and outcomes, strengthen workforce 
capacity, foster entrepreneurial and business development, 
expand affordable housing stock and access, and promote 
environmental conservation and preservation.
    During that hearing 2 years ago, Senator Carper suggested 
that I find what works and do more of that. SCRC commissioned a 
three-part health assessment to address gaps in healthcare 
needs and access. Nationally, 76 rural hospital closures have 
been reported between 2011 and 2021. Nearly 20 percent occurred 
within the southeast crescent region.
    When preparing for the start of the flagship grant program, 
SCRC formalized cooperative agreements with all participating 
States and the 55 local development districts to strengthen 
economic development and sustainability.
    In June, SCRC launched its inaugural State Economic 
Development and Infrastructure grant program. The pre-
application phase is now complete; 363 pre-applications 
totaling $119 million were submitted and are now under review; 
$20 million will be spent on these worthwhile projects.
    The large number of projects that SCRC cannot fund this 
year shows the high demand for economic development and 
infrastructure investment.
    I look forward to working with Congress on H.R. 5899, a 
bipartisan bill to reauthorize the commission.
    SCRC is committed to building sustainable communities and 
fortifying economic growth in its 428 counties. We look forward 
to building partnerships with local, State, and other Federal 
entities to ensure a prosperous future for all who call the 
southeast crescent region home.
    Thank you for your time and attention.

   Prepared Statement of Hon. Jennifer Clyburn Reed, Ed.D., Federal 
            Cochair, Southeast Crescent Regional Commission
    Good morning.
    Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, Committee Members and Staff, 
thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Southeast 
Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC) and share how it has progressed 
since being activated in January 2022. I also want to thank the members 
of Congress and President Biden for your confidence and support for 
this region of the country. There is an abundance of greatness and 
potential here.
    Many thanks to all the Members of Congress who have met with me 
over the past 22 months and offered support to SCRC as we create and 
formalize policies and procedures to meet the needs of its 51 million 
residents and generate jobs and opportunities within the 428 counties 
which span over 210,000 square miles. The region, or footprint, 
consists of seven states--portions of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and all of Florida. 
Currently, it is the largest of all active regional commissions.
    I have much appreciation for my State co-chair, Governor McMaster, 
and the other Governors, Governor's Alternates, program managers, and 
staff who have shown and continue to show their commitment to the 
region by putting forth great effort.
    Two years ago, almost to the day, I sat before the Senate Committee 
on Environment and Public Works as a nominee. At that time, I 
identified goals to pursue--assess the needs of each community, name 
regional challenges, and determine the tools needed to transition 
counties out from a distressed economic designation to transitional or 
attainment status. Today, I'll share what I've learned and how SCRC has 
progressed.
    Immediately after acquiring an Employer Identification Number 
(EIN), work commenced to develop an initial set of bylaws. A seven-
state survey was disseminated with questions that centered around, 
``What will make you love where you Live?'' We hosted virtual ``Coffee 
and Conversations'' in each state to introduce SCRC and glean a better 
understanding of each state's needs. SCRC also held Collaboration 
Sessions to hear how regional stakeholders thought economic growth, 
development, and sustainability should look.
    Information from the seven-state survey, Coffee and Conversations, 
and Collaboration Sessions was compiled to formulate SCRC's Five-Year 
strategic plan. Additionally, participating partner states created 
state economic development plans which illuminated each Governor's 
priorities.
    Feedback from the information gathering efforts revealed six 
overarching goals for SCRC to reach to have a positive impact within 
the footprint:
    (1)  invest in critical infrastructure,
    (2)  improve health and support services access and outcomes,
    (3)  strengthen workforce capacity,
    (4)  foster entrepreneurial and business development activities,
    (5)  expand affordable housing stock and access, and
    (6)  promote environmental conservation, preservation, and access.

    These guiding principles are in sync with SCRC's statutory 
obligations to:
    <bullet>  develop public, transportation and telecommunications 
infrastructure;
    <bullet>  assist with job skills training, business development and 
entrepreneurship;
    <bullet>  provide access to basic health care and other public 
services;
    <bullet>  promote conservation, tourism, recreation, and the 
preservation of open space; and
    <bullet>  also encourage the use of renewable and alternative 
energy sources.

    During that hearing two years ago, Senator Carper suggested that I 
find what works and do more of that. In response to the data gleaned 
from outreach efforts, most notably, SCRC found gaps in healthcare 
access. Of the 76 rural hospital closures between 2011 and 2021, nearly 
20% occurred within the Southeast Crescent region. In response to that 
statistic, SCRC was encouraged to use the J1 Visa Waiver Program. It 
was already being offered by two other regional commissions and proved 
highly successful. In conjunction with the Department of State, SCRC 
processed its first application in November 2021 and, to date, has 
successfully retained 65 doctors in areas of the region where health 
access was lacking. SCRC also commissioned a three-part health 
assessment of the region. Part I compiled data for the 166 distressed 
counties and is now complete. Part II will focus on the 177 
transitional counties and Part III will gather data for the 85 
attainment counties.
    When preparing for the start of the flagship grant program, SCRC 
formalized cooperative agreements with all participating states and the 
55 local development districts to fortify economic development and 
sustainability in communities.
    SCRC launched the inaugural State Economic Development and 
Infrastructure (SEID) grant program in June 2023 and the pre-
application phase is now complete. 363 pre-applications totaling $119 
million were submitted and are currently under review--an extraordinary 
showing for the first grant opportunity cycle. There was a wide range 
of projects with the percentage of construction projects at 56% and 
non-construction projects at 44%. Fiscal Year appropriations plus 
funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law totaling $20 million 
will be spent on these worthwhile projects. The large number of 
projects that SCRC cannot fund this year shows the high demand for 
economic development and infrastructure investment in our region.
    I look forward to working with Congress on H.R. 5899, the 
Southeastern Crescent Economic Empowerment Act. This bipartisan bill to 
reauthorize the Commission includes legislative proposals from the 2024 
Budget, such as authority for the State Capacity Building Program and 
identifying promoting housing accessibility as an eligible activity.
    SCRC is committed to building sustainable communities and 
strengthening economic growth in the 428 counties and county 
equivalents that make up the Southeast Crescent footprint. We look 
forward to continuing partnerships with local, state, and Federal 
entities to allow SCRC to achieve its mission, ensuring a prosperous 
future for the people who call the Southeast Crescent region home. 
Thank you for your time and attention.

    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Dr. Reed.
    Mr. Boyle, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

    TESTIMONY OF GARRETT C. BOYLE, FEDERAL COCHAIR, DENALI 
                           COMMISSION

    Mr. Boyle. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member 
Titus, and honorable members of the committee. Thank you for 
inviting me to testify and providing this opportunity to 
present the Denali Commission's perspective.
    We are unique among the other regional commissions, as we 
operate solely in Alaska. While this may seem like a narrow 
focus, I assure you, it is not.
    Alaska has a population of just over 730,000 people spread 
out over more than 571,000 square miles of land area, which 
makes the State larger than Texas, California, and Montana 
combined and leaves us with a population density of about 1.27 
people per square mile.
    Alaska has about 160 municipalities, ranging in size from 
about 20 to around 300,000. Of these municipalities, 86 percent 
are not connected to the road system, which means everything 
the community needs is either barged or flown in, significantly 
driving up costs and logistical problems.
    About 80 percent of these municipalities are considered 
rural, meaning a population of less than 1,500. Slightly more 
than 50 percent have less than 500 residents; 13 percent less 
than 100. Only 6 have more than 30,000 residents.
    Many of those smaller communities do not have much in the 
way of a cash economy. Many who live there still follow a 
traditional lifestyle. The municipality often does not have tax 
authority, and there is not much to tax even if it did. The 
infrastructure base is frequently decades behind most of the 
country.
    I share this information with the committee to illustrate 
the challenges of promoting economic development in the rural 
parts of Alaska, which is where the Denali Commission does the 
majority of its work.
    We aim to address the challenges presented by Alaska's 
geography and low population in a holistic way.
    To begin, many villages are powered exclusively by diesel 
generators. The cost of electricity averages 47 cents per 
kilowatthour in rural communities, but it ranges from a high of 
$1.50 to a low of about 37 cents.
    As a point of comparison, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
states the average cost of power here in the DMV area is 16.2 
cents per kilowatthour.
    It is incredibly hard to have an economy when power costs 
that much.
    We fund a wide array of energy projects, from new power 
houses, bulk fuel tank farms, and, increasingly, renewables in 
order to bring those costs down. We engage in efforts to bring 
broadband to these areas to provide more economic 
opportunities.
    Several years ago, the commission started working groups to 
raise awareness and encourage stakeholders to consider a 
statewide strategy. This outreach resulted in technical 
assistance grants in eight regions supporting planning, 
engineering, strategy, and applications to larger grant 
opportunities.
    As a specific example, the commission's grant to the Tanana 
Chiefs Conference, which is a Tribal organization representing 
42 Tribes in the interior, resulted in three winning grants 
from different programs for over $90 million in investment.
    We also have direct economic development efforts. Last 
year, we partnered with the Southeast Conference, a regional 
economic development organization, and pledged $1.5 million in 
non-Federal match to their Build Back Better regional challenge 
application, which resulted in a $49 million award to the 
Alaska Mariculture Cluster.
    This award will help grow the mariculture industry to a 
target of $325 million per year, supporting 1,800 jobs across 
the State from Ketchikan in the southeast to Unalaska far out 
the Aleutian Chain in the southwest, in 20 years.
    Finally, the Village Infrastructure Protection Program has 
been working with Tribal, local, regional, State, and Federal 
partners to support the resilience of Alaskan communities. We 
have funded the planning, partnership, and construction efforts 
to move communities to safer environments while also protecting 
communities in place and assisting in managed retreats.
    One project has used our funding to leverage additional 
support and generate more opportunity for Alaskan communities. 
Our partnership with the Alaska Native Tribal Health 
Consortium's Center for Environmentally Threatened Communities, 
which I will call CETC for short, began in 2016. Recognizing 
the value in this partnership, the commission has increased the 
awards over the years.
    Since program inception and June 30, 2023, the CETC has 
provided technical assistance to 39 communities and secured $43 
million across 133 projects to benefit 44 different 
communities.
    The commission is proud of our work to improve the lives of 
Alaskans, especially those in rural communities. We look 
forward to working with your committee, and we would welcome a 
discussion about potential legislative changes that can 
strengthen the work of the commission.
    Thank you for convening this hearing, and I welcome your 
questions.
    [Mr. Boyle's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
        Prepared Statement of Garrett C. Boyle, Federal Cochair,
                           Denali Commission
    Chairman Perry, Ranking Member Titus, and Honorable Members of the 
Subcommittee,
    Thank you for inviting me to testify and providing this opportunity 
to present the Denali Commission's perspective. We are unique among the 
other regional commissions, as we operate solely in Alaska. While that 
may seem like a narrow focus, I assure you it is not. Alaska has a 
population of just over 730,000 people, spread out over more than 
571,000 square miles of land area, which makes the state larger than 
Texas, California, and Montana combined, and leaves us with a 
population density of 1.27 people per square mile.
    Alaska has approximately 160 municipalities, ranging in size from 
around 20 to about 300,000. Of those municipalities, 86 percent are not 
connected to the road system, which means everything the community 
needs is either flown or barged in, significantly driving up costs and 
logistical problems. About 80 percent of the municipalities are 
considered rural, meaning a population of less than 1,500. Slightly 
more than 50 percent have less than 500 residents, 13 percent less than 
100 residents.\1\ Only six have more than 30,000 residents. Many of 
those smaller communities do not have much in the way of a cash 
economy; many who live there still follow a traditional lifestyle, the 
municipality often does not have tax authority and there is not much to 
tax even if it did, and the infrastructure base is frequently decades 
behind most of the country.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I share this information with the Committee to illustrate the 
challenges of promoting economic development in the rural parts of 
Alaska, which is where the Denali Commission does the majority of its 
work. To illustrate: in fiscal year 2022, of the $21 million the 
Commission awarded, 97% was allocated to areas that were considered 
economically distressed or disadvantaged. For fiscal year 2023, we will 
be making awards that total just under $32 million, of which 97 percent 
will go to disadvantaged or distressed areas. The Denali Commission 
aims to address the challenges presented by Alaska's geography and low 
population in a holistic way.
    To begin, many villages are powered exclusively by diesel 
generators. The cost of electricity averages 47 cents per kilowatt hour 
in rural communities, but it ranges from a high of $1.50 to a low of 
about 37 cents.\2\ As a point of comparison, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics states the average cost of power here in the DMV area is 
16.2 cents per kilowatt hour. It is incredibly hard to have an economy 
when power costs that much. Rural Alaskan households spend an estimated 
27 percent of their annual income on energy--which includes both power 
and home heating--compared to 7 percent for urban Alaskans.

Power%20Cost%20Equalization/FY22%20PCE
%20Community%20Report.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One factor that influences the cost of all rural energy is the 
availability of bulk fuel purchasing--which relies on an appropriately 
sized and code compliant bulk fuel tank farm--such that heating oil and 
diesel for power generation, as well as transportation fuels, can be 
purchased and delivered in bulk by barge during the brief seasonal 
windows of \3\ opportunity, where that's possible, rather than in 
smaller, more costly quantities throughout the year delivered by 
airplane. Even in communities with renewable energy integrated into the 
power generation mix there's still a critical need for bulk fuel 
purchase and storage. Without significant state and federal investment 
in these critical bulk fuel facilities, the cost of rural energy would 
be exponentially higher. A 2016 study found that public investments in 
this infrastructure saved sometimes more than $2.00/gallon in the cost 
of the fuels stored there.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As Alaska continues advancing down the long and slow road to a 
carbon-reduced energy future, our rural communities' energy systems 
will have an unavoidable place for diesel. At a minimum, it will be 
needed for backup power generation and for building heat, and the 
futuristic possibility of someday displacing all of rural Alaska's 
diesel with renewables for power and heat is at best several decades 
away if for no other reason than it takes a long time to make change in 
these far-flung places. In the meantime, bulk fuel tank farms will 
continue playing a critical role in the rural Alaska community 
landscape. One bulk fuel project costs around $9 million these days. 
Since 1999, the Commission has invested more than $255 million in bulk 
fuel projects; $115.7 million of those funds have come from the TAPL 
transfers, $70 million from the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), and 
$44.5 million from the Commission's ``base'' appropriations that come 
from the Energy & Water bill to match the RUS funds. Additional base 
appropriations have been used to reach more communities, and the 
Commission has also received funding from the EPA to do bulk fuel work. 
While we have partnered with the Rural Utilities Service to fund some 
of these projects in the past, but going forward, the Commission will 
likely be the only federal agency to provide funding for diesel power 
generation.
    While they may not fit into the idealistic picture of renewable and 
sustainable energy, well maintained bulk fuel tank farms in good 
condition provide a level of security that helps manage energy costs 
and, by allowing confidence to members of a community that they will 
make it through winter without having to make the impossibly hard 
choice between feeding their families or keeping the house warm, builds 
the kind of resilience that makes planning and innovation possible--the 
very things we need to advance farther down our carbon-reduced energy 
road.
    Much of Alaska's foundational energy infrastructure--bulk fuel tank 
farms, rural powerhouses, and distribution systems--are aged beyond 
their expected useful life. Inadequate operations and maintenance due 
to funding shortages and management capacity challenges, combined with 
the harsh climates in which these facilities are located, exacerbated 
by the effects of a rapidly changing climate, has created an 
overwhelming backlog of deferred maintenance for energy infrastructure 
throughout rural Alaska. The Alaska Energy Authority estimates more 
than $300 million for powerhouses and more than $800 million for bulk 
fuel tank farms is needed for critical repairs or replacements. The 
cost of distribution system upgrades is not included in this estimate 
but is undoubtedly a high cost as well. The more time it takes to meet 
the deferred maintenance need for critical rural energy facilities will 
inevitably raise the price tag, and more importantly, it increases the 
risk of infrastructure failure, which results in a cascade of 
additional social, environmental, and financial consequences. We fund a 
wide array of energy projects--from new powerhouses, tank farms, and 
increasingly, renewables--in order to bring those costs down.
    We also engage in efforts to bring broadband to these rural areas. 
Several years ago, the Commission started hosting working groups to 
raise awareness and consider a statewide strategy, working with 12 
Alaska Native Regional Corporations, 12 regional Native nonprofits, and 
other statewide nonprofits. This outreach resulted in technical 
assistance planning grants in eight regions supporting planning, 
engineering, strategy, and applications. As a specific example, the 
Commission's Grant to the Tanana Chiefs Conference, representing 42 
interior tribes, resulted in Applications submitted to U.S. Department 
of Agriculture (USDA) Community Connect, National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration (NTIA) Tribal Broadband Connectivity 
Program 1, USDA ReConnect 3, and USDA ReConnect 4, resulting in three 
winning grants for over $90 million as of Spring 2023, with several 
anticipated Awards pending as of Fall 2023. The Commission achieved 
success through early awareness of the opportunity and focused 
response, developed with key regional partners meshing the best 
approach to building complex networks in remote communities.
    The Commission's transportation program was reauthorized in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and we are engaged in helping 
build out economically impactful projects in this space as well. One 
such project is the Commission's award to the village of Emmonak for 
dock storage. The Denali Commission awarded the Emmonak Dock Storage 
Project $200,000 to remove the scrap metal and convert the site into 
the first-ever secure, fenced storage facility for port operations, 
emergency response supplies and boats in Emmonak. This will advance the 
City's goals toward building a full-service port that will support the 
regional commercial fishing industry that employs hundreds of workers 
from local communities in the region. The Dock Storage Project will not 
only benefit the City of Emmonak but will support better operations for 
barge services that provide many goods to communities of the Lower 
Yukon Region. Another award to the Bristol Bay Native Association aims 
to identify the preferred alignments for approximately 60 miles of new 
roads that will connect the communities of Ekwok, New Stuyahok, 
Koliganek, to Aleknagik, which has road access to the regional 
community of Dillingham. The project increases access to economic 
opportunities in the region by surveying more reliable and efficient 
travel routes that could be utilized year-round, and will conduct 
planning, engagement, and preliminary engineering activities for the 
project.
    We also have direct economic development efforts. Last year, we 
partnered with the Southeast Conference--a regional economic 
development organization--and pledged $1.5 million in non-federal match 
to their Build Back Better regional challenge application, which 
resulted in a $49 million award to the Alaska Mariculture Cluster. This 
award will help grow the mariculture industry to a target of $325 
million per year, supporting 1,800 jobs across the state from Ketchikan 
in the Southeast to Unalaska, far out the Aleutian Chain, in the 
Southwest in 20 years. This project also involves numerous private 
sector partners, ranging from the Sealaska Corporation and numerous 
seafood companies to several philanthropic partners. In fiscal year 
2022, the Commission awarded $1.3 million in direct economic 
development awards.
    Finally, the Village Infrastructure Protection Program has been 
working with Tribal, local, regional, state, and federal partners to 
continue to support the resilience of Alaskan communities. We have 
funded the planning, partnership, and construction efforts to move 
communities to safer environments while also protecting communities in 
place and assisting in managed retreats. All of these impact the well-
being of the Alaskan economy. One project has used our funding to 
leverage more funding and generate more opportunity for Alaskan 
communities. The Commission's partnership with the Alaska Native Tribal 
Health Consortium-Grant Center for Environmentally Threatened 
Communities (CETC) began in 2016. Recognizing the value in this 
partnership, the Commission has increased the award over the years with 
the most recent amendment providing the CETC with another $500,000. 
Between program inception and June 30, 2023, CETC has provided 
technical assistance to 39 communities and secured $43 million to 
benefit 44 communities across 133 projects. Every three cents invested 
by the Denali Commission into CETC has resulted in one dollar for 
infrastructure protection in Alaska communities.
    The Denali Commission is proud of our work to improve the lives of 
Alaskans, especially those living in rural communities. We look forward 
to working with your Committee, and we would welcome a discussion about 
potential legislative changes that can strengthen the work of the 
Commission. Thank you for convening this important hearing, and I 
welcome your questions.

    Mr. Perry [presiding]. Thank you, all. The Chair does thank 
you for your testimony.
    And we will now turn to questions for our witnesses. The 
Chair recognizes himself for 5 minutes for questions.
    I think there is a reasonable claim to be made that 
regional commissions do duplicative work at multiple levels of 
Government. There are State and local programs for almost 
everything.
    I am not going to read through all of it because that would 
spend all the time. But we have the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Small 
Business Administration, U.S. Department of Education, 
Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, 
Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, Department of 
Transportation, Department of Agriculture, and a panoply of 
programs, and all of those agencies that do exactly what you 
do, and yet you do it, too. It's just inefficient.
    Let me ask you this, Ms. Manchin. I am close to the 
Appalachian Regional Commission geographically. It is not in 
the district that I represent, it is adjacent to it. I am 
looking at a map here, and I am sure you are probably familiar 
with the map.
    So, if I look at that, all the white area is counties that 
aren't included. The gray areas are attainment counties. So, 
what, 58 years this has been going on? I see one, two, three, 
three attainment areas. This is a map as of 2023 [indicating 
map], everybody to see here. I mean, for 58 years we have got 
attainment of three counties here.
    What is the cost over the 58 years for the Appalachian 
Regional Commission? Can you tell us that?
    Ms. Manchin. Well, thank you very much. And I appreciate--
we do look at that. I have lived in the Appalachian region all 
of my life, and so, I have seen the isolation and the poverty 
that is there.
    And so, we have been building--we have been on the mission 
of building the highway system since 1965, and we are now about 
91 percent complete on that. Building highways through the 
mountains is not an easy task. And it also takes cooperation 
with the States and funding that comes from several different 
arenas.
    Mr. Perry. Did you say 95 percent complete?
    Ms. Manchin. Ninety-one.
    Mr. Perry. Ninety-one. So, if you are 91 percent complete 
since 1965, do we have to wait until we are 100 percent 
complete in building the highways before we see any of these 
counties go from attainment to anything better than attainment?
    Ms. Manchin. Well, certainly. I mean, Corridor H that comes 
from Washington across and comes into the eastern panhandle of 
West Virginia is one of the latest, Corridor H----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. I am familiar with it.
    Ms. Manchin [continuing]. And we are working on that. But 
it takes--this is a series of years. You don't build the 
highway in a year.
    Mr. Perry. I get it, I mean. But we are talking about an 
area that is right here [indicating map], but we have got this 
whole thing right here. Some of this is dark red or black, 
almost distressed, one, two, three counties, one in Virginia, 
one in Georgia, one in Alabama. So, if you are 95 percent or 91 
percent complete . . .
    Ms. Manchin. That is through the entire, from southern New 
York----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Yes. So, why aren't we seeing 
more counties meet attainment? I mean, it has been 58 years. 
And with all due respect, I know you haven't been there for 58 
years, but this is costly to the American people.
    Ms. Manchin. Well, because there is--because you build the 
highways and then you have the impact of when coal goes up and 
when then coal went down and 70 percent of the jobs lost.
    Mr. Perry. OK. Fair enough. But----
    Ms. Manchin [interrupting]. If you notice, the highly 
distressed counties are through southern West Virginia and 
eastern Kentucky.
    Mr. Perry. So, just to be clear here, in my opinion, the 
coal industry has been destroyed by the Federal Government. It 
just didn't go away on its own, it has been destroyed by the 
Federal Government. And if the Federal Government was so 
concerned about the Appalachian region, maybe they should have 
thought about that before they destroyed the economic vitality, 
maybe what little there was or is in the Appalachian region. 
But they did that.
    That having been said, I am looking at, this is the 
Appalachian Regional Commission, the city of Toccoa, Georgia, 
the Ritz Theatre Annex, $750,000, to include the expanded 
lobby, concession stand, merchandising stand, bathroom, 
storage, ticketing, balcony access, and more.
    Now, I don't know if that county is the one county in 
Georgia that has reached attainment, but it doesn't seem to me 
that money went for building a highway.
    And, God bless them, I am sure they love their theater. I 
have got a theater that I represent in Middletown that we would 
love to have kept open because it was historic, but nobody 
could afford to keep it.
    We spent a boatload of money on the one in New Cumberland, 
Pennsylvania. We did it. We didn't ask people from California, 
New York, and Florida to do it, we did it. These are State and 
local issues. These are not Federal issues. And how do we 
justify?
    And I don't mean to pick on you, ma'am. I mean, I can go 
through a list here.
    We have got, in the northern border region, the fund, the 
replacement of a double chair lift and to upgrade existing 
snowmaking infrastructure. How about purchase of a trail 
groomer and a Mogul Master drag? I live within eyesight of a 
ski resort where I live, and I am sure they would love to have 
the Federal Government pay for their snowmaking, their chair 
lift, and their new snow machinery. I am sure they would love 
it.
    And then in the Denali Commission, a bike and pedestrian 
path. It is wonderful, I am sure. It is not a Federal 
responsibility.
    Or how about the development of an art studio? Again, 
building a visitor and retail center. I am sure they are all 
wonderful. These aren't things that we should be paying for at 
the Federal level. These are local issues, ma'am.
    Let me just ask you this. Can you tell me, if you know, how 
much of the commission's budget goes to pay for salaries and 
other administrative costs and operating, and how much of your 
budget is directed to actual programming?
    Ms. Manchin. Yes. When grants are presented, that is all in 
it. We have third-party evaluators that evaluate all the 
programs and initiatives that we have. So that we ask for 
impact, how many jobs are going to be created, what is the 
impact on communities and----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Do you have a number? Do we have 
a percentage? What is the metric there?
    Ms. Manchin. Well, it is different. The POWER grants, these 
POWER grants are all designed a little differently to address 
different needs.
    But what we have found through our third-party evaluators 
is that the money that has been invested in these communities 
has reached or exceeded the expectations of what that grant was 
to do.
    Mr. Perry. And----
    Ms. Manchin [interrupting]. So, we are talking about 
bringing clean--in the 21st century, we are still bringing 
clean drinking water into these communities.
    Mr. Perry. I understand, ma'am, but I am looking for a 
metric by which we can measure your success, and I don't see 
any.
    And even the IG, especially for the Denali Commission, Mr. 
Boyle, has said that of the mass amount of money that has been 
spent there, a very, very small percentage has been reviewed 
under the inspector general. And so, almost literally no one is 
looking at any of this.
    Do any of you have a standard set of metrics by which you 
measure your success? And I am not meaning to be pejorative 
here. But we created you, I get it. But this is taxpayer money. 
And you would think, you are all high-powered people that are 
well connected, you should be able to come up--you are working 
together, you are working with other agencies. Is there any 
metric by which all of you measure your success? Anybody.
    Ms. Manchin. Yes. Well, we do have measures and we do have 
an inspector general over our commission that works every year 
with reports. So, I don't--I mean, I don't have numbers----
    Mr. Perry [interrupting]. Well, his comments are not very 
flattering.
    But my time has expired. And now I would yield to the 
gentlelady from Nevada.
    Ms. Titus. Thank you.
    I think I heard--maybe it was you, Dr. Wiggins, who said 
that for every dollar you spend you get back--would you tell us 
that statistic again?
    Or was it you, Mr. Saunders?
    I am sorry.
    Mr. Saunders. That is correct.
    Ms. Titus. That is a metric.
    Mr. Saunders. I was citing from our grant round that for 
every dollar, Federal dollar that is invested, there is a total 
of $4 that goes to a project that is leveraging other sources 
of funding.
    Ms. Titus. Yes. So, that would be a metric of success if 
you can take some Federal dollars and use it to leverage. Maybe 
it is a private investment, maybe it is a State match, that 
sort of thing. So, wouldn't that be a metric to show success?
    Mr. Saunders. Absolutely. And we are asked to measure 
indicators of distress and target our resources. Congress asks 
us to award at least 50 percent of our resources at the 
Northern Border Regional Commission to distressed communities, 
and we routinely meet and exceed that target, as well as our 
targets around infrastructure investment and other metrics that 
Congress has put in place to say, this is how we believe we 
should guide the dollars flowing to your communities.
    Ms. Titus. And, Ms. Manchin, you were talking about how 
many jobs were lost from the coal industry. Can you address how 
your workforce development programs may have brought back some 
of those jobs? There would be a metric of success.
    Ms. Manchin. Yes. Most--all of our grants, whether they are 
POWER grants, INSPIRE, or the multistate grants, all are around 
economic development, economic vitality.
    But then that spans a large region. Are we talking about 
education that is going to strengthen and training programs for 
industry that is coming in? The Appalachian region is seeing a 
lot of industry reentering the region. The automotive industry. 
And so, training for that.
    Ms. Titus. Don't you all--don't you do reports at the end 
of the year of how many new businesses you have attracted or 
how many new people you have hired or how many have gone 
through the workforce development program? Don't you all do 
that?
    Those are all metrics of success, I would say, or 
measurements of what your accomplishments are. You just don't 
have time to hit on every single one of them.
    I am sure you do them, Dr. Reed. Don't you do them in the 
Southeast?
    Ms. Reed. Yes. Thank you for the question. And while we are 
in our first round of grantmaking, we have developed targeted 
impact measures to evaluate the efforts of the investments. And 
these include jobs created and jobs retained. So, I look 
forward to coming back next year and giving you an update on 
where we stand with that.
    Ms. Titus. And don't all the commissions leverage that 
Federal money as you work closely with local governments? I am 
sure that is not all you have and all you spend, that you can 
use it to--you water the green spots sometimes. Is that kind of 
what you do?
    This isn't a question to any of you, but listening to you 
and hearing some of the dates you have to get reauthorized to 
exist, reauthorize the money, don't know how much money you are 
going to get.
    I have always heard from business that the main thing they 
need is stability and predictability. And if you are subject to 
political whims, that makes it very hard to do good investment, 
I would think. Maybe you all could address that.
    That doesn't mean you don't have to justify what money you 
are getting and how you are spending it for taxpayers. But if 
you kind of knew you were going to be in existence and 
basically the minimum of how much you were going to have, 
wouldn't that make the investment easier and better for 
leverage?
    Mr. Boyle.
    Ms. Manchin. Well, I think, just to be very specific, we 
are in partnership. We match money. So, any grant that comes 
from the ARC has started at the local level, is matched by 
State money, and then we come in as the third element. We don't 
come in with a check to pass out to people to say: Build it, 
and they will come. They create, and we are the third partner.
    So, it is a bottom-up approach. So, if a grant comes to us 
for funding for match, it is because the State, the Governor, 
and the local communities of that State have actually 
researched and worked on that.
    Ms. Titus. Yes. Do you want to add to that, Mr. Boyle?
    Mr. Boyle. I am sorry, could I ask you to repeat that 
question?
    Ms. Titus. Well, I have forgotten it myself by now.
    No, I was just saying that if you had some stability and 
knowing that you were going to be around next year and not 
subject to political whims, wouldn't it be easier to invest and 
leverage the Federal dollars that you get?
    Mr. Boyle. Yes. I think it certainly would. Allowing 
communities to know that we are going to be around for years as 
opposed to we might be gone next year would make it a lot 
easier for us to plan how to invest.
    Ms. Titus. And you can go through a list and pick out a 
theater there and a ski lift here and all. It makes a kind of 
cute list of calling out these things, kind of like the 
Proxmire award.
    But in reality, if you put those in context, those may have 
a big impact on a community. That may be a historic area, it 
may bring back business, it may revitalize a downtown area.
    You have got to put it in context. You can't just pick and 
choose like the list that the chairman gave out.
    Dr. Wiggins, you hadn't weighed in.
    Mr. Wiggins. Well, to your point, I mean, we actively work 
to make sure that our investments are in line with our 
statutory purpose.
    One of the unique opportunities we have because we do 
partner with our States, we regularly are engaging with our 
State members and having conversation and better understanding 
the needs of the community.
    So, to your point, making sure that our investments are 
aligned to our purpose and having the type of impact around job 
creation, how we improve infrastructure in the communities, and 
really trying to make sure that we have workforce development 
programs that are training people to be able to get into 
family-sustaining jobs.
    Ms. Titus. I yield back. Thank you.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi, 
Mr. Ezell.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you all for the active commissions that are here 
today. I really appreciate it.
    I want to note all the work that the Delta Regional 
Authority and the Appalachian Regional Commission have done in 
facilitating projects in my State of Mississippi.
    Dr. Reed, since the SCRC covers my district in south 
Mississippi, I want to ask you a question here.
    The Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the SCRC, was 
founded in 2008 and began receiving funds in 2010. The SCRC did 
not have a Federal Cochair until you became the first one--and 
congratulations--in 2021.
    If a Federal Cochair is not appointed, regional commissions 
cannot expect to expend the funds. However, before your 
arrival, the SCRC received annual appropriations totaling $2.75 
million.
    Can you elaborate on how these funds were used?
    Ms. Reed. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.
    The accumulated funds over that time were put into the 
appropriations being used now for the grantmaking. So, it is 
included in that $20 million that we will grant forward through 
this first grant cycle.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you.
    As previously stated, the DRA and the ARC have been 
successful in partnering with counties to accomplish projects 
in Mississippi.
    Since your appointment, what has the SCRC done outreach-
wise to prepare counties for receiving Federal grant dollars?
    Ms. Reed. Thank you very much.
    We have garnered cooperative agreements with every local 
development district in participating States, and there are 55 
of them. We have also enacted cooperative agreements with the 
States. So, we have a layered support system to make sure that 
the entities applying for grants are ready to receive those 
funds.
    Mr. Ezell. Very good.
    Lastly, each regional commission categorizes counties based 
generally on economic indicators such as per capita income and 
unemployment rates.
    The counties that have the lowest per capita income and the 
highest unemployment rates are labeled as distressed. Each 
regional commission has declared that nearly every county in 
Mississippi is distressed, including 66 percent of the counties 
in my district. I understand that 40 percent of the funds under 
each commission must go to distressed counties.
    Can each of you just kind of elaborate a little bit on a 
plan to prioritize funds to assist counties in Mississippi and 
in my district? And let's start with the DRA.
    Mr. Wiggins. Sure. As you mentioned, each year, we do an 
analysis to determine which counties or parishes are distressed 
in our communities. Once we do that, we have two primary 
investment tools.
    One tool is where we work with our Governors and our 
designees in our local development districts in identifying 
potential projects or opportunities to invest.
    And then we have another fund that is our Community 
Infrastructure Fund that is really focused on basic public 
infrastructure.
    So, we really work hand in hand with our local development 
districts because they are part of our boots on the ground, in 
a sense, in working, talking to local government, helping and 
supporting project development in terms of projects that come 
to us.
    Statutorily, a certain percentage of our funding does have 
to go into distressed communities. In addition, too, we focus 
on areas, what we consider isolated areas of distress, because 
you do have some communities or counties or parishes that may 
be nondistressed, but you have isolated areas of distress and 
poverty.
    So, in addition to working with our local development 
districts, our agency, ourselves, we do a lot of direct 
outreach by being present, showing up, meeting with local mayor 
associations, supervisor associations, so, all the types of 
things to make sure that our programmatic options are in front 
of, particularly, our distressed communities to maximize our 
investment at DRA.
    Mr. Ezell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is about up. I 
yield back.
    Thank you all again for being here today.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady, Ms. Norton.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Manchin, we must help ensure that Federal dollars for 
infrastructure projects flow through the local community.
    Throughout my service in Congress, I have worked to 
increase workforce development opportunities for District of 
Columbia residents whom I represent.
    After I first secured funding for the Department of 
Homeland Security headquarters consolidation in 2009, I worked 
to establish the Opportunities Center at St. Elizabeths to help 
DC residents and small businesses--including minority-owned and 
women-owned businesses--procure jobs, apprenticeships, and 
contracts for the headquarters consolidation and other Federal 
projects.
    The Opportunities Center also offers resume writing 
workshops, job postings, 8(a) small business training, and 
community outreach.
    Furthermore, I was proud to stand with Secretary Buttigieg 
in front of DC's own Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge to 
announce the reinstatement of the Department of 
Transportation's local hiring initiative pilot program now 
permitted by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
    Through local hire, we can revitalize local communities, of 
course, and provide meaningful jobs.
    Ms. Manchin, in your testimony, you describe how the new 
Appalachian Regional Initiative for Stronger Economies, which 
is funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, 
supports large multi-use collaborative projects, such as 
transitions to electric vehicles, something I have been working 
hard on, and green manufacturing. Large-scale projects such as 
these can generate new, good-paying jobs for local residents.
    What are the workforce development efforts, Ms. Manchin, 
including skills training, recruitment, and job placement, that 
will help residents take advantage of jobs created by the new 
initiative?
    Ms. Manchin. Well, one of the things that you find 
throughout the Appalachian region, as with all of our 
commissions, is that we have academic institutions throughout 
our regions.
    And so, one of the great assets, I think, in the 
Appalachian regions are our community colleges, which have 
become really the engines for training for industry that is 
coming in: the automotive industry that is coming back, the 
energy industry, hydropower, the agriculture that is returning 
to our area.
    We are finding that our community colleges are becoming the 
major engines for workforce training, not only for students out 
of high school but workers that have been displaced by their 
former work can go back and be retrained into these jobs and 
stay in the area in which they live. They can commute.
    So, this is one of the most effective. Education becomes 
the foundation for economic development, for growth, for 
vitality within a community.
    And certainly then that can lead into a 4-year degree or 
more. But community colleges are really the advocate and the 
lead instrument for training for the industry that is in our 
area and that is coming into our area.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you very much, Ms. Manchin.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentlelady.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman, Mr. Edwards--oh, 
correction--Mr. Carter.
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    And thank you all, Commissioners, for the incredible work 
that you do.
    Dr. Wiggins, in your testimony, you mentioned the 
commission's role in the CIF. I am sure that you and your staff 
have been working with Federal, State, and local officials on 
the massive flood insurance issues that the gulf coast is 
facing.
    Can you share what steps your office has taken to combat 
the risk of flood?
    Mr. Wiggins. Well, one, our Community Infrastructure Fund 
does support investments in flood control projects and other 
basic public infrastructure. And we actually do tend to see a 
lot of those requests come from Louisiana, particularly 
southern Louisiana.
    So, we actively work, again, with these local development 
districts, our commissions, on helping identify project 
support.
    In addition, we have actually spent some time, spent time 
in communities. I mentioned the mayors association meetings, 
the municipal association meetings as an opportunity for our 
local elected officials to hear from us.
    And I will lift up at this time, too, partnership, because 
an important part of our work is not just us as a commission 
going at this work alone. We actually do work with our other 
Federal partners closely in trying to figure out how we can 
support our regions that we serve. We work with State 
government. We work with the local development districts, as 
well, in addition with local governments.
    So, a lot of our work to address those issues around flood 
control projects is really based on the local needs but making 
sure that local government understands that we can be a 
resource, a partnering resource, as they are looking to address 
those issues around flood----
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana [interrupting]. And we appreciate 
that.
    As you know, Risk Rating 2.0 is a major, major issue. It is 
literally pricing people out of the market of being able to 
either become a homeowner or maintain home ownership in homes 
that they have paid for.
    And now, God forbid, with the rising costs of insurance, 
who would have ever thought that that could be a prohibitive 
factor in people maintaining their homes?
    What training programs does the DRA offer? Can you speak to 
any job training fields that promote environmental 
sustainability?
    Mr. Wiggins. Sure. Just recently, as a matter of fact, 
through our Delta Workforce Program, we awarded a partnership 
grant to Southern University that included partnership with 
other local development districts, Baton Rouge. They actually 
do work around sustainable energy development.
    And so, that is a prime example of, I think, some of the 
types of projects we are investing in that gets towards climate 
sustainability, resiliency.
    But, again, our strategic goals, our regional development 
plan helps put an eye towards the type of investments we do.
    I will highlight that in those plans, it is not a plan that 
is developed only by DRA input. We actually went out and talked 
to stakeholders across our eight-State region to help develop 
that plan, to help guide those investments.
    And so, work around sustainable energy is one that we 
continue to see and get more requests for, and we will continue 
to work with our local stakeholders in making sure we are doing 
good quality investments that are giving us a good return on 
that investment in terms of impact, as well.
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana. As you know, in Louisiana District 
Two, which is my congressional district, I represent the 
largest compilation of petrochemical plants in the River 
Parishes, plants that are nestled between communities.
    So, obviously, we have to consistently find ways to make 
sure that we have sustainability and environmental justice in 
those areas. So, thank you for your efforts.
    Dr. Reed, I would like to congratulate you once again on 
your post to the SCRC. Thank you for coming today to brief our 
subcommittee on your work over the past 22 months.
    I have two questions. What has been your biggest win to 
date? And how will the State Economic Development and 
Infrastructure grant help you and your agency in carrying out 
your mission?
    Ms. Reed. Thank you for the question.
    The biggest win to date is the establishment of a 
relationship with the States. It is a Federal-State 
partnership. And in order for us to do any of the work that we 
have been charged to do, that relationship has to be solid.
    So, I am really proud of the work that we have done and 
look forward to the relationship that we will have with the 
Governors and the Governor's alternates in getting everything 
established there.
    Second to that would be the 5-year strategic plan that sets 
the tone for where we are going and a map to where we need to 
be in the next 5 years. So, to that question.
    Your second question was about the Economic Development and 
Infrastructure grants?
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Yes.
    Ms. Reed. OK. I am extremely proud of the interest and the 
number of pre-applications that have come through; 363 pre-
applications are being evaluated right now, $119 million, while 
we only have $20 million to grant away. But to know that that 
interest is there.
    And the projects are broad. They run from infrastructure to 
health access to housing access. They run the gamut. So, we are 
very proud of the diversity that those grants have shown.
    I want to also point out we are statutorily bound, 40 
percent of the funds are to be spent on infrastructure, and 50 
percent of those funds are to be spent in distressed counties.
    So, those are the challenges that we have when we are 
awarding those grant funds.
    Mr. Carter of Louisiana. Thank you very much. And that is 
demonstrative.
    My time is up. So, thank you very much for your leniency, 
Mr. Chairman.
    But I will say in closing, this is demonstrative of the 
need that is out there. The great work that you are doing is 
showing. And the plethora of people that are attempting to 
apply talks about the real need.
    And we talk about metrics. It was offered, a question 
earlier. The metrics is people are showing up saying they have 
need, and thank God we have resources now to be able to address 
them.
    So, congratulations and thank you all for the great work 
that you do.
    Ms. Reed. Thank you.
    Mr. Perry. The Chair thanks the gentleman.
    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. 
Garamendi.
    Mr. Garamendi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Witnesses, thank all of you. I appreciate the opportunity 
to engage with you.
    Some of my questions have been answered in the previous 
discussions by the Members.
    But I want to really begin to focus in on the critical 
pieces of legislation that are now law, the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, and 
just generally how in each of your commissions you are able--or 
unable--to access that money, to bring that to bear in the 
problems that you are attempting or you are responsible to 
address.
    So, Ms. Manchin, if you would care to start.
    Ms. Manchin. Well, thank you.
    Yes, the increased funding that came out of the bipartisan 
infrastructure act, also the RFA, makes a big--increased 
certainly the funding that came to us. And where you are given 
more, one of the initiatives that we brought forth was the 
ARISE, which is a multistate.
    What I noticed, that in our 13 States, they were writing 
and doing great projects. But we are not the 13 States of 
Appalachia. We are the Appalachian Regional Commission.
    And so, with being able to offer a larger grant, the 
encouragement was that States need to work together, that if we 
lift up our region, then all of our States will do better.
    So, this increased funding in the Appalachian region I 
think has started an impact of States working together, how 
they can create bigger projects, which then impact and are much 
more transformative.
    The Hydrogen Hub, one of the placements now, will certainly 
impact Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, it will impact that 
region not only in jobs that will come there, training, but 
subsidiary jobs that will come into the region.
    And so, I think that our Governors and our program managers 
are beginning to realize that by sharing ideas and growth and 
certainly using our academic institutions between our States 
will certainly greatly impact and increase the abilities of our 
region to grow and gain parity.
    Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
    Mr. Wiggins.
    Mr. Wiggins. Well, with our additional funding, we did a 
couple things.
    One, we leveraged the funding into existing programs. So, 
for example, I talked earlier about our Community 
Infrastructure Fund. Just this week, we were looking at the 
amount of requests that we have.
    So, for example, we have about $29 million to spend in that 
particular fund, but we received $46 million of good quality 
requests. So, not just the total number of applications, but 
projects that are eligible, good-quality projects.
    And so, we have been able to leverage the additional 
funding to go further in those types of programs that we have.
    The other thing that we did, what we have noticed, is there 
has been a real, sort of, challenge--but we view it as an 
opportunity--around capacity building in a region. Again, that 
is part of our regional development plan that was approved by 
our Governors.
    So, two investments that we have leveraged with the 
additional funding is, one, a capacity-building grant to our 
local development districts. We hear throughout our region, 
through our local governments, about the help we need.
    So, we really have been focused on investments in capacity 
and leveraging our existing programs.
    Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
    I am not sure we are going to have enough time to go all 
the way down, so, briefly with the remaining three.
    Mr. Saunders. I would just simply echo some of the same 
improvements we have made to our programs as our peers have, 
making larger award size, incentivizing partnerships, looking 
at the fact that many rural communities have challenges, 
assembling multiple funding sources to make these projects 
possible.
    So, we have increased some award thresholds to try to make 
those projects happen quicker and more expediently.
    Mr. Garamendi. Ms. Reed.
    Ms. Reed. Thank you.
    Past appropriations leading up to my appointment, added to 
the $5 million for IIJA, all folded into the $20 million that 
we are using for our current grant cycle.
    Mr. Garamendi. Mr. Boyle.
    Mr. Boyle. Thank you, Congressman Garamendi. It is good to 
see you again.
    Briefly, Mr. Chair, if I can. From our IIJA funds, directly 
to your point on the IG, I am taking one-half of 1 percent of 
that money to make sure he can do the work that he needs to do. 
Your point is well-taken. I know that was an issue in the past, 
and I am doing my best to address it.
    What we are doing is we devised a 5-year spend plan for our 
funds to make sure all of those moneys are available in the 
outyears for our communities. Our funds may be used as non-
Federal match. We want that available down the road if other 
communities get big grants from other programs but they don't 
have the match available at the local level.
    We are doing a lot of technical assistance to provide 
capacity building and grant applications, and also doing 
planning, engineering, and design work that other Federal 
agencies can't fund in order to get projects to a fundable 
stage.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Garamendi. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Chairman, my time having expired but my questions not, 
I yield back.
    Mr. Perry. I thank the gentleman. The gentleman does yield 
back.
    Are there any further questions from any of the Members who 
have not been recognized?
    I don't see any.
    So, I would like to say I would like to continue the 
hearing. However, there are other pressing needs apparently 
that require my attendance and our attendance.
    So, I hope the trip was worthwhile for you. It was 
worthwhile for us in having your attendance. And while 
sometimes these can seem stressful, none of us has any personal 
animosity with any of you. We believe that you are hoping for 
the best things in your communities and working towards that.
    I think our collective job is to make sure that we are 
doing it as effectively and as efficiently as we can within the 
scope of all of the Federal Government.
    And so, with that, that concludes the hearing for today, 
and I would like to thank each of you for your testimony.
    This subcommittee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:21 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

                      Submissions for the Record

                              ----------                              

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen, a Representative in Congress 
    from the State of Washington, and Ranking Member, Committee on 
                   Transportation and Infrastructure
    Thank you, Chairman Perry and Ranking Member Titus, for holding 
this important hearing on the effectiveness of regional economic 
development commissions.
    We have held several hearings in the past few years to examine the 
Economic Development Administration and the good work it is doing to 
promote economic development in communities across the country.
    But it has been several years since we held a hearing specifically 
on the regional commissions. I have long been a champion of regional 
economic development commissions--which leverage federal, state and 
private sector resources to bolster regional economies.
    With their singular focus on specific areas of the country and the 
needs of those regions, regional commissions play an important and 
complementary role to the EDA.
    Regional commissions are unique in their structure and reach with 
most led by a federal co-chair and the governors of the states in which 
the commission operates. By integrating federal, state, regional and 
local economic development priorities, the regional commissions help 
state, local, and non-profit experts tailor responses to unique local 
economic crises, trends and needs.
    The impacts that these regional commissions have on communities 
around our country is crucial. Construction of wastewater treatment 
facilities, development of workforce training programs, industrial park 
road improvements, commercial truck driver training, broadband 
expansion--all these local initiatives are vital to regional economies.
    I look forward to hearing from each of the commissions represented 
today about their important work and the impact it is having on their 
regions.
    Mr. Chairman, I would like to note that the Southwest Border 
Regional Commission (SBRC) is missing from this hearing. The SBRC is a 
federal-state partnership between the states of Arizona, California, 
New Mexico, and Texas and the Federal Government.
    The SBRC was authorized in 2008 but did not receive funding until 
FY21. In January of this year, Mr. Juan Sanchez of Texas was confirmed 
by the Senate to serve as SBRC's first Federal Co-Chair. Mr. Sanchez 
expects the commission to be operational in the very near future, and I 
hope we will include the SBRC in our next hearing on this topic.
    After visiting the southwest border multiple times, I am convinced 
that innovative economic development projects are crucial to the 
economic vitality of our border communities and the SBRC is poised to 
help.
    Regional Commissions are an important tool that can leverage 
federal, state and private sector resources to help historically 
distressed regions respond to economic challenges.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and I thank the 
Chairman and Ranking Member for holding this hearing.


                                Appendix

                              ----------                              


   Questions to Hon. Jennifer Clyburn Reed, Ed.D., Federal Cochair, 
      Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, from Hon. Mike Ezell

    Question 1. Can you further elaborate on which of the Local 
Development District (LDD) and state cooperative agreements you have 
signed and finalized? If all the agreements have not been finalized, 
what is your plan to finalize the outstanding agreements before 
distributing the funds that were appropriated in the LDD Capacity 
Building Program?
    Answer:
LDD Capacity Building Program
    SCRC will allocate two million dollars from appropriated funds to 
the LDD Capacity Building Program to support the 55 LDDs located in the 
participating states of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, 
South Carolina and Virginia. Funding for this program is available 
through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, PL. 117-328.
    This non-competitive financial assistance program will strengthen 
the operational capacity of LDDs and benefit communities within 
distressed, transitional, and isolated areas of distress by enhancing 
local economic development, administration and planning. As economic 
development engines, LDDs provide services which often consists of 
funding identification, grant writing assistance, planning and project 
implementation.
    The LDD Capacity Building Program will provide LDDs with resources 
to help communities plan, develop, implement and evaluate projects. To 
date, all 55 LDDs within the Southeast Crescent region have opted-in to 
participate in the LDD Capacity Building Program. Of those 
participating, 50 cooperative agreements have been signed by both the 
LDD and SCRC. These fully executed agreements have been forwarded to 
the LDDs along with required forms needed to establish the LDDs as 
vendors, making them eligible to receive financial investments from 
SCRC. Once the LDDs are vendors and all required forms and documents 
are signed and returned, disbursements will be dispersed.
    There are five LDD cooperative agreements that have not been signed 
by the LDDs. Staff has contacted each one to acquire the required 
signatures and documentation. The goal is to have all 55 cooperative 
agreements fully executed by the close of the calendar year.
SCRC State Capacity Building Program
    SCRC will allocate two million dollars of appropriated funds to 
participating member states to assist with grant administration and 
facilitating outreach efforts. The cooperative agreements with member 
states will also assist with oversight of SCRC's financial investments 
in roads, buildings, water systems, broadband networks and other 
projects executed within their counties. Local technical assistance, 
training and outreach will be a collaborative effort between SCRC 
member states and LDDs.
    SCRC collaborates with other active regional commissions to 
formalize procedures and internal processes. In drafting the 
cooperative agreement for the SCRC State Capacity Building Program, 
staff worked with the State Program Managers (SPMs). Since SCRC shares 
six states with the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), a sample 
state cooperative agreement from ARC was used as a guide to draft the 
cooperative agreements for SCRC's State Capacity Building Program.
    Upon review by SCRC legal counsel, initial drafts which included a 
scope of work, budget, and budget narrative, were delivered to the 
member states for internal review by September 22, 2023. SCRC received 
collective feedback from the members states on November 7, 2023. The 
states' revisions were reviewed by SCRC legal counsel and the final 
drafts are with the member states for signatures. Once member states 
complete their internal review of the revised cooperative agreement and 
signatures are acquired, funds will be disbursed to the six 
participating member states. The goal is to have all six cooperative 
agreements fully executed by mid-January 2024.

    Question 2. Please provide a detailed outline of how you plan to 
use the funds that were appropriated to the Southeast Crescent Regional 
Commission (SCRC) before your arrival, and how you plan to use the 
additional funds that were made available to SCRC by the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58).
    Answer. SCRC was authorized by Congress in the 2008 Food, 
Conservation, and Energy Act (``the Farm Bill'') and began receiving 
annual appropriations in 2010. From FY 2010 through FY 2021, prior to 
the appointment of a Federal Co-Chair, SCRC was appropriated $3.75 
million (In FY 2010-FY 2020, SCRC received $250,000/FY and $1 million 
in FY 2021).
    Once confirmed in January 2022, I conducted a Backdated Treasury 
Warrant exercise with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the 
Department of Treasury to have those funds transferred to SCRC 
Treasury-generated accounts.
    Cumulative funds from FY 2010 through the current fiscal year are 
being used for grants, programs and administrative operations. SCRC 
also received $5 million from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act (P.L. 117-58) which has been invested in the 2023 State Economic 
and Infrastructure Development (SEID) Grant program. Funds for the $20 
million grant program are from the following sources:
    <bullet>  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, PL. 117-328 ($10 
million);
    <bullet>  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, PL. 117-328 ($5 
million);
    <bullet>  Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act, 2021, PL. 117-58 
($5 million).

    Question 3. Please elaborate on how you plan to prioritize 
distressed counties in Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District, 
especially considering over half of the counties are distressed.
    Answer. Of the 18 counties within the SCRC Mississippi footprint, 
14 are distressed. The Fourth Congressional District is home to four 
transitional counties and seven distressed ones. All investments by 
SCRC in Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District will be guided by 
the enabling statute, priorities identified in the SCRC's Five-Year 
Strategic Plan and Mississippi's State Economic and Infrastructure 
Development Plan approved by the Governor's office. SCRC investments 
align with the six strategic goals listed below:
    a.  Invest in Critical Infrastructure
    b.  Improve Health and Support Services Access and Outcomes
    c.  Strengthen Workforce Capacity
    d.  Foster Entrepreneurial and Business Development Activities
    e.  Expand Affordable Housing Stock and Access
    f.  Promote Environmental, Conservation, Preservation, and Access

    SCRC's authorizing statute, 40 U.S.C., Subtitle V, Sec. 15501 
(b)(c)(d), stipulates at least 50% of grant funds be allocated to 
distressed counties and isolated areas of distress in the region. The 
statute also requires SCRC to allocate at least 40% of grant funds to 
infrastructure projects tackling basic public infrastructure, 
telecommunications, and transportation.
    As stated previously, SCRC has entered into cooperative agreements 
with 50 of the 55 LDDs located in the Southeast Crescent region. It is 
a goal to have the remaining five signed by the end of the year. SCRC 
is in the final stages of signing cooperative agreements with the six 
participating states. The scope of work within each cooperative 
agreement details how both outreach and technical assistance will be 
delivered to entities in the region, to include Mississippi's Fourth 
Congressional District. SCRC member states and LDDs will work 
collectively to build the capacity of local communities while 
simultaneously serving as conduits of change and development.
Methodology--Economic Designations
    SCRC uses an index-based, economic classification system to 
identify and monitor the economic status of its counties and county 
equivalents. The system involves the creation of a national index of 
county economic status through comparative averages of three economic 
indicators--the three-year average unemployment rate, per capita market 
income, and poverty rate--with national averages. The resulting values 
are summed and averaged to create a composite index value for each 
county. Each county is then ranked based on its composite index value 
where high values indicate high levels of distress.
    Per 40 U.S.C. Sec.  15702, SCRC annually assigns economic 
designations to counties and areas within the region. The categories 
are:
    a.  Distressed Counties--Counties that are the most severely and 
persistently economically distressed and underdeveloped with high rates 
of poverty, unemployment, or outmigration.
    b.  Transitional Counties--Counties that are economically 
distressed and underdeveloped or have recently suffered high rates of 
poverty, unemployment, or outmigration.
    c.  Attainment Counties--Counties not designated as distressed or 
transitional counties under this subsection.
    d.  Isolated Areas of Distress--In accordance with 40 U.S.C. Sec.  
15702, SCRC identifies isolated areas of distress with high rates of 
poverty, unemployment, or outmigration and located within attainment 
counties.
