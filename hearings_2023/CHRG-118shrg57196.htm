   EXPLOITING THE AMERICAN DREAM: HOW ABUSIVE LAND CONTRACTS PREY ON 
                         VULNERABLE HOMEBUYERS

                              ----------                              


                         TUESDAY, JULY 11, 2023

                               U.S. Senate,
  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
    Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community 
                                               Development,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Subcommittee met at 2:30 p.m., in room 538, Dirksen 
Senate Office Building, Hon. Tina Smith, Chair of the 
Subcommittee, presiding.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIR TINA SMITH

    Chair Smith. Good afternoon. The Subcommittee on Housing, 
Transportation, and Community Development will be called to 
order. I want to thank our witnesses testifying today, both in 
person and remotely, and I want to again thank my colleague, 
Senator Lummis, for your partnership and joint work on this 
Subcommittee hearing.
    Everyone wants a safe, decent place to call home. Without 
this, nothing in your life works--not your job, your health, 
your education, your family, not anything. So when parents hear 
that there might be a way for them to buy a home for their 
families, something that may have seemed out of reach, we can 
understand what that would be like: safety, security, an 
opportunity for better school for their kids, to live closer to 
work, maybe a backyard or an extra bedroom for their family. 
This is the American dream, and it is also the way that most 
people build wealth and grow a safe, secure life.
    This Subcommittee hearing today is about how this dream is 
being exploited by unscrupulous home sellers, under the guise 
of offering home ownership through complex contracts. Instead 
of a traditional mortgage, they sell homes on an installment 
plan, with a high interest loan called a contract-for-deed or 
land contract. These contracts go by different names in 
different places, but what they have in common is that they 
provide all of the risks and few of the protections homeowners 
can expect under traditional mortgages.
    The buyers in these contracts often are faced with 
extraordinary penalties if they miss even one payment. People 
think they are they are on the path to owning their own home, 
when in fact they are on a path for financial disaster--
forfeiting all the money they have paid in, as well as the 
place they thought was their home.
    Too often, these contracts are designed to fail.
    So I became interested in this issue when I learned about 
how these land contract sellers are targeting people in my home 
State of Minnesota, particularly Somali Muslim immigrants, who, 
under the tenets of their faith, are limited in paying interest 
with a traditional mortgage. The stories that I have heard are 
heartbreaking and enraging, families targeted, and exploited 
because of their religion and their inability to get access to 
a traditional mortgage.
    As we did more research, we learned that unscrupulous 
contract-for-deed sellers are operating across the country. 
Typically they are targeting Black, Brown, and immigrant 
communities, poor communities, groups that have long suffered 
from housing discrimination. It is estimated that there have 
been more than three million homes sold with land contracts 
across the country, affecting people in all parts of the 
country in all States, not only Minnesota but also in places 
like Ohio, Texas, and Georgia.
    Our purpose with this hearing today is to understand how 
these land contracts work, how they differ from traditional 
mortgages, why their use is apparently expanding, and what this 
all means for the people caught up in this web.
    As a start, we know that many of these land contracts lack 
basic consumer protections, and I know that our witnesses will 
tell us more about this during the course of this afternoon.
    It is important, I want to add, to understand that land 
contracts, contracts-for-deed, and similar financing mechanisms 
have been around for a century or more, and when used properly 
they are a legitimate tool for financing real estate 
transactions. In recent years, some nonprofits have launched 
innovative programs using land contracts, coupled with housing 
counseling and reasonable contract terms, which can help 
families buy homes for the first time, and I commend the 
organizations who are using land contracts as tools for good.
    But land contracts also have also historically been a tool 
of housing discrimination and exploitation of poor communities 
and communities of color who could not get access to 
traditional banking and mortgage products. Today these buyers 
still have a hard time getting access to credit, so the legacy 
of discrimination lives on today, including in my hometown, 
where the disparities between White and Black home ownership 
are the greatest in the Nation.
    So today we are going to dive into this issue with this 
excellent panel of witnesses. We want to understand how this is 
happening, how prevalent the problem is, what impacts it has on 
families, and what Congress should consider as we think about 
basic consumer protections, and how to address the root causes 
of lack of access to capital and lending, so every family has a 
safe place to call home.
    I want to commend my Ranking Chair here today because I 
know that she has spent a lot of time thinking about what we 
need to do to expand access to capital and borrowing and 
lending in fair ways, so I very much appreciate your shared 
work on this.
    So thank you, Senator Lummis, thank you for working with me 
on this hearing, and I now recognize you for your opening 
statement.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CYNTHIA M. LUMMIS

    Senator Lummis. Well, I want to thank the Chairman as well. 
This issue, I think, is critical in your State and critical in 
the Midwest, maybe even more so than the Mountain West, where I 
live.
    But you mentioned something already that I had not thought 
of, which is the effect of certain religious practices and 
usury laws that run counter to their religious beliefs, 
encountering the financial system that we have in place in the 
United States. So lots to learn on my part.
    I want to thank our witnesses for helping instruct and 
inform and provide wise counsel to this Committee, so welcome, 
witnesses. And thanks again, Madam Chairwoman.
    Buying a home is a critical part of the American dream. 
Because of higher prices and higher mortgage rates, this dream 
is out of reach for an increasing number of Americans. That is 
certainly true in my State of Wyoming. I hear weekly from 
Wyoming people that are struggling to find a foothold in the 
housing market. While current homeowners can use their homes' 
equity to trade up in the housing market, first-time home 
buyers are finding themselves largely priced out of housing 
markets. So I think it is important that we talk about how we 
can get past this and find alternative housing financial 
products like land contracts and lease-to-own agreements that 
have fewer hurdles and that do not protect consumers 
adequately.
    Compliance costs for banks have increased since the Great 
Financial Crisis, and the fixed costs of underwriting have 
risen, hitting consumers that need to borrow a relatively small 
amount the hardest. This hurts low-income and rural home buyers 
the most. And while it is not clear how many households use 
land contracts or contracts-for-deed, it is not surprising that 
anecdotally their use has increased since the Great Financial 
Crisis.
    More recently, rising mortgage rates have also pushed home 
buying further out of reach for many families, and Congress 
shares some of this blame. The Congress, both under the last 
Administration and under this one, has embarked on an 
irresponsible spending spree. The Fed has been forced to raise 
rates to combat inflation, and as a result mortgage rates have 
also risen.
    The median family in Wyoming has an income of about $65,000 
each year. When mortgage rates were at 3 percent, this family 
could afford to purchase the median home in Wyoming at 
$280,000, with a modest downpayment. With rates closer to 7 
percent, that family can now only afford a $200,000 home. So 
this loss of purchasing power has been felt most acutely by the 
families that have been saving for years for a downpayment, 
only to discover a house is even farther out of reach.
    So now is the time to think creatively about how to help 
families purchase their first home. Financial products and 
tools to build wealth and accomplish goals are necessary. Let's 
explore them. Families need access to a variety of financial 
products and the flexibility to select the one that would best 
suit their needs. They also need to understand the tradeoffs 
between various products and have the information they need to 
make the best decision for them, for their families.
    Our witnesses today come from States that use a variety of 
laws to govern land contracts. While data on the use of land 
contracts is thin, there are regional variations in their 
usage. States have exercised their oversight of consumer 
protection to do what is best for the citizens of their State. 
Let's explore which States are doing it the best. Let's find 
best practices. State governments should continue to evaluate 
how to ensure households can make informed decisions and how to 
protect consumers from fraud.
    Finally, the clearest way to make housing more affordable 
is to make more housing, period. We need to reduce barriers to 
building more houses so that more households can realize their 
American dream.
    Thank you, Madam Chairman, for holding this important 
hearing and inviting witnesses that can elucidate this issue.
    Chair Smith. Thank you very much, Senator Lummis.
    I will now introduce our three witnesses. We have Sarah 
Bolling Mancini, which is the Senior Attorney and Codirector of 
Advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center. She is a leading 
expert on foreclosures, mortgage lending, and credit reporting 
issues, and has represented homeowners in Federal and State 
courts. She holds a law degree from Harvard Law School.
    Joining us remotely will be Beth Goodell. Ms. Goodell is 
the Supervising Attorney of the Consumer Practice Group at Mid-
Minnesota Legal Aid. She leads a team of legal aid attorneys 
who have litigated contract-for-deed cases on behalf of low-
income Minnesota families. She has been a legal aid lawyer for 
more than 25 years and holds a law degree from Penn Law School.
    And we have John Green joining us today, who is Managing 
Principal at Blackstar Stability. Blackstar Stability's 
distressed debt fund's aim is to achieve compelling returns for 
investors while providing significant benefits to low-income 
and moderate-income families by reducing distressed mortgages 
and land sale contracts. Mr. Green has more than 18 years of 
real estate and financial experience and has managed 
approximately $5 billion in properties. He has an MBA from 
Harvard Business School and an MPA from Harvard's Kennedy 
School of Government.
    We will begin with Ms. Mancini, and then turn to Ms. 
Goodell, and then Mr. Green. For each of our witnesses, you 
will have 5 minutes for your opening statements. There is a 
clock in front of you to help you gauge the time. And, of 
course, your full written statements will be a part of the 
record.
    Ms. Mancini, you are recognized for your opening statement.

 STATEMENT OF SARAH BOLLING MANCINI, SENIOR ATTORNEY, NATIONAL 
                      CONSUMER LAW CENTER

    Ms. Mancini. Thank you. Chairwoman Smith, Ranking Member 
Lummis, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify on behalf of the low-income clients of 
the National Consumer Law Center regarding alternative home 
purchase methods. My name is Sarah Mancini, and I am Codirector 
of Advocacy for the National Consumer Law Center, based in 
Atlanta, Georgia.
    Zachary Anderson was in his early 50s and was working as a 
city mechanic when he saw signs dotting his southwest Atlanta 
neighborhood advertising homes for sale with low downpayments 
and low monthly payments. He called the number on one of those 
signs and was told to sign some papers and FedEx them back to 
the company, Harbour Portfolio. He got a letter that said, 
``Congratulations on the purchase of your name home.'' Mr. 
Anderson had no idea that the transaction he entered into was 
any different than a traditional mortgage loan. His contract 
carried a 10 percent interest rate, and the price of the home 
was roughly five times what the company had paid when they 
acquired it from Fannie Mae.
    Mr. Anderson made substantial repairs to his home. He 
repaired the roof, replaced burst pipes, painted, installed 
gutters. He paid faithfully on the contract for years. He also 
paid property taxes and homeowner's insurance, only to discover 
at a certain point that the deed to the house was not in his 
name, and Mr. Anderson was at risk of losing all of his 
investment in that home.
    Mr. Anderson had entered into a land contract, also known 
as a land installment contract or contracts-for-deed. These are 
seller-financed transactions that are targeted at consumers who 
are unable, or believe they are unable, to get a mortgage loan.
    Land contracts essentially involve seller financing in 
which the home buyer promises to pay a fixed amount of money at 
a certain interest rate over a period of time, often 10 or 20 
years. But unlike a traditional mortgage loan the deed to the 
home remains in the seller's name until the full purchase price 
has been paid, and if a buyer misses a single payment at any 
point in time the contract can be canceled, and the seller can 
keep all of the money the consumer has paid and all of their 
investments in the home and kick them out like a tenant. Buyers 
essentially have all the responsibilities of home ownership and 
none of the rights or protections.
    Another similar type of transaction is a lease with option 
to buy. A lease option transaction involves two separate 
contracts: a residential lease and an option to buy the home 
for a certain price within a certain time period, usually 6 to 
24 months. And until the option is exercised, the consumer is a 
tenant. However, the contract often says that that tenant has 
to make the necessary repairs to the home, which violates 
landlord-tenant laws in almost every State. The consumers are 
usually required to pay a substantial option fee, between 
$2,000 and $5,000, sometimes even more than that, that is 
nonrefundable if they do not exercise the option, and most of 
the time the consumer is not able to exercise the option, 
either because they still cannot qualify for a mortgage loan 
within that limited time period or because the price that they 
have the option to buy the home for is way above the fair 
market value, and no bank will make a mortgage loan for more 
than fair market value.
    These transactions are problematic because they are 
designed to fail. Sellers actually make more money when 
consumers default because they do not have to do a foreclosure 
sale. They just take the property back and keep all of the 
money the consumer has invested in the home, and they can turn 
around and get another consumer into the home, taking another 
large downpayment or option fee.
    NCLC estimates that the failure rate for these transactions 
is well above 50 percent, and that is compared to a roughly 1 
percent foreclosure rate for FHA mortgage borrowers. And this 
is a conservative estimate because some data suggests that the 
failure rate is really 70 or 80 percent. There was a study out 
of Texas that showed a 70 percent failure rate over a 20-year 
period, and there is also data from a Pennsylvania AG lawsuit 
that looked at transactions over a 6-year time period and found 
that 73 percent of those transactions had already failed just a 
few years later.
    When these transactions fail, consumers are much worse off 
than they would have been if they had just been renting. They 
lose that large downpayment or option fee, they usually have 
been paying more than typical rent, they have spent their money 
and sweat equity to make repairs to the home, and they often 
end up facing a judgment or a collection account that ruins 
their credit.
    There is a patchwork of State laws that apply to these 
transactions. Many States have no protections at all on the 
books. Some States require a foreclosure. Other require the 
contracts to be recorded. But all in all, many homeowners are 
completely unprotected. And as I mentioned, instead of offering 
a pathway to home ownership, these transactions are really a 
costly and harmful detour from home ownership for these 
consumers.
    Thank you, and I am happy to take any questions.
    Chair Smith. Thank you so much.
    We will turn now to Beth Goodell, who is joining us 
remotely.

   STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH GOODELL, SUPERVISING ATTORNEY, MID-
                      MINNESOTA LEGAL AID

    Ms. Goodell. Good afternoon. Thank you. Good afternoon from 
Minnesota. Chairwoman Smith, Ranking Member Lummis, and Members 
of the Committee, I am happy to have the chance to talk with 
you today.
    I am a lawyer at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid in Minneapolis. 
Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid provides free legal services for low-
income residents of a 22-county area. We serve clients whose 
household income is in the range of 125 percent of the Federal 
poverty level, or about $37,000 a year for a family of four.
    In Minnesota, ``land contracts'' are referred to as 
``contracts-for-deed.''
    The people who seek our help do not, of course, represent 
contracts-for-deed success stories. In our experience, 
contracts-for-deed are a vehicle for exploitation rather than a 
path to ownership, and we have seen the abusive practices that 
Sarah Bolling Mancini just described.
    I see the losses experienced by our contracts-for-deed 
clients falling into two main categories--first, the loss of 
the protections of landlord-tenant law, and second, the loss of 
money paid into the home with no path for recovering it.
    The first type of loss is experienced by people, in our 
experience, who had no chance from the beginning of paying the 
purchase price in full and becoming the owner of the house. We 
have seen scores of cases where the so-called buyers have the 
means to rent but not the means to buy, but the owner placed 
them in a contract-for-deed, allowing the owner to avoid 
responsibility for repairs and maintenance. In one case, our 
client had rented from the owner for years. The owner was 
facing the loss of his rental license because he failed to make 
the required repairs.
    On the eve of the loss of the rental license, the owner 
talked the tenant, a senior woman of color with developmental 
disabilities, into signing a contract-for-deed. He put the sale 
price into the contract at $180,000, although the accurate fair 
market value was about $60,000. The monthly payment stayed the 
same, but the seller was legally no longer a landlord. He 
allowed the house to fall into further disrepair. The tenant 
remained in the home for another 3 years before the owner 
brought an eviction against her for not paying the $180,000.
    We found that this same property owner had sold many 
properties this way, and that none of the transactions resulted 
in ownership. In the end, all of the properties were taken back 
by the seller.
    The second type of loss, the loss of a significant amount 
of money that was paid into the house, Sarah Bolling Mancini 
talked about to some extent and Senator Smith mentioned the 
pattern that we are seeing in Minnesota now of Somali 
immigrants being talked into abusive contact for deed 
transactions. One of these transactions that we know about, the 
family had put $73,000 down and then struggled trying to make 
the monthly payments of $4,800. If they default on those 
payments there is no requirement in Minnesota law that they get 
any of their money back.
    Another case involved a single Somali woman who paid 
$35,000 down and was able to make the monthly payments, but she 
could not find an insurance company that would insure the 
house. Having insurance was a term of the contract, so she was 
facing termination of the contract and loss of the money she 
paid.
    Now a buyer with a mortgage who faces insurmountable 
financial difficulties would have time to sell the home and 
receive any equity over the debt owed, but this is not the case 
for contract-for-deed buyers here in Minnesota. Minnesota law 
requires only a written notice of default and a 60-day period 
for curing the default. At the end of the 60 days, the contract 
simply terminates, and the buyer has no right to any home 
equity, to the return of any payments, or the value of any 
repairs paid for.
    All of the contract-for-deed buyers represented by MMLA 
were part of a vulnerable population, low-income households. 
For many of our clients, their best interests lie in the 
availability of affordable, decently maintained rental housing 
rather than being pulled into contracts-for-deed, and because 
of the overlap of poverty and race, low-income communities in 
our service area tend to be neighborhoods where a majority of 
the residents are people of color. Unscrupulous sellers of 
contracts-for-deed tend to target these communities, and most 
of our contract-for-deed clients have been people of color.
    Contracts-for-deed do not always fail, but they fail low-
income, vulnerable populations too frequently to allow the 
situation to go on as it is.
    Thank you for the attention you are giving to this issue 
and for the opportunity to talk with you about it today.
    Chair Smith. Thank you very much.
    And now we will turn to Mr. Green.

    STATEMENT OF JOHN GREEN, MANAGING PRINCIPAL, BLACKSTAR 
                           STABILITY

    Mr. Green. Thank you, Chairwoman Smith, Ranking Member 
Lummis, and esteemed Members of the Committee. I serve as 
Managing Principal of Blackstar Stability.
    Blackstar is a real estate investment management company 
that focuses on stabilizing communities by expanding the 
equitable ownership of affordable single-family homes. In 
particular, we focus on the naturally occurring, unsubsidized 
segment of the property market that is $100,000 or less, and 
that often is transacted by unregulated, predatory financial 
instruments. We are a private equity fund that changes the 
lives of working-class families by turning land contracts into 
real mortgages.
    In my testimony today I will share two important findings, 
first, that there is an immense unaddressed problem, and 
second, that there are readily available answers.
    Blackstar purchases pools of homes encumbered by predatory 
forms of seller financing, converts the financing into 
traditional mortgages at fair market terms, eventually sells 
these mortgages, and then recycles the capital. In that 
process, ownership is transferred to families in a transaction 
that is transformational.
    Blackstar's focus is on contracts-for-deeds--CFDs--and 
similar instruments that confer the obligations of home 
ownership to buyers without the benefits, and take typical 
landlord obligations and foist them upon buyers and tenants. 
There are more than $200 billion of CFDs, and that prevalence 
reflects a larger problem that the availability of small-
balance mortgages simply does not meet the demand from 
qualified buyers.
    Nationally, less than 30 percent of all properties that are 
sold for less than $70,000 are financed with a traditional 
mortgage.
    Notably, the supply deficit of these mortgages is driven 
much more by the high fixed costs and unfavorable economics of 
originating these mortgages than any issues of creditworthiness 
or financial wherewithal amongst the qualified buyers. This 
issue disproportionately affects low-income and minority 
communities. This gap has made working-class housing markets 
far less liquid, depressed home ownership, robbed communities 
of hard-earned equity, and diminished both the capital and 
incentives to reinvest in these communities.
    Unequal access to traditional mortgages has been a reality 
throughout U.S. history. The absence of available mortgages 
gives rise to products like CFDs.
    Blackstar's aim is to preserve affordable single-family 
housing, lower the cost of ownership, and keep families in 
their homes. Blackstar's approach uses scalable, market-driven, 
commonsense tactics to refinance homes for families that have 
been solid payers of higher-cost alternatives. Inherently, 
there is a strong sustainability thesis as we avoid the 
functional obsolescence of homes and help meet a huge shortage 
of affordable housing nationwide.
    As proof of concept, Blackstar acquired a portfolio of 181 
homes in 18 States, encumbered by CFDs and lease options, and 
to date we have converted 86 of these to mortgages and received 
full payoffs for 10 more.
    Beyond the strong expected financial returns, the impacts 
are striking. There has been dramatic wealth creation. More 
than 85 percent of the families that we have been able to 
refinance have had equity transferred, averaging $43,000 per 
family, a more than 20 times increase in their net assets, on 
average. Thirteen percent of families had their principal 
balances reduced by nearly a quarter. Average monthly payments 
were reduced by nearly 30 percent, and penalties and arrearages 
were forgiven for over 40 percent of families, at roughly 3 
times their net assets. The median household income for these 
families was $45,000, roughly 60 percent of AMI.
    As an example, in Canton, Illinois, Blackstar worked with 
borrowers who are a disabled veteran and his daughter, who is 
also disabled. They share a small, multigenerational house that 
includes young children. When Blackstar purchased the house it 
had no central heating, no hot water, and the roof leaked. The 
borrowers had stopped making payments due to the condition of 
the home and broken promises of the seller. The veteran 
borrower is also an amputee and was unable to accept help from 
a local veterans' group to adapt the home, due to not having 
title to the house.
    Blackstar provided a new roof, a furnace, and hot water 
heat. The borrower's disability income qualified them for a new 
30-year mortgage with a 30 percent reduction in monthly 
payments and the opportunity to complete the necessary 
accommodations to the home.
    By purchasing assets at a substantial discount from market-
driven sellers, Blackstar can rethink the service delivery 
model for originating and servicing small-balance mortgages.
    Perhaps the largest challenge that Blackstar faces is 
simply finding the CFDs and lease options. While we know that 
there are millions throughout the country, very few are 
recorded. Even in States that require recordation, compliance 
is spotty, and enforcement is virtually non-existent. The 
owners selling these properties via these contracts are 
overwhelmingly intentional about staying in the shadows and 
rarely sell through transparent mechanisms.
    There is a clear and better path than the limited pool of 
options and minimal protections afforded to low-cost home 
buyers today. Small-balance mortgage lending that reaches 
underserved consumers and communities should be meaningfully 
incentivized. Consumer protections must be enhanced and 
enforced, and recordation of CFDs and lease options must be 
required.
    In conclusion, the current state of affairs is not 
inevitable. Our model works. It is a simple, effective approach 
that earns an attractive risk-adjusted return for investors 
while producing life-changing stability and lower payments to 
families. Blackstar Stability is creating the sort of home 
mortgage alternative for working-class families that is already 
available to mainstream America. Fair and equitable access to 
the housing finance system is both good policy and good 
business.
    I look forward to your questions.
    Chair Smith. Thank you so much.
    We will now turn to our round of questions from Committee 
members, and I will defer first to Senator Tester, who I 
believe is joining us remotely.
    Senator Tester. I am, and I want to thank you, Madam Chair, 
for your courtesy, and I want to thank you and Ranking Member 
Lummis for holding this meeting, and I want to thank the 
panelists for their testimony.
    As Senator Lummis said in her opening statement, I think 
concur with, from a Montana perspective. This is not something 
we are hearing about the way you are in Minnesota or in 
Michigan. And I was wondering if this is partly because of 
consumer protections in the Montana code.
    So this question is for you, Ms. Mancini. Are there 
appropriate protections States can make to make sure that the 
market works without a bunch of folks who should have a special 
place in hell?
    Ms. Mancini. Thank you for the question, Senator Tester. 
There are State laws that can be effective, and of course there 
also could be Federal legislation that would help to rein in 
these abusive practices that you allude to.
    Certain States to date, some States have treated these 
transactions like a mortgage loan and required foreclosure. 
Those include Florida, Oklahoma, and California. There are a 
few others States that sometimes require foreclosure if the 
consumer has paid more than a certain amount already, and that 
includes Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Maryland, Maine, and Texas. 
And there are some other protections that could be meaningful. 
Requiring recordation of contracts can be very helpful. Iowa, 
Maryland, and Washington require the contracts to be recorded.
    Of course, you have to have sufficient remedies so that the 
companies will comply because there is widespread noncompliance 
even in States that do have a recording requirement.
    Other important protections are things like limiting or 
prohibiting other liens on the property because sometimes 
buyers in a contract-for-deed do not know that there is a 
higher priority mortgage or tax lien that could foreclose at 
any time. So it is much better if it is not permissible to have 
higher priority liens there.
    And then there are some habitability requirements, actually 
requiring the property to meet a livable standard of 
habitability is also a very important protection that exists in 
Virginia and in some local city ordinances.
    Senator Tester. I appreciate that answer. One of the things 
that we are seeing in Montana that I think is similar is bad 
actors buying up manufactured housing communities, and then 
once the buy them they jack up the lot rent because they can. 
Now these are folks that own their own manufactured home, but 
they do not own the land that lies underneath them, so they are 
stuck.
    I know that Montana is not the only State where this is a 
problem, with purchase of mobile home communities that, in 
fact, hurt the elderly, hard-working families, folks who have 
been there and it has been their home for a long, long time.
    What we have seen--and this is for you, Ms. Mancini, 
again--we have seen some success with resident-owned community 
conversions in Montana. Could you talk about this and tell me 
what we could do to help those communities?
    Ms. Mancini. Thank you, Senator. I am so glad you raised 
this issue because you are absolutely right. Buyers in land 
contracts are in an even more precarious position when they are 
buying the manufactured home, but they are renting the land 
underneath, which happens quite a bit all around the country. 
And when the owners of the land jack up the lot rent, that 
consumer is out of luck because most of these homes cannot be 
moved. They will fall apart.
    So the rights to actually purchase the manufactured home 
community is an extremely important protection, the opportunity 
to have resident-owned communities, and I believe there have 
been some good State law reforms around the country. There is 
also the PRICE Act that helps to fund that process for 
resident-owned communities as an affordable housing measure. So 
I think that is a very important step, and more could be done 
there.
    Senator Tester. And Beth and John, would you like to 
respond to that question on resident-owned community 
conversions? You do not have to if you do not want to.
    Ms. Goodell. Thank you, Senator Tester. I am aware that in 
Minnesota the Attorney General's Office is working on stronger 
protections for purchasers of manufactured housing. In the 
community in which I live, a housing tract was sold to a new 
owner who then tried to put in rent increases on the land, but 
the Attorney General's Office stepped in and prevented that, 
and is now working on a set of laws that would allow for owner 
purchasing of the land and greater protection for the 
residents.
    Senator Tester. Thank you. John, do you have anything to 
add?
    Mr. Green. Yes. Just briefly, all I would say about it is I 
would point out the fact that not owning the land subjects 
families to a range of higher costs--higher fees, higher 
interest rates. By virtue of being subject to chattel loans as 
opposed to being able to finance these as typical home 
purchases, it limits the options that are available. So again, 
by virtue of having the opportunity to purchase the land, 
owning that land is the fundamental difference between being 
able to finance a manufactured home as a site-built property. 
So these are important protections to provide.
    Senator Tester. Thank you for the hearing, Madam Chair, and 
I yield back.
    Chair Smith. Thank you, Senator Tester. Senator Lummis.
    Senator Lummis. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I am going to 
start, Mr. Green, with you. I want to make sure, in my short 
time, that you have the opportunity to share all of the 
recommendations that you would make to us and further encourage 
you to make the same kind of presentations to either the 
National Governors Association or to their groups. There is a 
Midwestern Governors Association. There is a Southern Governors 
Association. There is a Western Governors Association. Some 
States belong to several of those, but almost everybody belongs 
to the National Governors Association. The Governors need to 
hear this too, and so I strongly encourage you to make use of 
that venue.
    That said, please use as much of my remaining 4 minutes as 
you feel you need to give us more ideas about what the 
solutions are, the answers to this big problem.
    Mr. Green. Thank you so much, Senator. I would say we have 
an array of responses, but I think the most impactful things 
that we can do are to be able to identify these contracts where 
they exist, and the recordation plays such a huge role it 
cannot be overstated that being able to enforce contract law 
requires the recognition of where these properties are, who the 
owners are, and who are the counterparties that can be dealt 
with. For us, having the capital to be able to provide, but not 
knowing how to reach potential sellers is corrosive.
    Senator Lummis. Did you say you are in 18 States?
    Mr. Green. We are in 18 States today.
    Senator Lummis. Eighteen States.
    Mr. Green. Our pipeline today would take us into as many as 
30 States.
    Senator Lummis. Wow. OK. Excuse the interruption. Go ahead.
    Mr. Green. No, no problem at all. I would point out that 
these are overweighted in the Midwest and the South, for 
reasons that are consistent with ones that were pointed out by 
my colleagues.
    But what I would point out is that some of our findings are 
really that at the base of any solution has to be some 
encouragement about how to finance, because it is not simply 
the fact that you cannot finance the purchase. In many of these 
cases, these lower-cost properties have the sorts of deferred 
maintenance conditions that have been referred to by both of my 
colleagues here.
    So despite the fact that we have been able to transfer 
significant equity to many of these families, these families, 
for the reasons that they cannot get a primary mortgage cannot 
tap that equity in order to make basic needed repairs. So if 
your house has a leaky roof, it simply needs to be replaced, 
you may be comfortable making your monthly payment, for 
instance, but completely unable to make those capital 
improvements. So sweat equity and other sorts of things have 
played a larger role than practical for many families, so 
creating the capacity to finance.
    What many families do not realize when they are on the 
wrong end of these lease option arrangements, is not only can 
they not exercise their option because perhaps the house is 
overvalued, but because there simply is not a mortgage that is 
available. There are no lenders. It requires a lender 
essentially the same work to underwrite a $500,000 mortgage as 
a $50,000 mortgage, so the industry tends not to produce enough 
of the latter.
    Senator Lummis. OK. So could we focus on that for just a 
second, because in Wyoming I find that most of our banks are 
State-chartered community banks. They are small banks. And the 
more requirements that are placed on them by us, federally, the 
harder it is for them to spend the time, the paperwork, to do 
those small mortgages, so they just decide not to. And then 
people are shifted to these contract-for-deed types of 
situations because the banks are excluded from the 
transactions. They do not need a bank. But then you have some 
unscrupulous private financiers, that we have been hearing 
about during this hearing.
    So you are that alternative, it sounds like. Your company, 
Blackstar, tries to identify those contracts-for-deed and get 
them back to a product that is more like a traditional 
mortgage. Am I stating that fairly?
    Mr. Green. That is actually a traditional mortgage.
    Senator Lummis. OK. So your number one request would be to 
be able to identify these contracts-for-deed so you can 
approach the person who is subject to the contract.
    Mr. Green. Yes. So number one certainly is the recordation, 
so that we can identify it. I would say enforcement actions, 
many States do have laws on the books that would take the teeth 
out of some of the sting that is provided to families who are 
subject to forfeiture and on the wrong end of the bad-faith 
actions. But unfortunately, the enforcement and the advocacy 
tends to be poor. It tends to rely on groups like NCLC. And so 
unless a family raises their hand to be advocated for, then 
they are left twisting in the wind.
    Senator Lummis. Yeah. That makes perfect sense to me. My 
time is up, but I want to thank you for that. And further, if 
it is all right, Madam Chairman, Ms. Mancini, it sounds like 
you have a fairly comprehensive understanding of what State 
laws are around the Nation, and I would ask you to provide that 
to the Committee so that we can go through and have a better 
inventory of what State laws look like and which States are in 
need of some advice from us, or something stronger than advice 
from us.
    Thank you. Thanks so much, Madam Chairman. I yield back.
    Chair Smith. Thank you so much, Senator Lummis.
    So I want to just start out by clarifying a bit about what 
is happening here with these contracts-for-deed. So these land 
contracts basically are lacking basic consumer protections for 
the folks that are engaging in them. So for example, in most 
situations if you are in a mortgage and you miss a payment or 
so, at worst case you go into sort of a foreclosure process. 
But what happens with these buyers is that they go into this 
immediate forfeiture, like one missed payment and you end up 
kind of losing everything. Is that right, Ms. Mancini?
    Ms. Mancini. Yes, Senator Smith, and the key thing about 
the forfeiture is there is no public auction of the home. So in 
a foreclosure at least there is a possibility that a third-
party buyer could pay what the house is worth, and the surplus 
would go to that former homeowner. But with a forfeiture, the 
seller just keeps the house.
    Chair Smith. The seller keeps everything, and the person 
who has been paying in does not have any opportunity for any 
kind of redress at all.
    Ms. Mancini. That is right.
    Chair Smith. In a traditional mortgage there are certain 
things that Congress, that I would say, in their wisdom, have 
said are illegal activities. We learned this from the 2008 
financial crisis. You cannot have balloon payments. You cannot 
have rapidly increasing monthly payments that basically price 
people out of an ability to own their own home.
    Do I have that basically right? Is that another important 
difference between these land contracts and mortgages?
    Ms. Mancini. We would argue that actually land contracts 
should be covered by the Dodd-Frank Act and those protections, 
but most actors are totally ignoring the Truth in Lending Act 
and all Federal consumer laws. So if it is a true land 
contract, those laws really do apply, but they are being 
violated left and right, and no one is enforcing it.
    Chair Smith. So we do have Federal laws to protect 
homeowners, including the Truth in Lending Act, but one of the 
challenges, and I think this gets to what Mr. Green is saying, 
one of the challenges that we have is we do not know where 
these are. We do not know who it is because there is no 
requirement to record these contracts in any way. Is that 
correct?
    Ms. Mancini. That is right, and even in the States where 
there is a recordation requirement, they are often violated. So 
like Iowa, for example, says that if the contract is not 
recorded the seller cannot enforce the contract, so that is a 
very powerful remedy. So you have got to think about how you do 
it.
    Chair Smith. Right. So not only is it not recorded but 
there is no enforcement capacity there.
    Ms. Mancini. That is right.
    Chair Smith. And, you know, one thing I suspect people 
listening to this are asking themselves--and Ms. Goodell, I am 
going to turn to you on this, because you had an opportunity to 
work with some individuals who have been directly impacted by 
this. I think sometimes people might look at this and say why 
would you enter into a contract that you do not know anything 
about? The basic question is how did you get taken advantage 
of, is the question.
    So I am wondering, Ms. Goodell, if you could just talk a 
bit about your experience with these individuals and help us 
understand a little bit about how people end up in these 
predatory and exploitive contract relationships.
    Ms. Goodell. Sure. Thank you, Senator Smith. My clients 
tend to have trusted the sellers, the people who approached 
them with a situation that maybe sounded too good to be true, 
and we know that often it is the case that it is not true.
    One of my clients said to me, ``Why would this seller sell 
me a house that he knew I could not afford?'' and the answer, 
that the seller would make a lot of money if you failed was 
beyond her understanding. She trusted that the seller was being 
reasonable.
    Chair Smith. This gets to a point that I think all of you 
have made in one way or another, which is that these contracts 
are designed to fail because that is how the seller makes more 
money. So the incentives are not aligned, the incentives are 
perverse, and that is why you have this sort of breakdown.
    Ms. Mancini, in your testimony you suggested several 
actions that Congress could take in order to address this 
issue. Could you just go over those and talk to us a bit about 
that?
    Ms. Mancini. Certainly, Senator. One important piece that 
everyone has touched on today is the idea of expanding access 
to the mortgage market for small-dollar mortgages, and that can 
be done in a number of ways. But essentially we need to 
encourage lenders to make small-dollar loans, to incentive it, 
in a way. Even though the origination cost is the same for a 
$50,000 mortgage as a $500,000 mortgage, we need a system in 
which banks cannot just say, ``We are not going to make loans 
to the low end of the market.'' They need to serve everyone.
    We also need more research on the prevalence of land 
contracts and the outcomes, and we need the CFPB, Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau, and State attorneys general to 
look more at enforcement and to have the bandwidth to enforce 
existing laws.
    Chair Smith. Yep. I have raised this question a couple of 
times also with the CFPB, to understand something I think 
Senator Lummis is also, we are trying to figure out, which is 
what is the interplay between State and Federal law when it 
comes to these contracts. So Ms. Mancini, I want to come to 
you. Yeah, anybody.
    Ms. Mancini. Yeah. So there can be both State and Federal 
laws that regulate these transactions. That is fine. As I 
mentioned, the Truth in Lending Act does apply, and it has 
certain requirements, but it is fairly limited in what it does. 
So States do still have the ability to impose further 
protections, and the Federal Government could as well.
    Chair Smith. OK. Mr. Green, your business, it seems to me 
to be a model that is demonstrating that it is possible to 
provide smaller mortgages to folks that have, in many cases, 
have been sort of blocked out of the mortgage market in order 
to buy their own home. And I am wondering if you could just 
tell us a little bit more about what we can learn. Ms. Mancini 
is talking about how Congress should be looking at ways that we 
could provide incentives for traditional financial institutions 
to offer smaller-dollar loans, so I am interested in that, but 
also what you can tell us about what you learned from your 
model about how to serve this particular group of Americans.
    Mr. Green. Sure. I think part of what makes our model 
possible, candidly, is the discounts that are achievable in the 
current market environment as a function partially of some of 
the enforcement actions that have been taken. State AGs have 
pursued, in some cases in very aggressive manners, perceived 
bad actors. And what that has done has prompted more desire to 
sell on the part of groups that would seek to hold as previous 
investors have but also created a chilled environment for 
would-be buyers, that depresses the pricing for that.
    What we are able to accomplish largely exists within the 
margins of those discounts. So, by virtue of taking more 
aggressive enforcement actions against those perceived bad 
actors it helps to keep pricing for these often overpriced 
instruments at a level that can allow for us to absorb the 
costs associated with providing these smaller-balance 
mortgages. So, we have the know-how, we have the financial 
capability, using levers like CRA, using SPCP programs and the 
like, and creating the sort of levers within institutions like 
Fannie and Freddie to ensure that their bulk sales do not 
inadvertently result in huge waves of REO properties being sold 
that are subsequently sold via contract.
    Because a big part of what happened in the wake of the GFC 
was precisely that. If we look at our own portfolio, more than 
two-thirds of the properties were previously REO sales from 
Fannie or Freddie that were subsequently sold as CFDs. So, by 
putting both restraints on those, constraints from that 
activity as well as actual enforcement to ensure that that does 
not happen will help to keep pricing down and allow the 
capacity for groups like ours to be able to finance properties.
    Chair Smith. So what you are describing is, in some ways, a 
good partnership between the public sector and the private 
sector. The public sector is doing enforcement. It is holding 
accountable these bad actor buyers. Then you are in a position 
with private investment that you can make to turn those 
properties into a good business opportunity and, very 
importantly, a good place for people to live, and basically in 
that sense it is able to solve the problem.
    Mr. Green. It is. I would say it advances meaningfully 
toward that.
    You know, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the 
significant yeoman's effort that is involved. These are more 
difficult populations to serve. The geographically dispersed 
nature of our work requires us to have a team that has deep 
expertise and is really willing to roll up their sleeves to 
accomplish it. The families are deeply appreciative. That is 
consistent with our mission.
    I think that, as a practical matter, you have to 
acknowledge that the difficulty of serving not only the primary 
mortgage market but the deep need for secondary mortgages or 
any sort of capacity to be able to finance the improvements and 
deferred maintenance issues of these properties has to be 
similarly addressed, and we think that there have to be 
incentives to help prompt that.
    Chair Smith. Thank you.
    Senator Lummis, do you have any further questions?
    Senator Lummis. You know, I do, and thank you, Madam 
Chairman.
    Ms. Mancini and Mr. Green, if you could please, where do 
the credit unions fit in this? They are taxed differently than 
banks. They are tax advantaged. They are not for-profits. So 
they should be able to address some of these small lending 
issues in a way that is still beneficial to their tax 
advantaged status, whereas banks may be less so because they 
have to factor in the tax component of their business.
    Why aren't credit unions helping out here?
    Ms. Mancini. Senator Lummis, I will try to take a start on 
that. I think that some credit unions are more willing to make 
smaller-dollar mortgages than a lot of banks, but we still do 
not see a lot of that, and it is something I would be happy to 
follow up with and try to get a bit more insight. But I believe 
that the origination costs and the compensation structures, 
even at credit unions, tend to make it difficult below 
$100,000.
    And Mr. Green, you may know more.
    Mr. Green. Yeah, I would concur with that point. I think 
that below a certain threshold the fixed costs proportionately 
just make it much less desirable. And I think that 
inadvertently some of the result of the qualified mortgage 
rules that are part and parcel to Dodd-Frank make it for small-
balance mortgages a little more difficult to carry those costs 
in quite the same way that you would in terms of the way that 
mortgages are originated.
    So the incentive lies much more on the other side of the 
ledger, particularly during the sort of market that we have had 
over the previous 10 years, where refinance activity and 
lowering interest rates made it much easier, much more 
attractive. Just the opportunity costs of doing larger loans 
did not leave a lot of oxygen in the room for smaller-balance 
loans.
    Senator Lummis. So Mr. Green, would it be advisable to us 
for us to consider a carveout from Dodd-Frank for smaller-sized 
mortgages that provide a lesser regulatory burden and therefore 
a greater financial incentive for financial institutions to 
lend below the $100,000 level?
    Mr. Green. Yes, I think there are some provisions that 
exist, but I think there are some nuanced considerations to be 
able to incorporate reasonable costs so that organizations like 
ours do not have to fully absorb the cost of doing that, or 
disproportionately absorb the cost of doing that, and to be 
able to roll those into loans.
    I would also point out that there are also some practical 
dynamics in the market, things like appraisal gaps that exist, 
given the lack of liquidity in these markets. There just tend 
to be fewer transactions, so pegging price tends to be harder. 
So, on the margins it is more difficult to transact in this 
property market segment, and as a function of that you have to 
do things to grease the wheels, to be able to make it more 
likely the transactions can occur.
    Senator Lummis. Do you have competition in your business 
model? I mean, are there other firms like you out there?
    Mr. Green. I think our competition is not necessarily firms 
that do what we do. It is firms that would acquire to do the 
opposite. There is not a lot of incentive for groups, 
unfortunately, like the players in Minnesota who have targeted 
the Somali populations, to sell to groups like ours after 
having received large downpayments and having that significant 
equity cushion.
    So for us, it less that there are groups that are seeking 
to do what we do. It is groups that would acquire the same 
properties and seek to perform, essentially, what we are all 
here to talk about today in terms of churning families, 
squeezing them, and charging high interest rates to be able to 
have high cash-yielding investments.
    Senator Lummis. Are there Federal barriers to the success 
of your business model at Blackstar?
    Mr. Green. I would say that we encounter less in the way of 
barriers so much as we would benefit from tailwinds that would 
be associated with more vigorous enforcement actions.
    Senator Lummis. OK. I may want to visit with you about this 
more, but we can do that offline to explore some of those 
advantage that may accrue to incentivize a business like yours 
to provide consumer information. And I might ask that as my 
final question. Do you educate consumers as part of your 
business model?
    Mr. Green. We do. Part of our business model relies on 
trust-building. We are coming into an environment where there 
is, for many obvious reasons, a deficit of trust. So, a big 
part of what we have to do initially is to distinguish 
ourselves from our predecessors, and part of that is helping to 
educate them on the instrument that they have, the deficiencies 
of it, and why a traditional mortgage would benefit them, why 
having the headache of applying and why doing it with us is 
fundamentally different than the process before. So yes, that 
education is a big part of what we do.
    Ms. Mancini. Senator, I am sorry. Could I make one very 
quick point about QM? Is that all right?
    Senator Lummis. Absolutely, if the Chairman is OK with it.
    Chair Smith. Absolutely.
    Ms. Mancini. OK. Thank you. I just wanted to address the 
question about carveouts, because I really appreciate the 
collaborative spirit of thinking of various options.
    I did just want to point out that already the QM structure 
has different allowances for smaller-dollar loans, like the 
points and fees threshold and the APR thresholds are higher for 
smaller-dollar loans. So, there is already a built-in 
understanding about those fixed costs. And, of course, we 
should be cautious about removing key protections. I also think 
that a lot of the fixed costs of originating mortgages is aside 
from compliance. You know, there are just things that have to 
be paid for.
    But I think there is a benefit to more study about the 
costs of origination, the way loan officers are compensated, 
often as a percentage of the principal balance is another 
factor. And there are some banks that pay their loan officers a 
salary in certain departments, like for Community Economic 
Development, and that has led to more small-dollar lending as 
well.
    Chair Smith. That is interesting. Actually, I appreciate 
that, and I was going to ask Ms. Mancini, just as we wrap up 
here. To just pursue this a bit more, the fixed costs 
associated with mortgages are partly to pay for the things that 
protect buyers, and sellers potentially. I mean, making sure 
that there is an appraisal on the property so that you are not 
paying five times more, making sure that they are doing a title 
search to make sure that there are not liens on the property 
that the buyer is unaware of.
    Could you just maybe talk a bit more about what contributes 
to some of that fixed cost?
    Ms. Mancini. Absolutely, and you have named a few. So the 
title search and the closing attorney will get you to at least 
$1,000 or $1,500 right off the bat, and those are very 
important. Really, no one should purchase a home without having 
a lawyer do a title search to make sure the person selling it 
actually has good title. And then sometimes the inspection, 
there are the recording fees and the deed records. So there 
really are a number of flat fees that are hard to eliminate.
    We do know that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as part of 
their Equitable Housing Finance Plans have been looking closely 
at closing costs with an eye toward whether any of them can be 
reduced.
    Chair Smith. Thank you. That is great.
    Well, seeing no further questions for our panel, thanks so 
much to our witnesses for being here today and for providing 
testimony, both those of you in person and also Ms. Goodell, 
calling in remotely from Minnesota.
    I am interested in the conversation today. We are hearing a 
lot about sort of the interplay between State and Federal law 
and how that can work together, how it really should be 
supporting each other, what we can do to try to address the 
incentives around providing mortgages for smaller-dollar 
mortgages, which would then reduce the demand for these kinds 
of exploitive contracts-for-deed, and many other, I think, good 
ideas for us to start thinking about.
    And I would like to just say that I look forward to 
continuing to work with our colleagues on this and work toward 
some commonsense solutions that we can have, that we can work 
on together.
    Senator Lummis. Thank you, Madam Chairman, and I am 
particularly interested in if it is not recorded, the contract-
for-deed cannot be enforced. I think that is a really smart 
idea. So we have heard some really good ideas today, so thank 
you very much, again, for your testimony.
    Chair Smith. For Senators who wish to submit questions for 
the record, those questions are due 1 week from today, which 
will be Tuesday, July 18th. For witnesses, you will have 45 
days to respond to any questions for the record.
    Thank you again so much for your testimony, and with that 
this hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 3:38 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

supplied for the record follow:]
                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR TINA SMITH
    Good afternoon. The Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and 
Community Development will come to order.
    Everyone wants a safe, decent place to call home. Without this, 
nothing in your life works--not your job, your health, your education, 
your family, not anything. So when parents hear that there might be a 
way for them to buy a home for their families, something that may have 
seemed out of reach, we can understand what that would be like: safety, 
security, an opportunity for better school for their kids, to live 
closer to work, maybe a backyard or an extra bedroom for family. This 
is the American dream, and it's also the way that most people build 
wealth, grow into safe, secure life.
    This Subcommittee hearing today is about how this dream is being 
exploited by unscrupulous home sellers, under the guise of offering 
home ownership through complex contracts. Instead of a traditional 
mortgage, they sell homes ``on an installment plan, with a high 
interest loan called a contract-for-deed or land contract.'' \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

for-fixer-uppers-traps-low-income-buyers.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These contracts go by different names in different places, but what 
they have in common is that they provide all of the risks and few of 
the protections homeowners can expect under traditional mortgages. The 
buyers in these contracts often are faced with extraordinary penalties 
if they miss a payment. People think they are they were on the path to 
owning their own home, when in fact they are on a path for financial 
disaster--forfeiting all the money they have paid in, as well as the 
place they thought was home.
    Too often, these contracts are designed to fail.
    I became interested in this issue when I learned about how these 
land contract sellers are targeting Somali Muslim immigrants in 
Minnesota, who, under the tenants of their faith, are limited in paying 
interest with a traditional mortgage. The stories I've heard are 
heartbreaking and enraging. Families targeted, and exploited because of 
their religion, and their inability to get access to a traditional 
mortgage.
    As we did more research, we learned that unscrupulous contract-for-
deed sellers are operating across the country, but they typically 
target Black, Brown, and immigrant communities--groups that have long 
suffered from housing discrimination. It's estimated that there have 
been more than three million homes sold with land contract across the 
country, to Latino families in Minnesota, Black families in Akron and 
Detroit, and families of all races in Ohio, Texas, Georgia, and many 
other places.
    Our purpose with this hearing today is to understand how these land 
contracts work, how they differ from traditional mortgages, why their 
use is apparently expanding, and what this all means for the people 
caught up in this web.
    As a start, we know that many of these land contracts lack basic 
consumer protections. For example:

  <bullet>  In most situations, the seller continues to own the 
        property until the entire loan is paid off and if a family 
        misses a payment--which often happens--the seller can simply 
        evict the family and keep the home and all the money for 
        themselves, so they can turn around the do the deal all over 
        again with the next unsuspecting buyer.

  <bullet>  Land contracts often have loan terms that are illegal in a 
        traditional mortgage--like balloon payments, or lower payments 
        at the beginning, followed by unaffordably high payments down 
        the road. Congress specifically banned most ``balloon 
        payments'' after the 2008 financial crisis, but not for 
        contracts-for-deed.

  <bullet>  Land contracts have no basic protections for buyers, like 
        assessing the buyer's ability to pay, a fair appraised value of 
        the home, or sussing out other liens or the safety of the 
        property. These were all required by Congress for mortgages 
        after the 2008 financial crisis, but not for land contracts.

    It's important to understand that land contracts, contracts-for-
deed, and similar financing mechanisms have been around for a century 
or more. When used properly, are a legitimate tool for financing real 
estate transactions. In recent years, some nonprofits have launched 
innovative programs using land contracts, coupled with housing 
counseling and reasonable contract terms, to help families buy homes 
for the first time. I commend the organizations who are using land 
contracts as tools for good.
    But land contracts also have also historically been a tool of 
housing discrimination and exploitation of poor communities and 
communities of color who could not get access to traditional banking 
and mortgage products. Today these buyers still have a hard time 
getting access to credit, so the legacy of discrimination lives on 
today. Including in my hometown, where the disparities between White 
and Black home ownership are the greatest in the Nation.
    So today we are going to dive into this issue with this excellent 
panel of witnesses. We want to understand how this is happening, how 
prevalent the problem is, what impacts is has on families, and what 
Congress should consider as we think about basic consumer protections, 
and how to address the root causes of lack of access to capital and 
lending, so every family has a safe place to call home.
    Thank you, Senator Lummis, thank you for working with me on this 
hearing. You are recognized for your opening statement.

                PREPARED STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH GOODELL
             Supervising Attorney, Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid
                             July 11, 2023
    Chair Smith, Ranking Member Lummis, and Members of the Committee, 
thank you for inviting me to testify today regarding the abusive 
potential inherent in the purchase of homes under installment land 
contracts.
    I am a lawyer who supervises a practice group at Mid-Minnesota 
Legal Aid in Minneapolis. My practice group includes the representation 
of homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes.
    Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid (MMLA) provides free legal services for 
low-income residents of a 22-county area including Hennepin County and 
the city of Minneapolis. We serve clients whose household income is in 
the range of 125 percent of the Federal poverty level, or about $37,000 
for a family of four.
    ``Land Contracts'' are referred to as ``Contracts-for-Deed'' in 
Minnesota.
    MMLA has experience with contracts-for-deed dating back two 
decades, including the financial and foreclosure crisis of 2008, its 
leadup and its aftermath.
    On the surface, a contract-for-deed may appear to be a reasonable 
path to home ownership for people who cannot qualify for a purchase 
money mortgage. In our experience, however, contracts-for-deed are a 
vehicle for exploitation rather than a path to ownership.
    In representing low-income clients with contracts-for-deed, we have 
observed the following abusive practices. These examples are based on 
the experiences of clients we represented.

  <bullet>  The full payment due under the contract was clearly not 
        affordable for the buyer. The monthly payments were manageable 
        but the balloon payment in 3 years was clearly out of reach, 
        given that the buyer was on a fixed income with no prospects 
        for an increase. The balloon payment was exceedingly high 
        because the purchase price was grossly inflated beyond the fair 
        market value. The contract was sure to fail, and the seller 
        filed an eviction action after the balloon payment was not 
        made.

  <bullet>  The house was in serious need of repairs which the seller 
        of course refused to make. The client came to MMLA to try to 
        get the seller to make the repairs. The seller was really a 
        landlord seeking to avoid the obligations of State law 
        protecting tenants.

  <bullet>  The buyer had made significant payments towards the 
        purchase price in a combination of downpayment and monthly 
        payments over several years, but experienced a loss of income 
        and could no longer make the payments. Under Minnesota law, the 
        buyer had no right to any of the equity in the property.

    The use of contracts-for-deed by landlords to avoid their State law 
obligations to tenants is the most common abusive practice we have 
encountered. We have seen scores of cases where the ``buyers'' had the 
means to rent but not to buy, but the owner placed them in a contract-
for-deed, allowing the owner to avoid responsibility for repairs and 
maintenance. In one case, our client had rented from the owner for 
years. The owner was facing the loss of his rental license because he 
failed to make required repairs. On the eve of the loss of the rental 
license, the owner talked the tenant, a senior woman of color with 
developmental disabilities, into signing a contract-for-deed. He then 
removed the property from the city's registry of rental properties and 
allowed the property to fall into further disrepair. The tenant 
remained in the property for another 3 years before the owner brought 
an eviction action.
    Contract-for-deed buyers most frequently come to our attention in 
this situation--when they are being evicted. At that point, Minnesota 
law provides buyers almost no recourse. Minnesota law requires only a 
written notice of a breach in the contract-for-deed and a 60-day 
waiting period during which the buyer must cure the stated breach. 
After the 60-day period expires, the contract is deemed terminated and 
the buyer has no right to any home equity, to any appreciation in the 
value of the property during the term of the contract, to the return of 
any payments or the value of any repairs paid for.
    Contracts-for-deed increased in volume in Minnesota between 2000-
2020 because a large number of foreclosed homes became available for 
low prices ($10,000-$50,000) in certain areas. Further, the tightening 
of traditional mortgage credit, particularly for small dollar loans, 
contributed to an increase in contracts-for-deed as an alternative.
    An investigation by the Minneapolis Tribune showed that the number 
of contracts-for-deed recorded in Hennepin and Ramsey counties 
increased 56 percent between 2007 and 2012. [``Contracts-for-Deed Can 
Be House of Horror for Buyers'' (startribune.com)]
    Research by ProPublica showed that more than 1,800 contracts-for-
deed were recorded in Minnesota's 11 most populous counties in 2022. 
[``How Contracts-for-Deed Put Families at Financial Risk''--ProPublica]
    Each of those transactions placed the buyer at risk of the abuses 
identified above.
    All of the contract-for-deed buyers represented by MMLA were part 
of a vulnerable population: Low-income households without the means to 
buy homes using conventional mortgage lending. For many of our clients, 
their best interests lie in the availability of affordable, decently 
maintained rental housing rather than being pulled into contracts-for-
deed.
    Because of the overlap of poverty and race, low-income communities 
in our service area tend to be neighborhoods where a majority of the 
residents are people of color. Unscrupulous sellers of contracts-for-
deed do tend to target these communities and nearly all of our 
contract-for-deed clients have been people of color.
    We are aware that Somali immigrants are the recent targets of 
abusive contracts-for-deed. Minnesota has a very high number of Somali 
immigrants. Sellers are aware that the Islamic religion of most Somali 
immigrants prohibits them from paying interest, which means they will 
not take out conventional home purchase loans. Contract-for-deed 
sellers therefore target Somali immigrants. The buyers we have learned 
about are not in MMLA's service area, so they are not our clients, but 
the cases we've heard about tend to include significant downpayments, 
grossly exaggerated purchase prices and high monthly payments that were 
not sustainable. One family paid $73,000 down and then struggled with 
monthly payments of $4,800. If they defaulted on the payments, there is 
no requirement in Minnesota law that they get any of their money back. 
Another case involved a single Somali woman who paid $35,000 down and 
was able to make the monthly payments, but she could not find an 
insurance company that would insure the house. Having insurance was a 
term of the contract, so she was facing termination of the contract and 
loss of the money she paid.
    It's unconscionable that a seller would be able to keep such large 
payments in these situations.
    The National Consumer Law Center issued a comprehensive list of 
recommended policy changes for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
in its 2016 report, ``Toxic Transactions: How Land Installment 
Contracts Once Again Threaten Communities of Color''.
    Short of a comprehensive policy overhaul at the Federal level, 
there are a few changes to State law that would significantly improve 
the situation for buyers in Minnesota:

  <bullet>  Create a right of the buyer to a portion of the amount paid 
        or a portion of the equity in the value of the property in case 
        of default by the buyer.

  <bullet>  Create a requirement for an appraisal of the value of the 
        property and an inspection of the property to disclose 
        essential repairs.

  <bullet>  Require sellers to comply with the duties of landlords 
        under landlord-tenant law until a particular amount of the 
        purchase price has been paid.

    Contracts-for-deed don't always fail, but they fail low-income, 
vulnerable populations, including people of color and immigrants, too 
frequently to allow the situation to go on as it is.
    Thank you for the attention you are giving to this issue and for 
the opportunity to discuss it with you. I look forward to any questions 
you may have for me.

                    PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN GREEN
                Managing Principal, Blackstar Stability
                             July 11, 2023
    Good afternoon, Honorable Chairwoman Smith, Ranking Member Lummis, 
and esteemed Members of the Committee, and thank you for the 
opportunity to testify before you at this important hearing. My name is 
John Green, and I serve as Managing Principal of Blackstar Stability 
(Blackstar). Blackstar is a real estate investment management company 
that helps stabilize communities by expanding equitable ownership of 
affordable single-family homes. We are a private equity fund that 
changes the lives of working-class families by turning predatory land 
contracts into real mortgages. We focus on unsubsidized, affordable 
properties that are less than $100k and often sold through unregulated, 
predatory instruments. In today's testimony I will share with you two 
important findings of our work. First, that there is an immense 
unaddressed problem and second that there are readily available 
answers.
    Blackstar is an investor that purchases pools of homes encumbered 
by predatory forms of seller financing, converts the financing to 
traditional mortgages at fair market terms, eventually sells these 
mortgages and then recycles the capital. In that process, ownership is 
transferred to families in a transaction that is often life changing. 
Any equity associated with the property is also transferred at that 
point, which has increased the average family's net assets by over 20x 
to date. Any negative equity is absorbed by Blackstar. Monthly 
principal and interest payments have come down roughly 30 percent on 
average, and any lingering penalties and arrearages from previous 
sellers are extinguished.
Nature of the Problem
    Most of Blackstar's acquisition focus is on Contracts-for-Deed 
(``CFDs'', also known as land contracts) and similar sorts of 
instruments that confer the obligations of home ownership to buyers 
without the benefits and take typical landlord obligations and foist 
them on buyers/tenants. The prevalence of CFDs and similar products 
reflect a larger problem that nationally, the availability of small-
balance mortgages does not meet the demand from qualified buyers. The 
primary group of families Blackstar serves are seeking to buy small-
balance properties (i.e., less than $100k) and tend to have much less 
access to traditional mortgages than borrowers buying larger 
properties. Nationally, fewer than 30 percent of all properties sold 
for less than $70k are financed with a traditional mortgage. \1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Notably, the supply deficit of small-balance mortgages is driven 
much more by the high fixed costs and unfavorable economics of 
originating these loans than any deficiencies of financial wherewithal 
or creditworthiness amongst qualified borrowers. The issue 
disproportionately affects low-income and minority communities that 
comprise most of the demand for these loans. This problem is 
exacerbated by the fact that more than 20 percent of Black and 16 
percent of Hispanic adults are considered ``credit-invisible,'' with 
either non-existent or unscorable credit profiles \2\--even when they 
have been strong, consistent payers of predatory loan products.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unequal access to traditional mortgages has been a reality 
throughout U.S. history. The absence of available mortgages gives rise 
to predatory alternatives like CFDs. This gap has made working class 
housing markets far less liquid, depressed home ownership, robbed 
communities of hard-earned equity, and diminished both the capital and 
incentive to reinvest in those communities. Blackstar believes there 
are more than $200 billion or 4 million total CFDs in place today, 
mostly with borrowers who would prefer a traditional mortgage.
    Home ownership is a keystone for middle-class families to build 
generational wealth. Nearly two-thirds of household wealth for middle-
income families is comprised by their principal residence. Health 
outcomes improve for children of homeowners, students who move less 
often are more successful in school, and the ability to shelter in 
place became an unexpected necessity in recent years. Black and Brown 
families understand and crave these benefits, but over time have only 
consistently managed to exchange one set of predations and 
discriminatory practices for another. Unfortunately, home ownership is 
the largest driver of the racial wealth gap in the United States, \3\ 
yet few policies advance equitable and inclusive strategies that would 
result in meaningful progress. While approximately two-thirds of all 
Americans own their homes, that proportion camouflages a troubling gap 
where only 45 percent of Black families are homeowners, compared to 74 
percent of White families. \4\ Moreover, as owners and buyers, Black 
and Brown families are significantly more likely to have a subprime 
loan (even if they qualify for a prime mortgage) or another, more 
predatory form of home financing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It's not as if Black and Brown families have not sought home 
ownership despite redlining and other practices. CFDs, which fill the 
gap left by missing lending products, have existed in a largely 
unregulated manner in the U.S. for more than 100 years and dwarf the 
scale of industries like payday loans and car title loans which are 
often scrutinized as similarly predatory. These land contracts gained 
prominence due to the redlining of Black communities by programs begun 
under the New Deal. Passage of some key legislation in the 1960-70s 
expanded access to mortgages somewhat, though still not equitably. 
However, a resurgence of CFDs resulted from the Global Financial 
Crisis. Black families lost their homes to foreclosure at nearly twice 
the rate of other groups. \5\ When a glut of devalued, vacant homes in 
low- and moderate-income communities needed to be resold, the market 
reinvigorated an old tactic--CFDs. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, freshly 
bailed out by taxpayers, sold homes in bulk to corporate and individual 
buyers who tripled or quadrupled the price and quickly resold them to 
unsophisticated or desperate families, often using CFDs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Predatory lending products wreak havoc on a family's financial and 
psychological well-being. What often begins as a hopeful chance to own 
one's own home almost always ends in unpayable debt on a home that 
continues to deteriorate around them. By the time Blackstar purchases 
these CFDs, one of two scenarios has inevitably taken place. Either the 
family has fallen significantly behind on their payments or despite 
having diligently paid on time has made almost no progress on their 
debt. In both cases, the family is often disgruntled and disheartened.
Overview of the Blackstar Solution
    Blackstar's focus is to preserve affordable single-family housing, 
lower the cost of ownership, and keep families in their homes by 
restructuring distressed debt products and attacking predatory seller-
financed, mortgage alternative practices that both undermine value and 
promote disinvestment in these communities.
    Upon acquiring properties encumbered by these types of contracts, 
the first step is direct conversation to establish rapport and build 
trust with the family. One critical reason that Blackstar does not 
charge fees, ask for money up front or impose conversion deadlines is 
to prove that this opportunity to achieve true home ownership is 
different. After Blackstar has earned the trust of the borrower many 
families still need help to adjust to a more normalized relationship 
with their lender. Some families need budgeting help, some need 
assistance with repairs and occasionally some need to sell the home 
that is no longer a good fit for the needs of the family. Blackstar has 
found that when offered a fair opportunity, a fresh start and ongoing 
guidance and support, most families are eager and successful in 
converting to a traditional and equitable lending arrangement.
    Blackstar's approach uses scalable, market-driven, commonsense 
tactics to confront credit invisibility and refinance homes at a lower 
cost for families who have been solid payers for higher-cost mortgage 
alternatives. We believe these improved ownership outcomes strike at 
the core of the racial wealth gap by extension. Blackstar's business 
model creates a marketplace which brings together:

  <bullet>  Families seeking to purchase affordable single-family homes 
        at fair terms (who have often been unable to tap traditional 
        mortgage markets),

  <bullet>  Financial institutions seeking CRA-eligible, performing 
        mortgages,

  <bullet>  Investors seeking compelling, risk-adjusted returns that 
        drive significant social benefits for low- and moderate-income 
        families through a scalable, market-driven strategy; and

  <bullet>  Bulk sellers of existing CFD and substantially similar 
        Lease-to-Own (LTO) products, who often have limited secondary 
        market disposition opportunities.

    Inherent in this support of preserving affordable housing is a 
strong sustainability thesis. Unlike affordable housing solutions that 
are generally multifamily rental properties and require significant 
subsidy, our program helps organically spur reinvestment from families 
through a financing solution that empowers them. Our approach avoids 
the functional obsolescence of the homes and helps meet a dramatic 
supply deficit of affordable housing nationwide.
    As a proof of concept, Blackstar acquired a seed portfolio of 181 
homes across 18 States, encumbered by CFDs and LTO agreements that 
reflects the broader opportunity in a 4Q20 transaction and a follow-on 
acquisition in 3Q21. Blackstar has worked with the existing residents 
to extinguish the CFDs and LTOs by originating mortgages in a manner 
that provides residents with outright affordable home ownership. As of 
June 30, 2023, Blackstar has converted 86 CFDs and LTOs to mortgages, 
sold 27 vacated properties, and received full payoffs for 10 CFDs. 
Beyond the strong expected financial returns for this investment, its 
impacts include:

  <bullet>  Wealth Creation: $3.6 million in equity has been 
        transferred to 84 families, or $43,000 per family (a more than 
        20x increase in their net assets on average)

  <bullet>  Principal Reduction: $131,000 in total principal balance 
        reductions has been realized by 12 families, which is a 24-
        percent reduction in their outstanding principal balances

  <bullet>  Payment Reduction: With respect to the 84 mortgages 
        originated with Blackstar, monthly principal and interest 
        payments have been reduced by 27 percent, or approximately $122 
        per month on average

  <bullet>  Term Reduction: 26 families reduced the remaining term on 
        their loans by more than 5 years

  <bullet>  Interest Savings: Approximately $1 million of projected 
        lifetime interest savings will be realized across 60 families 
        that were previously subjected to predatory CFDs

  <bullet>  Penalties and Arrearages Forgiven: Approximately $130,000 
        of penalty fees, charges, and interest forgiven across 40 
        families, or approximately $3,250 per family (roughly 3x the 
        average net assets for the families)

    Notably, the median household income for the families served was 
approximately $45,000 per year, which is slightly less than 60 percent 
of the Area Median Income in their respective markets.
    The need is vast and not well understood. There were more than $300 
billion of distressed loans and $200 billion of CFDs and similar 
predatory instruments before COVID-19 devastated the economy. This 
represented more than 4 million families with CFDs and over 2 million 
with negative equity. Disproportionately, these issues affect low-
income and minority communities. The problems were particularly acute 
in areas with high concentrations of lower-cost properties and where 
State consumer protection laws are weaker. The many varied 
circumstances that lead families to finance a home purchase using a 
CFD, and the ensuing challenges often require thoughtful consideration 
to counteract. Below are a few examples of situations that Blackstar 
has worked through with borrowers:

  <bullet>  Promises Kept--Canton, Illinois--Borrowers are a disabled 
        veteran and his daughter, who is also disabled. They share a 
        small, multigenerational house that includes young children. 
        When Blackstar purchased the house it had no central heating, 
        no hot water and the roof leaked. The borrowers had stopped 
        making payments due to the condition of the home and broken 
        promises of the seller. The veteran borrower is also an amputee 
        and was unable to accept help from a local veterans' group to 
        adapt the home due to not having title to the house. Blackstar 
        provided a new roof, furnace, and hot water heater. The 
        borrowers' disability income qualified them for a new 30-year 
        mortgage with a 30-percent reduction in principal and interest 
        and the opportunity to complete necessary accommodations to the 
        home.

  <bullet>  New School Clothes and an Affordable Payment--Muncie, 
        Indiana--Borrower is a single mother of two teenagers who works 
        in food service at a local university. She struggles to make 
        ends meet with a gross income of $2,600 a month but always 
        makes the house payment. In addition to lowering her principal 
        substantially, Blackstar was able to lower her monthly payment 
        from $530 to $375. She believes the savings will change their 
        quality of life. When Blackstar told her that there would be no 
        payment due in September as the new mortgage would not yet have 
        accrued interest, she gasped and said it would be the first 
        time in her children's life that they would have new school 
        clothes.

  <bullet>  Basic Necessities--Muncie, Indiana--Borrower is an elderly 
        man who was buying the house using a land contract despite a 
        leaky roof and parts of the house having inoperable plumbing. 
        He had been bathing at his son's home across the street. He had 
        equity in the house and could afford the payment but did not 
        have access to the capital needed for necessary repairs. 
        Blackstar financed a new roof and plumbing and then converted 
        his debt to a lower interest rate mortgage. He opted for a 15-
        year mortgage, choosing to minimize interest costs on his now 
        functional home.

  <bullet>  An Affordable Home--Dayton, Ohio--Borrower is a disabled 
        woman who entered an inflated lease option in hopes of securing 
        a long-term home that she could afford on a fixed income. 
        Despite high housing costs, she never missed a lease payment, 
        but as her option to purchase expired, she had no realistic 
        path to ownership. Blackstar lowered the principal balance to 
        match the market value of the home and qualified her for a 30-
        year mortgage that reduced monthly housing costs by over 30 
        percent, thereby providing stability on a fixed income.

    Blackstar's innovation counters the lack of access to financing and 
the related issues that disproportionately affect working class 
families, and minority communities. By purchasing the targeted assets 
at substantial discounts from market-driven sellers, Blackstar can 
rethink the service delivery model for originating and servicing small-
balance mortgages. However, the intensity of the company's focus on 
borrower success and foreclosure avoidance is distinct from most 
investors. It employs a scalable, hybrid model for enhanced borrower 
interaction that provides many insights to reaching solutions that are 
mutually beneficial for families and investors.
Blackstar's Conversion Process
    The process of ``converting'' a CFD or LTO is a dynamic partnership 
between Blackstar, the borrower and a mortgage lender. The first step, 
shortly after purchasing the CFD/LTO, is for Blackstar to communicate 
with the borrower and begin the process of building trust. Often the 
borrower is unaware of the CFD/LTO limitations, or alternatively is 
painfully aware of those limitations and is angry, cynical, or 
disillusioned with their situation. Blackstar approaches each borrower 
and initiates a conversation regarding their individual circumstances 
and presents the option of converting the CFD or LTO to a traditional 
mortgage. If the borrower is not interested or ready to convert, 
Blackstar works with them to settle any predatory fees and arrearages 
to make the current situation as fair as possible while the borrower 
considers the new opportunity and their options. Often, these predatory 
arrangements have been in place for many years, and it takes time to 
build both trust and a shared commitment. Blackstar is careful not to 
impose ultimatums or false deadlines and works to create a harmonious 
relationship between lender and borrower.
    Once the borrower is ready to convert the predatory instrument into 
a conventional mortgage, Blackstar refers them to a third party, 
licensed mortgage originator to take a traditional mortgage 
application. Blackstar-financed mortgages are fully documented and 
underwritten to Qualifying Mortgage standards for low balance loans. 
Approved underwriting ratios are similar to FHA and other refinance 
products for moderate- and low-income homeowners. Blackstar does not 
require a minimum credit score nor any closing costs or downpayment, as 
most CFD borrowers have little net worth and challenged credit. The new 
mortgage is offered at the lower of the current principal balance or 
the value of the home. Often CFDs and LTOs are written at values 
substantially higher than the house is worth, so it is important to 
reset the loan to no more than the actual value of the home. If the 
home needs substantial repairs, Blackstar finances the repairs prior to 
initiating the new mortgage with the cost added to the principal 
balance and then adjusted if above the home's repaired value. The new 
mortgage is generally a 15- or 30-year term at an interest rate 
substantially below the current rate of the predatory CFD/LTO.
    Once the borrower is documented and approved, the new mortgage is 
closed and recorded at a title company and boarded with a licensed 
servicer. Blackstar funds the escrow reserve and pays closing costs and 
the lender's origination fee, so the new mortgage is achieved without 
additional cash out of pocket for borrowers. To date, Blackstar has 
closed 86 conversions with no foreclosures. All borrowers have achieved 
either reduced payments, shortened amortizations or repairs made 
possible by corresponding reductions in interest rates and in some 
cases principal forgiveness. Past-due fees and arrearages are forgiven, 
and in many States, property taxes are lowered as borrowers now have 
title to the home and thereby qualify for homestead exemptions.
Key Challenges
    Perhaps the largest challenge Blackstar faces is finding the CFDs 
and LTOs. While we know there are millions of these instruments 
existing throughout the country, very few are recorded. Even in States 
that require the recordation of CFDs, compliance is minimal, and 
enforcement of those laws is virtually non-existent. While many of the 
most predatory LTOs are structured and presented tantamount to CFDs, 
transferring the landlord's responsibilities to the tenant, there are 
virtually no laws that require the option arrangement to be made 
public. Given the extreme profitability and questionable legality in 
certain of these arrangements, the owners selling properties via CFDs 
and LTOs overwhelmingly stay in the shadows and rarely sell through 
transparent mechanisms.
    A second consistent challenge, once CFDs and LTOs have been 
identified, is agreeing on a fair price. As exorbitant interest rates 
and inflated property values create a cash flow far beyond what could 
be reasonably derived from these often-sub-standard assets, owners 
without external motivations are often reluctant to sell. Moreover, 
rising interest rates and market volatility have made the acquisition 
landscape much less active, as sellers have been slow and often 
unwilling to accept the lower prices implied by higher risk-free rates 
and risk premiums. Blackstar routinely encounters owners unwilling to 
sell because the cash flow achieved by their portfolios cannot be 
replicated.
    Once acquired, there are many challenges to converting CFDs/LTOs to 
mortgages. To begin with, because compensation structures favor higher 
balance loans, very few mortgage originators offer and none focus on 
loans below $100,000, let alone the even lower balance, more 
challenging properties that Blackstar targets. Once Blackstar is able 
to contract with a lender to originate these loans at QM standards it 
must pay the cost of the mortgage in order to not exceed statuary 
limits on fees. The condition of the home and appraisal gaps can also 
be challenging, as many of these homes have substantial deferred 
maintenance that limit value.
    Headline, legal and regulatory risks are effective deterrents that 
have led many large investors to avoid CFDs altogether. Recent 
litigation penalties and settlements underscore the perils of not 
acting in good faith as with some previous investors. The unit 
economics of CFD investments are often favorable; however, their small 
balances imply a need to manage a high volume to achieve efficiency and 
significant scale.
Recommendations
    There is a clear and better path than the limited pool of options 
and minimal protections afforded to small-balance home buyers today.

  <bullet>  Small-balance mortgage lending that reaches underserved 
        consumers and communities should be meaningfully incentivized.

  <bullet>  The GSEs must not only prohibit the use of CFDs or 
        comparable instruments by resellers of foreclosed property, but 
        aggressively enforce these policies. They should also make 
        better efforts to prevent foreclosure, and when it is 
        unavoidable, to more vigorously incorporate community-minded 
        buyers in sales processes.

  <bullet>  Consumer protections must be enhanced and enforced.

  <bullet>  Recordation of CFDs and LTOs must be required.
Conclusion
    The current state of affairs is not inevitable. Blackstar has 
established a fund which purchases CFDs and converts them into 
traditional mortgages at reasonable interest rates. Our model works. It 
is a simple, effective approach that earns an attractive risk-adjusted 
return for investors while providing life-changing stability and lower 
payments to families. Current market conditions afford a unique 
opportunity to effectuate this change. Consumer advocates, State 
Attorneys General and regulators have begun putting pressure on some 
particularly egregious issuers of CFDs, but more attention is needed. 
Many issuers are simply looking to realize gains by liquidating their 
holdings in a buyer's market. Blackstar Stability is creating the sort 
of viable, life-changing home mortgage alternative for working class 
families that is available to mainstream America.
    Fair and equitable access to the housing finance system is both 
good policy and good business. More stable, economically strong 
homeowners will benefit everyone while tangibly lowering the wealth 
gap.
         RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF CHAIR SMITH
                   FROM SARAH BOLLING MANCINI

Q.1. In your testimony, you briefly discussed the qualified 
mortgage structure and existing allowances for smaller-dollar 
loans. Can you elaborate further on what allowances are 
available and how they affect the cost of originating smaller-
dollar loans? How can we encourage more small-dollar lending 
while maintaining strong consumer protections?

A.1. Chair Smith, thank you for this question. Increasing 
access to small dollar mortgages while maintaining protections 
for these consumers is very important. The ability to repay and 
qualified mortgage rules already have more lenient requirements 
for small-dollar mortgages, which I will describe below.

Insufficient Access to Small Dollar Mortgages

    The lack of availability of small-dollar mortgages prevents 
low-income people and, disproportionately, people of color from 
building wealth through home ownership, and fuels the rise of 
the predatory financing products described in the July 11th 
hearing in communities already suffering from discrimination 
and disinvestment.
    Mortgage loans remain out of reach for many creditworthy 
consumers in rural and urban communities. Consumers seeking 
loans to purchase lower-priced homes, including manufactured 
homes, or to rehabilitate, repair or make energy efficient 
upgrades to existing homes, rely on alternative, often 
predatory, high-cost financing. Access to small dollar 
mortgages remains scarce. \1\ Banks and other lenders either do 
not offer small-dollar mortgages, or deny small-dollar 
mortgages to creditworthy borrowers at higher rates compared to 
consumers who apply for larger loans. \2\ The definition of 
``small'' has crept up over time. One recent analysis shows 
that just 26 percent of properties that sold for less than 
$150,000 between 2018 and 2021 were financed using a mortgage, 
compared with 71 percent of higher-cost homes. \3\

Dodd-Frank's Ability To Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rules

    The Dodd-Frank Act requirement to verify the consumer's 
ability to repay was one of the most important consumer 
protections to arise out of the 2008 foreclosure crisis. 
Congress saw that lending without regard to ability to pay had 
been one of the major causes of the wave of subprime mortgage 
foreclosures, and amended the Truth in Lending Act to 
specifically require lenders to document and consider the 
borrower's ability to repay in residential mortgage loan 
transactions. \4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \4\ 15 U.S.C. 1639c(a)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At the same time, Congress created a category of 
presumptively safe mortgage loans, termed ``Qualified 
Mortgages'' (QM), entitled to a presumption of compliance with 
the ability to repay requirement. The Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau (CFPB) was granted authority to issue 
regulations further implementing the statutory framework. There 
are several different kinds of QMs, all of which must meet 
certain basic criteria, including up front points and fees 
below a certain limit. In addition, a mortgage can qualify 
under the ``general QM'' definition based on the APR of the 
loan. \5\ The affordability presumption granted through QM 
status is rebuttable for ``higher priced mortgage loans'' 
(loans over a certain APR), and irrebuttable, resulting in a 
total safe harbor from ability-to-repay claims, for loans below 
that APR threshold. Many lenders want to qualify for this safe 
harbor, and thus confine their mortgage lending to loans that 
meet the QM criteria.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \5\ The ``pricing'' threshold for the general QM category was 
promulgated by the CFPB in 2020 as an eventual replacement for the 
``GSE patch,'' which temporarily defined loans that are eligible for 
purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac as QM loans. In addition to 
falling below the relevant price threshold, the lender must ``consider 
and verify'' the borrower's income, assets, and debts with reliable 
third-party records. 12 CFR 1026.43(e)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The fixed cost of originating a mortgage and the effect of 
points and fees on the loan's QM status are certainly a primary 
cause that lenders cite for the limited number of smaller 
dollar mortgages being made. However, the QM rules offer 
considerably more flexibility for smaller-dollar mortgage loans 
than is commonly recognized.

More Lenient QM Rules for Small Dollar Mortgages

    The QM rules are more lenient for smaller dollar mortgages 
in two ways: (1) the points and fees limit to qualify as a QM 
is a larger percentage of the loan amount for smaller dollar 
loans, and (2) the APR threshold to qualify for the general QM 
definition based on the price of the loan is higher the smaller 
the loan amount.
    Lenders often claim that the points and fees cap for QM 
loans is 3 percent, but that is only the limit for loan amounts 
greater than or equal to $124,331. For the smallest mortgage 
loans, the points and fees can be as high as 8 percent of the 
loan amount. The limit according to loan size is described in 
the table below. Some of these figures are adjusted annually 
for inflation.
    As of January 1, 2023, the points and fees limit to qualify 
as a QM is as follows:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

    To meet the general QM definition, the lender must stay 
below an APR threshold that varies based on the loan amount and 
type of the loan. The APR threshold ranges from 2.25 percent to 
6.5 percent above the average prime offer rate (referred to 
here as the ``prime'' rate).
    As of January 1, 2023, the APR limit to meet the definition 
of general QM is as follows:
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>

    Finally, TILA imposes additional substantive restrictions 
on certain ``high cost'' loans, also known as HOEPA loans. One 
way of being defined as a ``high cost loan'' is carrying points 
and fees above a certain limit, which also depends in part on 
the loan size. For loan amounts above $24,866, the loan will be 
deemed ``high cost'' if the points and fees exceed 5 percent of 
the total loan amount. \6\ For loan amounts less than $24,866, 
the points and fees limit is the lesser of 8 percent of the 
total loan amount or $1,243. \7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \6\ Reg. Z 1026.32(a)(1)(ii) (effective Jan. 10, 2014); 87 FR 
78,831 (Dec. 23, 2022) (threshold adjustments effective January 1, 
2023).
     \7\ Id. (both figures are adjusted annually for inflation).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As an example, if a lender is making a residential mortgage 
loan in the amount of $74,000, it can charge up front points 
and fees of up to 5 percent of the loan amount (here, $3,700) 
and an interest rate of up to 13.76 percent \8\ and still be 
deemed a QM loan and a non-high-cost loan. In addition, the 
lender can charge the borrower for third party costs (for 
example, the cost of an appraisal) that are reasonable and do 
not benefit the creditor. \9\ Given the ample interest rate cap 
(13.76 percent), a lender that needs to charge more than $3,700 
in origination costs can recoup those costs simply by charging 
a higher interest rate--which has the side benefit of making 
the costs of the loan more transparent to consumers. \10\ Or, 
if a lender decides to charge more than $3,700 in up front 
``points and fees,'' the loan will not meet the QM definition--
which simply removes the presumption regarding ability to 
repay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \8\ The average prime offer rate was 7.26 percent as of Aug. 23, 
2023, plus 6.5 percent equals 13.76 percent.
     \9\ See 12 CFR 1026.32(b); 12 CFR 1026.4.

Whole Truth, and Nothing But the Truth: Fulfilling the Promise of Truth 
in Lending'', 25:2 Yale Journal on Regulation 181, 209 (2008) 
(explaining that most consumers can compare two stated APRs priced in 
identical units, but cannot make a comparison across multiple charges 
or units).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It might cost less to build a car without seatbelts, but no 
one would recommend that solution to increase access to lower-
priced cars. The ability to repay rules serve the important 
consumer protection purpose of ensuring that lenders make 
mortgage loans based on a reasonable determination of ability 
to repay, and not based on the value of the collateral or the 
individual lender's up-front profit. Removing this kind of 
consumer protection is not the right way to expand access to 
mortgage loans.

How To Expand Access to Small Dollar Mortgages While Protecting 
        Consumers

    A whole-Government approach to increasing lenders' 
willingness to make small dollar mortgage loans is needed. This 
could be done through a combination of requirements, 
incentives, and subsidy. FHA has undertaken a study of barriers 
to small dollar mortgage loans, \11\ and the Government 
Sponsored Enterprises should follow suit, especially under the 
framework of their Equitable Housing Finance Plans. \12\ The 
Duty to Serve rule and Enterprise Housing Goals might also be 
used to increase small-dollar mortgage lending. \13\ Special 
purpose credit programs can also be a useful tool in expanding 
access to small-dollar mortgages in a way that promotes access 
to home ownership for historically disadvantaged groups. \14\

efficient and automated underwriting systems. The fair lending 
implications of refusing to make loans below a certain dollar

         RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF CHAIR SMITH
                        FROM JOHN GREEN

Q.1. Based on your testimony, most homebuyers Blackstar 
Stability works with are able to extinguish their land 
contracts and transition into traditional mortgage. From your 
experience, why do these homebuyers enter into land contracts 
in the first place? What role, if any, does the buyer's 
creditworthiness play in reaching that decision?

A.1. Most CFD buyers are not knowledgeable of the traditional 
home buying process and typically respond to Craigslist 
advertisements, signs on the home or other nontraditional 
selling channels that offer low money down and other 
inducements. The seller presents the CFD as a legitimate 
instrument and the typical buyer trusts the process. Often, 
they have been turned down by banks in the past or are outside 
the mainstream financial system. If they were to seek a 
traditional loan, the primary barriers are credit score, lack 
of a downpayment and the unsubstantiated value of the seller's 
asking price. Most buyers do have adequate income to support 
mortgage underwriting.
    The transactions are often structured such that the monthly 
payments may approximate nearby rental costs. Families can 
easily rationalize in these instances that the opportunity is 
compelling, as they can own a property for only slightly more 
than renting. What is not apparent to the buyers at that point 
is that:

  1.  They will not own the home at contract closing, in 
        contrast to a mortgage-financed deal,

  2.  The contract price of the property is typically above the 
        prevailing market value,

  3.  The interest rates are significantly higher than mortgage 
        rates for comparable borrowers, and

  4.  The deferred maintenance burden and ongoing requirements 
        dramatically distort the real costs of ownership.

    The lack of adequate property disclosures, home inspections 
and third-party valuations establish an information asymmetry 
that strongly favors the sellers. The result is a rent vs. own 
decision based on very incomplete information that often haunts 
the buyers.
    Other buyers who have a better understanding of the key 
distinctions between CFDs and mortgages often misjudge the 
capacity to eventually refinance the CFD with a traditional 
mortgage. In these cases, the lack of a larger downpayment or 
stronger credit profile might encourage a buyer to justify 
using a CFD as a temporary solution until they can be more 
fully prepared for a mortgage. Unfortunately, the reality that 
often awaits is that small-balance mortgages are frequently 
unavailable, even for qualified buyers.
    It is important to note that credit scores and 
creditworthiness should not be conflated, as FICO scores often 
depict incomplete profiles of these borrowers' payment habits, 
particularly with respect to housing costs.
