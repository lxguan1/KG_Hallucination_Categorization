                              ----------                              


                       THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:10 a.m. in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin 
III, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. The Committee will come to order.
    Just as soon as we have 11, we are going to go right to our 
business order, real quick, to make sure that we get that out 
of the way.
    But right now, I would like to welcome everybody and thank 
you all for making such a committed effort to being with us. We 
appreciate every year when you come in and tell us exactly what 
is going on and how we can all be helpful and work together for 
all of our citizens.
    Speaking first to the markup on the agenda's amendment to 
our Committee rules for the 118th Congress and the Committee's 
funding resolution for the 118th Congress, the rule change will 
reduce the number of Senators who need to be physically present 
to report matters from the Committee from 11 to 10, in keeping 
with the reduction in the total number of our members from 20 
to 19. The funding resolution is something the Rules of the 
Senate require us to report to fund the Committee's operating 
expenses for the next two years. The spending levels in the 
resolution have been preapproved and given to us by the Rules 
Committee and will be bundled with those of other committees 
and approved by the Senate later this month. I know several 
committees are planning to do the same this morning, so our 
members have competing schedules and we are all supposed to be 
at different places at the same time. So as soon as we have a 
reporting quorum, we are going to go right to the vote.
    Now, turning to the hearing today, I would like to extend a 
warm welcome to the territorial governors, who are all joining 
us in person.
    We have Governor Bryan of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Thank 
you, Governor, for being here.
    We have Governor Guerrero of Guam.
    We have Governor Lemanu of American Samoa.
    We have Governor Palacios of the Northern Mariana Islands.
    And Governor Pierluisi of Puerto Rico.
    I know it is not an easy trip to make and I appreciate you 
all making this effort. As many of my colleagues know, this 
Committee has longstanding jurisdiction of territorial policy 
and insular affairs, and I look forward to learning about the 
opportunities and challenges facing your communities. I would 
like to start by acknowledging that American Samoa, Guam, and 
the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands are an integral part of our history, economy, and the 
culture of the United States, and that each territory is unique 
with its own set of pressing issues and priorities. This past 
year, the world has seen heightened geopolitical tensions 
following Putin's invasion of Ukraine. I am also concerned 
about the Chinese Communist Party's malicious influence and 
predatory economic policies leading to potential for conflict 
in the Pacific, as I am sure the people of Guam, American 
Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are very much aware of.
    We must not turn a blind eye to the severe consequences of 
China's continued aggression toward Taiwan and the Indo-Pacific 
region at large. The territories and the Freely Associated 
States in the Pacific are a vital part of our national 
security. Guam has long hosted American military bases and 
American Samoa yields the highest rate of military enlistment 
of any U.S. state or territory. As we face those global 
challenges, the United States cannot ignore the concern of the 
territories and must prioritize maintaining peace and security 
in the region.
    There are many challenges facing the territories today. I 
do not need to remind any of you about the impact that the 
global pandemic has had on our communities and our economies. 
The pandemic's challenges were compounded in the territories 
given the ongoing recovery from the devastating natural 
disasters in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. I applaud each 
government for quickly and effectively responding to the 
pandemic and prioritizing power and water restoration in the 
wake of these natural disasters. Now, however, we are turning a 
new page and focusing on economic recovery and how best to move 
forward.
    In Puerto Rico, this recovery is powered by a reliable and 
affordable energy grid. It is clear that hurricanes will 
continue to deliver setbacks to grid reconstruction, as we saw 
with Hurricane Fiona last fall. But power restoration to the 
majority of the island in days or weeks is an improvement over 
months, as we saw after the 2017 hurricanes. I am frustrated by 
the slow progress, but I am hopeful that the change in 
operation and management of PREPA's generation and transmission 
assets will bring transparency, modernization, and cost 
savings. I look forward to hearing from you today about where 
the recovery stands. It is critical that investments made can 
deliver real benefits today and tomorrow, and there is a 
capacity on the ground to maintain this infrastructure going 
forward.
    There are many, many pressing issues impacting the 
territories that we will discuss today, from workforce, 
infrastructure, inflation, and supply chain difficulties to the 
different treatment of taxes and federal assistance programs. 
Underlying many of these challenges are questions of economic 
development and fiscal stability. Again, I would like to thank 
each of you for your time today and sharing your priorities and 
discussing how Congress can support economic opportunity and 
improve the quality of life of individuals living and working 
in the territories for generations to come. As I have said 
before, the sun never sets on the jurisdiction of the Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee, and I would like to recognize 
those who are watching this hearing from the territories in the 
Pacific. I know it is very early right now where some of you 
live.
    With that, I am going to turn it over to my friend, Senator 
Barrasso, for his opening remarks.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman.
    And with regard to the business meeting, I look forward to 
supporting each of the measures that you are bringing forward 
and I would agree that we should hold an en bloc vote--voice 
vote--as soon as a quorum arrives.
    Also, before returning to my remarks for today's hearing, I 
would like to take a minute to recognize our Chief Counsel, 
Matt Leggett. I want to thank him for his work on this 
Committee and his work on behalf of the people of Wyoming. His 
unwavering commitment to public service is so admirable. Matt's 
been with me for ten years. He has served as Chief Counsel on 
the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for the last two 
years. He also held the same position at the Environment and 
Public Works Committee while I was Chairman there. Before that, 
Matt served as Policy Counsel for the Senate Republican Policy 
Committee. He also spent a number of years across the street in 
the House of Representatives. He started his career here in the 
year 2000 as a Capitol Hill legislative correspondent. So his 
departure from the Senate does leave big shoes to fill. I just 
want to thank Matt for all that he has done during his time 
here. He is going to be greatly missed and we wish him every 
success in his next chapter.
    [Applause.]
    Senator Barrasso. Now, Mr. Chairman, let me turn to the 
hearing.
    Thank you to all of the governors for being here with us 
today. Today's hearing gives us a great opportunity to discuss 
the importance of the territories. The territories in the 
Pacific are the front lines of Chinese aggression. As I have 
said before, Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific is a 
serious and growing threat. Guam, the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa are not only vital 
to our national security interests, they are also home to 
American citizens and nationals. Their security is more 
important now than ever.
    Guam is also home to several United States military 
installations. It is key to maintaining our military power in 
the region. Over time, China has ramped up its military threats 
against Guam. It has conducted drills near the territory and 
has developed missiles that are capable of reaching the island. 
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is home to 
thousands of Americans. This chain of islands, known for its 
rich history and beautiful beaches, is also important to our 
national security because of its proximity to East Asia. Our 
partnership with Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands benefits 
not only the people of the territories, but also the nation as 
a whole. During a time when China is working to expand its 
economic and military influence, we must maintain a strong 
presence in the region.
    China's illegal global fishing operation has also impacted 
other territories in the Pacific. The people of American Samoa 
regularly face this illegal assault. They have suffered serious 
economic setbacks as a result of China's fishing practices. I 
look forward to hearing how they are responding to these 
illegal activities. I am also interested to hear about the 
effectiveness of the U.S. Coast Guard, which now regularly 
patrols the waters of the Western Pacific. The Freely 
Associated States and the corresponding Compacts of Free 
Association are also integral to the security of our 
territories and our strategic interests in the region. These 
agreements are a central part of preserving international 
maritime security, maintaining geopolitical stability, and 
countering Chinese hostility.
    A number of the Compacts will expire this year. Mr. 
Chairman, I look forward to working with you and other members 
of this Committee on that issue going forward. I think it is 
important to acknowledge that the governors before us today 
represent territories that are home to patriotic Americans who 
enlist in our armed services at very high rates and who serve 
with distinction. We owe them a debt of gratitude.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the governors for 
being here to testify.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.
    Now, I would like to turn to the governors of the 
territories for their opening statements, and we will begin 
with Governor Bryan of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

             STATEMENT OF HON. ALBERT BRYAN, JR., 
                 GOVERNOR, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS

    Mr. Bryan. Good morning, Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, and members of the Committee. On behalf of the people 
of the U.S. Virgin Islands, I would like to sincerely thank you 
all in this body for the opportunity to appear before you today 
to discuss the state of the United States Virgin Islands and 
the territory's focal points in 2023. Chairman Manchin, you 
have been a stalwart friend of the Virgin Islands for as long 
as I can remember and I want to thank you personally for your 
friendship with the U.S. Virgin Islands and your support. I 
also want to thank this Committee, broadly, along with Congress 
at large for the support you gave the territory in 2022. Thank 
you, all.
    This past year, the territory began to bounce back from the 
devastating effects of COVID-19, and continued on rebuilding 
efforts from a deluge of national disasters. We are making 
great strides rebuilding. Our overall revenues are up. Our debt 
burden is down. We have restructured our struggling government 
employee retirement pension system, which has been a drag on 
our fiscal situation for decades. We are rebuilding our housing 
and infrastructure, and tourism in the territory is rebounding 
and is leading the Caribbean. I am proud to say that we are 
laying the foundation for a stable, sustainable prosperity for 
the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
    But I am going to keep asking you for your support. Virgin 
Islanders deserve it. We are Americans, and as Governor of the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, I will continue to demand equality until 
we are treated like every other American. All too often, the 
territories are subjected to disparate treatment, afforded 
unequal funding, provided poor infrastructure, and treated as, 
frankly, an afterthought.
    Our health care system and hospitals, still reeling from 
natural disasters, do not receive equal funding guaranteed to 
those on the mainland. Our energy is the most expensive and the 
least reliable in the country. The ``GILTI'' tax treats us 
Virgin Islanders like a foreign country, crippling our access 
to the tax incentive programs Congress created to spur American 
investment in the territory. The U.S. Supreme Court recently 
held that as Americans who are residents of a territory, we, 
along with my fellow governors, do not have the right to equal 
protection under the law and must turn to Congress to demand 
fundamental social welfare benefits guaranteed to our fellow 
citizens residing on the mainland. Still, we lack equal 
representation in Congress. We make strides toward equality 
every year, but we are not there yet.
    We face enough challenges inherent to our island, such as 
geographic isolation, lack of natural resources, and the 
prevalence of natural disasters that we, as a U.S. territory, 
should not be facing--challenges rooted in discriminatory 
federal policies and second-class infrastructure that Congress 
has the power to change. I come before you today expecting 
action on some long-overdue needs.
    First, we need assistance in meeting the local cost-share 
requirements as we continue to cope with the financial 
challenges of the hurricanes, which were exacerbated by the 
pandemic. Just to put that in perspective for you, $1.2 billion 
is what our match is now at ten percent. That is our annual 
budget. That is what we must come up with. All of the agencies 
have the right--FEMA has a right to waive this--and we are 
asking Congress to make sure that instead of having the 
possibility to do it, that they actually do it and waive this 
for the territories.
    Second, we need Congress to address immediately the 
shortfall for our rum excise tax covered over into the 
territory. Since our country acquired the territory over a 
century ago, federal excise taxes on rum manufactured in the 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are returned or covered over to 
the Virgin Islands. It is essential that we get this, as this 
is a revenue source we use to stabilize our pension system and 
bring much-needed revenue into our territory. It has been 
codified as a tax extender that we come for every couple of 
years, but at this point, we just need it to be extended so we 
can cover our expenses from last year as well as making it 
permanent.
    Third, we need to address inequitable treatment of health 
care in the territory. While we are eternally grateful for the 
2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which addressed the 
longstanding discrimination in the application of the Federal 
Medicaid Assistance Program, our Medicaid funding for the 
territory is subject to an arbitrarily low hard cap. I want to 
thank you sincerely for making sure that now we are permanently 
matched at 83 percent to the Virgin Islands' 17 percent, 
something that it took decades to do. But the cap ensures that 
we cannot go further than $135 million. This year we will 
surpass that cap in terms of providing health care to our 
citizens. This cap is not instituted anywhere else for any 
state. But strangely, the territories are under that. We 
already have problems getting care, as we are isolated, and it 
is expensive to come to the mainland. So we want to make sure 
that we have that possibility.
    Fourth, our territory's economic problems have been 
compounded by aggressive federal environmental regulators at 
the EPA who have shut down our refinery once again. This 
accounts for 20 percent of our employment. If we cannot get the 
refinery up, we cannot be sustainable. The EPA took an 
extremely aggressive stance and used something that they have 
only enacted twice in the last 30 years. We are fighting with 
the EPA just for equal treatment, just like any other state, to 
have that chance to restart our refinery and keep our growth 
going through the sustainability that it provides.
    Lastly--energy, energy, energy. The Governor of Puerto Rico 
is here today. We would love to have a Caribbean energy grid. 
They are doing incredible things to secure their energy future. 
By the end of the next two years, we will have more renewable 
energy in the Virgin Islands than we actually need. So we will 
have over 105 megawatts of daytime energy, even though at peak 
we are only at 85, an incredible win for the Virgin Islands.
    I want to thank you all for all that you have done. And as 
you continue to help us, we have the money to do it, it has 
already been allotted and allocated. We just need cooperation 
between our Federal Government divisions. Thank you, again, for 
your attention to all the challenges and incredible support 
that we have had over the last four years. I know it is going 
to get better, and the Virgin Islands is proof that this body 
and the entire Congress is doing things that really work for 
the people of the territories.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Bryan follows:]
    
    
    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. Thank you, Governor Bryan. We appreciate it.
    And let me just say to all of our members, we are going to 
meet off the floor when we have a vote to have our 
organizational--basically, our rules to be changed so we are 
able to operate. So I want to thank all of you. I know everyone 
is--we are going to continue with this, with our meeting here, 
but we want to thank all of you.
    So I am going to turn to Governor Guerrero from Guam.
    Governor Guerrero.

    STATEMENT OF HON. LOURDES LEON GUERRERO, GOVERNOR, GUAM

    Ms. Guerrero. Hafa Adai, Mr. Chairman and members of the 
Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before this 
Committee.
    In previous hearings, both myself and my predecessors, as 
Governors of Guam, have testified on a range of concerns for 
which Guam is seeking federal action. These include Compact-
Impact reimbursement, relief from regulations, including the 
Jones Act, expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act 
to include Guam, lifting of the Medicaid caps, climate change 
assistance, and inclusion in the SSI program. Foremost of these 
concerns is our request for $700 million in federal support for 
the construction of a new hospital. In my written testimony, I 
will go into further details about these issues and others. At 
the outset, I did want to speak to one aspect of my community 
circumstances, which I believe not only places our concerns in 
context, but adds urgency to actually addressing them.
    I am referring to the growing military threat from China 
and the prospect of Guam being on the front lines should our 
shared fears of a military conflict be realized. Since its 
acquisition by the U.S. in 1898, Guam has always been a host 
for U.S. military bases. Of course, these bases have benefited 
our community and our economy, but have also brought with them 
risk, as was starkly demonstrated in 1941 when our island was 
invaded and suffered three years of brutal foreign occupation 
before our liberation by American forces. Although peace has 
been maintained in the post-war years, the risk to our 
community continued through the Cold War and beyond. Our people 
have long known that such risks are the price we pay for our 
freedom as Americans, and we take pride in the contribution of 
our island to the nation's security. It is broadly recognized 
that American bases on Guam will be a main target in any 
conflict with China. Although behind the fence line, the 
military bases which dot our island from north to south are 
very much part of our larger community, and any scenario 
involving the targeting of these bases will have serious 
implications for our civilian health care facilities, 
infrastructure, and resilience.
    In a visit to Guam last month, Marine Corps Commandant, 
General David Berger, remarked that it is not always fully 
appreciated how intertwined are both Guam's military bases and 
the civilian community. For example, these bases are served by 
the local Guam Power Authority and other civilian utilities. 
There is a naval hospital in Guam situated behind the fence 
line, but if that is damaged in a military conflict, the backup 
will naturally be the island's civilian hospital facilities, 
thus underscoring the need for federal support and investment 
for a new hospital. Indeed, but for the limitation of time, I 
could present further examples of how our community's road 
network, ports of entry, and public service factor into the 
resilience and effectiveness of our island if it is called upon 
to play a front-line role in any conflict with China. I raise 
this prospect, not to be an alarmist, but to emphasize that any 
federal support or investment in Guam's hospital facilities, 
infrastructure, and resilience also serves under the nation's 
security interest.
    In addition to a new hospital, one way in which our 
community can be supported is in addressing some of the adverse 
impacts of existing federal policy. This brings me to a subject 
with which I am sure you are very familiar, namely, the adverse 
impact of the Compact of Free Association on Guam's education, 
health care, and public safety services, as well as our 
infrastructure. Specifically, we seek full reimbursement for 
Compact-Impact expenses either by direct funding or offset 
against local match requirements in federal grant programs. 
Another area in which we seek relief is with respect to the 
restrictions on the importation of skilled labor, which is 
important to our economic recovery, but also to the planned 
military construction program. We appreciate the efforts of 
Congress in supporting our efforts to find a resolution to the 
skilled worker shortage, which is largely mitigated by the H-2B 
program. To diversify and strengthen our economy, broader 
access to skilled labor is needed if our economic 
diversification strategies are to be realized.
    We propose two solutions--one, short-term relief: the Guam 
NDAA H-2B exemption expires in 2024, and estimates for ongoing 
military construction extend to 2029. Therefore, we ask that 
the exemption be extended to 2029. Long-term resolution: 
establish a ``Guam-Only'' temporary need criteria within the H-
2B program which would include ``other qualified need'' to be 
determined by the Governor of Guam.
    I appreciate your attention to my requests and look forward 
to working with the Committee on solutions to these matters. 
Thank you and Si Yu'os Ma'ase.

    The Chairman. Thank you. Thank you, Governor.
    Before--Senator King and Senator Cortez Masto, who has to 
leave?
    Senator Cortez Masto. I have to leave at 10:45.
    The Chairman. Okay. You okay at 10:45?
    So we are going to continue with our presentation, but 
before you leave, if you have a question, we might not be able 
to interrupt, so you all can give your questions.
    Senator King. My only comment was to the Governor of the 
Virgin Islands. I never realized that drinking Puerto Rican rum 
was a patriotic act, and it is very reassuring to know that.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. Thank you.
    Mr. Bryan. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I do have a couple of questions.
    The Chairman. If you can, before you leave, we will make 
sure we get them in.
    Now we are going to go to Governor Lemanu from American 
Samoa.

             STATEMENT OF HON. LEMANU P.S. MAUGA, 
                    GOVERNOR, AMERICAN SAMOA

    Mr. Mauga. On behalf of the people of American Samoa, I 
wish to say ``Talofa and greetings!'' to the esteemed Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources. Thank you, Chairman Manchin, 
Ranking Member Barrasso, and the distinguished members of this 
Committee for the opportunity for the U.S. territories to 
appear before you. This is truly an occasion to celebrate in 
recognition of our nations returning to our new normal with 
holding Congressional hearings again.
    I first want to commend you on your role in passing the 
American Rescue Plan Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and 
Bipartisan Infrastructure bill. Funding provided by these laws 
helped to address many of our issues in American Samoa, and of 
course, the U.S. territories. As with all of the United States 
of America, American Samoa's economy is recovering slowly from 
the adversity of COVID-19. While struggling through COVID-19, 
natural disasters with global warming, climate change, 
hurricanes, monsoons, droughts, spring and neap tides, sea-
level changes, and so forth took damaging tolls, and are now 
the most dangerous catastrophe American Samoa is facing, now 
and into the future. In fact, according to the USGS study, and 
I quote, ``American Samoa is vulnerable to sea-level rise in 
part due to steep terrain on its islands. . . . This subsidence 
is estimated to lead to roughly twice as much sea-level rise by 
2060 as what is already predicted for climate change alone. As 
a result, the timeline of coastal impacts in American Samoa 
will be decades ahead of similar island communities of the 
Pacific.'' Land is life for the seven islands of American 
Samoa, and I seek your immediate attention and full support on 
saving American Samoa.
    American Samoa is sending a request for funding to build 
and maintain hard infrastructure--sea walls, roads, bridges, 
eight wharfs, four airports, and shipyards; soft 
infrastructure--health care system, hospital, education system, 
food and fiscal security, power generation, water system, 
communication, and financial system; and critical 
infrastructure--building and structures and components to house 
and provide services to our people, and of course, security of 
the surrounding perimeters because of the Chinese presence in 
the Pacific. Mr. Chairman and Committee, all three components 
of our infrastructure must be built simultaneously, because one 
complements the other. Like building a house, you can't have 
the structure of the house without a bathroom, a kitchen, and 
all the components that go into the house. So therefore, Mr. 
Chairman, we can't build one without the other because one 
complements the other.
    So what is the U.S. territory from American Samoa asking 
for? Well, for hard infrastructure, $700 million. For soft 
infrastructure, $500 million, and for critical infrastructure, 
$500 million. Please keep in mind that American Samoa, like 
other U.S. territories, are by ourselves in the middle of the 
vast deep blue sea, and our need to build infrastructure, 
economy, security, health care system, education system, power 
generation system, communication, air, sea, and land 
transportation, protection of land, air, ocean, and food 
security is protecting the lives of our people.
    I thank you once again for this opportunity for American 
Samoa to address this distinguished Committee and for your 
ongoing effort to improve the quality of life for the people of 
the U.S. territories. God Bless America. God Bless this 
Committee and us.

    The Chairman. Thank you, Governor.
    And now, we are going to have Governor Palacios, from 
Northern Mariana.

STATEMENT OF HON. ARNOLD I. PALACIOS, GOVERNOR, COMMONWEALTH OF 
                  THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS

    Mr. Palacios. Good morning, Hafa Adai and Tiroow, Chairman 
Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and members of the Senate 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Thank you for 
conducting this crucial hearing on the state of America's 
territories. As the newly elected Governor of the Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands, I appreciate this opportunity 
to highlight the strategic importance of our islands and the 
security of our nation and peace in our Indo-Pacific region. I 
also wish to share with you the urgent challenges confronting 
our Commonwealth, the path we are forging toward recovery and 
resilience, and the support we seek from Congress.
    We in the Northern Marianas are grappling with crisis on 
multiple fronts: a government in fiscal disarray, an economy 
still struggling from the impacts of COVID and several 
unprecedented typhoon disasters that preceded the pandemic, 
infrastructures and systems that are woefully unprepared for 
the climate crisis, and a shrinking population, as citizens 
leave our islands for greener pastures. Against this backdrop 
of vulnerabilities are the geopolitical challenges presented by 
China in our islands and the region. My administration is fully 
committed to rebuilding relationships of trust and confidence 
among our citizens, our federal partners, and our allies in 
Micronesia and the wider Indo-Pacific area.
    Four weeks ago, I was sworn in as the tenth elected 
governor. I entered an office that had been literally stripped 
bare, but far more troubling, I found the government's finances 
in complete disarray. We are still assessing the extent of the 
government's fiscal woes, but we are already taking necessary 
but painful actions, including cost containment measures. We 
have also placed high priority on increasing oversight and 
accountability of federal and local funds, and have sought 
assistance from and placed full cooperation with local and 
federal agencies investigating and holding accountable those 
responsible for the misuse and abuse of public funds. As my 
administration continues to tackle our government's fiscal 
disaster head-on, I want to remind this body that the 
Commonwealth is still recovering from disasters that, in and of 
themselves, were unprecedented and extraordinary in scale.
    Just a few years ago, the Commonwealth was devastated by 
three natural disasters that occurred within a span of only 
three years. The most recent, Super Typhoon Yutu, was a 
Category 5 storm that ranked the most powerful on earth that 
year and was the worst storm to hit the U.S. since 1935. These 
storms wreaked havoc on our homes, our businesses, schools, 
infrastructure, and brought into sharp focus the 
vulnerabilities of our islands to the impacts of the climate 
crisis. These natural disasters were followed by an economic 
downturn, as tourism, our primary industry, collapsed. We are 
grateful for the Federal Government's investments that have 
been making projects which will support a long-term economic 
recovery, and we welcome the opportunity to work with our 
federal partners to break the bottlenecks holding up hundreds 
of millions of federal dollars awarded to support our economic 
recovery and development.
    A major part of our struggle to carry out critical 
infrastructure and development projects is a shortage of labor 
and serious uncertainty affecting the stability of the 
Commonwealth's workforce. I therefore strongly support our U.S. 
Congressman Kilili Sablan's recently reintroduced legislation, 
H.R. 560, the Northern Mariana Islands Population Stabilization 
Act. As Congressman Sablan has stated, ``the population loss in 
our islands and resulting loss of economic viability not only 
hurts all of us, but also has an implication for the U.S. 
strategic position in the Western Pacific.'' With increasing 
competition for dominance from China, the United States needs 
to be strengthening our position in the region and not 
shrinking the significance. Equally important, I appeal to you 
to consider amending the U.S. Workforce Act of 2018, which 
governs the administration of the CW program with a diminishing 
number of CW permits every year, and with the program's end 
just around the corner in 2029, I ask for your support in the 
repeal of the section on touchback provision.
    More than 50 years ago, Mr. Chairman and members, the 
Commonwealth's founding fathers traveled thousands of miles 
across the sea to Washington, DC to negotiate the covenant 
between the Northern Marianas and the United States. The 
Marianas' delegation included my own father, the late Dr. 
Francisco Palacios. Their hopeful vision of a thriving Marianas 
and a strong relationship with the United States holds true 
today, and like our Commonwealth founding fathers, I carry the 
decisive mandate of the people to repair and strengthen 
relationships of trust with our own federal partners. We are 
acutely aware of the sensitive geopolitical challenges of our 
region, and recognize the vital role we play in ensuring the 
safety and security of all and in supporting a larger strategic 
imperative. Now, the Northern Mariana Islands is also America's 
front line in the Pacific. We face many challenges, but our 
people, who are American citizens, possess the grit, the 
resilience, and resourcefulness to pull together as we always 
have in times of crisis to solve our problems.
    That said, we do need help, and I am here to seek your 
assistance to contribute to the CNMI's economic recovery and 
financial sustainability. Thank you for the opportunity to 
testify before you today. May God bless the Northern Mariana 
Islands. May God Bless America. Thank you. Si Yu'os Ma'ase.

    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Now we have Governor Pierluisi to give his comments. Thank 
you.

             STATEMENT OF HON. PEDRO R. PIERLUISI,
                     GOVERNOR, PUERTO RICO

    Mr. Pierluisi. Chairman Manchin and members of the 
Committee, thank you for holding another hearing regarding the 
state of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. Since last year's 
hearing, much work has been done toward the reconstruction and 
recovery of our island, and there is great momentum as we 
continue to move forward.
    I am pleased to report that Puerto Rico has entered a new 
era of economic progress and optimism. We successfully 
restructured the government's debt to a sustainable level. Our 
economy grew four percent last year. We are strategically 
employing federal funding across the island, and government 
revenues are surpassing estimates. All economic indicators, 
including those relating to our manufacturing and tourism 
sectors, have consistently been on the rise during the past two 
years. We have 150,000 additional jobs since the beginning of 
2021. The labor participation rate has increased by five 
percentage points. We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 
our history and we are expecting similar figures for 2023.
    Let me highlight some of the most important developments of 
the last year. The government of Puerto Rico has put its fiscal 
house in order. My administration has published three audited 
financial statements that had been delayed by previous 
administrations and is on schedule to publish two more this 
year so that we are up to date in our financial reporting. Our 
government's last two budgets, including the one for the 
current fiscal year, were clearly balanced, and our Treasury 
Department reported an operational surplus at the close of the 
last two fiscal years.
    Our reconstruction efforts have made significant headway, 
even in the wake of Hurricane Fiona last September. Our 
Recovery, Reconstruction, and Resiliency Office has disbursed 
over $954 million for permanent work projects, a huge jump from 
the $153 million disbursed from 2017 to 2020. As of the end of 
last year, more than 2,400 FEMA-funded projects were under 
construction. In 2022 alone, over $1.4 billion has been 
disbursed across multiple disasters, and we estimate that we 
will be able to disburse around $2 billion in funding for 
permanent work during this year. With respect to CDBG-DR 
funding, we have obligated $7.2 billion of the approximately 
$10 billion allocated to Puerto Rico, and disbursements have 
increased from $152 million in 2020 to more than $1.5 billion 
as of year-end 2022. This represents a 377 percent increase in 
obligations and an 893 percent increase in disbursements.
    Another important highlight is the status of our energy 
system transformation. We have already procured private 
operators for the transmission and distribution electric grid 
as well as for the operation and maintenance of the government-
owned generation plants. The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau has 
approved over 142 projects for reconstruction work valued at 
over $8.4 billion, and 93 permanent work projects have been 
approved by FEMA. Over 68,000 rooftop solar systems have been 
interconnected in our grid, and we anticipate that those 
interconnections will continue to increase by over 2,000 a 
month. Additionally, utility-scale renewable energy projects 
are underway to add 845 megawatts of generation and 200 
megawatts of battery storage to our system. We also continue 
our collaborative work with the Department of Energy to be able 
to implement our public policy to reach 100 percent renewable 
energy generation capacity by 2050.
    To conclude, I must speak to you about the importance of 
putting an end to Puerto Rico's territorial status. On December 
15, 2022, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 8393, which 
allows the American citizens of Puerto Rico to choose one of 
three available non-territorial status options for their 
future. The people of Puerto Rico have repeatedly expressed 
their desire to end the island's current territorial status and 
an absolute majority of them want Puerto Rico to become a state 
of the union. It should not be surprising that 105 years after 
becoming U.S. citizens by birth, Puerto Ricans want to vote for 
President and to have voting representation in Congress. In 
other words, nobody should expect the American citizens of 
Puerto Rico to consent to discrimination and unequal treatment. 
It is therefore up to this Congress to show Puerto Rico, our 
fellow citizens of the states, and the world that the 
democratic principles of equality professed by our nation apply 
to all American citizens. As Governor of Puerto Rico, I will 
continue to demand equal treatment for my constituents until 
they have it.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Pierluisi follows:]

    [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. We will start our questions, and we will go 
with Senator King.
    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    You would think within the age of computers, we could 
schedule the Senate so that we didn't have to be three places 
at once. I am supposed to be in a meeting with the Secretary 
General of NATO right now. So I apologize.
    I am going to submit my questions for the record, but I did 
want to comment. I made some notes, and my notes ended up, I 
looked down, three Cs--climate, China, and commitment. 
Particularly to our western island territories, China, 
obviously, is a very significant concern, and you are outposts 
on the frontiers of democracy, and I understand that.
    As far as climate is concerned, you are all seeing the 
effects, and some more dramatically than others, but you can 
help us to--you are seeing it earlier in some ways than we are, 
and to the extent you can document the climate change impacts 
that you are seeing on your coastlines, on water supplies, on 
energy, all of those things, that would be very helpful to us.
    The final ``C'' I have is commitment, and that is, we have 
a commitment to all of you, and we want to honor those 
commitments, whether it's a 100-year-old covenant, or recent 
agreements, I understand, there are detailed questions about H-
2Bs and workforce and all of those kinds of things. We do want 
to address those, but I just want to express, number one, my 
apologies for not being able to stay at the hearing, but also, 
my understanding, of those three important elements, probably 
in the long run, the most important is commitment.
    Thank you. I visited three of your five islands and look 
forward, hopefully, to visiting the others. But thank you for 
what you are doing. Thank you for the work that your American 
citizens do on behalf of your country, your states, your 
territories, and the United States. Thank you very much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Cortez Masto, do you have a question?
    Senator Cortez Masto. I do, thank you.
    Let me echo what my colleague Senator King has said with 
the support of our territories. Thank you all for being here. 
Let me start with Governor Pierluisi, thank you, always good to 
see you as well.
    You talked a little bit about this--as you know, we have 
talked in the past, many American citizens living in Puerto 
Rico continue to face, what I am hearing, blackouts and 
brownouts on a regular basis. Residents are unable to plan when 
they will be able to cook dinner or do laundry without 
interruption. Use of generators has become more and more 
common, which obviously comes with added cost. So can you 
highlight a little bit more and update us on the status of the 
grid rebuilding? You talked a little bit about that. And what 
is the government doing to minimize, now, the service 
interruptions so that Puerto Ricans can continue to live their 
lives?
    Mr. Pierluisi. Yes, thank you, Senator.
    For the past roughly five months, the electric system in 
Puerto Rico has been stable, which is quite positive. I have to 
say that part of it has to do with all of the emergency work 
that was done after Fiona. Hundreds, if not thousands of poles 
were replaced, lines, and a lot of work is being done on the 
grid itself to make it more resilient, to make it better. FEMA 
has been an extraordinary partner with us. FEMA created a 
stabilization task force with DOE's support, as well as the 
Corps of Engineers' support because they realized after Fiona 
that even though it took roughly 12 days for 90 percent of the 
customers to get their power back, they realized that our 
system is still fragile, that we are barely meeting demand with 
the generation assets we have--old plants, contaminating 
plants. We are in the midst of a transformation, and we are 
turning to renewables with a vengeance, but that does not 
happen overnight.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Right.
    Mr. Pierluisi. So FEMA did this assessment and determined 
that we were short then by 700 megawatts in terms of generation 
capacity. And they also saw that some of our plants--generating 
units as well as substations--needed critical repairs. FEMA 
committed through this stabilization task force to assist us in 
the process, and that is ongoing. That is happening.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And so, that is what I want to ask 
you, because, obviously, the short-term is key, getting, right 
now, to Puerto Ricans the needed----
    Mr. Pierluisi. Exactly.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Are you comfortable that FEMA is 
there at the table?
    Mr. Pierluisi. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. You are able to do that now?
    Mr. Pierluisi. Yes.
    Senator Cortez Masto. I applaud you and your long-term 
goals here with renewable energies, but like you said, it's 
going to take time to get there. What can we do now?
    Mr. Pierluisi. I anticipate that through the Corps of 
Engineers, FEMA will be bringing to Puerto Rico land-based 
generators, generating 350 megawatts in the coming months 
before the hurricane season, so we have that breathing room, so 
that we have that backup in case, God forbid, we get another 
hurricane. But I tell you, the numbers speak for themselves. 
Right now, FEMA has approved already 93 projects. Some of them 
have already been completed----
    Senator Cortez Masto. So when you say projects, they are 
not renewable projects, they are projects on stabilizing the 
grid?
    Mr. Pierluisi. Permanent work. These are projects to make 
the grid better, more resilient, changing poles----
    Senator Cortez Masto. More reliant.
    Mr. Pierluisi [continuing]. Changing transformers, changing 
transmission lines. Our grid is old. It is getting better, 
believe it or not, but it has taken a while. And as I said, in 
the last five months, we have been stable, and I have checked 
this out with FEMA and with the players we have at two private 
entities--well, one private entity is now in charge of the grid 
since mid-2021. This is Luma. Now, we just procured a contract, 
a P3 contract, a public partnership contract with another 
entity, Genera PR, to take care of the legacy generation 
assets. But actually, the vision which is incorporated in the 
integrated resource plan we have in Puerto Rico is to turn to 
renewables. By 2025, the expectation is that we should be 
generating 40 percent of our energy from renewables. And I 
mentioned in my statement something that, it should tell you 
that this is ongoing.
    Right now, we already have 68,000 rooftop solar systems 
with batteries, most of them interconnected in our grid. And 
this is growing by 2,000 a month. I am using ARPA funding to 
give incentives--grants to small businesses--to install solar 
panels and batteries, and I am devoting roughly $500 million of 
CDBG-MIT funding to do the same, but for low-income and 
moderate-income households to install solar panels all over 
Puerto Rico. We will probably be reaching like 20,000 homes 
there. Congress appropriated--I should thank you--a billion 
dollars for DOE to do the same, you know, solar panels in 
Puerto Rico for low-income households and households with 
disabled people. So that is the vision. But at the same time, 
we are promoting--and actually, they are in the pipeline--
industry-scale renewable energy projects, most of them solar.
    So lots of things are happening in Puerto Rico. I have to 
say that I am glad that the system is stable and has been 
stable for five months because having blackouts is terrible for 
everything, for the public at large, as well as businesses, and 
that's what we don't want.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Governor.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And can I just say thank you so much. 
I do have to run and I apologize, to go to Senate Finance, but 
I will submit the rest of my questions for the record as well.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you all for being here.
    The Chairman. Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Governor Guerrero, Guam is central to our military power in 
the Pacific. We know that China understands this and that China 
has increased their aggression as a result. This includes 
military exercises near Guam, and developing weapons that are 
capable of reaching the territory. Could you please speak and 
share with all of us the recent Chinese actions that concern 
you?
    Ms. Guerrero. Absolutely. I think the geopolitical 
situation between China and the U.S. does concern our people. 
We are very fearful for what could happen if there is a 
conflict that would occur. We have two major military bases in 
Guam. We have the Air Force, the Navy, and now, just recently 
activated Camp Blaz, which is a Marine camp, and the Marines 
are going to be relocated from Okinawa to Guam by, I think 2024 
or 2025.
    The presence of that strength of military bases in Guam 
makes for a target for us. And if there is going to be any 
Chinese conflict, we feel that we would be the first line of 
attack, as we also were with Japan--by Japan in World War II. 
And so, that is very concerning to us, Senator. We realize 
this. We have had an average of about one or two North Korean 
missile threats to our island, and frequently in the last few 
years. We also know that there is more Chinese activity. The 
spy balloon that was shot down passed by Guam. We had a 
briefing from the military. So those are the things that do 
concern us.
    And of course, what are we doing to prepare? The military 
is now going to set up a military defense system in Guam. In 
fact, I think Admiral Hill is there now as we are speaking. And 
all this activity to fortify and strengthen military 
preparedness for national security concerns our people, again, 
because it does influence, I think, the attack. And that is 
why, Senator, I am very urgent to build our new hospital, and I 
am very urgent to find the financing and the grant to build our 
hospital. The military naval hospital is there, but their bed 
capacity right now is 39, and certainly, if there is any 
situation where they are attacked, they would rely on us, as 
the civilians, to help back up that military situation.
    I just want to say that Guam and the military are working 
very closely together, Senator, to provide for the national 
security of our nation and more specifically, for our people. 
So any help from the Federal Government is, I think, an 
investment in the nation's security. We have daily discussions 
with Admiral Nicholson. I know Admiral Aquilino very well in 
the INDOPACOM. We have a great working relationship, both in 
interdependence and health care, primarily. And so, yes, we are 
very much concerned about conflict. We see the Chinese 
activities within our region.
    Senator Barrasso. In your good answer to this question, you 
mentioned the Chinese spy balloon, and you said it passed over 
Guam as well and that you were briefed on that. Was that as it 
was passing over or was it kind of an after the fact, or they 
saw it coming? You said you had a military briefing.
    Ms. Guerrero. They were briefing our homeland security as 
they were passing over.
    Senator Barrasso. As it was passing over?
    Ms. Guerrero. Yes.
    Senator Barrasso. Okay great. Thank you.
    Just a quick question for the three governors from the 
territories of the Pacific. I mentioned in my opening 
statement, we are preparing to review the Compacts of Free 
Association that the Administration is currently negotiating. 
Can you speak, just very briefly, because I am running out of 
time, on the importance of these agreements to your security?
    Ms. Guerrero. Very important, these agreements--Compact-
Impact, Compact. COFA citizens impact our island in all 
aspects--economy, in the safety, in the education, health care, 
and so forth. And as we continue on with this impact, we need 
to get federal reimbursement to provide the services for 
everybody. And they are, certainly, our brothers and sisters, 
Senator, and we welcome them, but I think we need to be able to 
provide them with the same kinds of services as everyone, and 
to do that we would need full reimbursement of our Compact-
Impact.
    Senator Barrasso. If I could also hear from American Samoa 
and then Northern Mariana.
    Mr. Mauga. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.
    I think the relationships between the Federal Government 
and American Samoa in terms of security, the presence of China 
in the Pacific, we are also on the front line. We are the only 
one out there. We are five hours from Hawaii for any military 
support. We do not have military in American Samoa, as you 
know. That is why I asked for the $700 million. We are looking 
at also service support and Compact service support, elements 
of the infrastructure to build in case something happens out 
there. We have a neighboring island that is also threatened by 
the Chinese and they are looking at American Samoa. What is 
American Samoa doing? And we are looking here at the Federal 
Government. What are we doing?
    Like Guam, our hospital has been--Army Corps of Engineers 
has been to American Samoa about four or five years ago. We 
need a new hospital and they were told that we recommend to 
Congress that we should build a new hospital. $700 million was 
the allocation that the Army Corps has proposed. And we are 
asking for that, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in those 
terms.
    American Samoa is very fragile with its infrastructure. The 
rebuilding of it, everything from sea walls, roads, and harbor, 
and so forth, airports. And then, we are asking for all of 
those in our proposal.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Governor.
    I am sure my time is up, but I would like to hear the 
importance of this Compact as well, Governor. Thanks.
    Mr. Palacios. Thank you. I am glad that our Federal 
Government has finally started to finalize those Compact 
agreements. Personally, I think that we took too long and that 
is why, I believe, that we gave the opportunity for China to 
start making inroads and begin to influence. You know, I used 
to work in fisheries, and I saw personally how Chinese 
fisheries started getting into the region, but to your 
question, I am glad that we are finally at the home stretch on 
finalizing the Compacts and also, of course, hope that the 
Compact also takes into consideration the impacts, not just for 
the Marianas--Northern Marianas and Guam--but also for the 
State of Hawaii, because, you know, that is part of the 
agreement. And we need to quantify the impacts and help Guam 
and the Northern Marianas, but I am glad that we are finalizing 
those agreements.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you, Governor. Thank you all very 
much.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    I have not asked my questions yet. I am going to ask mine 
then I will go right to Senator Hickenlooper. My question is 
going to be to all of you, very quickly, if you can give us 
answers--inflation. What is inflation in your territories? What 
is the inflation? What is the most contributing factor to 
inflation? What are you fighting the most right now? Is it 
food? Is it energy prices? What is it? You know, where's your 
inflation rate? What is the greatest challenge you have?
    We'll start with our friend from Puerto Rico.
    Mr. Pierluisi. Yes. Well, my concern with inflation is the 
cost----
    The Chairman. What is your rate?
    Mr. Pierluisi. Well, last year it was about six percent. 
Lower than the mainland.
    The Chairman. About the same as ours.
    Mr. Pierluisi. But still too high.
    The Chairman. Sure.
    Mr. Pierluisi. And it impacted all the different areas you 
mentioned, but one area in particular that troubles me is cost 
of construction materials, because the way we are getting the 
funding from FEMA, it is basically through Section 428 of the 
Stafford Act, which caps the funding. Once you agree to an 
estimate with FEMA--and that happened in 2019--you have to live 
with it.
    The Chairman. Got you.
    Mr. Pierluisi. The cost overrun goes on you. So we are 
engaged in conversations with FEMA, and I am alerting 
Congressional leadership that FEMA should have the flexibility 
to adjust the cost--the cap on the project--so that the scope 
of work of the projects does not get affected. So that is the--
--
    The Chairman. Well, your inflation is running about the 
same as ours, but basically your construction, trying to 
rebuild back from your hurricanes----
    Mr. Pierluisi. Exactly.
    The Chairman [continuing]. And all that is basically not 
able to proceed as you thought because you have cost overruns.
    Mr. Pierluisi. Yes, well, we could end up not doing all the 
projects that we planned to do.
    The Chairman. Right, right.
    Mr. Pierluisi. Because of the cost of inflation.
    The Chairman. Got it.
    Mr. Pierluisi. The inflation.
    The Chairman. Congressman, or Governor, if you will?
    Mr. Palacios. Thank you. We are in the same situation.
    The Chairman. You are right about six?
    Mr. Palacios. Pardon me?
    The Chairman. You are at a six percent inflation rate?
    Mr. Palacios. No, we are higher. We are much higher.
    The Chairman. Where are you? Do you know?
    Mr. Palacios. I don't have the specific numbers.
    The Chairman. But you are higher than the national average?
    Mr. Palacios. It is very, very high.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Mr. Palacios. For consumer----
    The Chairman. And what is the greatest cause of your 
inflation?
    Mr. Palacios. Pardon me?
    The Chairman. What is causing you the greatest harm and 
basically making it difficult for your citizens?
    Mr. Palacios. I think transportation, where we are at.
    The Chairman. Transportation.
    Mr. Palacios. And that is--and energy, of course.
    The Chairman. Just the high cost of getting everything to 
the island, right?
    Mr. Palacios. Absolutely.
    The Chairman. Okay. Governor.
    Mr. Mauga. American Samoa is at 11 percent.
    The Chairman. You are at 11 percent?
    Mr. Mauga. Yes, sir. Costs, again--construction, shipping 
into the island, and food are the highest inflation rates.
    The Chairman. Governor.
    Ms. Guerrero. I would say the same. Ours is about eight to 
ten percent.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    Ms. Guerrero. And for example, Senator, the price of eggs 
was $2.99, and now it is like $10. So gas----
    The Chairman. Can't trust those chickens.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Guerrero. We are actually giving subsidies to our egg 
farmers to----
    The Chairman. Well, the problem is, the virus that hit the 
chickens, I mean, it has taken a toll everywhere, in America 
too.
    Ms. Guerrero. So the cost of our inflation is, of course, 
energy, the gas prices.
    The Chairman. Sure.
    Ms. Guerrero. And also, chains----
    The Chairman. I am going to get to that next.
    Ms. Guerrero. Supply chain----
    The Chairman. I am going to get to energy real quick.
    Mr. Bryan. Energy--63 cents a kilowatt-hour, compared to 
like, 12 here. Food--a pack of chicken thighs is $35.
    The Chairman. So what is your inflation, Governor? Your 
inflation rate?
    Mr. Bryan. The last three years, five percent, five 
percent, seven percent--growth. And then construction. A public 
housing unit is costing us $380,000 to $500,000 per unit, and 
construction has tripled in cost. Inflation and the hurricane 
recovery, but yes, it is really bad.
    The Chairman. I do know that in the territories and 
islands, basically, that energy is a tremendous factor for you 
all--the reliability and also the cost. Now, with the Inflation 
Reduction Act and also the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill, do 
you see much interest and much technology coming your way or 
people wanting to develop hydrogen? Different types of new 
fuel, reliable fuel, you know, cleaner fuel or using fossil in 
a much cleaner way? Are you seeing those interests peaking in 
your areas? Because you would be natural for that, being more 
self-reliant.
    Ms. Guerrero. So for us, solar energy, of course.
    The Chairman. Sure.
    Ms. Guerrero. And we have a goal of 100 percent alternative 
energy by 2045, but we are also looking at virtual power plants 
using solar energy coming from rooftops. That is something 
that----
    The Chairman. Storage is the biggest concern you have right 
now because you don't have the reliability on storage.
    Ms. Guerrero. Right.
    The Chairman. And we are trying to develop the storage as 
quickly as possible. Hydrogen is a tremendous replacement for 
what we have been doing. And if you have that much, you know, 
you can do green hydrogen. You can do green ammonia. There's so 
much. I want to make sure that you all have all the 
opportunities that we have developed and we are trying to 
mature very quickly. So let us know how we can help on that. I 
know most of you ran by oil for a long time, and I know on the 
island that as far as in your situation with the refinery--we 
need that refinery up and running. We do, for stability for the 
whole region. And I agree with you.
    Mr. Pierluisi. I should just say that I issued an executive 
order in Puerto Rico making green hydrogen renewable energy, 
considering it as renewable energy because we have a renewable 
energy portfolio standard that we have to meet.
    The Chairman. Are you getting pushback? Are they saying 
green hydrogen does not fit as renewable?
    Mr. Pierluisi. The term is being used, but what I mean is 
the following, hydrogen, I agree with you----
    The Chairman. It's got horsepower.
    Mr. Pierluisi [continuing]. That is the future.
    The Chairman. It's got horsepower and you have stability 
with it.
    Mr. Pierluisi. That is the future. But I am, since I have 
this standard that I have to meet as a matter of our energy 
public policy law, I am considering hydrogen----
    The Chairman. I would hope you would.
    Mr. Pierluisi [continuing]. As one of the renewable energy 
sources.
    The Chairman. And we can make blue hydrogen also if we 
capture it and sequester the CO<INF>2</INF> from that----
    Mr. Pierluisi. Exactly.
    The Chairman [continuing]. That would raise that to a 
level. And then we have a $3 credit on it. I'm going to go 
ahead and I'm going to jump over to you because I know we have 
to run, the bell has been rung.
    Thank you all. We are going to have a lot of more 
discussion on this. We want to help you and make sure you have 
access to every opportunity of this new transition that is 
going on, using all-of-the-above in a cleaner fashion than we 
ever had before.
    Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thanks to all 
of you. I mean, we always hear, those of us in the continental 
48, always look with longing to our impression and 
understanding of the places you live as some of the most 
beautiful places on earth, but we also recognize, and it is 
only heightened by your testimony today, that they are not 
without risks and without serious challenges. So I appreciate 
you all coming here and hopefully we will be responsive to a 
lot of the issues you have raised.
    Governor Palacios, Congress has made a number of 
infrastructure investments in the Northern Marianas and other 
territories, including through relief packages, and as the 
Chair mentioned, the Inflation Reduction Act investments. Do 
you have the workforce and the resources to actually put the 
funds to work, and how could we help accelerate the deployment 
of these investments? And actually, I could probably ask each 
of you, concisely. I mean, why don't you start, but then we can 
ask each of you to answer the question.
    Mr. Palacios. Thank you for the question. You know, two 
years ago, I went in front of the IGIA and I thanked all of the 
federal agencies for all their contributions to rebuilding back 
after the super typhoon. We had, at the time, almost a billion 
dollars' worth of funding from HUD, EDA, FEMA, but we are still 
lagging behind on a lot of those projects because of the labor 
shortages in our region. It is like, you know, the rest of the 
nation. To put it in context----
    Senator Hickenlooper. You are going to have to be more 
concise if I want to get all five of you, so.
    Mr. Palacios. Okay.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Sorry.
    Mr. Palacios. Yes. We are very, very concerned about that, 
too and we are lagging behind----
    Senator Hickenlooper. Okay.
    Mr. Palacios. Because of labor shortages.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Okay, thank you.
    Who's next?
    Mr. Pierluisi. Well, in the case of Puerto Rico, skilled 
construction workers are the ones that are of concern because 
we are in the midst of an incredible reconstruction effort.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right.
    Mr. Pierluisi. You are talking about billions of dollars, 
of federal dollars devoted to this effort. And so, I have 
raised this topic with Secretary Mayorkas. I have raised it at 
the White House. I am saying that the H-2B program, it does not 
really work because it has a cap on it. If I recall correctly, 
it is roughly like 60,000 or so, nationwide. In Puerto Rico, we 
probably are lacking 10,000 skilled construction workers, and I 
know that there must be so many out there who we could give a 
two-year visa, tied to a specific sponsor with specific 
requirements, basically to allow them to come in and help us do 
this reconstruction that is in the interest of the Federal 
Government, and at the same time, that would help on the border 
because we would need Spanish speakers to deal in our 
construction industry. So you are talking about, it could be--
--
    Senator Hickenlooper. What is your unemployment?
    Mr. Pierluisi. Unemployment is at the lowest point in our 
history right now. It is six percent. It used to be double 
digits because, as I said, we are in the middle of a rebound 
here in Puerto Rico, now, two years in a row.
    Senator Hickenlooper. And you could put those workers to 
use. Got it.
    Mr. Pierluisi. But, yes, so that is, I would say, Central 
American workers, Dominican Republic workers, they could come 
in, legally through a program targeted for this purpose.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Okay, thank you.
    Mr. Mauga. American Samoa is going through a reformation, 
reconstructions of the ability of the government to go forward, 
in terms of educating our young ones into trade and into 
technical schools and so forth. So we could gain the technical 
expert in terms of skilled. We have a cannery in American 
Samoa, StarKist, and we are getting workers for the cannery 
from our neighbor islands of Samoa. So there is a lot of work 
there, but like I said, we are going through the 
transformation, and the funding that we are asking for is to 
transform the school system, to transform the trade and 
technical training at the college level so we can teach our own 
young ones born in American Samoa so they can take over these 
jobs.
    Senator Hickenlooper. The point is to help you train your 
own people, got it. Thank you.
    Mr. Mauga. Thank you.
    Ms. Guerrero. Senator, our greatest concern for economic 
recovery, of course, is workforce development. We do train our 
local people, but the demand is so much higher than the supply. 
And so, we are asking to exempt Guam from the ban of the H-2B 
workers, and in the NDAA there is a provision there that allows 
for H-2B workers, but only for military projects, and we would 
like to have it include civilian projects, also. And there is 
an expiration for that. It expires in 2024, and we are asking 
to extend it to 2029.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Got it.
    Mr. Bryan. Same position as Puerto Rico. As a matter of 
fact, we used to get the Puerto Rican workers. We don't even 
get them anymore. They are working in Puerto Rico. Everybody 
used to complain about it. Nobody is complaining anymore.
    Mr. Pierluisi. Stop that.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Bryan. We lost 20 percent of our population in the last 
decade between the hurricanes, the closing of the refinery, and 
the recession. We need as many people as possible. We need 
5,000 additional workers. That is over five percent of our 
population, and over ten percent of our workforce to complete 
this recovery.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Wow.
    The Chairman. Let me say this--I'm sorry, Senator.
    Senator Hickenlooper. No, I just wanted to make one last 
point.
    The Chairman. Okay, go ahead.
    Senator Hickenlooper. That I think you guys are doing a 
great job in difficult circumstances. I just want to leave you, 
and I will post a question into the record and you can provide 
written answers, because we are out of time, but there is a lot 
of evidence that expanding the Marine Protected Areas helps 
boost economies on your islands continuously. And I know there 
are a number of plans in the works that, I know, the Virgin 
Islands have. President Kennedy started the Buck Island Reef 
National Monument, and you look at the impact that has. One of 
the world's first Blue Parks. I think in many cases the best 
way to protect reefs is to protect the fish that inhabit the 
reefs. Those kinds of things, I think, the Congress is 
beginning to look at and recognize that this is economic impact 
in one way, as we get you the workers so that you can continue 
to build the infrastructure that creates a long, sustained 
economic expansion.
    I yield back.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    I am going to have to leave and I am going to turn it over 
to Senator Hirono to ask her questions and she will finish up 
the meeting.
    I just want to personally thank all of you, and I want you 
to know that we are with you. We are very much concerned. You 
are extremely important, as any state is, as far as to all of 
our success and the freedoms that we love and the democracy 
that we enjoy. And it is something that we are going to protect 
and do everything we have with the force of the United States 
of America and working together and we will make sure that you 
have every opportunity that possibly could be available to you 
all. We are going to make sure that we are going to do that.
    As far as you having the same concerns we are having, we 
need more workers too. We have ten million jobs we cannot fill 
in America. So with that, I am going to turn it over to Senator 
Hirono.
    Senator Hirono [presiding]. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Welcome to all of you, and of course, to my former 
colleague, Governor Pierluisi, it is always good to see you.
    I echo the Chairman's comments about how important our 
relationship is with each of you and your governments. And of 
course, as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I 
know how important our relationships are with each of you 
regarding our national security. So we have much in common.
    This is a question for Governors Palacios, Mauga, and 
Guerrero. Always good to see you too, Governor Guerrero.
    Ms. Guerrero. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hirono. I know that you were asked questions about 
the importance of the Compacts that we are now negotiating, so 
I won't go through all of that, but at the same time, it is 
important that we change the law that will allow Compact 
citizens that come to Hawaii, Guam, and other places, that they 
receive the kind of social services that they should be, in my 
opinion, entitled to, and it took many years to restore 
Medicaid eligibility to Compact citizens. I plan to reintroduce 
the Compact-Impact Fairness Act, which would restore COFA 
citizens' access to all federal public benefits that are 
available to other legal permanent residents.
    How would restoring access to these federal public benefits 
mitigate the effects of COFA migration on Guam and the 
Marianas' budget and improve health and educational outcomes 
for COFA citizens?
    Would you like to start, Governor?
    Ms. Guerrero. I can start. Like I said, our brothers and 
sisters from the outer islands are certainly very welcome to 
Guam and they are already accessing a lot of these public 
services. And I am certainly very supportive, Senator Hirono, 
of your legislation, as I was with the Medicaid. And now, as a 
result of the eligibility for Medicaid in Guam, it is helping 
us with the impact on the health care services.
    I certainly support it, but I think it should also have 
along with it an increase of grant funding to these social 
services to allow them to absorb the migrant workers to be able 
to continue and expand these services to them. So I hope that 
there is some consideration for an increase of funding in those 
various areas, whether it be housing, education, we estimate 
about $150 million a year of impact to the island. This 
includes education, health care, and public safety. And we only 
get $18 million. And so we absorb the balance of that and it 
does impact us tremendously.
    Senator Hirono. Same for Hawaii. So the amounts that come 
to you and to Hawaii and other places are very short of what is 
expended to take care of our friends.
    Governors Mauga and Palacios, do you have anything to add?
    Mr. Palacios. Yes, thank you.
    First, I certainly support the idea of making COFA's FSM 
and Micronesian brothers and sisters eligible for Medicaid. 
That certainly would help defray the cost of health services in 
the Commonwealth, Guam, and Hawaii, for example. But I think we 
should also take a look at other social services and other 
services provided, and perhaps even include them in your bill 
or maybe subsequent bills that Congress may consider because, 
obviously, I totally agree, and it is a fact that, you know, 
us, Guam, the CNMI, and Hawaii are recipients of most of the 
migrations out of Micronesia, and our government has basically 
borne the cost of a lot of these social services and health 
care needs that we provide. So I fully understand and I fully 
support your legislation and your effort.
    Thank you.
    Senator Hirono. Would you like to----
    Mr. Mauga. First, I want to thank you for the Consolidated 
Appropriation Act of 2023 that permanently increased the 
federal Medicaid match to 83 percent/17 percent. Our dilemma in 
American Samoa is that most of us that are American Samoa-born 
qualify for Medicaid, but there is a percentage of American 
Samoa residents that are legal residents in our terms in 
American Samoa that do not qualify under the Medicaid program, 
and we are looking for internal revenues from the government to 
make sure that we are taking care of this part of the 
population.
    In terms of a lot of revenues, grants from the Federal 
Government also do not benefit this group of population, 
residents of American Samoa. They are not qualified for federal 
scholarships. They are not qualified for a lot of the 
educational benefits that all the residents born in American 
Samoa are qualified for.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you very much for pointing out an 
area that I would like to learn a little bit more about. It is 
very clear that we need to do more, and I think if we present a 
united front in the need for more reimbursements under the 
Compacts or under the legislation that provides support for 
those areas that are particularly welcoming, I guess, of our 
Compact citizens, I think that is something that we need to 
look forward to.
    Now, there has been testimony about the shortage of 
workers. And yes, all across the country we are facing very low 
unemployment, at the same time, I know that there are visa 
issues that impact, for example, Puerto Rico and Guam. I know I 
am over my time, but I am the only one here, so I can keep 
going.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hirono. So it is going to take some work, I think, 
for us to work through some of the visa issues that you have to 
enable you to attract more workers. And with regard to Guam, we 
were able to put in a one-year extension for the H-2B visas. 
You had wanted a much longer extension, however, we do need to 
meet some of the Department of Labor's concerns about how these 
visa holders are treated. I just want to get to the bottom of 
all of that so we can help you with your workers and also 
Puerto Rico. And if that is an issue for the other governors, 
and you need us to address visa issues with regard to you, then 
I would like to have a commitment from each of you to work with 
us.
    Yes, Governor.
    Mr. Pierluisi. And I have to say, Senator, that there are 
things that we are doing to increase labor force participation.
    Senator Hirono. Okay.
    Mr. Pierluisi. Through training. We are using CDBG-DR 
funding to train potential construction laborers. We are doing 
the same with apprenticeships. And that is something that needs 
to be done. I issued an executive order requiring that in 
federally funded construction projects, the minimum wage be $15 
an hour for skilled construction workers and now, the 
construction industry in Puerto Rico is paying more for the 
labor, as it should. So that should be helping because we need 
all the labor we can get, including Puerto Ricans who left the 
island looking for better quality of life or, you know, equal 
rights in the states. Now we are telling them, come back. We 
have good-paying jobs, particularly in this construction field.
    So that is something we are doing, but I have to admit, we 
are lacking, definitely, at the very least, like 10,000 workers 
right now. And we see the problems in the border. And so we say 
this is a common interest here. Let's set up a special program 
for skilled construction workers using either the H-2B visa 
program or something similar. That is my proposal, and I have 
run it both by Secretary Mayorkas as well as the White House, 
and here in Congress.
    Ms. Guerrero. I wanted to comment, Senator, on the concerns 
of the Department of Labor. We treat our workers very well. We 
have guidelines that we follow with the federal labor laws. We 
monitor construction sites all the time for adherence and 
compliance to those requirements. In fact, the Philippines just 
sent out a Congressional delegation to review the places of 
these workers, and they came back with such excellent comments 
about the way we provide food, housing, medical benefits, labor 
wages and so forth. So I think the concerns that the Department 
of Labor has are very much addressed in the way we treat our H-
2B workers in Guam. So we need those H-2B workers with the 
increase of military construction and also coming back with 
economic recovery with investments in commercial development 
and housing developments. You know, we also have local 
training. We have boot camps for shipyard repair, boot camps 
for plumbing, electricians, but the local labor, the local 
civilian population just cannot meet the demands----
    Senator Hirono. Yes, I understand. So Governor, my hope is 
that Guam will be able to address and meet the concerns of the 
Department of Labor, and when that happens, I believe that we 
will be able to extend the number of H-2B visas that become 
available.
    Ms. Guerrero. Our Department of Labor is working very 
closely with the U.S. Department of Labor.
    Senator Hirono. Good.
    Mr. Bryan. If I may, Senator.
    The other thing you have to think is conversely, the 
reality is that it is happening anyway. Every day, people are 
dropping off non-citizens on our shores. They are actually 
going to the immigration office and then they give them a court 
date and they let them go. Some of them even give them tickets 
to travel to the mainland. So they are already there. And they 
are being abused--the ones that don't know, the most 
disadvantaged ones, are being abused because they don't have a 
system in which they can report. Creating the program will 
allow them to actually be monitored and we can assure that they 
are not being abused.
    Senator Hirono. Yes, I agree with you. Thank you for that 
observation.
    I know that one of my colleagues is going to be coming, so 
I will just continue with my questions. Regarding the lack of 
workforce, one of the things that COVID-19 really brought to 
the fore is how challenged our health care workers were. So all 
across the country we need nurses, we need other health care 
workers. Is that happening with all of you, and what can we do 
to address your needs for health care workers--doctors, nurses, 
the range of workers?
    Mr. Pierluisi. Well, I am appreciative, as is the Governor 
of the Virgin Islands, for the additional funding we got 
through the bipartisan appropriations bill that just happened 
here a month ago or so. But the fact is, we are underfunded, 
still, in Puerto Rico, in both the Medicaid program and the 
Medicare program. And the ones who suffered this, among others, 
are not only the beneficiaries, they are the providers, 
including those who work at hospitals and so on, because we are 
underfunded. And that raises the problem, and it increases the 
problem of getting people.
    Now, what we are doing in Puerto Rico, finally, now that we 
have this bankruptcy behind us, is revising pay scales for 
public servants at large, ensuring that they earn pretty much 
what they would be earning in the private sector. And that is 
happening as we speak there.
    Senator Hirono. Okay.
    Mr. Pierluisi. And that includes nurses, for example. So we 
are raising the pay scales for nurses, the ones who work for 
the government, for the public hospitals, but I tell you, the 
underlying problem is lack of equality in our health programs. 
And that is why you see me advocating for statehood because 
that is one instance. And my fellow governors probably face the 
same lack of equal treatment in key health programs that, in 
our territories, they are like the Cadillac programs. The 
commercial plants do not pay as much as Medicare does. And 
still, we are underfunded in the Medicare program, underfunded 
in the Medicare Advantage program. The formula that is being 
used is not adequate, but I think this is something----
    Mr. Bryan. Common.
    Mr. Pierluisi. Something where we all in the same boat.
    Mr. Bryan. TEFRA rebasing at our hospitals has not been 
done in 30, 40 years. I mean, we are getting paid the lowest 
rate. And the ARPA funding has been so useful because it is so 
flexible and you can use it in so many ways. We are 
incentivizing nurses and medical personnel on a whole to move 
to the islands, but housing and everything else is expensive. I 
always tell people a bucket of chicken in the Virgin Islands is 
$50. That puts it in perspective for you, and that was before 
COVID.
    So incentivizing them is good, but not only are they lesser 
paid, there is a higher cost of living. So it's like a double-
whammy.
    Senator Hirono. Yes.
    Mr. Bryan. Being able to pay more would be great.
    Senator Hirono. You know, the workforce issues are a 
multiplicity of factors. And Governor Pierluisi, Hawaii is a 
state, but we would like to have the Medicare reimbursement 
schedule changed for states like Hawaii. So we need to revisit 
how those determinations are made all across the country 
because there are other states that do not feel that their 
Medicare reimbursements are what they should be.
    So apparently my colleague is not coming. So thank you once 
again, each of you, for being here. I am going to close this 
hearing with the notation that members will have until the 
close of business tomorrow to submit additional questions to 
you for the record.
    The Committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:36 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
