                              ----------                              

                  House of Representatives,
                       Committee on Armed Services,
                          Subcommittee on Strategic Forces,
                        Washington, DC, Thursday, December 7, 2023.
    The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 9:01 a.m., in 
room 2212, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Doug Lamborn 
(chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DOUG LAMBORN, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
      COLORADO, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC FORCES

    Mr. Lamborn. The subcommittee hearing will come to order.
    Today, we meet to receive testimony on regional missile 
defense capabilities. This includes the Patriot system; the 
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, system; and the 
Aegis, or Aegis, weapons system.
    Testifying before the subcommittee today are: Mr. John D. 
Hill, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space and 
Missile Defense Policy; Major General Sean Gainey, the Director 
of Fires within the headquarters of the Department of the Army; 
Rear Admiral Doug Williams, who, as of yesterday, is no longer 
the Acting Director of the Missile Defense Agency but is now 
Director of Test at MDA [Missile Defense Agency]--I guess there 
have been a lot of promotions here in the last couple days----
    Admiral Williams. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Lamborn. --and finally, Brigadier General Clair Gill, 
the Joint Staff's Deputy Director for Regional Operations and 
Force Management.
    Thank you all for being here with us.
    As the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to 
demonstrate, missile defense capabilities are becoming 
increasingly important on the modern battlefield. However, 
demand for these systems continues to outpace supply. In recent 
years, the force has experienced significant stress attempting 
to meet the needs of our combatant commanders. This suggests we 
are far below what will be needed in a conflict with a near-
peer adversary.
    This issue will only get worse as the need to increase 
deterrence in the INDOPACOM [U.S. Indo-Pacific Command] theater 
becomes more urgent. Over the last month, we have seen Iranian 
proxies attempt to sink U.S. military and civilian vessels 
transiting the Red Sea. These attacks by the Houthis, which 
were named a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump 
administration, have only intensified over the past week.
    U.S. missile defense assets in the area, particularly those 
aboard the USS [United States Ship] Carney, were able to 
intercept some of the incoming missiles and UAVs [unmanned 
aerial vehicles]. This quick action likely saved the lives of 
U.S. Navy sailors and commercial seamen.
    We look forward to hearing from our witnesses on how the 
Department manages these scarce assets and whether additional 
capacity is necessary.
    While not the subject of today's hearing, I must express my 
concern about reports that the Department is considering early 
down-selects to a single contractor on several key missile 
defense programs. Maintaining multiple competing industry teams 
helps limit risk in developmental programs. And this 
subcommittee will closely scrutinize any decision to eliminate 
competition so as to ensure that a sufficient rationale exists.
    I am similarly concerned that the Department may be 
reconsidering a transfer of the Missile Defense Agency's 
responsibilities for the THAAD program to the Army. The idea of 
transitioning mature missile defense programs from MDA to the 
services is not new; however, the Department's longstanding and 
consistent position in the case of THAAD has been that doing so 
would be disruptive and unnecessarily would add risk to the 
program.
    Based on this argument, last year's defense authorization 
bill repealed a standing requirement for such a transfer. If 
the Department's view has now changed, I would expect that it 
would thoroughly consult with this committee. The Department 
must explain why it is reopening this issue and considering 
changes that, per the Department, would put THAAD at risk.
    The fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act has 
several key provisions on regional missile defense. Among other 
things, it includes additional THAAD interceptors and an 
acceleration of the Glide Phase Interceptor program for 
hypersonic missile defense. I cannot emphasize enough how 
critical it is that we get the NDAA [National Defense 
Authorization Act] signed into law at the soonest possible 
time.
    With that, I recognize Ranking Member Seth Moulton for any 
opening comments he may have.

     STATEMENT OF HON. SETH MOULTON, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM 
MASSACHUSETTS, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON STRATEGIC FORCES

    Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    I would also like to welcome our panel of distinguished 
witnesses here on December 7th, the 82nd anniversary of the 
attack on Pearl Harbor.
    In Ukraine, Israel, and around the world, our adversaries 
are using missiles to attack not just military targets but 
diplomatic facilities, energy infrastructure, commercial 
shipping vessels, and civilian populations. Fortunately, their 
success has been limited, in part due to deployed missile 
defenses, many of which are developed and produced by the 
United States.
    During one of this subcommittee's previous hearings, I laid 
out the four levels at which missile defenses might be used: 
level one, strategic defense against peer adversaries; level 
two addresses a capability to address rogue-nation threats; 
level three, while somewhat of a nuance, is the ability to 
defeat an accidental launch of a near-peer adversary; level 
four is regional tactical-level missile defense; and level five 
is the foundational level of being able to detect and track 
threats from the moment they are launched throughout their 
flight and up until they reach their impact point.
    Today, we are focused on that fourth level, regional or 
tactical missile defense.
    In the last 2 years especially, we have seen how important 
this is. Ukraine has received incredible support from allies 
and partners on air and missile defense, which has enabled them 
to fight back against near-nonstop Russian missile attacks. It 
is safe to say that not only have these systems saved countless 
civilian lives, but they are a key reason Ukraine has been able 
to maintain its sovereignty almost 2 years after war criminal 
Vladimir Putin's criminal invasion.
    In Israel, we continue to witness the critical daily role 
the tactical missile defenses play in defending Israeli 
citizens from rocket, artillery, mortar, attack drone, and 
ballistic missile threats being launched into the country.
    For years, these defensive systems, like the famed Iron 
Dome, have also saved Palestinian lives, because, previously, 
the only protection Israel found against these attacks was 
hitting back offensively. Imagine if the bombing like we have 
seen over the past 2 months happened every time rockets were 
fired at Israel over the past 2 decades.
    The administration has also shifted U.S. force structure in 
the region, deploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, 
or THAAD, battery to Saudi Arabia, adding Patriot battalions, 
and increasing Aegis BMD [Ballistic Missile Defense] at-sea 
presence. These systems have not only defended against attacks 
on U.S.-deployed forces but also against attacks aimed at 
commercial shipping vessels in one of the most congested and 
vital thoroughfares of global trade.
    While these systems are performing well operationally, this 
confluence of global aggression has spotlighted our limited 
capacity to address the growing requirements from each of the 
combatant commanders, primarily in INDOPACOM, CENTCOM [U.S. 
Central Command], and EUCOM [U.S. European Command].
    With a finite number of Aegis BMD-capable ships, THAAD 
batteries, and Patriot battalions, at some point--a point we 
may have already reached--any changes in our regional missile 
defense posture will almost certainly induce risk somewhere 
else in the world.
    The limited capacity of regional missile defense 
capabilities highlights a central issue in the missile defense 
policy debate. Missile defense, to date, has been on the wrong 
side of the cost equation, and at the end of the day, it is a 
simple numbers game.
    For example, the USS Carney has recently shot down several 
Houthi missiles using Standard Missile-2 interceptors. Those 
interceptors have a per-unit cost of $2 million, more than 
double the cost of the cruise missiles they shot down.
    This is why we must look at next-generation capabilities as 
well, capabilities that can flip the cost paradigm, such as 
directed energy, cyber, and other innovative solutions that are 
not one-for-one point defenses. Only then will we have a decent 
chance of stopping our adversaries from relying so heavily on 
missile technology.
    Lastly, while we are here today primarily to talk about 
systems and capabilities, we would be remiss not to discuss our 
greatest asset when it comes to missile defense: the soldiers 
and sailors assigned to the Aegis BMD ships, Patriot 
battalions, and THAAD batteries around the world.
    I remember the early days of Iraq and Afghanistan, when the 
missile defense community had little to do. But, recently, 
these troops have been overtaxed, experiencing shorter and 
shorter deployment dwell times. And GAO [U.S. Government 
Accountability Office] has repeatedly reported on the negative 
impact on readiness and training for the community.
    The Navy, though less discussed, is not immune to these 
issues either. The independent review conducted after the 
collisions of the USS McCain and Fitzgerald, both Aegis BMD-
capable ships, highlighted the increased OPTEMPO on the crews 
due to long at-sea deployments and increasing mission 
requirements and how those contributed to basic training often 
being skipped.
    While this subcommittee tends to focus on the high demand 
of the weapons systems, we cannot forget about the impact of 
this intense global demand for missile defense that it places 
on the men and women who are at the core of our capability.
    Missiles are an integral part of the modern way of war, 
and, thus, so too is missile defense. I look forward to 
discussing with the witnesses where we can improve these 
systems and innovate towards the future capabilities we need to 
meet the increasingly complex missile threats proliferating 
around the world.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. We hear that votes are projected to be 
at 10:30. So we will go ahead and start in with our testimony, 
and then we will move to members' questions.
    You will each have 5 minutes. Your full statements will be 
part of the record.
    Mr. Hill, you are recognized first.

   STATEMENT OF JOHN D. HILL, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF 
          DEFENSE FOR SPACE AND MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY

    Mr. Hill. Chairman Lamborn and Ranking Member Moulton, 
distinguished members of the subcommittee, on behalf of the 
Office of the Secretary of Defense, thank you for the 
opportunity to testify today alongside my distinguished 
colleagues.
    The ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East 
underscore the centrality of missiles in modern warfare and 
global strategy. Likewise, for U.S. forces and U.S. allies and 
partners around the world, in this era of missile-centric 
warfare, active missile defenses have become an essential 
element of a credible military force posture.
    In the most basic sense, integrated air and missile 
defense, or IAMD, encompasses diverse sensors and shooters with 
the command and control systems that network them together to 
give battlefield commanders the optimal selection of 
interceptors to defend against a given threat.
    Space-based sensors and networks are an increasingly 
important component of IAMD systems for homeland and regional 
defenses. But in a broader sense, IAMD must also be integrated 
with other elements of military posture, including strike 
systems that can hold an adversary's critical military 
capabilities at risk. Moreover, IAMD must also incorporate 
passive defenses, including resilient critical infrastructure, 
and broader missile-defeat options, such as electronic warfare 
and supply-chain interdictions that disrupt proliferation 
channels.
    The IAMD efforts of the United States, our allies, and 
partners are sound in the face of evolving and expanding 
threats. These efforts are advancing shared national-security 
interests in the defense of freedom and common values. However, 
protecting national security is a process of continual 
investment and funding.
    And as Secretary Austin has emphasized, although the 
passage of another continuing resolution has put off the threat 
of a lapse of funding, operating under continuing resolutions 
hamstrings the Department's people and programs and undermines 
both our national security and competitiveness.
    Further, passing supplemental funding can ultimately 
strengthen our national security, deter our adversaries, meet 
our commitments to allies and partners, and ensure Israel and 
Ukraine have the military capabilities they need to succeed.
    I thank you again for this opportunity to testify. You have 
my full written testimony for the record. And I thank you for 
the role this subcommittee plays in supporting our homeland and 
regional integrated air and missile defense interests around 
the globe.
    I look forward to our discussion and your questions.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Hill can be found in the 
Appendix on page 31.]
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    Major General Gainey.

  STATEMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL SEAN A. GAINEY (USA), DIRECTOR, 
 COUNTER-UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS OFFICE, DIRECTOR OF FIRES, 
           OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF

    General Gainey. Chairman Lamborn, Ranking Member Moulton, 
and distinguished members of the subcommittee, on behalf of the 
Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Army, thank 
you for the opportunity to highlight the importance of regional 
missile defense.
    As you know, air- and missile-related threats have rapidly 
expanded in recent years in quantity, variety, and 
sophistication. Current events around the world highlight the 
criticality of missile defense as a force for deterrence and as 
a central element of our national defense.
    These are challenging and important times for the joint and 
integrated air missile defense force, and while specific 
details of current and planned deployments are more appropriate 
for a closed session, I can say that the Army air and missile 
defense remains the Army's most heavily deployed force with the 
highest demand signal among the combatant commands every year.
    In that context, the importance of the work that our air 
and missile defense soldiers do each and every day in support 
of the Army and the Nation cannot be overstated. And I want to 
thank you for your continued support to them and their 
families.
    Our Army's contribution to defeating the wide range of 
evolving threats is advancing and continues to improve in both 
capability and capacity as we build towards the future Army. 
This additive capability and its associated force structure is 
designed not only to defeat the threat but to minimize the 
impact on soldiers and their families.
    But capability does not consist only of materiel solutions. 
The amazing soldiers that operate and sustain these systems 
remain our true center of gravity. Recruiting and retaining the 
Nation's top talent for our Army and air and missile defense 
forces is the linchpin of our success. Caring for our soldiers 
and their family is paramount to win in any environment around 
the globe.
    A critical point to emphasize is that integrated air and 
missile defense is a shared responsibility across the service. 
No one service by itself will have enough capability and 
capacity to protect every critical asset across the globe. 
Therefore, to reduce the burden, the Army continues to work 
with our joint service partners, to include the U.S. Navy Aegis 
ballistic missile defense and the U.S. Air Force offensive 
counter-air operations.
    Integration with allies and partners on missile defense is 
also an important priority to strengthen international 
cooperation and defeat our shared threats. Integrated 
deterrence with our allies and partners provides commanders 
layered and tiered options to degrade, disrupt, and defeat 
adversary air and missile defense threats. Our ability to 
protect the homeland and our collective interests abroad is 
dependent on burden-sharing between our air and missile 
defenses and that of our partners.
    Let me conclude by saying that I take great pride in the 
efforts and sacrifices made by all soldiers and their family on 
behalf of the Nation. The Army recognizes the demand placed on 
the force and has taken significant and aggressive steps to 
enhance regional air and missile defense capabilities and 
capacity as well as implementing important quality-of-life 
improvements. The Army will continue to work with joint service 
partners and allies to better integrate their defenses into the 
overall missile defense architecture.
    The Army appreciates the continued support and significant 
investments from Congress. Thank you for shedding light on this 
important issue today, and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of General Gainey can be found in 
the Appendix on page 42.]
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    Rear Admiral Williams.

 STATEMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL DOUGLAS L. WILLIAMS (USN), DIRECTOR 
                (ACTING), MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY

    Admiral Williams. Chairman Lamborn, Ranking Member Moulton, 
and distinguished members of the subcommittee, it is an honor 
to appear before you today.
    Since its inception in 2002, Missile Defense Agency has 
developed numerous missile defense capabilities to enhance the 
regional defense posture of combatant commands to counter 
increasingly diverse missile threats.
    Globally deployed ship-based and land-based Aegis ballistic 
missile defense capabilities are a critical part of the missile 
defense system. There are currently 49 Aegis BMD-capable ships 
as well as Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland.
    The Standard Missile-3 class of missiles provide BMD 
mission capabilities across fleet areas and have been vital to 
the success of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, which is 
the U.S. contribution to NATO [North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization] missile defenses.
    Additionally, the SM-6 is available to the Navy for a 
limited defense against hypersonic missile threats and is a key 
part of the sea-based terminal defenses currently in operation.
    MDA develops, produces, and fields the Terminal High 
Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, weapons system for the Army. 
The THAAD system is combat-proven. And eight THAAD batteries 
have been procured, and seven are currently fielded to the U.S. 
Army.
    Current plans for improving Aegis BMD and THAAD system 
performance involve efforts to increase missile defense 
quantities and to improve the quality of missile defense 
through greater integration of deployed capabilities and 
development of new systems, such as our efforts with the 
Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor and Glide Phase 
Interceptor.
    Additionally, MDA continues to strengthen defenses against 
all regional missile threats by our continued close work with 
allies and partners to improve missile defense capability, 
integration, and interoperability.
    MBA has developed and fielded a command and control battle 
management and communications system that operates in a joint 
multidomain environment and connects ground, air, sea, and 
space sensors and shooters. The C2BMC [Command Control Battle 
Management Communications] system ties in, for example, the 
Aegis BMD and THAAD weapons systems as well as our homeland 
defense system.
    MDA and the Israel Missile Defense Organization continue to 
cooperate on engineering, development, co-production, testing, 
and fielding of the Arrow weapons system, the David's Sling 
weapons system, and the Iron Dome defense system. Since October 
7, 2023, each of these multitiered defense elements have 
successfully intercepted multiple air and ballistic missile and 
rocket attacks against Israel and deployed U.S. personnel 
during Operation Swords of Iron.
    Finally, MDA will continue to support the Army to meet the 
INDOPACOM requirement to deliver a persistent, 360-degree, 
integrated air and missile defense capability to defend the 
people, infrastructure, and territory of Guam from advanced 
ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missile threats.
    Chairman Lamborn, Ranking Member Moulton, members of the 
subcommittee, I appreciate your continued support for the 
Missile Defense Agency and the missile defense mission, and I 
look forward to answering the committee's questions. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Admiral Williams can be found in 
the Appendix on page 49.]
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    Brigadier General Gill.

  STATEMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERAL CLAIR A. GILL (USA), DEPUTY 
 DIRECTOR FOR REGIONAL OPERATIONS AND FORCE MANAGEMENT, JOINT 
                             STAFF

    General Gill. Good morning, Chairman Lamborn, Ranking 
Member Moulton, and distinguished members of the subcommittee. 
Thanks for the opportunity to discuss missile defense in the 
context of the Joint Staff, specifically as we consider 
combatant commanders and allied demand and service capacity.
    As you have heard, missile-related threats have rapidly 
expanded in recent years, and adversary missile systems are 
showing more maneuver capability as well as greater 
survivability, reliability, accuracy, and lethality.
    The increase in adversary capabilities and combatant 
command demand, Russia's war in Ukraine, and the Israel-Hamas 
conflict place an ever-increasing strain on joint integrated 
air and missile defense forces. As you will hear today, these 
forces comprise one of the most stressed force elements across 
the entirety of the joint force.
    For context, I serve as the Deputy Director for Regional 
Operations and Force Management in the Joint Staff Operations 
Directorate, the J-3. I assist in providing policy, readiness, 
force sourcing, and force employment expertise to the Director 
of Operations and coordinate with the services and combatant 
commands on the input to the annual Global Force Management 
Allocation Plan, the GFMAP, and the emergent Secretary of 
Defense Orders Book, SDOB, processes.
    The GFMAP is our annual strategic force allocation plan, 
built over the course of the entire preceding year, that orders 
forces to deploy in the framework of our Department's guiding 
intent, our National Defense Strategy.
    The SDOB process allows combatant commanders to request 
forces in an emergent manner and source immediate needs in the 
context of the ever-changing global environment. In this role, 
the J-35 reviews, adjudicates, and recommends allocation 
decisions through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to 
the Secretary of Defense on a recurring basis.
    Additionally, as the focal point for global current and 
future operations on the Joint Staff, the J-35 is responsible 
for providing directives and communications to and from the 
joint force, while ensuring we assist the Chairman in his role 
as principal military advisor to the Secretary of Defense and 
the President.
    Many surmise that global force management is about 
allocation and assignment of forces and equipment. To be sure, 
it is, but it is really about prioritization and risk. We have 
finite joint forces as we contemplate addressing the global 
challenges that require appropriate military solutions.
    When the Joint Staff presents recommendations through the 
Chairman to the Secretary, the conversation always ends up 
focusing on risk: Do we risk deploying units early? Do we 
jeopardize service modernization plans? Or do we mortgage dwell 
time at home station?
    Moreover, if the Secretary must decide between combatant 
commands, where does he assume risk--in a priority theater or 
in theater with an emergent requirement? We often discuss the 
balance between the ``tactical now'' and the ``strategic 
future.'' And we always take into consideration the 
capabilities of our allies and partners.
    As we cover protecting the force today, I am prepared to 
discuss our missile defense contributions as it relates to 
supporting our allies and partners in the Russia-Ukraine war 
and the Israel-Hamas conflict and their impacts on the safety 
of our own deployed troops.
    In conclusion, I share my colleagues' pride in the efforts 
made by all our servicemembers and their steadfast families in 
support of these critical missile defense capabilities that 
protect our Nation and its interests. We will continue to work 
with our service partners and allies to better align our 
efforts into the overall missile defense architecture.
    Thank you again for the continued support of the Congress 
to resource and improve our IAMD capacity and capabilities. I 
look forward to our discussion and answering your questions.
    [The prepared statement of General Gill can be found in the 
Appendix on page 59.]
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    And thank all of you for providing your testimony and for 
being here today.
    It was mentioned earlier that there have been some 
excellent defense by our sailors and soldiers against missiles 
fired in CENTCOM at our own forces and vessels and at Israeli 
targets.
    Would you agree that we have had excellent operations on 
the part of our sailors and soldiers in shooting down some of 
these missiles? Admiral Williams and General Gill, would you 
agree with that assessment?
    Admiral Williams. Thank you for the question, sir.
    Absolutely agree with that assessment.
    And I will offer a vignette. Just over a month ago, sir, 
you know, we had the opportunity to align with the Navy on a 
really complex flight test off the coast of Hawaii, where we 
fired simultaneously in a raid scenario two ballistic missiles 
and two cruise missiles. And the Aegis destroyer successfully 
intercepted all of those threats simultaneously.
    And it was a little omniscient because, you know, lo and 
behold, a few weeks later, you know, the Aegis, you know, ships 
in the Red Sea were up against a similar threat. And the 
weapons system continues to perform as designed, with the 
sailors, the weapons system, the tactics, techniques, and 
procedures working as we expect it to.
    Mr. Lamborn. General.
    General Gill. Chairman, thank you.
    This is exactly why the combatant commanders ask for those 
assets to be in the region. I think the actions of the Carney, 
the Hudner, and the Mason have all demonstrated the discipline 
of our sailors who deployed to the theater, on short notice in 
some cases, and demonstrated their proficiency.
    Mr. Lamborn. I am going to ask about rules of engagement 
here, to take a little diversion from my questions I was going 
to ask. And that is, if targets are in Israel itself, I assume 
that Israel takes the responsibility for how to respond to the 
source of those attacks, although it is wonderful that we can 
help our partner by shooting down these threats.
    But when Iranian forces or Iranian proxies are shooting at 
our ships or our installations in CENTCOM, what are the rules 
of engagement for us to respond? Or do they have impunity to do 
whatever they want and we just take it? Which I hope is not the 
case.
    General Gill. Chairman, all of our soldiers, sailors, 
airmen deployed always have the right of self-defense. So that 
is primary. We also have the Spartan Shield EXORD [executive 
order], which gives authority for us to protect our allies in 
Israel.
    Mr. Lamborn. Admiral?
    Admiral Williams. I have nothing further to add than what 
General Gill just added, sir.
    Mr. Lamborn. Okay.
    Shifting gears to the production supply lines and 
production of missiles and precision-guided munitions, part of 
the administration's supplemental budget request includes $755 
million to expand production of Patriot interceptors from 550 
to 650 annually.
    Would you agree that that is something we need, or should 
we even go beyond that, let's say?
    General Gainey. Sir, thank you for the question 
specifically referenced to the Patriot system. As you know, the 
Army maintains the Patriot system and runs the Patriot system 
and our great soldiers man the Patriot system globally today.
    Yes, the additional interceptors are welcome. As you know, 
the Patriot interceptor is in demand globally by the United 
States and our partners, so any additional help in that area 
will be very helpful. Thank you.
    Mr. Lamborn. Do any of you have suggestions on how our 
Nation's supply lines could be better equipped and constituted 
for future potential demands?
    I mean, we look at Ukraine, we look at Israel, we look at 
the threats against Taiwan, and who knows what else might crop 
up?
    Starting with you, Secretary, and anyone else.
    Mr. Hill. Certainly. Chairman, I think your previous 
question about the supplemental, there is also $50 billion in 
that that is focusing on industrial base. And that is something 
we have seen, the ability to produce munitions, meet the need, 
is very important. That would be strengthening that.
    Additionally, in the NDAA, there is legislation on 
multiyear procurement. That is another tool we can have to 
improve our Nation's ability to respond rapidly to the rapidly 
changing environments.
    Mr. Lamborn. Did you say $50 billion?
    Mr. Hill. Yep.
    Mr. Lamborn. And what would that go for, as far as you 
know?
    Mr. Hill. There is a variety of investments in the 
industrial base improving capacity. But, certainly, with 
respect to Patriot, other munitions, that is key parts of it, 
and a lot of skilled manufacturing in there.
    Mr. Lamborn. Do either of the rest of you have any 
suggestions on improving our Nation's production?
    Admiral Williams. Yes, sir. I guess I will just add, you 
know, we found tremendous value in cooperative development, 
cooperative production, and foreign military sales. It allows 
the industrial base--it allows three things, right?
    It allows the industrial base to be energized, to include 
potentially foreign-nation industrial base, which was the case 
with, you know, our ally Japan when we did the cooperative 
development for the SM-3 IIA.
    It allows us to control cost even further.
    And then it really allows us to improve on the overall 
integration of the weapons system with our foreign allies, with 
our partners, and the interoperability, as well as the 
industrial-base capacity, the supply chains that all get 
energized from these cooperative developments with these 
foreign military sales, sir.
    Mr. Lamborn. Well, and I am really happy to hear about our 
ongoing cooperation with Japan. They have an excellent 
manufacturing base and creativity and hard work in their 
society. And I just think that that is wonderful, that we are 
partnering with them like that.
    Admiral Williams. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Lamborn. Anything else to add by either of the two 
generals?
    General Gill. Chairman, the only thing I would add is that 
we monitor the total munition requirements of the entirety of 
the force. The Chairman holds a readiness tank quarterly right 
now where we look at the entirety of what we have in the 
inventory, what our consumption rates are, so that we can then 
turn the lever, if need be, particularly as we are providing 
munitions to some of our allies, in the case of Ukraine and 
Israel.
    General Gainey. And, sir, nothing additional to add. Thank 
you.
    Mr. Lamborn. Okay. Very good.
    Thank you all for your answers.
    And I will turn it over to Ranking Member Moulton.
    Mr. Moulton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    MDA has a responsibility to ensure both the sustainment of 
missile defense today and to look ahead to ensure sufficient 
missile defense capabilities into the future.
    Now, this year, MDA is procuring the minimum sustaining 
rate of interceptors for THAAD and Aegis.
    Rear Admiral Williams, do you think MDA has the right 
balance between the money spent on procurement and the money 
spent on RDT&E [research, development, test, and evaluation] to 
ensure we can handle the ever-increasing threat from our 
adversaries?
    Admiral Williams. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. 
Absolutely, I do.
    And I just will say, you know, MDA has various venues and 
vehicles to stay tightly coupled and synchronized with the 
combatant commanders to understand their priorities, their 
needs. We have, you know, a tremendous number of venues and 
vehicles to ensure we stay synchronized with the services. And 
then, when we align with defense planning guidance, with 
resources and our budget, you know, we get together and we 
deliver capability that gets aligned with the Joint Staff's 
global force management process that allocates that.
    And then I will also say, you know, although, you know, our 
budgets may go down for certain production lines, many times 
and in cases like with THAAD, you know, the production line 
gets bolstered with, you know, foreign military sales--and, in 
this case, you know, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is procuring, you 
know, several missile interceptors--that keep that production 
line warm and hot so that, if and when we do have to surge in 
the later part of the FYDP [Future Years Defense Program], we 
can do that, sir.
    Mr. Moulton. Got it.
    Rear Admiral Williams, last year, we visited the Aegis 
Ashore site in Poland, which must have some of the most 
luxurious accommodations for anyone in the United States Navy 
on deployment. As a U.S. Marine, I confused the barracks for a 
five-star resort when I walked in.
    But while the sailors were enjoying their deployments, MDA 
remained over half a decade behind schedule--half a decade--in 
getting the site operational. Given the pace of evolving 
threats today, this is grossly unacceptable.
    But what was particularly shocking to me was learning that 
construction would be completed in what I now understand is a 
week from today, but then the site would not be operational for 
months longer because it was going into a maintenance period.
    Now, forgive my simpleton questions, but I wondered out 
loud why you would immediately go into a maintenance period 
right after you finished construction. And what I was told is 
that the reason is because the software needed to be upgraded, 
all sorts of new systems had to be installed, because the 
original contract was for the old systems.
    So the question I asked was: How much is the American 
taxpayer spending to install an entirely outdated software 
system--and I believe there was a lot of hardware associated 
with it, as well, a network system--only to have it ripped out 
on day one and replaced with an upgraded system? We haven't 
received an answer to that question yet.
    Admiral Williams. Yes, sir. I will find out where we are in 
answering that question.
    I will say this, sir. You know, we have statements of work, 
we have contracts, we have deliverables. And I don't believe, 
you know, the maintenance that we do is as violent as ripping, 
you know, hardware out, although hardware may be replaced. We 
are in a constant----
    Mr. Moulton. Well, whatever it is, we just want to know the 
cost.
    Admiral Williams. Yes, sir. And I will take that for the 
record and get back to you to understand the cost, sir.
    [The information referred to can be found in the Appendix 
on page 69.]
    Mr. Moulton. Thank you.
    A theme we have we have heard in this hearing, already in 
previous hearings, is how overstretched our regional missile 
defense capabilities are.
    Mr. Hill, the administration's Missile Defense Review 
acknowledged regional missile threats were continuing to grow 
and emphasized the need to pace these changes, but it did not 
recommend significant adjustments to U.S. regional missile 
defense posture or force structure.
    Do you believe that is still the correct approach? If no 
force structure changes are needed, could you please describe 
the Department's approach to countering these growing threats?
    Mr. Hill. Yes. Thank you, Ranking Member Moulton.
    In the Missile Defense Review, what we did differently this 
time than in past years was, first, we integrated with the 
National Defense Strategy, wrote them at the same point, 
recognizing that missile defense is fundamentally not something 
separate from the national defense; it is part and parcel of 
that larger whole.
    The second thing we did was we decided that we were not 
going to try and identify in 2022, in a document issued in 
2022, fixed targets for the different things we would be 
needing, but we would be working that through the regular 
process of the program budget review, the global force 
management contingency planning, and we would be adapting what 
we would need each year as we went through the regular 
processes, so that if the demand grows and we have situations 
like we have, we would be flexible and not tied to a document 
that would be published in one year and be static.
    That is the way we have been implementing it.
    Mr. Moulton. Okay.
    And then briefly, General Gill, you talked about this a 
little bit with the chairman, but, as new threats arise, 
sometimes on very short notice--for example, the October 7th 
attack--and a regional, an AOR [area of responsibility] 
commander asks for new capabilities, how do you manage the 
tradeoffs, the process for allocating these missile defense 
capabilities all around the globe?
    General Gill. Thank you, sir. So this gets to the emergent 
Secretary of Defense Orders Book process.
    When a combatant commander has a requirement, they send a 
request for forces into the Joint Staff. We adjudicate it, we 
validate it, we check it for legal and policy implications, and 
then we present the recommendations to the Chairman.
    We always try to take the lens of the immediate problem to 
be solved in the context of this strategy. And that gets to the 
point I made earlier about looking at priority theaters versus 
immediate demand to solve a problem. There is always a balance 
that has to be made. The combatant commanders each provide risk 
statements to us to the proposed courses of action. And then 
the Chairman considers that in his recommendation to the 
Secretary.
    Ultimately, the Secretary of Defense has to make those hard 
choices.
    Mr. Moulton. Mr. Chairman, in your opening statement, you 
talked about how limited our magazines are for missile defense 
all around the world. And, of course, that is due to how 
effectively they have been used.
    But I think we need to dig into a little bit more not just 
how were the tradeoffs that are associated with making these 
allocations, as General Gill just described, but also the fact 
that, you know, there are certain parts of the world, 
especially the Pacific, where we simply need to have a lot of 
missiles ready for deterrence.
    Mr. Lamborn. Absolutely.
    Mr. Moulton. Thank you.
    Mr. Lamborn. Absolutely. I would absolutely agree with 
that.
    And, now, Representative Wilson.
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Chairman Lamborn.
    And Chairman Lamborn was ahead of the curve by bringing up 
about source of attacks. And so, Secretary Hill, this really 
concerns me. We are at a war we did not choose. It is Iran. 
Their puppets--the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas--trained by war 
criminal Putin, are attacking our troops; it was brought to our 
attention yesterday by Lord Cameron, the Foreign Minister of 
U.K., their troops; we have got other allied troops. But they 
are at direct risk of--and we have already had so many 
injuries, but over 70 attacks. And I am very concerned.
    I believe--and back to rules of engagement--that, with the 
capabilities we have, what can we do to, by trajectory and by, 
hey, satellite surveillance--as we wave to the satellite over 
our head today--what can be done to identify the site of the 
attack?
    And why would there not be, as Secretary Panetta has said, 
an immediate response?
    Mr. Hill. Congressman Wilson, you are right to be 
concerned.
    And what is happening, as you are seeing, an awful lot of 
entities--Hamas, Houthis, Lebanese Hezbollah, even Russian 
forces--using equipment provided by Iran. And so the source of 
that equipment, you know, we know it comes from Iran.
    You can see, of course, in any particular physical attack, 
whether it is an attack on Ukraine coming from Russia or an 
attack on Israel coming from Gaza, you can see with the 
overhead. And we can share--we have shared early-warning 
arrangements with many countries around the world----
    Mr. Wilson. But, hey, back specifically, my concern are 
rocket attacks on our forces. And we know----
    Mr. Hill. Yeah.
    Mr. Wilson. --from Yemen or wherever, we know--we should 
know, I hope, the exact site.
    And somehow there should be--back on rules of engagement--
announced that there will be an immediate response within 5 
minutes of once it is identified so that, if it is indeed 
located at a school or a hospital--which they use human 
shields.
    Mr. Hill. Yes.
    Mr. Wilson. The American people need to know that too.
    And so why is there not immediate response? It is 
impressive to attack an empty warehouse, but we need to go 
after--we need to stop it. I just can't visualize--as a father 
of four sons who served in the Middle East, I would be 
disgusted if I had family there now, knowing the level of lack 
of response.
    Mr. Hill. Yeah, I understand what you are saying now.
    The question of what the United States does in response, in 
a striking-back sense, is a question that would go to the 
Secretary of Defense and the President for decisions on that.
    But, certainly, the defensive capabilities we have and that 
we have to support our allies right now, who are responding in 
their contexts, are in place.
    Mr. Wilson. Well, hey, we want President Biden to be 
successful--and Secretary Austin, everybody, and all of you. 
But we need to respond immediately to stop this, because the 
loss of life is really inexcusable.
    And on the rules of engagement, I have never gotten over 
that the sniper at Kabul Airport had the suicide bomber in his 
sights, but rules of engagement prevented saving 13 American 
lives and 276 Afghanis'. And this is setting up, indeed, more 
human shields by not responding right away. And so I hope this 
is done.
    Also, I am really concerned, Admiral Williams, defense of 
the very remarkably strategic American territory of Guam for 
our national security. The Missile Defense Agency is 
responsible to integrate the Army Integrated Air and Missile 
Defense and Navy Aegis ballistic missile defense in support of 
the defense of Guam.
    Is there any additional requirements or resources that the 
Missile Defense Agency may need to ensure the critical function 
is established on Guam? Can you highlight the challenges and 
limitations?
    Admiral Williams. Sir, thank you for the question.
    And, you know, we are aligned to deliver, with our Service 
Acquisition Executive lead, which is the U.S. Army, to deliver 
the INDOPACOM requirement of 360-degree Guam defensive system 
against advanced ballistic missile threats, against hypersonic 
threats, and against cruise missile threats.
    You know, the Missile Defense Agency's portion of the 
defense-of-Guam system is a command and control system, as well 
as the Aegis weapons system that will include the SM-3 and SM-
6, and then that will integrate with the Army's capabilities 
and architecture. And it will start showing up in the 2027 
timeframe per the PB24 [President's Budget Request for 2024] 
budget, sir.
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    Representative Norcross.
    Mr. Norcross. Thank you, Chairman, and for our witnesses 
being here today.
    I want to backtrack a little bit on what both the Ranking 
Member and the Chairman had talked about, and that is our 
industrial base.
    Mr. Hill, how would you assess the condition of our 
domestic industrial base when it comes to the manufacturing of 
these systems?
    Mr. Hill. Broadly, the industrial base is strong, but there 
are weaknesses, as we have seen, in particular areas.
    You know, the point about munitions that I made before. 
What we have seen is, our ability to respond, not just in the 
United States--allies also have seen that their industrial base 
is not prepared to produce what we would want it to produce.
    The supply chains also have vulnerabilities, where there is 
reliance, over-reliance, on foreign sources that aren't as 
assured as we would want them to be.
    So these are areas that need to be addressed. And that is 
some of what is in the supplemental bills, to try and improve 
on those.
    Mr. Norcross. So two issues that you mention--the foreign 
materials that are coming in, it has been years since we have 
identified the vulnerabilities of those. Why would they still 
be a problem with us literally 4 years after we really started 
to look at that problem?
    Mr. Hill. Yeah. The issues of stockpiling taking time. So, 
when you are dealing with critical minerals where you don't 
have the production here locally so you are looking to 
stockpile, that takes some time. The----
    Mr. Norcross. But stockpiling it is above and beyond.
    Mr. Hill. Right.
    Mr. Norcross. I understand that.
    Mr. Hill. So you will also have places where sometimes what 
you are relying on is critical electronic components, where, 
when you are wanting to have your assured production of supply 
chains that you trust, the commercial marketplace that leads to 
where companies make their investment decisions doesn't--it 
leads to them wanting to be producing offshore. So you have to 
work to figure out, where will it be acceptable? Which allies 
will it be from? And which things do I then need to pay the 
extra money to move on shore because the regular marketplace 
that is driven by the commercial demand won't take care of 
that?
    Those are some of the factors that go into the industrial-
base questions. More in the lane of my acquisition and 
industrial-base counterparts. But as I see it from the missile 
defense area, those are the things that relate to the munitions 
concerns that we have.
    Mr. Norcross. You have talked about the additional moneys 
that is going into the industrial base. Can you talk about that 
with a little bit more specificity when it comes to, are we 
looking at materials? Manpower? Industrial capacity?
    Mr. Hill. Yes. All of that needs to be part of it. When you 
are talking about increasing the production rates, you are 
needing to have--that requires more skilled labor. It results 
in more investment in plant and----
    Mr. Norcross. So what are we doing to try to get that 
labor, is the point I am trying to make.
    Mr. Hill. Yeah, that is part of the objective of some of 
the supplemental funding request, is to be able to invest in 
that capacity so you would be able to have more production 
lines working. Am I mis----
    Mr. Norcross. I think we are talking past each other.
    Mr. Hill. Okay.
    Mr. Norcross. How are we recruiting that next generation? 
You are saying there is money there, and I understand that----
    Mr. Hill. Yeah.
    Mr. Norcross. --but where is the money being spent? How are 
we recruiting that next generation of worker?
    Mr. Hill. So that recruitment obviously comes from the 
companies, themselves, who do the hiring. The----
    Mr. Norcross. Well, the--forgive me. This is the point I am 
trying to make: Our industrial base for submarines, very 
focused on that.
    Mr. Hill. I see.
    Mr. Norcross. And what we are doing through Department of 
Defense and certainly through the Navy is helping to recruit 
those. Are we looking at that same model for something as 
critical as this?
    Mr. Hill. I don't know, personally, on that aspect of the 
industrial base. I would be happy to take the question back----
    Mr. Norcross. Okay.
    Mr. Hill. --for my colleagues who do industrial-base 
matters.
    Mr. Norcross. Thank you.
    Real quickly, Admiral Williams, you talked about the 
cooperation with Japan helps control cost. Can you tell us how 
that helps to control the cost?
    Admiral Williams. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Norcross. Or is it the capacity?
    Admiral Williams. Yes, sir. Thank you for the question.
    As we work-share--you know, as we defined our work-share, 
the aspects for--in this case, the example I will give is SM-3 
IIA.
    Mr. Norcross. Right.
    Admiral Williams. You know, Japan took ownership of the 
second- and third-stage rocket motor development. So that was 
their allocation that they were able to invest in, which 
lowered our overall development, NRE, engineering that we, you 
know, did not have to come up with. And, therefore, those costs 
were shared and ultimately lowered the overall----
    Mr. Norcross. So that was the development side, not the 
production side.
    Admiral Williams. Correct. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Norcross. Thank you.
    I am out of time. I yield back.
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    Representative DesJarlais.
    Dr. DesJarlais. Mr. Hill, the Missile Defense Review 
emphasizes the role of allies and partners in regional missile 
defense.
    Can you expand on what this looks like? And how is the 
Department encouraging greater international participation in 
this regards?
    Mr. Hill. Absolutely. In my full written statement, I 
address several of these points.
    One of the things we are doing, in the Indo-Pacific area, 
moving from the immediate fights, with Japan and Korea, we are 
putting in place an ability to do trilateral shared early 
warning. So they both have radars; they can benefit each other. 
As we have been able to benefit them bilaterally, now you are 
having a trilateral arrangement.
    Of course, in the context of immediate fights in Europe, it 
is not just the United States that has been supplying Ukraine. 
Our European allies have provided a tremendous amount, some of 
them larger shares of their GDP [gross domestic product] and 
assistance to Ukraine than what we have been supplying as our 
GDP, even though our aggregate gross number is quite large, of 
course.
    And so, then, in the Middle East, likewise. We are talking 
about where we are deploying; the Gulf countries are some of 
the largest investors in missile defense assets. And, as was 
noted earlier, their demand is one of the things that keeps our 
production base open and warm and available and gives us some 
surge capacity.
    Those are a few examples, sir.
    Dr. DesJarlais. Great. Thank you.
    General Gainey, demand for Patriot and THAAD capabilities 
in recent years has put enormous stress on Army air defenders. 
This is something that I have personally talked about with 
General Karbler on a few occasions.
    Can you talk about how the Army has tried to manage this 
and the steps you all have taken to stabilize the force?
    General Gainey. Sir, thank you for your question 
specifically in that area and focus on our soldiers.
    We have asked a lot of our air and missile defense 
formations, and in every instance they have responded to every 
call. However, the cost has been decreased time home. Right 
now, all of our Patriot units are below the Secretary of 
Defense's red line of deploy 1 year and return home for 2 
years. And so it is having a strain on the force.
    The Army leadership recognizes that strain and, as you 
heard earlier, put in measures through our Health of the Force 
initiative to get after initiatives to help improve areas as 
far as soldiers. And the Joint Staff and the leadership has 
also looked at reducing demand.
    So we were on a glide path to improve deploy-to-dwell 
readiness; however, the global demand again has caused those 
units to fall back below the 1-to-2 red line and will continue 
to be a challenge.
    However, the Army leadership will look at other levers to 
pull within our Health of the Force study to be able to address 
the challenge with our highly deployed force.
    Dr. DesJarlais. What does the training pipeline for this 
capability look like? How long does it take the Army to develop 
a trained air defender?
    General Gainey. Yes, sir. So our officers come in and it is 
about a 6-month school training before they go to a unit. And 
same with our soldiers. Our soldiers are 6 to 9 months they 
will get trained and move off to a unit, execute deployment or 
garrison operations.
    Dr. DesJarlais. Where do the retention rates stand today? 
And so, once you've gotten them in the door, have you made 
progress in retaining them?
    General Gainey. Absolutely. Thank you for that question, 
sir. And, again, important aspect of our ability to assess the 
readiness of our force.
    The retention remains strong. Our largest air missile 
defense formation, the 32nd AAMDC [Army Air and Missile Defense 
Command], leads FORSCOM [U.S. Army Forces Command], a division-
size element, in retention. And all of our units are at the 
Army goals for retention.
    Dr. DesJarlais. Is there anything we can do to support the 
work in this area?
    General Gainey. Sir, we appreciate the continued support 
and the support to the Army modernization. The Army's 
modernization, with the Integrated Battle Command System as the 
cornerstone of our modernization, will allow the branch to 
build capacity and capability against threats.
    The ability to integrate all of our sensors and shooters--
that will provide us the ability to, through one operator, 
leverage the best sensor and best shooter--will allow us to 
reduce the strain on several different organizations deploying 
to one organization.
    And so your support in allowing us to maintain funding in 
that area will be helpful. Thank you, sir.
    Dr. DesJarlais. Yeah.
    Thank you all for your testimony today.
    I yield back.
    Mr. Lamborn. Representative Vasquez.
    Mr. Vasquez. Thank you, Chairman.
    Thank you, Mr. Hill, General Gainey, Admiral Williams, 
General Gill, for taking the time to speak with us this 
morning.
    I represent New Mexico's Second District, and it is the 
proud home of White Sands Missile Range. White Sands is the 
birthplace of America's Michelin space program, beginning as 
the original testing site for the first atomic bomb. It 
continues to serve as the Department of Defense's premier 
research, development, and testing facility to this day.
    White Sands is also home to some of our finest 
servicemembers, contractors, and scientists in this Nation. And 
the research and testing they conduct has been key to 
developing and deploying many of the missile defense systems 
that we have discussed today.
    General Gainey, beyond the contributions that White Sands 
has made to develop and test many of the weapons systems 
currently in our arsenal, how can we ensure that White Sands 
Missile Range continues to be the premier facility that 
fulfills our missile modernization priorities?
    General Gainey. And, sir, thank you for that question. And 
thank you for your support to White Sands. As you know, it is a 
critical component of our testing strategy.
    White Sands will always be a critical part of the testing 
environment because it provides the optimal opportunities for 
us to test our capable systems, not just our current programs 
of record, but also our future programs that are highlighted in 
our modernization strategy--our IBCS [Integrated Battle Command 
System] system and the components that will integrate into 
IBCS; and, also, Increment 3 of our Indirect Fire Protection 
system, where we will start looking at high-power microwave 
capability, directed energy capability, and some of our cyber/
electronic-warfare-type capability. White Sands Missile Range 
provides a great opportunity to test those systems.
    Mr. Vasquez. Thank you, General.
    And as we continue to see these destabilizing global 
events, such as in Ukraine, the Middle East, and escalating 
tensions with other global powers, I strongly believe that it 
is important for the United States to have the most robust 
fighting force possible with the capability to defend our 
Nation. And I have often stated in committee hearings before 
that if we can design it in New Mexico and test it in New 
Mexico, we should also be able to build it in New Mexico.
    So this question is for both Mr. Hill and Admiral Williams. 
What are the advantages, the strategic advantages, of co-
locating missile production capabilities in regions like New 
Mexico, where we already have the research, development, and 
testing, as well as national labs and places like WSMR [White 
Sands Missile Range]?
    Admiral Williams. Thank you for the question, Congressman. 
And I think all three of us have probably spent some time at 
White Sands, and so it is a premier and an incredible range 
that--and testing range that we have all used. We have 
leveraged heavily White Sands for the THAAD and the THAAD 
capabilities, from the development to the incremental upgrades 
that we do to THAAD.
    With respect to the aligning production line in the State 
of New Mexico, you know, from an acquisition perspective, we 
rely on our prime contractors to really determine their optimum 
location for production lines, and so I don't know if I am 
going to be able to answer your question directly.
    I just will say, you know, from our regional defense that 
the Missile Defense Agency is responsible for, our SM-3 class 
of missiles, those interceptors have a production line in 
Redstone Arsenal in Alabama, as well as the THAAD production 
line operated by Lockheed Martin is out of Troy, Alabama.
    In the future, is there possibility to establish a 
production line in the State of New Mexico? Absolutely, but 
that would have to be coordinated with our prime contractors as 
far as optimally, economically, and just ensuring that, you 
know, we manage the cost, schedule, performance, and quality 
coming off that production line.
    Mr. Vasquez. Thank you.
    Mr. Hill.
    Mr. Hill. I wouldn't have too much more to add to what my 
acquisition colleague would say.
    The prime contractors typically are looking very carefully 
at where they to want make their investment decisions, and 
certainly the availability of related types of facilities, 
related expertise is one of the things they take in mind, as 
you have pointed out.
    Mr. Vasquez. Thank you, Mr. Hill.
    And I would just continue to stress that, in economically 
depressed States like New Mexico, having the production 
capability that supports the testing and development of these 
systems is critically important, especially in our rural 
communities.
    And so taking that into account as you are working with 
contractors, more than just ability in existing facilities, but 
also the needs of some of these communities that depend and 
have, for many years, been the backbone of our missile defense 
system is also critically important in those considerations as 
we work with those contractors.
    Thank you so much, Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Lamborn. Representative Strong.
    Mr. Strong. Thank you, Chairman Lamborn.
    It is great to be with each of you again today. Thank you 
for your commitment to the Missile Defense Agency.
    Admiral Williams, I appreciate you taking time to stop by 
my office yesterday. It is always great getting to chat with 
someone who loves Huntsville, Alabama and its role in national 
security. If you think about it, THAAD, SM-3, SM-6, Patriot, 
PAC-3, along with many others--that is Rocket City, USA.
    Congratulations, again, on being able to focus on your 
actual job. And everyone knows how much you love test.
    Admiral Williams. Thank you.
    Mr. Strong. While this hearing is focused on regional 
missile defense, it is important to remember that the threats 
facing the United States do not occur in a vacuum. I agree with 
testimony; THAAD is battle-tested, battle-proven, and we need 
to increase production.
    As the Missile Defense Agency has consistently 
communicated, the missile defense system is an integrated 
architecture of regional and homeland missile defense 
capabilities. Accordingly, it is my belief that we should 
balance our resources appropriately across the architecture.
    Admiral Williams, I am concerned by reports that the 
Department is considering down-selecting to a single design 
earlier than planned for both the Next Generation Interceptor 
and the Glide Phase Interceptor programs.
    I know you cannot comment on predecisional matters, but 
don't you believe a lesson learned from other now-canceled 
portions of the GMD [Ground-based Midcourse Defense] system is 
the importance of maintaining competition, especially earlier 
in the program's development?
    Admiral Williams. Sir, thank you. Thank you for the 
question.
    And, yes, the Missile Defense Agency absolutely embraces, 
endorses the spirit and intent of competition. And I will speak 
to both programs, both the Next Generation Interceptor, NGI, 
and the Glide Phase Interceptor, GPI.
    So, for, you know, NGI, it is a gold standard for 
competition. We are getting the right behavior by the two 
competitors. We have accelerated the original baseline by as 
much as 12 months. We held, you know, a major technical design 
review with one of the offerors 2 months ago, and we are 
holding the first technical design review for the second 
offeror next month, in the month of January. Both offerors are 
performing. I mean, they--and we have really produced an 
incredibly mature design to date.
    And so, yes, you know, for PB24, we are baseline to down-
select after the next major technical design review, known as 
the critical design review. That is the baseline. You know, 
anything beyond that is predecisional.
    But, I guess, I just will offer this: You know, the 
Department has to make hard decisions. Program managers, we 
have to make hard decisions at times. And sometimes you have 
to, you know, really appreciate where risk is and ensure those 
resources are prioritized accordingly.
    Decisions that we make at the Department level will be 
communicated down to the service level and in a very 
transparent way with, obviously, the Congress as well as our 
industrial base. And any down-select that we do, you know, 
ahead of the baseline that is already set will be communicated 
and will be very fair.
    Mr. Strong. Thank you.
    NGI is the future of homeland missile defense, and GPI is 
the only purpose-built program to defend against hypersonic 
threats. We don't have other capabilities in the pipeline if 
these programs fail.
    Are you concerned about the amount of risk this potential 
cost-cutting measure--that it would add?
    Admiral Williams. So, again, sir, I mean, managing risk is 
a day-after-day, week-after-week, month-after-month, year-
after-year, decade-after-decade evolution that we do. We are 
managing that risk appropriately. As I said, with NGI, 
Congressman, we are really satisfied with the performance and 
where we are to date with a very mature design.
    And, again, we will ensure we are communicating with our 
senior leaders if we think we are putting this country and the 
national security of this country in a bad light, in a bad 
space. And that is my job--was my job as the Acting Director, 
but that will be the job of the Director of the Missile Defense 
Agency--to ensure that we continue to, you know, provide that 
constructive feedback and that constructive tension to ensure 
we maximize the national security of this country, sir.
    Mr. Strong. Thank you.
    If the NGI program failed like its predecessor, what would 
that mean for the homeland missile defense? That would be an 
extremely bad thing, and--and I am right. I mean, you know, you 
think about it; we are fortunate there to have both Lockheed 
Martin and Northrop Grumman doing an exceptional job, and I 
think that competition has worked well for our country.
    Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    Representative Garamendi.
    Mr. Garamendi. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Appreciate the testimony. It is extremely useful.
    I have one question for each of you. I would like to start 
with Mr. Gill.
    What is the most important lesson that you have learned 
from the war in Ukraine?
    General Gill. I think the power of a coalition, allies and 
partners, and what we can do if we all come together.
    Mr. Garamendi. Now, translate that into your task now in 
missile defense systems.
    General Gill. So I don't have a particular task in my role 
as the J35 on the Joint Staff. We, however, track all of the 
things we donate as a country and what other countries are 
donating----
    Mr. Garamendi. No, no.
    I am going to be very, very clear, gentlemen. A 2-year test 
of missile defense systems has occurred in Ukraine and is 
continuing to occur. My question to you is, what is the single 
most important thing that you have learned from that 2-year war 
with regard to missile defense?
    Mr. Gill.
    General Gill. Congressman, I think----
    Mr. Garamendi. So it is the integration? Is that it?
    General Gill. No, I am going to talk to you about the 
effectiveness of the weapons system.
    So we have donated Patriots to the Ukrainians. We haven't 
shot a Patriot in 20 years. The Ukrainians have used it very 
effectively against the Russian missile attacks. So I think we 
are----
    Mr. Garamendi. So, going forward, more Patriots.
    General Gill. I think we are seeing very effective use of 
it.
    Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
    Let's go on down the line.
    Admiral Williams. Yes, sir. And if I could, you know, the 
missile defense, you know, contributions to the war in Ukraine 
is mainly through analysis and support with information, but if 
I could, I will pivot into the Israeli conflict.
    And I think the lessons learned with our Israeli allies is 
critical with the integration of the weapons system writ large, 
with the various subsystems of the Arrow, of David's Sling, of 
Iron Dome, to integrate effectively for one, you know, complete 
command-and-control picture so that they can, you know, select 
the optimum, you know, missile system to engage the threats, 
whether they are coming from Gaza with, you know, rockets or 
from the Houthis, you know, originating out of Yemen with a 
ballistic missile shot, sir.
    Mr. Garamendi. Thank you.
    Mr. Gainey. General. Excuse me.
    General Gainey. Sir, thank you.
    And in my role as the joint counter-UAS [unmanned aerial 
systems] office executive agent for the Army, we have looked 
extensively at the Ukraine conflict. And I can tell you that 
the use of drones and how we are seeing drones being utilized 
in that conflict and other conflict highlights the need for an 
integrated approach, netting all your sensors and shooters 
together, so that when you are faced with the appropriate 
threat, you are able to leverage the appropriate effector 
against, whether it is a drone, cruise missile, or a tactical 
ballistic missile.
    And this is how the Army is moving forward with the Army 
modernization--taking our Integrated Battle Command System, 
netting our sensors into that capability, and then have an 
effector where you can shoot a Coyote interceptor, a counter-
drone interceptor--low-cost--or you can shoot an IFPC [indirect 
fire protection capability] cruise missile capability or a 
Patriot interceptor, all integrated into one common system.
    And I think, from what we learned in this conflict, it is 
validating our approach as we move forward.
    Mr. Garamendi. Mr. Hill.
    Mr. Hill. Sir, a couple points on the key thing.
    First, integrated air and missile defense is why Ukraine 
remains sovereign. And our alliances are defending interests 
that are fundamental to American national interests.
    In Israel, integrated air and missile defense has given 
Israel options, as was mentioned, I think, in the ranking 
member's testimony, not just to have to always just hit back 
immediately. They have options. It is very important in that 
sense.
    The investments that we need to continue making--and, 
frankly, we need to improve our industrial base ability to 
support that--are fundamental to the credibility of our 
commitments around the world that are in our fundamental 
national interests.
    Mr. Garamendi. That is fine.
    Mr. Hill. Thank you, sir.
    Mr. Garamendi. Now, in the next 49 seconds, what do you 
need from us to do what each one of you said is the most 
important and that is the integration of the existing systems 
that we have? What do you need?
    We have $106 billion supplemental that speaks to part of 
this, we have the NDAA out there, and we have the 
appropriations out there. Do you have in those pieces of 
legislation what you need to achieve what you have said is your 
principal lesson that you have learned?
    Mr. Hill, this is your turf. Yes or no, do you have it? And 
if not, why not?
    Mr. Hill. Yes, in those and in full appropriations, sir. 
Those are the things that we need. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Garamendi. Between the two--that is, the supplemental 
and the NDAA?
    Mr. Hill. Yeah, the supplemental, the multiyear procurement 
that is in the NDAA, for example. And regular appropriations 
are just fundamental to doing the business of the Defense 
Department.
    Mr. Garamendi. Then I shall focus my time on what you 
gentlemen have suggested we spend--that you are spending your 
time on.
    Thank you.
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    Representative Houlahan.
    Ms. Houlahan. Thank you, Chairman.
    And thank you, gentlemen, for being here. I apologize for 
being late. I hope that these questions haven't already been 
asked, and if so, I apologize for that as well.
    I serve as one of the people on the Quality of Life panel, 
one of the leads on that panel. And I know Rep. Bacon would 
probably ask the same sorts of questions.
    General Gainey, you mentioned a little bit about 
recruiting, retention, the OPTEMPO, how long people are being 
deployed for, and that you were happy with retention rates. But 
I was wondering if you could kind of go into some of the 
quality-of-life improvements that perhaps you have been making 
and if there are any further ones that we should be focused on 
the quality-of-life panel.
    General Gainey. Absolutely, ma'am. And thank you for that 
question.
    And that was one of the areas that I wanted to highlight 
when I highlighted my answer earlier, that support to the 
quality-of-life programs will also be a critical part to 
continue the improvement in getting after the health-of-force 
initiatives.
    The air and missile defense formations, as I highlighted 
earlier, are the most deployed formations in the Army. And, 
several times, those systems are deployed early into an 
environment, and the quality-of-life facilities aren't in place 
for the soldiers as they deploy into those locations, and they 
are often built around the unit. And so, over time, the 
quality-of-life initiatives arrive.
    However, as we build our defense-of-Guam Army architecture, 
we are looking at MILCON [military construction] and quality of 
life on the forefront. And we can use your help in ensuring 
that we get the MILCON funding so that when our soldiers move 
into the defense of Guam to occupy their systems, that they 
have quality-of-life initiatives in place to support them.
    Ms. Houlahan. That is very helpful.
    My next question is for DASD [Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense] Hill, but I am actually quite interested in 
everybody's response. And, again, apologies if this has been 
asked.
    I was listening to some conversation about Ukraine. But, 
DASD Hill, you wrote in your testimony and emphasized the 
importance of continued support of Ukraine and that this has 
been essential in their successful campaign against Russia and 
keeping their sovereignty.
    As you probably are following, this is pretty contentious 
here on the Hill. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a 
little bit on why you think it is so important to continue to 
support Ukraine.
    Mr. Hill. Ukraine is fighting NATO's and America's battle. 
They are facing a threat from Russia, from Moscow, Putin, that 
is the same threat that we decided over 75 years ago we were 
going to stand up against.
    Ukraine has demonstrated that you can't put over-reliance 
on hoping that somebody has changed their ways, and they are 
paying a terrible price for it.
    Our commitment to Ukraine demonstrates the credibility of 
the commitments we make all around the world. And standing up 
and supporting Ukraine in that fight is standing up and 
supporting American national interest.
    Ms. Houlahan. And in relevance to this particular hearing, 
are you aware of any outstanding requests that they have for 
missile systems that are unaddressed right now?
    Mr. Hill. The concern is what needs to be funded yet to 
come. That is the biggest part of it. My colleagues may have 
many more specifics on that, but I think it is what is yet to 
come and needing that continued funding to keep the 
sustainment.
    Ms. Houlahan. Do you all have things to offer there?
    General Gill. Yes, Congresswoman.
    So we track every bullet, every missile that we send to 
Ukraine, and we track a burnout date. We are going to get to a 
point where we can't keep up the production level with what our 
contributions are. And so, you know, in terms of providing them 
more, we are going to get to a point where we are not going to 
be able to deliver.
    So it gets a little bit to the conversation about the 
industrial base and making sure that the industrial base is 
producing at pace, but it is also some funding.
    Ms. Houlahan. Do you also share the perspective that we 
need to continue funding Ukraine and their battle?
    General Gill. I absolutely agree with Mr. Hill's point. 
This is our credibility as a Western Nation that believes in, 
you know, the rule of law. So I do, yes, ma'am.
    Ms. Houlahan. Thank you.
    And, gentlemen, anything further in that subject?
    Admiral Williams. Nothing further to add from me, ma'am. 
Thank you.
    Ms. Houlahan. Excellent. Thank you.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Lamborn. Thank you.
    I want to thank all the witnesses for your very helpful 
testimony. I think members have asked a lot of excellent 
questions as well.
    Because of impending votes, we won't be having a second 
round of questions and we won't be having a closed hearing, so 
the subcommittee is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 10:14 a.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

=======================================================================

      

             RESPONSE TO QUESTION SUBMITTED BY MR. MOULTON

    Admiral Williams. On December 15, 2023, Aegis Ashore Poland was 
officially accepted by the Navy for operational tasking. As with all 
new afloat (and Aegis Ashore) weapon systems platform construction 
efforts, and similar to the Aegis Ashore Romania delivery and 
employment timeline, Aegis Ashore Poland has been scheduled for a 
follow-on Chief of Naval Operations sponsored Selected Restricted 
Availability for maintenance and modernization.
    The original Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and 
Intelligence (C4I) network Integrated Shipboard Network Systems for 
Aegis Ashore Poland was procured in 2011 at a cost of $3 million (M), 
with the intent of deploying that system in 2018. The CANES system was 
immature in that timeframe.
    In coordination with the Navy, the following systems will be 
upgraded to modernize the C4I network, totaling $11.34M ($6.93M in 
procurement costs; $4.41M in manpower installation costs).
    1. CANES at a procurement cost of $4.8M. 2. Global Positioning 
Navigation and Timing System at a procurement cost of $1.31M. 3. 
Automated Digital Network System at a procurement cost of $0.82M.
    Post-delivery modernization availabilities address C4I system 
upgrades and enhancements to address obsolescence, new required 
capabilities and security enhancements. These key upgrades will enhance 
the warfighter's ability to defend the theater with the most up-to-date 
C4I capabilities to include improvements in the Cyber Security posture, 
network applications, and command and control capacity throughput. Upon 
completion of this availability, both Aegis Ashore Poland and Romania, 
will be outfitted with the most capable, interoperable, and secure C4I 
systems employed in our afloat and ashore platforms today.   [See page 
12.]

                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. LAMBORN

    Mr. Lamborn. The Missile Defense Review also emphasized the role of 
allies and partners in regional missile defense; how is the Department 
encouraging greater international participation in this regard and what 
opportunities for co-production and co-development is the Department 
exploring?
    Mr. Hill. [No answer was available at the time of publication.]
    Mr. Lamborn. What demand signal have you seen from partners about 
these capabilities, particularly since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine?
    Mr. Hill. [No answer was available at the time of publication.]
    Mr. Lamborn. Can you please provide us with an update on timing for 
launching HBTSS. What steps are your offices taking to ensure prompt 
fielding?
    Mr. Hill. [No answer was available at the time of publication.]
    Mr. Lamborn. Demand for Patriot and THAAD capabilities in recent 
years has put enormous stress on Army air defenders; can you talk about 
how the Army has tried to manage this and the steps it's taken to 
stabilize the force? Specifically, what is the current dwell time for 
these units and how retention rates?
    General Gainey. Please see accompanying document. 
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7564.036
    
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Lamborn. What does the training pipeline for these 
capabilities look like? How long does it take the Army to develop a 
trained air defender, and are there challenges to growing the force?
    General Gainey. To create a Patriot Soldier, it takes between 17 to 
29 weeks depending on the Soldier's specialty within the unit. For 
Soldiers assigned to a THAAD unit, they attend a follow-on course that 
is THAAD specific adding between 3 to 10 weeks of additional training. 
Patriot and THAAD units contain 3 of the 5 ADA MOSs (14E, 14H, and 
14T).
    Mr. Lamborn. Can you please explain the timeline for the fielding 
of an 8th THAAD battery?
    General Gainey. THAAD Battery #8 is stationed at Fort Bliss, TX. 
The battery will begin fielding the THAAD system in FY25, with a 
projected operational availability date of FY27.
    Mr. Lamborn. Mr. Lamborn. Can you talk about the beneficial role 
international partners play on impact international partners have on 
your programs, whether through co-development efforts or Foreign 
Military Sales?
    General Gainey. International Partners are instrumental to Army 
programs and often leveraged through various Security Cooperation 
tools, including cooperative research and development, and via Security 
Assistance (Foreign Military Sales (FMS), etc.). Co-production and co-
development optimizes both US and foreign industrial bases, decreases 
weapons systems cost through economies of scale, and shapes future 
shared supply chains by increasing production capacity and shortening 
lead times for critical supply items. In addition, FMS is critical to 
building a partner's capacity in today's complex global security 
environment, while promoting interoperability and providing the added 
benefit of maintaining production lines during times of decreased US 
requirements.
    Mr. Lamborn. How is the Missile Defense Agency shaping its 
management of Aegis and THAAD programs to ensure there's sufficient 
interceptor production capacity to meet requirements for the defense of 
Guam without taking from other missions?
    General Gainey. [No answer was available at the time of 
publication.]
    Mr. Lamborn. How important is it to expand production capacity for 
the Patriot MSE missile to be able to meet this and other emerging 
challenges?
    General Gainey. Increasing production capacity is an area that is 
very important to the Army. The Army has awarded a contract that 
increases production capacity of PAC-3 MSE to 550 annually, with 
deliveries at that rate beginning in FY25. However, forecasted US 
government and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) demand through FY 28 
exceeds 650. As Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) threats continue to 
expand it is reasonable to assume that demand for the Patriot system 
will continue to grow annually. The continued proliferation of PATRIOT 
will be integral to other integrated air-defense systems and expanding 
capacity of interceptors will be required to meet expanding US Army 
Total Munition Requirements as well as the high FMS demand. 
Accordingly, the Army is evaluating the need to expand production 
further.
    Mr. Lamborn. Can you talk about the beneficial role international 
partners play on impact international partners have on your programs, 
whether through co-development efforts or Foreign Military Sales?
    Admiral Williams. As highlighted in the 2022 Missile Defense 
Review, America's alliances and partnerships around the world are one 
of its greatest assets. In line with federal law and Department of 
Defense (DoD) policy and priorities, MDA actively engages on 
international cooperative efforts to benefit the United States (U.S.) 
and our allies and partners. These efforts build and strengthen 
security relationships to promote U.S. security interests, while 
developing allies' and partners' capabilities for self-defense and 
multi-national operations.
    FMS provides our allies and partners with highly effective U.S.-
developed systems, which in many cases augment and support American 
warfighters and reduce regional demand on U.S. units and systems. FMS 
systems provide defense capability for our international partners that 
are largely interoperable with U.S. assets and reduce the cost for DoD 
acquisition through economies of scale. In the maritime realm, the U.S. 
has sold Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IA, IB, and IIA to Japan via 
FMS by exercising priced options on multiple U.S. contracts. While 
specific savings to the U.S. and FMS customer depend on various 
factors, the additional FMS quantities help to maximize the efficiency 
of the SM-3 production lines to achieve the best unit price.
    In the land domain, the U.S. has sold Terminal High Altitude Area 
Defense (THAAD) to United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia (KSA). The U.S. was able to procure an eighth THAAD battery more 
quickly and affordably due to FMS re-opening cold production lines and 
paying down obsolescence. Through previous synergized buys with two FMS 
customers, KSA and UAE, the U.S. has procured THAAD interceptors for 
approximately $1-2 million less per unit. Another benefit of FMS is the 
increased opportunity to demonstrate the utility and operational use of 
U.S. systems, further proving to the world their effectiveness. For 
example, the UAE has executed the only operational intercept using 
THAAD.
    Through international agreements with our partners, cooperative 
development and co-production allows cost sharing and technology 
contributions to develop and field current and future capabilities for 
the U.S. and our partners. The MDA and Japan cooperatively developed 
the SM-3 Block IIA, with Japan investing $1 billion. Japan produces 
approximately 50 percent of the missile hardware. The success of the 
SM-3 Block IIA Cooperative Development Project helped lead the United 
States and Japan to agree to cooperatively develop the Glide Phase 
Interceptor (GPI), announced by President Biden and Prime Minister 
Kishida in August 2023.
    This project is the only effort under development that contests 
hypersonic threats in the glide phase. While project arrangement 
negotiations for GPI are not complete, MDA anticipates a significant 
cost benefit to the U.S. The U.S. and Israel co-develop and produce the 
David's Sling and Arrow Weapon Systems. The U.S. provides $500 million 
for Israeli Cooperative Programs, including $80 million in procurement 
support for the Iron Dome Defense Systems. These three systems have 
demonstrated multiple combat intercepts in recent months, providing 
critical protection to the citizens of Israel.
    In addition to FMS, International Partnering provides focused 
maturity to various Science and Technology (S&T) critical areas 
allowing MDA to capitalize on the technical expertise of Allies, 
Friends and Partners. These S&T partnerships serve to further 
accelerate development of critical missile defense technologies.
    Mr. Lamborn. How is the Missile Defense Agency shaping its 
management of Aegis and THAAD programs to ensure there's sufficient 
interceptor production capacity to meet requirements for the defense of 
Guam without taking from other missions?
    Admiral Williams. The current Terminal High Altitude Area Defense 
(THAAD) Program has the capacity to produce up to 8 interceptors per 
month for a total of 96 per yearly lot buy and the ability to direct 
Lockheed Martin to surge to up to 12 interceptors per month, for a 
total of 144 per yearly lot buy with 24-month advance notice required. 
This approach will ensure sufficient THAAD interceptor production 
capacity for both the defense of Guam and other contractual 
obligations.
    The Sea-Based Weapon Systems (Aegis) Standard Missile (SM)-3 
Program has the capacity to produce up to 24 SM-3 Block IIA All Up 
Rounds (AUR), and up to 52 SM-3 Blk IB AURs annually. That capacity is 
used to fulfill both United States (U.S.) Government and Foreign 
Military Sales (FMS) partner demands. The combination of U.S. and FMS 
procurements planned through Fiscal Year (FY) 2027 consume the entire 
SM-3 Block IIA production capacity in that timeframe, while the SM-3 
Block IB production line has capacity beyond currently planned 
procurements. The prime contractor has the existing capacity to surge 
one additional missile per quarter of each block, for a limited period 
of time. Any sustained increase above the maximum production rates 
listed above would require capital investment and a three year lead 
time to bring production equipment online at Raytheon and sub-tier 
suppliers.
    The SM-6 Blk I/IA Program is under contract with Raytheon to 
deliver 29 Blk I and 96 Blk IA AURs per year. Capacity surges on the 
SM-6 program's production line is capable as long as there is a steady 
flow of hardware to support. There are multiple programs that utilize 
Raytheon Redstone Missile Integration Facility, which affects overall 
capacity and rate, but ideally, SM-6 production should be able to surge 
without affecting other missions/contractual obligations with an 
alternative quantity mix of Blk I and IA builds. SM-6 Blk IA Upgrade 
(IAU) is currently in development and does not have a production 
contract. Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems 3 is 
planning for initial deliveries to occur beginning in FY 2028. 
Expecting SM-6 Blk IAU to maintain similar production capacities and 
surge capabilities as what is currently being produced for SM-6 
variants.
    The Missile Defense Agency is not funded to procure missiles 
specifically for the Defense of Guam mission and because of multiple 
operational commitments for missiles, the allocation of missile 
inventory will be via the Global Force management process.
    Mr. Lamborn. Can you discuss MDA's efforts to integrate Patriot and 
THAAD capabilities, and the operational benefit this additional 
capability will bring?
    Admiral Williams. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) 
System Build 4.0 was developed for United States Indo-Pacific Command 
(USINDOPACOM) Joint Emergent Operational Need PC-0021 and encompasses 
all of the following capabilities:
    <bullet>  THAAD Remote Launcher: This capability increases the 
THAAD defended area and improves defense against specific regional 
threat concerns.
    <bullet>  Patriot Launch on Remote (THAAD): Increases the Patriot-
defended area and engagement opportunities by allowing the Missile 
Segment Enhancement (MSE) Interceptor to leverage the highly effective 
THAAD Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillence-2.
    <bullet>  Initial THAAD/MSE Integration: Improves THAAD self-
defense without requiring a dedicated Patriot Battery, expands defended 
area, and increases engagement opportunities, while conserving THAAD 
interceptors by adding MSE launchers and MSE missiles as a component of 
the THAAD Weapon System.
    Both USINDOPACOM Batteries received THAAD System Build 4.0. In 
Calendar Year (CY) 2024 the THAAD Project Office and the U.S. Army will 
continue to coordinate fielding to the remaining 5 Batteries; subject 
to Battery availability.
    In 1Q CY2024, the THAAD Project Office will review Critical Design 
Review-level content for THAAD System Build 5.0. THAAD System Build 5.0 
contains improvements for Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC)-3 MSE Cold 
Fire Prevention, the PAC-3 MSE Electronic Thermally Initiated Venting 
System, software improvements for PAC-3 MSE Manual Emplacement, updates 
to the PAC-3 MSE fire control contained within the THAAD Fire Control, 
and improvements in the management of Patriot Launch on Remote THAAD 
for radar prioritization and resource usage. In 4Q CY2024, the THAAD 
Project Office will begin integrating the final engineering release of 
THAAD 5.0 software into the Government-run hardware in the loop 
laboratory at Redstone Arsenal in preparation for the Missile Defense 
Agency system-level testing in CY2025.
    In 3Q CY2024, the THAAD Project Office plans to award Long Lead 
Systems Engineering requirements for THAAD System Build 6.0. THAAD 
System Build 6.0 initially planned for delivery in 2032, has been 
accelerated to deliver in December 2027, in response to emerging 
Warfighter needs and will include additional THAAD/MSE Integration 
upgrades as well as provide the initial capability against non-
ballistic threats, increase the Threat Engagement Space and improve 
THAAD Integrated Battle Command System Integration via Link-16.
    Mr. Lamborn. Can you please provide us with an update on timing for 
launching HBTSS. What steps are your offices taking to ensure prompt 
fielding?
    Admiral Williams. The two Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Hypersonic 
and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) prototype demonstrator 
space vehicles (SVs) are completing final functional testing and are 
manifested on U.S. Space Force (USSF) -124 for launch on February 14, 
2024, from Cape Canaveral, Florida. USSF-124 will carry the two MDA 
HBTSS SVs and four USSF/Space Development Agency Wide Field of View 
SVs. The February 14, 2024, launch represents a 4.5 month delay in 
previous program plans to launch at the end of Q4FY23. This delay is 
specific to one HBTSS vendor, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NGC), 
experiencing a technical issue with sensor pointing functionality. 
NGC's SV will launch in a partially degraded configuration in order to 
support timely collection of data to anchor models supporting 
development, fielding, and operation of the Space Force's Proliferated 
Warfighting Space Architecture. The technical issue has been mitigated 
through work-arounds to an acceptable level of risk, independently 
verified, to meet HBTSS program objectives to demonstrate latency, 
sensitivity, and quality of service for engaging hypersonic threats.
    Mr. Lamborn. What are MDA's plans to test and ensure HBTSS sensors 
are properly calibrated to track realistic hypersonic once it is in 
orbit?
    Admiral Williams. Launch of the two HBTSS prototype demonstration 
SVs will be followed by the Launch and Early Orbit Testing (LEOT) 
period. This early on-orbit testing is conducted by the Performers and 
overseen by the HBTSS Program Office, and it serves to ensure the 
prototype demonstration SVs are properly calibrated to track hypersonic 
and ballistic threats while on orbit. LEOT will be followed by on-orbit 
testing, utilizing the MDA Integrated Master Test Plan (IMTP), non-IMTP 
partner flight test events, and Targets of Opportunity to test, 
characterize, and validate the HBTSS performance. Following the 
successful demonstration of HBTSS capabilities, the responsibility for 
HBTSS operational fielding will be transferred to United States Space 
Force and MDA will continue the development of the next generation of 
space-based fire-control sensors for missile defense.

                  QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. CARBAJAL
    Mr. Carbajal. General Gainey, Can you discuss what the Army is 
doing to improve recruiting and retention for Air Defense?
    And, can you touch on how the Army is providing predictability to 
soldiers and their families as the increase in requests for Air Defense 
deployments are on the rise?
    General Gainey. Recruiting and Retention efforts for 14-Series: The 
Army has placed Non-Prior Service (NPS) accessions and Retention 
incentives on all 5 ADA MOSs. A decisive increase in an Enlistment 
bonus for 4--6 years could significantly impact the branch's immediate 
need for NPS recruits and would provide the stability needed to 
maintain a healthy Air Defense force in the near-term. Additionally, an 
increase in retention bonuses for every MOS in Career Management Field 
(CMF) 14 would ensure that ADA retains the human capital and experience 
required for the future in the long-term. Average Dwell Time for ADA 
Soldiers by AAMDC: 10th AAMDC (Europe)--between 8 and 15 months over 
the last 3 years 32nd AAMDC (CONUS/CENTCOM)--between 11 and 15 months 
over the last 3 years 94th AAMDC (PACOM)--between 23 and 27 months over 
the last 3 years
    Mr. Carbajal. Can you briefly describe the training pipeline for 
Army Air Defenders?
    How long does it take to develop these individuals, and do you 
anticipate any challenges with growing that force to the anticipated 
levels needed?
    General Gainey. To create a Patriot Soldier, it takes between 17 to 
29 weeks depending on the Soldier's specialty within the unit. For 
Soldiers assigned to a THAAD unit, they attend a follow-on course that 
is THAAD specific adding between 3 to 10 weeks of additional training. 
Patriot and THAAD units contain 3 of the 5 ADA MOSs (14E, 14H, and 
14T).

                    QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. WALTZ
    Mr. Waltz. Is it important to have China's missile capabilities 
integrated into US arms control frameworks like New Start? Is this 
something the administration is pursuing? Will DOD advocate for 
reauthorizing New Start when it comes up again without Chinese 
involvement?
    <bullet>  Which countries are most militarily important for basing 
theater missile defense sites? Have you begun discussions with them? 
How are those discussions going?
    Mr. Hill. [No answer was available at the time of publication.]
    Mr. Waltz. The plan for building out a layered missile defense plan 
in the Pacific relies on bringing onboard systems like Terminal High 
Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Patriot Advanced Capability, and our BMD 
ships.
    <bullet>  Can you be more specific about where the land-based 
systems will be stationed, and the expected footprint of the 
deployments?
    <bullet>  Given the size of China's Strategic Rocket Forces and our 
own limited footprint, what is the US employment strategy for theater 
force posture--delaying the effects of an attack, blocking parts of an 
attack, or deterring an attack on the most critical US sites?
    <bullet>  What will be the role of hypersonic missiles I this plan, 
and what is the current status of their integration in what I hope is 
an evolving integrated air and missile defense system that is robust, 
survivable, and increasingly agile?
    Mr. Hill. [No answer was available at the time of publication.]
    Mr. Waltz. COCOM demand for BMD ships and carrier escort duties and 
independent deployments can very easily outstrip supply, and excessive 
COCOM request for forces often does.
    <bullet>  How will the Pentagon manage BMD ships as strategic 
national assets to prioritize and achieve high readiness for the at-
sea, mobile part of the layered defense which is arguably among the 
most survivable--are additional request for Forces putting pressure on 
readiness of the force, missile inventory flexibility, and 
prioritizations within the Global Force Management Plan (GFMAP)?
    Mr. Hill. [No answer was available at the time of publication.]
    Mr. Waltz. Over the last several weeks we have seen multiple 
attacks emanate from the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels targeting Israel, 
including drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. We have also 
seen attacks from Yemen targeting maritime shipping in the Red Sea. 
U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria also continue to be attacked in various 
escalations.
    <bullet>  Can you please detail to the committee the extent of the 
Houthi threat on freedom of navigation?
    <bullet>  What missile and drone capabilities do the Houthis 
currently have and to what extent are those capabilities indigenous as 
opposed to directly abetted by Iran?
    <bullet>  To what extent are Houthi threats affecting our allies? 
How do you assess our ability to protect them in a complex threat 
arena?
    Mr. Hill. [No answer was available at the time of publication.]
    Mr. Waltz. It is critical that Congress quickly approve the 
supplemental aid package to Israel. Israel has already faced thousands 
of rockets from Hamas and has used many of its Iron Dome interceptors. 
If Iranian-proxy Hezbollah gets involved, Israel could face hundreds of 
thousands of rockets. It is critical that Israel have enough Iron Dome 
interceptors as well as other military supplies to deter Hezbollah from 
joining the conflict and continue to defend themselves against Hamas.
    I understand the administration needs Congressional action to lift 
the statutory limits on the value of arms that can be placed in the 
stockpile. Can you discuss the state of the U.S. war reserve stockpile 
in Israel?
    Mr. Hill. [No answer was available at the time of publication.]
    Mr. Waltz. Israel is in the midst of a war that is testing the 
limits of its multilayered missile defense architecture. Pursuant to 
the U.S.-Israel Memorandum of Understanding on Security Assistance, the 
U.S. invests $500 million annually for development and procurement of 
the Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Arrow systems, all which Israel has 
needed to use during the course of the ongoing war.
    <bullet>  In your assessment, how have the various missile defense 
systems Israel has in place have performed so far during the course of 
the ongoing war with Hamas?
    <bullet>  Since the outbreak of the war, the U.S. has deployed 
significant missile defense assets to the region to protect Israel and 
deter a broader conflagration. Can you please detail those additional 
assets deployed to the region and assess their performance thus far, as 
much as possible in this setting?
    <bullet>  To the extent possible, can you discuss how our missile 
defense cooperation with Israel has served U.S. national security 
interests?
    <bullet>  What else should we be doing to ensure we can continue to 
support our allies?
    <bullet>  What are your thoughts on an integrated regional missile 
defense architecture in the Middle East?
    Mr. Hill. [No answer was available at the time of publication.]
    Mr. Waltz. COCOM demand for BMD ships and carrier escort duties and 
independent deployments can very easily outstrip supply, and excessive 
COCOM request for forces often does.

    General Gill. Determining missile defense requirements for one 
Combatant Command given the many competing global priorities remains a 
dynamic process with a variety of time sensitive considerations. 
Maintaining the right posture for missile defense in a given region 
depends primarily on the baseline priorities laid out in national level 
guidance. But, other considerations, such as the likelihood and 
magnitude of the assessed threat, the implications to our relationships 
with allies and partners, our ability to provide alternative defensive 
options (such as passive defense actions), the location and capability 
of alternate missile defense forces, including allies and partners, and 
potential sustainment implications are all weighed in the decision 
process. Additionally, the availability of assigned missile defense 
forces to a Combatant Commander provides forces that can be moved 
internally by the Commander to meet specific local missile defense 
needs. USINDOPACOM has the largest missile defense force assigned 
outside of crisis allocation.

                   QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. VASQUEZ
    Mr. Vasquez. Recently, there have been discussions about adding 
Counter--Drone/Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) capabilities on 
military installations. However, I'm aware that current policy does not 
allow DOD to engage drone threats. What authorities would DOD need to 
be permitted to use C-UAS capabilities on a military installation to 
defeat, deter, or disrupt UAS intrusions?
    General Gainey. Thank you for your recent inquiry and demonstrated 
concern relating to the Department's legal authorities and associated 
policies underpinning DoD's ability to protect our Homeland 
installations, assets, and personnel from the threats posed by unmanned 
aircraft systems (UAS). The Department currently possesses the legal 
authority to protect its Homeland installations from threats posed by 
UAS; however, this authority is limited in scope to certain covered 
facilities or assets, the majority of which will expire in 2026.
    The deployment of counter-UAS (C-UAS) capabilities across DoD 
installations is based on Service Secretary and Global Priority List 
(GPL) prioritization factors. The Department's domestic C-UAS 
authority, 10 U.S.C.Sec. 130i, Protection from Unmanned Aircraft 
Threats, provides DoD with the statutory authority to protect its 
Homeland ``covered facilities or assets'' from threats posed by UAS to 
their safety or security. The statute allows appropriately trained DoD 
uniformed and civilian personnel to engage in C-UAS activities to 
detect, identify, track, and monitor UAS posing a potential threat to 
DoD covered facilities and assets.
    It further authorizes these personnel, where appropriate, to 
disrupt the control of, exercise control over, seize, confiscate, or 
use reasonable force necessary to disable, damage, or destroy threat 
UAS. The statute limits the Secretary's authority to designate Homeland 
``covered facilities or assets'' to those directly relating to one of 
nine distinct mission areas, namely: nuclear deterrence and nuclear 
command, control, and communications (NC3); missile defense; national 
security space; assistance in Presidential or Vice Presidential 
protection; air defense of the United States, to include the National 
Capital Region integrated air defense system (NCR IADS); combat support 
agencies; special operations activities; production, storage, 
transportation, or decommissioning of high-yield explosive munitions; 
and the DoD's Major Range and Test Facilities.
    The Department has previously proposed expanding the section 130i 
authority to, among other things, identify additional mission areas for 
designation of covered facilities and assets, as well as to extend the 
expiration date of this authority. Additionally, the CJCS Standing 
Rules of Engagement and Standing Rules for the Use of Force for US 
Forces, CJCSI 3121.01, provides commanders of the Department's Homeland 
installations the authority to exercise the inherent right of self-
defense--which is to say, to utilize that force which is reasonably 
necessary under the circumstances to defend DoD personnel and critical 
assets against physical attacks.
