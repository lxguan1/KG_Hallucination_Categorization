                  THE SAHEL IN CRISIS: EXAMINING U.S.



                             POLICY OPTIONS

                              ----------                              


                       Tuesday, December 5, 2023

                  House of Representatives,
                            Subcommittee on Africa,
                              Committee on Foreign Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:59 p.m., in 
room 210, House Visitor Center, Hon. John James
    (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
    Mr. James. The Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on 
Africa will come to order.
    The purpose of this hearing is to examine the current State 
of United States foreign policy in the Sahel. The chair 
announces that he may recess the committee at any point. 
Without objection, so ordered. I now recognize myself for an 
opening statement.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JOHN JAMES

    The Sahel region of Africa is undeniably in crisis and has 
become the global hotspot for Islamist extremism. In 2022, the 
region accounted for 43 percent of global terrorism deaths, up 
from 1 percent in 2007. Roughly one out of every three people 
who call this region home need humanitarian assistance.
    Rule of law is floundering and there have been no fewer 
than seven military power grabs since 2020. Russia has 
exploited this instability, primarily through the Wagner Group, 
to gain geopolitical influence, expand access to the de-
dollarized assets like gold mines, and pressure NATO's southern 
flank.
    At the same time, United Nations-led peacekeeping missions 
are failing to deliver while anti-French sentiments driven by 
missteps in French policies and magnified by adversaries have 
created a crisis of confidence about Paris' future role and 
policy toward the region.
    We have seen that a military response alone will not 
address counterterrorism, democratic backsliding, and rising 
anti-Western sentiment. We must have a strong coordinated U.S. 
response that appropriately balances our diplomatic, 
development, and defense efforts to build partner countries' 
capacity to address the root causes of their growing list of 
problems.
    We know that retrenching and an isolationist policy will 
not make these problems go away. In fact, it will make them 
worse, which is why I've called this hearing today to speak 
about the increasingly dire situations in Sudan, Chad, Niger, 
Mali, and Burkina Faso.
    Sudan is perhaps the most concerning country in Africa now. 
Conflict has raged for 7 months and U.S. diplomatic efforts 
have consistently proven unable to curb the fighting. Many 
prominent media and Sudan experts have warned that genocide has 
returned to the Darfur region where survivors have reported 
mass slaughter, murdered babies, and kill lists.
    The world is watching to see if the United States will 
stand by as Al-Fashir, the only capital city in Darfur not yet 
captured by the RSF, becomes a site of refuge or slaughter.
    I note the announcement yesterday of sanctions against 
Bashir-era Islamists who have contributed to Sudan's 
destabilization but I'm concerned that they do not appear to be 
part of a strategic framework.
    Sanctions are effective only as a means to a clearly 
articulated end goal and are not--excuse me, not sufficient 
policy in and of themselves.
    The administration must articulate a clear and coherent 
policy. It is not enough simply to issue periodic statements of 
condemnation as to how its current actions are contributing 
positively to achieving a return of civilian rule and end 
fighting in Sudan.
    Fragility in Chad is creating hard bedfellows for the Deby 
government and internal fissures within the ruling Zaghawas. 
Despite being one of the poorest countries in the world Chad 
hosts 1.3 million forcibly displaced persons as of September 
2023.
    Multiple reports suggest that United Arab Emirates is using 
an airfield in eastern Chad to funnel weapons and supplies to 
RSF who are a direct evolution of the Janjaweed militias from 
the Darfur genocide 20 years ago.
    The palace coup in Niger caught everyone by surprise and 
the current leadership in Niamey appears stuck, unable to move 
forward, and credible solutions that would see sanctions 
relief, allow safe relief of the democratically elected leader 
Mohamed Bazoum, and instead is looking to Moscow for solutions. 
Just yesterday the Russian Deputy Minister of Defense was in 
Niamey signing a military cooperation agreement among Niger, 
Burkina Faso, and Mali.
    The junta in Mali has doubled down on reliance on Wagner 
and Russia following the withdrawal of the United Nations 
peacekeeping operation in the country.
    The junta kicked out peacekeepers following an 
investigative report detailing a massacre that took place by 
the malign Russian personnel. In August 2023 Russia vetoed the 
renewal of the U.N. sanctions program for Mali which focused on 
the conflict in the north. Jihadists in Mali have almost 
doubled the territory they control in Mali in less than a year.
    This sows the seeds for the emergence of the Islamic State 
that exercises territorial control over west Africa. Burkina 
Faso experienced two military coups in 2022. Successive 
governments have been unable to contain the spread of violence 
by insurgents affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.
    In November 2023 Burkina Faso upgraded its relationship 
with Russia and 20 Russian soldiers arrived in the country. 
Russia's growing entrenchment across the Sahel and Africa as a 
whole is extremely concerning, testing Western influence on 
several fronts.
    I have yet to see a comprehensive strategy from this 
administration to combat Russia's influence and address the 
shortcomings of our economic and diplomatic tools.
    I would like to thank the witnesses for their appearance 
today and for their frank assessment of the security vacuum 
that's being filled by our adversaries in these countries.
    The descent into chaos in the Sahel is far from over and 
there is urgency to develop a comprehensive approach to 
stabilizing the region, not just containing it.
    The chair will now recognize the ranking member, the 
Congresswoman from California Ms. Jacobs for any statements she 
may have.

        OPENING STATEMENT OF RANKING MEMBER SARA JACOBS

    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you, Chairman James, and Assistant 
Secretary Phee, Assistant Secretary Wallander, and Mr. Jenkins 
for testifying before the subcommittee today on U.S. policy in 
the Sahel region.
    The past few years have shown that U.S. policy and that of 
the international community toward the Sahel region have come 
up short. We have seen a string of coups and democratic 
backsliding across the Sahel region and the broader continent 
including in Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Sudan.
    As a result, over 4 million people have been displaced in 
the Sahel alone adding to global migration levels while the 
climate crisis and violence continue to affect food crops and 
food prices, and we have started to see insurgent violence 
spread its way toward the coastal West African states, 
particularly Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, and Togo, which are working 
to secure their northern borders and address vulnerabilities to 
violent extremism.
    It is clear the United States needs to prioritize this 
region of the world, which is why I'm so focused on the 
implementation of the Global Fragility Act and the resulting 
10-year strategy to prevent conflict in coastal West Africa.
    We know that a key driver of violent extremism is lack of 
responsive governance. In many places that have experienced 
coups young and marginalized populations don't feel like they 
have a voice in their governments and aren't properly 
represented.
    This is especially important on the African continent where 
young people are the majority. Africa has the youngest 
population in the world with 70 percent of sub-Saharan Africa 
under the age of 30.
    So we need to make sure that national, regional, and 
international government responses to violent extremism address 
governance instead of prioritizing a security first response.
    Too often security forces have responded with a heavy hand 
and caused civilian harm, which only fuels underlying 
grievances against the State more.
    I saw this when I worked at the State Department. Security 
forces' abuses and human rights violations are some of the 
biggest drivers of violent extremism.
    So as we provide support to security forces working to 
address violent insurgents and secure their borders we need to 
emphasize human rights and professionalization.
    With thoughtful implementation the Global Fragility Act has 
the power to modernize our foreign policy and center conflict 
prevention and peacebuilding into the heart of our strategy.
    But one of the biggest tactics that we can't overlook in 
addressing conflict is the importance of locally led 
peacebuilding and development.
    Bringing in people who are involved and most affected by 
violent conflict to create solutions is the most effective, 
efficient, and equitable way to do development and conflict-
related work.
    We need to empower local people, not to tell them what to 
do and perpetuate harmful cycles of colonialism, and this is 
increasingly relevant in light of the civil war in Sudan where 
young people have led the democracy movement and heroically 
stepped in to provide for their communities when the 
international community has been unable to operate.
    Even before the fighting started 16 million people were 
already in need of aid. Many civilians lacked the basics for 
life, food, water, shelter, medicine, and security, while SAF 
and RSF continue hostilities and make clear that they are not 
serious about peace.
    I'm glad to see the Biden administration designate three 
former Bashir officials for their role in threatening peace, 
security, and stability in Sudan. But let's be clear, more is 
needed to bring this war to an end and enable a viable pathway 
to peace and democracy for the Sudanese people.
    I'm horrified by the mass atrocities committed by the RSF, 
particularly in Darfur but also in Khartoum, and look forward 
to hearing from the administration on what they're doing to 
prevent further atrocities, hold the RSF accountable, and 
recognize these atrocities for what they are.
    It is also clear there is more pressure the United States 
can bring to bear on the UAE and its role in providing weapons 
to the RSF, violating the U.N. arms embargo, and enabling mass 
atrocities.
    Any path to peace in Sudan must be inclusive, credible, and 
transparent and I hope to hear more from the administration 
today on its strategy to meet these standards.
    So I'm looking forward to hearing from you all today about 
the path for the U.S. policy in Sahel and Sudan and especially 
how the U.S. can work with local communities to create long-
term peace, stability, and security.
    Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. James. Thank you, Madam Ranking Member. Other members 
of the committee are reminded that opening statements may be 
submitted for the record.
    We are pleased to have a distinguished panel of witnesses 
before us here today. Once again, Hon. Molly Phee is the 
Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of African Affairs at the 
U.S. Department of State.
    The Honorable Celeste Wallander is the Assistant Secretary 
of Defense for International Security Affairs in the Office of 
the Secretary of Defense for Policy.
    Mr. Rob Jenkins is the Assistant to the Administrator in 
the Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization at the 
U.S. Agency for International Development.
    Thank you each for being here today. Your full statements 
will be made a part of the record and I'll ask each of you to 
keep your spoken remarks to 5 minutes in order to allow time 
for member questions.
    I now recognize Assistant Secretary Phee for her opening 
statement.

  STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE MOLLY PHEE, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 
      BUREAU OF AFRICAN AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE

    Ms. Phee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Jacobs. 
We appreciate this opportunity to together, the three Ds, 
discuss the Sahel and other issues of concern.
    As you know, the Biden-Harris administration recognizes 
Africa as a major geopolitical force and seeks to be a partner 
on shared values and interests.
    The recent coups in the Sahel can be attributed to the 
enormous challenges facing the region, notably a tradition of 
weak democratic governance, an acute terrorist threat, 
insufficient economic and educational opportunities for the 
region's young population, and climate-related water and land 
shortages which lead to conflict over resources and contribute 
to food insecurity.
    We also know that Africa is disproportionately affected by 
upheaval in the global world order. When similar global 
disruptions occurred, for example, in the 1960's and the 1990's 
civil wars and coups proliferated then. Today the ongoing 
destabilizing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia's war in 
Ukraine, the surge in climate shocks, and the global contests 
between democracies and authoritarian regimes, these are 
driving instability in Africa.
    While each country in the Sahel is unique we assess weak 
governance is the core vulnerability that opens the door to 
poor choices by military leaders and malign actors like the 
Wagner Group.
    We are adapting our response to these coups to promote 
responsive governance. For example, following the July military 
coup in Niger we suspended nearly $140 million in security 
assistance programs, more than $300 million in our MCC compact 
and our security cooperation.
    To bolster the regional African body known as ECOWAS, which 
shares our alarm at the proliferation of coups, we are actively 
supporting their negotiations with the junta in Niger by 
enabling them to leverage our assistance to craft actionable 
terms for a democratic transition timeline and for the release 
of former President Bazoum.
    The objective is to employ the prospect of resumed U.S. 
assistance to demonstrate that embracing the path to democracy 
is in Niger's interests. And we remain steadfast in our support 
for the people in Niger by maintaining our humanitarian, 
health, and essential food programming.
    Mali and Burkina Faso are challenging cases, as you both 
noted. In Mali, prospects for the return of democracy are 
increasingly grim as the Wagner-supported transitional 
government once again has chosen to delay elections and is 
forcefully seeking to exert control in northern Mali.
    The deterioration in security, the rise in civilian 
casualties, and the exploitation of the country's natural 
resources illustrate convincingly the dangers of the Wagner 
role.
    Burkina Faso faces a dramatic security and human rights 
crisis. We are urging the Burkinabe to employ a 
counterterrorism strategy that prioritizes civil security 
institutions.
    We know an overly militarized approach to counterterrorism 
like the one adopted in Mali is bound to fail. To address 
Burkina's ongoing political instability we are pressing for a 
democratic transition in line with a publicly declared 
timeline.
    In Chad, we are pushing the transitional government to 
adhere to its transitional timeline and to preserve political 
space for opposition and civil society groups so they can 
freely participate in next year's election.
    As Chad, confronts surging refugee flows from Sudan, we are 
mobilizing humanitarian support to minimize the resulting 
security risks.
    To promote good governance, we have eagerly embraced the 
tool Congress provided us with the Global Fragility Act. 
Drawing on those resources we are acting to help insulate 
neighboring countries in coastal West Africa vulnerable to 
democratic backsliding.
    As we support our African partners in navigating these 
challenges we believe leading with our values will best support 
our national security strategy.
    I want to turn to a topic that is of grave concern to us 
all, the military conflict in Sudan, which threatens to destroy 
the unity of the country and destabilize the region.
    The escalating violence, especially attacks by the RSF in 
Darfur, have included, as you know well, mass killings, ethnic 
targeting of non-Arab communities, widespread rape, and 
obstruction of humanitarian aid.
    By their actions the two forces have disqualified 
themselves from a role in governance and demonstrated there is 
no acceptable military solution to the conflict. Following the 
inspirational 2019 overthrow of the military led by a broad-
based popular movement there have been two serious attempts to 
achieve a civilian-led transitional government through a joint 
negotiation process between civilian and military leaders.
    Twice the security forces have trampled on these democratic 
aspirations, first in October 2021 when the military conducted 
a takeover and second in April 2023 when they went to war.
    As a result of these hard lessons, Sudanese civilians now 
seek to negotiate among themselves to resume and complete the 
democratic transition.
    These discussions are taking place in Addis Ababa with our 
active support. The conflict in Sudan is too big for any one 
country or any single platform to resolve.
    Our diplomacy is based on close coordination with African, 
regional, and international partners to build on our 
comparative strengths and those of our partners.

    Mr. James. Thank you, Assistant Secretary Phee. Your time 
has expired.
    In the interest of time I now recognize Assistant Secretary 
Wallander for her opening statement.

    STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE CELESTE WALLANDER, ASSISTANT 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS, OFFICE 
  OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF 
                            DEFENSE

    Ms. Wallander. Chairman James, Ranking Member Jacobs, 
members of the committee, thank you for having me here today to 
discuss the situation in the Sahel and Niger in particular, as 
well as the continuing importance of U.S. presence, operations, 
and security force assistance to our African partners.
    Security in the Sahel has steadily declined since the 
Libyan crisis of 2011. Violent extremist organizations--VEOs--
affiliated with both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State have taken 
advantage of weak governments and failed states.
    These VEOs have overstretched the defense and security 
forces of many regional governments and carved out safe havens 
to progressively expand their operational reach.
    This has allowed these VEOs to expand their influence and 
operations toward the littoral countries along the Gulf of 
Guinea. The Department of Defense's strategy focuses on two 
main lines of effort.
    In the short and medium term we will support African-led 
counterterrorism operations to disrupt the most acute terrorist 
threats with a particular emphasis on those targeting U.S. 
interests.
    In the long term we will emphasize bilateral security 
assistance to African defense and security forces in order to 
build their own homegrown capacity to counter these threats 
without excessive external assistance.
    Over the last 3 years significant changes in the political 
environment in the Sahel have affected our ability to work with 
both African and international partners. Successive military 
coups in Mali in 2020, in Burkina Faso in 2022, and now in 
Niger in 2023 have resulted in restrictions on DOD's operations 
and assistance programs.
    Other international allies and partners have also 
reconsidered their presence in the region, requiring us to 
reevaluate our own posture.
    We remain concerned that these developments will provide 
more space for VEOs to operate and make it more challenging to 
address those threats. VEOs survive and thrive in areas of 
instability and seek to leverage that instability for their own 
ends as evidenced by the attacks we have seen in Niger since 
the coup.
    Within this context our strategic competitors have seized 
the opportunity to increase their own access and influence.
    Russia has been particularly active in stoking anti-Western 
sentiment and presenting its military contractors or Russian 
private military companies--PMCs--such as the Wagner Group as 
practical alternatives to Western trainers.
    We are at a crossroads. On one level we--on the one hand, 
we cannot afford to ignore the sustained challenge to democracy 
by military juntas nor turn a blind eye to their misuse of 
power.
    As Secretary Austin noted during his recent trip to Africa, 
when generals overturn the will of the people and put their own 
ambitions above the rule of law security suffers and democracy 
dies.
    We also cannot afford to compromise our regional influence 
and security partnerships which are threatened by competitors 
who are less concerned with democratic values and human rights 
and threatened by the fragility of Sahel states.
    There is also a significant risk that VEOs might expand 
their influence or capabilities in the region if 
counterterrorism pressure remains at reduced levels.
    Given this elevated threat environment the Department of 
Defense is committed to working with our interagency partners 
to continue to monitor and disrupt VEO threats emanating from 
the Sahel while constructively engaging with regional states to 
restore productive democratic governance in those countries.
    In doing so we are consistently working to strike a balance 
between offering the practical assistance that our African 
partners need to face emergent threats while reinforcing our 
professional values to help them build strong, resilient 
institutions that will be reinforce not only their physical 
security but their democratic stability.
    Our success depends on continued investment in West Africa. 
To do this, we must maintain some continuity with past efforts 
while adjusting our approach to reflect changes in the 
environment as well as the actions of our African partners, 
international allies and partners, and strategic competitors.
    DOD's requirement to monitor indications and warnings of 
VEO activity in the Sahel and prevent threats to U.S. interests 
emanating from the region has not changed. For the last 10 
years our posture in Niger has proven critical to this effort.
    Moving forward, we have worked side by side with the 
Department of State and other interagency partners to define 
conditions for restoring our activities and partnership in 
Niger.
    Nigerien officials must quickly and credibly transition 
back to a democratically elected civilian government.

    Mr. James. Thank you, Madam Assistant Secretary.
    Mr. Jenkins, I now recognize you for your opening 
statement.

 STATEMENT OF ROBERT JENKINS, ASSISTANT TO THE ADMINISTRATOR, 
 BUREAU FOR CONFLICT PREVENTION AND STABILIZATION, U.S. AGENCY 
                 FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

    Mr. Jenkins. Thank you for inviting me to testify and for 
your support of this vital region whose peace and stability is 
deeply intertwined with that of the United States and of the 
world.
    To address the root causes of violence and conflict in the 
Sahel we need to support peaceful transitions back to democracy 
and lay the foundations for improving governance and building 
trust between citizens and their governments.
    Improved governance is critical to promoting stability. It 
is as important to focus on the delivery of basic services as 
it is to focus on inclusive, fair, and transparent institutions 
and political processes.
    Democracy needs to deliver. For example, in Mali USAID 
works with local governments on the development of community 
plans for water, sanitation, and hygiene, and ensures that 
local civil society participates in planning.
    The region's population is among the youngest in the world. 
Youth can be champions of democracy and reinvigorate economies 
or can serve as foot soldiers for extremist organizations and 
further destabilize the region.
    This will be determined by their education, agency, and 
opportunities. When youth can seek an education and gain the 
skills they need for life and work they can build more hopeful 
and prosperous futures.
    The U.S. has been the third largest contributor to the 
Global Partnership for Education, a multilateral organization 
providing education services in several countries across the 
Sahel.
    To build trust in good governance USAID works with people 
in country who are most impacted. We can't solve the problems 
in the Sahel alone. We're working with communities on the 
ground and with other bilateral, multilateral, and private 
sector partners such as the reenergized Stabilization Leaders 
Forum.
    We're seeking solutions by integrating our efforts more 
strategically across the U.S. Government with long-term shared 
goals. This is the paradigm shift that Congress envisioned in 
the landmark Global Fragility Act and strategy to prevent 
conflict and promote stability.
    We have developed 10-year whole of government plans that 
are guiding our development, diplomacy, and defense in five 
partner geographies including Libya and coastal West Africa, a 
country and a region inextricably linked to the Sahel.
    Peace and stability in the Sahel requires bringing peace 
and stability to Libya, which has served as a source of and 
destination for weapons and armed fighters. The 10-year plan in 
Libya is working in the southern part of the country to 
increase legal economic opportunity, invest in community 
advocacy to counter militia influence, and build local capacity 
to deliver public services to Libyans.
    Much of our work under this innovative strategy is 
concentrated in critical northern regions of coastal West 
Africa that border the Sahel. This includes a joint U.S.-German 
initiative, the Coastal States Stability Mechanism, which 
leverages shared funding and partners with local communities.
    Through it and other USAID programs we're hearing directly 
from communities about what they need. Based on community 
feedback in Togo, for example, we partnered to build a new 
bridge, a youth center, and a community radio station to 
improve economic opportunities in disconnected towns, foster a 
sense of belonging, and promote access to credible information.
    We are grateful for the congressional leadership and vision 
that passed the bipartisan Global Fragility Act. Congress can 
continue to lead us in realizing this vision by enacting 
legislative reforms to reduce bureaucratic challenges and help 
us work across the U.S. Government to address root causes and 
prevent conflict before it starts.
    We must continue to work creatively with people in the 
Sahel. We must support timely democratic transitions in Burkina 
Faso, Chad, Niger, Guinea, and Mali so that critical political, 
social, economic, and governance reforms can be realized to 
reduce corruption, prevent further democratic erosion, and 
rebuild a social contract.
    None of this work will take root without strengthening and 
expanding the role of African institutions in balancing 
regional threats and opportunities. The U.S. is improving its 
coordination to increase burden sharing and synchronization 
across development, humanitarian and peacebuilding programming 
while also countering propaganda and disinformation from 
strategic competitors.
    In addition to our conflict prevention work USAID is 
providing life-saving humanitarian assistance and early 
recovery, risk reduction, and resilience programming, almost 
$390 million in the Sahel during Fiscal Year 2023.
    Through our development and humanitarian assistance we can 
make the United States a partner of choice. We can demonstrate 
that democracy delivers by partnering to tangibly improve the 
lives of the millions in the Sahel searching for hope and 
opportunity, opportunity they deserve.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to speak and for 
convening this important meeting. I look forward to your 
questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Jenkins follows:]
    GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT

    
    Mr. James. Thank you, Mr. Jenkins. I now recognize myself 
for 5 minutes of questioning.
    I'm just going to go off of--Ukraine has a population of 
approximately 43.79 million people. Sudan has a population of 
approximately 45.66 million people.
    Yet, the nonmilitary assistance that has gone to Ukraine is 
$12.4 billion and the humanitarian assistance to Sudan is $620 
million. I've heard things like we need to do everything we 
possibly can.
    But what I see is you have almost identical population 
sizes but 20 times the commitment financially to the people of 
Ukraine than the people in Sudan. Are the lives in Sudan less 
important by 20 times?if not how are we going to address that 
gap?
    Let me rephrase it. Are you receiving support from the 
administration as much to do your jobs as your colleagues are 
doing theirs?
    Ms. Phee. Mr. Chairman, the situation in Sudan is 
commanding much time and attention from the administration. For 
example, we are seeking to help the civilians be in a position 
to take power when the conflict has abated.
    So that is why Ambassador Godfrey and the embassy that was 
previously located in Khartoum is now in Addis Ababa where the 
preponderance of Sudanese civilians are meeting to support them 
in that effort.
    Ambassador Rubenstein is in Jeddah working to try and----
    Mr. James. Madam Assistant Secretary, that sounds great. 
You've been to Africa and spent a lot of years in Africa and 
you understand that part of the reason why the Russian 
misinformation is working is because for a large population in 
Africa they see it as true in their lived experience.
    They see it as true that America is not showing up. They 
see it as true that America doesn't care and they see it as 
true that we're sending billions of dollars to Ukraine and 
they're getting pennies on the dollar.
    They see that America's commitment is not there to their 
plight and so part of the reason why we're experiencing these 
issues and the backslide in democracy in governance, the 
economic and educational opportunities that we're able to 
participate in, is because they see us as hypocrites.
    How are we changing that narrative through action?
    Ms. Phee. Mr. Chairman, my contacts with the Sudanese 
people tell me that they believe that we are the best friend to 
the Nation. It is not Russia or China who showed up to try and 
help end this conflict. It was the United States.
    We are perceived to be disinterested and care about the 
civilians and care about the stability of this State. That is 
not the position of other partners in the international 
community. The strength we have is that they want to have a 
partnership with us and they want our help to resolve the 
conflict.
    Mr. James. OK. Just before Thanksgiving Kenya's President 
Ruto and the SAF leader General Burhan met in Nairobi and 
issued a joint statement which called out the general process 
for being too slow.
    Assistant Secretary Phee, how realistic is it to expect 
that Jeddah produces anything of value when one of our 
strongest partners in the region meets with a belligerent 
leader and calls for an alternative fora?
    Ms. Phee. We work very closely with the Kenyan president. 
In fact, he has invited the United States to join an IGAD 
summit that will be held this coming weekend. I speak with him 
regularly. The Secretary speaks with him regularly.
    We are working very closely with our partners in the East 
African regional organization of IGAD of which he is a leading 
member as well as with the African Union.
    Mr. James. Is the UAE a friend or foe in ending this 
conflict diplomatically?
    Ms. Phee. We share the concerns that Ranking Member Jacobs 
identified about UAE's support to the RSF and that is a topic 
of conversation including most recently during the Vice 
President's visit to the UAE for COP.
    Mr. James. What are some ways that we can hold the UAE--
those actors in UAE who are fomenting this conflict 
accountable?
    Ms. Phee. I think the publicity of this hearing and your 
statement and request to the UAE to consider the detrimental 
impact of their support to the RSF would be very helpful.
    Mr. James. Absolutely you'll have our support.
    Mr. Jenkins, please describe how programs in your bureau 
continue to work with partners in support of a democratic 
transition in Sudan and where. Addis? Cairo? Jeddah.
    Mr. Jenkins. So thank you. Those of us that have been 
working in Sudan for generations--a generation or more our 
heart has broken quite a few times.
    But we stand firmly with the people of Sudan and we 
strongly, strongly, strongly support civil society including 
the movements that got us to the moment in 2019 and are going 
to be the hope for Sudan once they get out of their current 
nightmare.
    We're currently located temporarily in both Egypt and in 
Nairobi and are in the process of having a footprint of formal 
expat positions in both Egypt and in Nairobi, and our DART 
team--the Disaster Assistance Response Team--is 12 people 
that's based in Nairobi right now.
    Mr. James. Thank you. So my time is expired. I now 
recognize Ranking Member Jacobs for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    This hearing is incredibly timely particularly after Niger 
became the latest in a string of coups across the Sahel.
    In Niger in particular the United States was invested 
heavily, particularly militarily and particularly in their army 
and their special forces, and despite that, despite all of that 
investment and apparent influence and the security gains from 
those joint operations the coup in Niger was ultimately 
successful and revealed some deep-seated grievances among 
Nigeriens toward the democratically elected government and the 
United States was, frankly, caught off guard.
    So, Assistant Secretary Phee, Assistant Secretary 
Wallander, what happened? Besides not having an ambassador why 
do you think the State Department did not have a good 
understanding of grievances toward the Bazoum government? What 
lessons can we learn from this to apply toward U.S. policy in 
the Sahel and coastal West Africa?
    And Assistant Secretary Wallander, how do you explain the 
Department of Defense not seeing this coup coming, given the 
vast amounts of training and cooperation that the U.S. military 
did with our Nigerien counterparts?
    And, again, what lessons can be learned on the DOD side 
especially as the interagency is implementing the Global 
Fragility Act?
    Ms. Phee. We share your disappointment in the outcome in 
Niger. I think the statistics, which you know well, in terms of 
the security incidents and civilian casualties that we have 
seen in Mali and Burkina--in contrast to the very positive 
progress that was underway in Niger by the efforts of the 
Nigerien as well as the U.S. and other European partners it 
makes the coup confusing and perplexing.
    What we understand is that the President--I'm sorry, the 
commander of the Presidential guard, who was in a dispute with 
President Bazoum, is the one who initiated this action and then 
persuaded other members of the military to join him.
    It does not appear to us at this time that this was a well-
prepared or well-thought-out action. He was also able to 
successfully exploit anti-French sentiment as well, as you 
noted, concerns about the leadership--the democratically 
elected leadership.
    In terms of lessons learned, absolutely we need to have an 
important team on the ground, a team led by a confirmed 
Ambassador to engage. But in this particular instance it does 
seem as if it was a specific grievance that mushroomed.
    Ms. Wallander. Thank you, Ranking Member Jacobs. I would 
share, of course, Assistant Secretary Phee's analysis and to 
your point about how could this happen when the United States 
trained and worked with the Nigerien armed forces.
    The experience at the working level was positive in the 
interests in reducing violence against civilians in the country 
and pushing back against--and containing violent extremist 
organizations.
    The rates of violence had fallen in the years of our 
successful cooperation and since these select leaders of the 
Nigerien military leadership chose to violate their country's 
constitution and overthrow democratic rule in fact incidences 
of violence and their ability to live up to their duties to 
protect their country have been eroded because of their actions 
and their failures.
    One of the lessons learned is exactly to reinforce that 
message with our partners that it is only with stability and 
democratic civilian control of the military that they have 
effective governments and we believe that those of our partners 
who are trained and respect the importance of civilian 
leadership and democratic government are best positioned and 
demonstrate their ability to provide for security for their 
nations.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you.
    Assistant Secretary Phee, yesterday I sent a letter with my 
colleague Congresswoman Omar requesting information on the 
status of an atrocity determination in Sudan in response to 
RSF's horrific atrocities and ethnically targeted killings in 
Darfur.
    At the end of October you testified in front of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee and committed to making an official 
determination. So can you commit here today that the State 
Department will make this determination and let us know when we 
can expect to see this?
    Ms. Phee. First of all, thank you very much for the letter 
to highlight the need for an atrocity determination. As you 
know, one of the reasons it's a powerful tool is because of the 
rigorous research undertaken to investigate and document 
including by our attorneys.
    I had the opportunity to speak yesterday with Secretary 
Blinken who, as you know, just returned from a trip abroad and 
I'm pleased to report that you should see action on that 
shortly.
    Ms. Jacobs. Wonderful. Thank you all. I yield back.
    Mr. James. Thank you, Madam Ranking Member.
    I now recognize Rep. Kim for 5 minutes.
    Mrs. Kim of California. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking 
Member, for holding today's hearing on the Sahel. Thank you, 
witnesses, for joining us today.
    As the author of a resolution condemning the conflict in 
Sudan I'm interested in hearing from you about our policy 
toward the civil war in Sudan.
    In recent weeks, the crisis in Sudan has worsened and the 
Rapid Support Forces led multiple offensives during which it 
indiscriminately killed those in the Masalit ethnic community 
in West Darfur. European officials have also characterized 
those operations as part of a wider ethnic cleansing campaign 
by the RSF. These attacks happened while the U.S. was 
facilitating the last round of talks in Jeddah.
    I want to ask you, Ms. Phee, given the ethnic violence 
occurring in Darfur are you concerned that another genocide is 
happening?
    Ms. Phee. We share the concern and the horror that all of 
us feel about the atrocities being committed by the RSF as well 
as the problematic behavior by the SAF in terms of reckless 
disregard for civilian fatalities, and as I mentioned I think 
the Secretary will address that shortly.
    Mrs. Kim of California. Can you tell me at what point would 
the State Department determine the ethnic violence occurring 
constitutes it--declaring the violence as a genocide?
    Ms. Phee. That determination is based on legal criteria and 
would be best answered by our Global Criminal Justice leader 
Beth Van Schaack. But I know that the lawyers in reviewing the 
components of the atrocity determination have reviewed those 
matters closely and that should be announced in detail shortly.
    Mrs. Kim of California. As I said, those attacks happened 
while the U.S. was facilitating that talk in Jeddah. So what 
was the United States doing during the Jeddah talks to try to 
stop the RSF's ethnic violence?
    Ms. Phee. I can confirm that we have regularly engaged and 
pressed the Sudanese parties themselves as well as African and 
Arab partners to try and convince them to desist from this 
destabilizing behavior, which not only is horrific in terms of 
the human impact but also genuinely threatens the unity of the 
country.
    So we are using that platform to convey that message 
forcefully.
    Mrs. Kim of California. Thank you.
    You know, during the last or latest Jeddah talks the 
warring parties made commitments with respect to improving 
humanitarian access. So what changes if any has that led to?
    Ms. Phee. Our judgment is that the changes have been 
insufficient. We are engaged in discussions and there will be a 
meeting this week led by the U.N. OCHA and other partners 
including partners funded by the U.S. Government to try and 
implement those agreements--those confidence-building measures.
    Mrs. Kim of California. So if the talks in Cairo lead to 
any commitments can we trust the RSF to maintain any of those 
commitments?
    Ms. Phee. We do not trust the RSF or the SAF. We trust the 
civilians and the focus of the--or the balance of discussions 
are actually being held in Addis Ababa and we are working hard 
with our partners in USAID with the OTI office as well as with 
Ambassador Godfrey and others to help them complete the 
democratic transition and be prepared to assume governance of 
the country once the conflict has ended.
    Mrs. Kim of California. Thank you.
    You know, the recruitment for a violent extremist 
organization is not always driven by ideological affinity and 
often is caused by youth disillusionment associated with a lack 
of economic alternatives and a resentment toward the status 
quo. It has been reported that atrocities committed by State 
forces, militias, and Russian personnel may drive some VEO 
recruitment.
    So Ms. Jenkins--Mr. Jenkins--there you are--how is USAID 
seeking to balance the urgent here and there and now need to 
support the fight against the violent extremism with the need 
to also address some of the longer-term structural factors that 
continuously cause VEO recruitment?
    Mr. Jenkins. Thank you very much.
    Our humanitarian assistance provides life-saving assistance 
as urgently as we can but that does not provide solutions. The 
long-term solution will take longer, and as you noted it's not 
just about a job for youth. It's not just about ideology.
    It's about finding meaning in their life. It's about having 
agency and opportunity, and we have programs across the Sahel 
that work within communities to do exactly that, to provide 
youth a reason to believe that tomorrow might be better than 
today, to provide them with a group of--they can search out and 
find belonging and not have to turn to a violent extremist 
group.
    Mrs. Kim of California. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. James. Thank you, Madam.
    I now recognize Rep. Kamlager-Dove for 5 minutes.
    Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    You know, I was heartened to hear the chair reference the 
mass shootings and murdering of babies across the Sahel. I 
would note that these atrocities are also happening in the 
Ukraine by Russia and I would hope that I would hear the same 
outrage from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.
    I think our concern about and focus on Russia needs to be 
as consistent as their reign of terror.
    I have a few quick questions. Assistant Secretary Phee, so 
last week actually Ambassador Hammer talked about State 
capacity being stretched, which I think also compromises our 
ability to be successful with diplomacy.
    Can you talk to me about the personnel vacancies at the 
State Department and also with USAID at U.S. embassies in 
Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, and Niger, and what you all are doing 
and what the plan is going to be if we can't get our act 
together?
    Ms. Phee. Thank you for allowing me to request all of you 
to support the administration's budget which would provide us 
with badly needed personnel and budget resources.
    Also, although many of the countries you identified now 
have a confirmed Ambassador we did not have a confirmed 
Ambassador in Niger when the coup took place. We do not have a 
confirmed Ambassador in Nigeria, which is the president of 
ECOWAS.
    I do not have a confirmed Ambassador in Gabon where another 
coup took place. I do not have a confirmed Ambassador in the 
African Union.
    I also need one in Somalia and Djibouti where we have U.S. 
forces and significant events in the upcoming year. So that 
would be the first way that we could drive forward our policy 
more effectively.
    Second, as I've discussed before with the chairman and the 
members, we lost a lot of staff during the previous 
administration when there was a freeze on hiring. We are 
working to improve that and the budget request would help.
    We do have shortages particularly in the Sahel. That is 
sometimes in part because there are not adequate educational or 
health facilities and certain family members might require 
those, and then we get into a difficult dynamic where the great 
people who are there are working so hard they get burnt out.
    So we're trying to figure out ways to avoid that and to 
provide more incentives to attract more bidders to these 
challenging, important, and consequential countries.
    Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you for--USAID, yes?
    Mr. Jenkins. Thank you for the question. Yes, we have had 
challenges in the past. In the last 12 to 18 months the picture 
has improved considerably. We are now fully staffed--USAID--in 
both Chad and in Mauritania.
    We're 83 percent staffed in Mali and we're 72 percent 
staffed in Burkina Faso. Earlier this year both Niger and 
Burkina Faso were added to the list of countries--it's about 13 
countries including Mali that receive a difficult to staff 
differential in their pay.
    Basically, they receive 15 percent more per year if they 
agree to stay for 3 years and that's helped considerably.
    Thank you.
    Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you. I would also add, I guess, 
not just a freeze on hiring but also a disdain for the 
continent of Africa by the prior administration.
    So next question. This crisis has been ongoing in the Sahel 
and I think that it requires some engagement at the highest 
levels of U.S. Government. Obviously, we have hot spots all 
around the world and Secretary Blinken is challenged because 
he's only one person.
    So Assistant Secretary, how are you going to elevate this 
to his level so that we can get that kind of daylight on the 
crises that are happening here, especially in the Sahel?
    Ms. Phee. As I mentioned earlier, I had the opportunity to 
speak with Secretary Blinken and Acting Deputy Secretary Nuland 
yesterday. They will be engaging leaders of ECOWAS member 
states.
    ECOWAS is hosting a summit this weekend and I will be 
participating representing the United States so they're calling 
in advance of that discussion. They remain available to help at 
all times.
    In September at UNGA Secretary Blinken hosted a meeting of 
his foreign ministry counterparts--foreign minister 
counterparts of ECOWAS member states. So we have support and 
attention from the leadership.
    Ms. Kamlager-Dove. Thank you. I have a quick question maybe 
for Assistant Secretary Wallander. Just what's going to happen 
if this conflict expands? How will it continue to destabilize 
the region?
    Ms. Wallander. Thank you for the question.
    Well, we have already seen an increase in violence of VEOs 
against the Malian and the Wagner forces which then expands to 
violence against civilians in Mali.
    We have seen an uptick in--a considerable increase in 
violent incidents in Niger as the military is not focused on 
its real mission which is to provide for the security of the 
country.
    We are concerned that as the space for VEOs to operate and 
operate freely in territory in the Sahel may expand as a result 
of this security vacuum, that those VEOs may be tempted to act 
and strike and expand into critical West Africa----
    Mr. James. Thank you. The gentlelady's time has expired. 
Thank you.
    The chair will now recognize Rep. Kean for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Kean. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to thank our witnesses for being here with us today 
and you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this important hearing.
    First, terrorist groups have engaged in hostilities over 
control of U.N. bases after the junta in Bamako ended the 
U.N.'s peacekeeping mission.
    The U.N. had sought to transfer the bases to State control. 
Some separatist rebel factions have coordinated with one 
terrorist group, JNIM, to challenge the military expansion into 
former U.N. bases.
    With Russian tactical support Mali's military seized Kidal 
in mid-November, a goal that has eluded successive Malian 
governments for over 11 years.
    Assistant Secretary Wallander, how do you expect the 
capture of Kidal to affect African leaders' perception of 
Russia defense cooperation?
    Ms. Wallander. Thank you for that question.
    We--this is clearly why the Malian government asked MINUSMA 
or ordered MINUSMA to leave to enable their forces and the 
Russian forces to have greater running room in seizing 
territory, controlling locations in order to improve their 
ability to operate for their own ends.
    It is a concerning development because, as you noted, we do 
not want other African partners to see benefit in allowing 
Russia allowing Wagner free rein.
    So we work with African partners for them to understand is 
that, again, this is not enhancing the security of their 
country.
    It's actually increasing the activities and the 
vulnerabilities of their countries to the VEOs, to the drawing 
of these violent extremist groups, and that that is a model 
they absolutely should not follow.
    Mr. Kean. Thank you. Over the last two decades the United 
States Sahel policy has been in concert and often backstopping 
the foreign policy of France.
    The status quo is no longer possible as the French have 
been kicked out of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger in the last 
year and a half.
    Assistant Secretary Wallander, as France's policy in Africa 
is being forced to change how is the Department of Defense 
ensuring that U.S. strategic interests continue to be met in 
the Sahel?
    Ms. Wallander. First and foremost, we work closely with the 
State Department and with our colleagues in USAID for a 3D 
approach--democracy, development, and defense--because that is 
ultimately the solution that will bring stability and security 
anywhere in Africa but especially now in the Sahel.
    In terms of partners we are still working with European 
partners and other partners globally who want to contribute to 
counter VEO operations to building capacity. Different 
countries have different relationships with different countries 
in the region.
    By working with an array of partners in Europe and 
elsewhere from across the region we believe that we can 
continue to build capacity for those partners that seek it and 
continue to be committed to a democratic path.
    Mr. Kean. And how is the Department of State and USAID 
ensuring the anti-French sentiment across the Sahel does not 
become anti-U.S. sentiment?
    Mr. Jenkins. So thank you very much. Information 
manipulation, sometimes called disinformation, is now a plague 
throughout the region and we have upped our game significantly 
in the last 18 months with quite a few programs throughout the 
region and the continent to make sure that we get better 
information out there about what we're doing, something we have 
always been a little bit bad at, and make sure that we help 
people be more--better generators of real information and 
better consumers of false information so they know what it is 
when they can spot it and to keep a distance between the false 
information and the truth as we stand by it.
    Over.
    Mr. Kean. The juntas in Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso have 
all recruited the services of the Russia/Wagner Group security 
personnel and attempt to ensure regime strength.
    On November 27th, Niger's junta signed a decree revoking a 
2015 law that was enacted to curb smuggling migrants traveling 
from African countries to create migration routes in Niger en 
route to Europe.
    Curbing illegal migration and Russian influence are two of 
the biggest policy priorities of our European allies. French 
withdrawal from these countries creates a real risk of security 
vacuums forming, which will only exacerbate these issues while 
providing increased space for violent extremist organizations 
to strengthen.
    The Accra initiative, while promising in concept, has 
failed to gain support from all the involved countries. So can 
you talk to us in my remaining time about how we create more 
cooperation--U.S. and European cooperation to strengthen 
security in the region?
    Mr. Jenkins. In the small time we have we are actively 
engaged with quite a few bilateral partners in a multilateral 
and bilateral way in coastal West Africa, exciting partnerships 
with the German government, the Dutch government, the British 
government, to do everything we can to prevent the spread and 
the overflow of the violent extremism into coastal West Africa.
    Mr. Kean. Thank you, and I yield back my time.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. James. Thank you. I now recognize the chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, Chairman Mike McCaul, for 5 
minutes.
    Chairman McCaul. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the 
witnesses for being here.
    I've been focused on this area for a while in my career--
the Trans Sahara Partnership Act. But, obviously, the Sahel is 
getting very dangerous. I mean, it's always been problematic 
but with the latest events in Sudan----
    I had called for a special envoy previously that would 
report to the President. Would that be a helpful office to 
have?
    Ms. Phee. Hello, Mr. Chairman. It's good to see you.
    Chairman McCaul. You too.
    Ms. Phee. Thank you for the advocacy for an envoy. We 
would--we would agree that having a U.S. Government envoy to 
focus on Sudan would uplift the already considerable efforts by 
three Ambassadors who are focused full time on Sudan as well as 
the Africa Bureau, and I want you to know that's under active 
and serious consideration by the administration.
    Chairman McCaul. Great. Well, I look forward to working 
with you and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to 
perhaps move that process forward.
    It's been about--I guess about 7 months since we withdrew 
and abandoned our embassy in Khartoum. That's of grave concern. 
I think this conflict is getting worse, not better.
    I'm worried about the atrocities committed by the Wagner 
Group and their Rapid Support Forces formerly known as the 
Janjaweed. These horrendous crimes include--motivate killing in 
Darfur that echoes the genocide 20 years ago.
    And, further, western Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso there 
have been hundreds of recorded terrorist attacks by ISIS in the 
Sahel. They appear to be coordinated with a foreign terrorist 
organization known as JNIM, a French acronym stands for Union 
for Support of Islam and Muslims.
    As I mentioned, I championed the Trans-Sahara 
Counterterrorism Partnership back many years ago. Can you give 
me an update on how that is working and how that's being 
applied to this situation?
    Ms. Phee. Mr. Chairman, when that program was first 
developed with support from leaders like you it was an 
innovative approach to addressing the problems in the Sahel.
    But over time it became less effective, in part because of 
the changing conditions on the ground and in part because the 
way the program was structured we didn't optimize, I think, the 
interoperability that you see here.
    We have suggested to Congress that we would like to talk 
with you about how to update that program. I can tell you that 
both the benefits and the drawbacks of that program were 
considered in the design of the Global Fragility Act and in the 
policy that we developed on the basis of the GFA, the Strategy 
to Promote Stability and Prevent Conflict, which--where we're 
focused in coastal West Africa to prevent the expansion of the 
problems in the Sahel to our friends and partners in coastal 
West Africa.
    Chairman McCaul. Okay. Can you tell me about--because you 
have the Wagner Group trying to provide stability sort of like 
a military police force and then you've got the radical 
Islamists in the Sahel.
    Then you have the French. What does--what does it look like 
for the French now in that part of the world?
    Ms. Wallander. France--French forces have been withdrawn 
from Mali. They've been withdrawn from Burkina Faso and now 
they are undergoing--they're in the last weeks of their full 
withdrawal from Niger at the requirement of the Nigerien junta.
    So that leaves----
    Chairman McCaul. A vacuum.
    Ms. Wallander. That leaves--well, worse than a vacuum it 
leaves Wagner. It leaves Russian influence and it leaves 
leaderships, certainly in Mali, that are not respecting 
civilian security, safety, and in the excuse of fighting VEOs 
often get civilians in their sights.
    Chairman McCaul. So that vacuum is basically filled by 
Wagner and the Islamic extremists?
    Ms. Wallander. I think that is clearly solidly the case in 
Mali. It is still on the--it's not fully developed in Burkina 
Faso and in Niger. It is very concerning that we have seen 
Wagner officials in speaking to the leadership in Burkina Faso 
and then we are seeing Russian defense--ministry of defense 
officials in Niger.
    Chairman McCaul. You know, it's interesting. Prigozhin, I 
think--well, when--actually the merchant of death that we 
traded for the basketball player--the vape pipe--he--the 
Russians sent him down to negotiate with the Wagner Group in 
Africa to swear their allegiance to Putin and after they did 
that within a matter of days Prigozhin was shot down out of the 
sky about 2 months after his unsuccessful coup. I found that 
interesting.
    Do you--are you concerned about--you know, when I chaired 
the Homeland Security Committee it was during the rise of ISIS 
and the caliphate. Are you worried about that phenomenon 
happening in the Sahel right now, and how sophisticated could 
they be in terms of external operations?
    Ms. Phee. One of the reasons why we have had a long-
standing security cooperation relationship with the Nigerien 
armed forces was exactly because of the concern that control of 
territory, freedom to operate, would--could create an even more 
complicated situation if the ISIS forces and the JNIM forces in 
the region believe they then have the ability to operate 
externally and it's the reason why we need to continue to work 
with those partners that we can work with to counter that.
    Chairman McCaul. Have you seen any designs or plans of them 
to aspire to external attacks or is it just more focused on in 
the Sahel?
    Ms. Wallander. At this point the focus of those groups is 
assessed to be in the Sahel.
    Chairman McCaul. Right. I just met with a lot of the top 
Ukrainian military leaders and I have to say I'm always amazed 
at their strength and courage and their tenacity and their 
fighters.
    They envision a time where moving into the future, 
hopefully, when there's more success on the battlefield where 
they could take the place of the Wagner Group and replace them 
then I think that would be a change for the better.
    But I just throw that out to you as an interesting side 
note. But, anyway, I appreciate the work you do. This area has 
always been tricky and troublesome and I worry that our Belt 
and Road Initiative has not been successful in Africa and if 
they don't have an alternative they're going to turn to other 
groups like Wagner, like China, who obviously does participate 
quite a bit in the African continent, and this will be the 
largest continent in the world population wise in the next 
decade and I think it's very important we keep our eye focused 
on it.
    And, finally, you know, I'll give you an update, Mr. 
Chairman, on our PEPFAR negotiations. We're very committed to a 
reauthorization of PEPFAR and it's a tricky process up here but 
I've been up here long enough to get--to know how to get things 
done and it's my intention to get this one done, too.
    So with that, I yield back.
    Mr. James. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to 
echo the chairman's sentiments. He is personally committed to 
reauthorizing PEPFAR and so am I, and he is personally 
committed to supporting your efforts in the African region--in 
the continent of Africa to the benefit of the American people.
    The chair will now recognize Ranking Member Jacobs.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    So under the GFA the interagency is required to align and 
integrate all relevant diplomatic, development, and security 
assistance of the U.S. Government.
    I understand State and USAID have not used all the 
flexibility Congress has provided under existing earmark 
requirements. What are the barriers to additional alignment and 
what more help do you need from us?
    Mr. Jenkins. Thank you very much.
    I believe you're referring to the 10 percent variance on 
earmarks, which we are working with our lawyers and others 
across AID and State on how we can better utilize that and as 
we're working right now through the budgets for the next year 
we're taking that into account.
    There are a lot of things that we're learning under the GFA 
implementation. One of them is we still need some changes to 
the authorities particularly with the peace and security 
funding so that we can then actually meet the mandate of the 
act and use that funding to monitor and evaluate things other 
than just foreign assistance.
    And one of the key things we need is a reauthorization of 
both the PSF funding and also the complex crisis fund.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you.
    So support for Mali's 2015 peace accord between the 
government and northern ethnic separatist groups has been a 
cornerstone of U.S. policy toward the Sahel.
    Yet, the accord now appears to be moribund, especially 
given the resumption of hostilities in northern Mali in mid-
2023 and the Malian military seizure of Kidal, a rebel 
stronghold, a goal that has eluded successive Malian 
governments over the past 11 years.
    Assistant Secretary Phee, do you expect the Malian military 
to continue to expand its footprint in northern Mali with 
Russian support? What other scenarios might emerge? What 
opportunities exist for U.S. diplomats to support a political 
process that could actually deliver greater stability in Mali?
    Ms. Phee. I regret to tell you that I'm not very optimistic 
about the situation. I believe that FAMa, the Malian armed 
forces, with support from Wagner will continue to prosecute a 
military campaign in Kidal and other areas of northern Mali 
against Tuareg rebels.
    Their inattention and actual actions to undermine the 
Algiers Accords is one of the factors that affected our shift 
in position toward the transitional government.
    We are speaking to the Algerians and other partners to see 
how we can address this challenge. But I do expect it to 
continue and to worsen.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you. Members of the committee have 
received outreach from humanitarian NGO's and Sudanese civil 
society about concerns about potential drastic cuts in 
humanitarian assistance to Sudan.
    Either Assistant Secretary Phee or Mr. Jenkins, can you 
speak to that and outline how a significant cut to assistance 
would impact the Sudanese people?
    Mr. Jenkins. Thank you very much. As you know, for the last 
few years because of supplementals the--we have been the 
benefit of on humanitarian assistance particularly of a very 
generous Congress.
    Looking at a new reality budgetary wise, moving forward, we 
also have grave concerns about what will be necessary cuts not 
just in Sudan but in many if not almost all places around the 
world where we have had the benefit of increased levels that we 
aren't anticipating looking forward to that in the future.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you.
    Ms. Phee. May I just add? May I use this opportunity to 
please ask for congressional support for the administration's 
request for humanitarian assistance? The crises that we're 
discussing here in the Sahel are also present elsewhere in the 
globe and we urgently need the continued support of the 
American people.
    Ms. Jacobs. Mr. Chairman would like to know how much.
    Mr. Jenkins. I would refer you to the President's budget 
request on that one.
    Ms. Jacobs. And last, Assistant Secretary Phee, how is the 
State Department adjusting the GFA strategy in coastal West 
Africa in light of the coups in the Sahel?
    Ms. Phee. We are shifting the security assistance which had 
initially been conceived to focus on the challenges from the 
Gulf of Guinea to help them engage more effectively with the 
communities on the northern border.
    Ms. Jacobs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. James. I now recognize Rep. Baird for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Baird. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank the witnesses 
for being here and sharing your perspective on the region and 
that will be an asset for us making legislative decisions.
    But my first question deals with the fact that there's been 
some media reports that indicate a small Russian security 
detachment of, roughly, 20 men arrived in the Burkina Faso in 
November.
    So, Assistant Secretary Phee, what is known about this unit 
and its mission and what might such a deployment mean for U.S. 
engagement?
    Ms. Phee. Thank you, sir, for the question.
    Since the coup occurred--the second coup, if you will, 
occurred last year about this time we have been trying to 
convince the Burkinabe authorities to choose a different path 
than the path chosen by Mali where we can see the deteriorating 
security situation.
    We also are convinced that supporting what is effectively 
the second coup government in Burkina Faso would not be helpful 
in terms of our lessons learned about the need for a durable 
solution which would require a democratic government that looks 
after the rights and concerns of its citizens.
    So we have been trying to have a conversation to say if 
they move back to the path of democracy we're going to be able 
to be a better partner on the security situation and not to 
follow the Russian example.
    This--so, in short, the visit of these Russian soldiers is 
not welcome news and we will continue to try and press the 
Burkinabe to avoid going down the Mali path.
    Mr. Baird. Anyone else have a comment?
    Ms. Wallander. I would just--the DOD fully supports the 
Department of State in this approach and we stand ready. We 
continue to hold off on security assistance but should the 
leadership in Burkina Faso follow that path we would be ready 
to reengage with them.
    Mr. Baird. Thank you. I also serve on the Agriculture 
Committee, so, Mr. Jenkins, in the past 3 years, how much U.S. 
humanitarian aid has Mali, Sudan, Niger, and Burkina Faso all 
received, and who determines how much aid is spent and where?
    Mr. Jenkins. Thank you very much. For all of sub-Saharan 
Africa in Fiscal Year 1923, USAID spent approximately $12.5 
billion. Of that, $7.5 billion is development assistance and 
over $4 billion of that was humanitarian assistance.
    Now, how we determine how much humanitarian assistance goes 
into which countries when is a rather complicated art more than 
it's a science. Things are constantly changing, constantly 
shifting, and especially right now with the movements of people 
the way they are throughout the region we often find that with 
our partners we have to chase the displaced to where they're 
going.
    In Sudan right now you have 7 million people displaced 
alone in Sudan. You have over 3 million IDPs in the five 
countries of the Sahel, all of them badly in need of 
humanitarian assistance.
    But it also goes beyond that. There's people that are not 
displaced that also need life-giving assistance that they're 
receiving right now.
    Mr. Baird. So in your opinion do you feel that our USAID is 
competing well with Belt and Road Initiative from China?
    Mr. Jenkins. So we are the largest humanitarian donor in 
the world, we're the largest humanitarian donor in Africa, and 
we're the largest humanitarian donor in the Sahel.
    When you look at what the Chinese provide for humanitarian 
assistance it is a rounding error. So they've preferred to go 
on a different tack, asking and demanding loans for long-term 
development that already many on the continent have realized 
that they should not have gotten into the agreements they got 
into.
    Meanwhile, we lead with values and principles, as the 
assistant secretary said. We are the most generous humanitarian 
donor on Earth by way of dollars and we'll continue to do that 
with the support of Congress.
    Mr. Baird. So you feel the recipients are aware of where 
this support is coming from?
    Mr. Jenkins. We make very, very, very sure that all of our 
assistance is branded from the American people unless it's in 
those rare circumstances where that puts our partners at risk.
    Mr. Baird. I guess my time is up so I yield back, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Mr. James. Thank you, Mr. Baird.
    Just a couple last questions and we'll conclude.
    All witnesses, to your knowledge what U.S. security 
assistance or counterterrorism cooperation remains ongoing, if 
any, in countries subject to Section 7008 aid restrictions in 
Mali, Niger--excuse me, or Burkina Faso?
    Ms. Wallander. There are no security assistance programs 
subject to 7008 ongoing in those three countries.
    Mr. James. Assistant Secretary Wallander, I would actually 
appreciate your feedback here. The ranking member addressed 
this earlier but I just want to put a finer point on it. You've 
expressed regret at the fact that forces we train may end up a 
part of these coups.
    But how are we changing the strategy on how we have trained 
or how we're training and what are some of those lessons 
learned? Because this is not only something that we have seen 
in the continent of Africa but we see it around the world, that 
folks who have been trained with U.S. tax dollars by U.S. 
forces seem to miss the memo when it comes to the next steps.
    What are we doing better? What are we learning and what do 
we have to change in how we train?
    Ms. Wallander. Thank you for that question. I want to 
reassure you and reassure the American people that we do not 
believe there is a causal relationship between the quality of 
the training that our U.S. military provides to partners in--
globally and also in Africa.
    In fact, in Africa since 2008 the United States between--
I'm sorry, between 2010 and 2022 the U.S. trained 21,000 
African military personnel in IMET and other senior military 
education programs and of those 20 were involved in coups, 
which is .01 percent of those who were trained.
    The focus of those training programs is not just on 
military capability and leadership but on civilian control of 
the military, on respect for rule of law and constitutional 
order, on the requirements to serve the interests of the 
people.
    And so I believe the lesson learned is to refocus and 
recommit to serving--for our U.S. military to serve as both a 
model and as a mentor and to ensure that that is the focus of 
every training program--senior military education training 
program that the United States develops and executes with our 
partners.
    Mr. James. Yes, hopefully that will be sufficient to end 
what many Americans see as a revolving door of coup leaders and 
despots that are trained by American forces.
    As a United States Army veteran myself it does pain me to 
see my brothers and sisters put in harm's way to train who we 
intend to be allies and then end up going in the opposite 
direction of good governance, democracy, and human rights.
    So I look forward to continuing to work with anyone--my 
colleagues, the administration--for the purpose of peace and 
stability, which will have a direct positive effect on the 
security of American people at home and abroad.
    So with that, I'd like to conclude by thanking the 
witnesses for their valuable testimony and the members for 
their questions. The members of the committee may have some 
additional questions for the witnesses and we ask that you 
respond to these in writing.
    Pursuant to committee rules, all members may have 5 days to 
submit statements, questions, and extraneous materials for the 
record subject to the length and limitations.
    Without objection, the committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:16 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
