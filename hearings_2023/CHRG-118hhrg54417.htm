                              ----------                              


                      WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 2023

                          House of Representatives,
                                   Committee on the Budget,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:05 a.m., in Room 
210, Cannon Building, Hon. Jodey Arrington [Chairman of the 
Committee] presiding.
    Present: Representatives Arrington, Grothman, Smucker, 
Burgess, Cline, Good, Bergman, Ferguson, Moore, Estes, Bice, 
McClain, Fischbach, Yakym, Brecheen, Boyle, Schakowsky, 
Blumenauer, Peters, Panetta, Scott, and Espaillat.
    Chairman Arrington. The hearing will come to order. Today's 
hearing will focus on the need for a fiscal commission. We will 
discuss several legislative proposals to create a fiscal 
commission and hear testimony from several of our capable 
colleagues who have introduced legislation in the House and the 
Senate. The Senate panel will follow the House panel. We will 
have the colleagues testify this morning from the House.
    Leading off is my dear friend Bill Huizenga from Michigan, 
serves on the Financial Services Committee, and my other dear 
friend, Scott Peters. Both of them are chairing, they are co-
chairs of a bipartisan caucus that focuses on how to reform 
this dysfunctional budgetary process so we have more 
responsible behavior by Members of Congress, better motivation 
for a greater and more responsible outcome for the American 
people. So, I appreciate y`all's leadership there. They have 
introduced together, H.R. 5779, the Fiscal Commission Act of 
2023.
    Representatives Steve Womack and Ed Case join us as well. 
Chairman Womack from Arkansas is chairing the Financial 
Services and General Government Subcommittee at the 
Appropriations Committee, former Chairman of this august body 
and a mentor of mine, and I am grateful that you continue to 
provide your insights to our Committee to give us the best 
chance of success, and Ed Case, a great Member from Hawaii and 
a leader on this issue. Mr. Case and Mr. Womack have introduced 
H.R. 710, the Sustainable Budget Act, and we appreciate their 
input and their leadership over the years on this particular 
issue.
    Then we have with us Representative Lloyd Smucker, our very 
own from the Keystone State who serves not only on Ways and 
Means but also this Committee, and has had an experience with 
commissions, solving big problems, and he served as chair of a 
commission in Pennsylvania that was successful, believe it or 
not, and we want to learn about the best practices so that we 
can construct a commission that will ultimately work.
    As a friend of mine said in Washington, when all is said 
and done, more is said than done, and we don't have much more 
runway, Mr. Chairman, to talk about this issue and to not do 
anything about it for the sake of our beloved country, its 
future, and our children's future in America.
    Jim McGovern is another leader on a number of issues. He is 
our Ranking Member on the Rules Committee. I say our because we 
are all on one team. This is not a Republican or Democrat 
problem. This is America's problem. It is our problem, and we 
have got to figure out how to solve it.
    The second panel will include Senator Mitt Romney from Utah 
and Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia. They have 
introduced Senate Bill 3262. I think it is the companion bill 
of Mr. Peters' and Huizenga's, called the Fiscal Stability Act 
of 2023. We look forward to hearing from them as well.
    At this time, I would like to yield myself as much time as 
I may consume for an opening statement, and I don't like to 
read opening statements. It is tattooed on my heart, this 
issue, like I know it is for you all as our witnesses and many 
in this room who are deeply concerned about the bleak, fragile, 
and rapidly deteriorating fiscal state of affairs in the 
greatest Nation in human history.
    Let me start by again thanking the Members who are 
testifying for their leadership on what I believe is the most 
significant challenge facing our Nation in the 21st century, 
which is our runaway deficit spending and unsustainable 
national debt that threatens not only our economy, but our 
national security, our way of life, our leadership in the 
world, and everything good about America's influence, and our 
children's future.
    I think it is worth repeating some of the startling 
statistics that demonstrate just how fragile the situation is 
and just how bad off we are from a fiscal standpoint. 120 
percent debt-to-GDP. This is the highest level of indebtedness 
in the history of our country, surpassing World War II, and we 
are not at war. We are in relative peace and prosperity, and it 
is only going to get worse.
    The CBO projection 30 years out has our indebtedness at 
twice the size of the largest economy in the world. Our annual 
deficits have reached almost $2 trillion this past year. CBO 
projects them to double. We will add $20 trillion if we just 
keep the policies as they are today, $20 trillion, ten years. 
Now hear this: half of that $20 trillion is interest expenses 
alone. Chairman, we don't get another soldier or sailor 
equipped for battle. We don't sustain the senior safety net. We 
get nothing for that, and the interest, according to CBO, will 
triple. It was almost three quarters of a trillion dollars this 
past year. It is projected to be a trillion dollars. We will 
eclipse what we spent on national defense on interest alone.
    If that is not enough to wake all of us up and give us the 
sense of urgency to act, I don't know what will. No responsible 
leader can look at the rapid deterioration of our balance 
sheet, the CBO projection of these unsustainable deficits, and 
the long-term unfunded liabilities of our Nation, and not feel 
compelled to intervene and change course. No responsible leader 
can do that.
    As I said from the outset, this is the 21st century 
challenge for America. I believe this is our generation's world 
war, and the cost of losing this war will be catastrophic and 
irreparable, and I have three children. I imagine many of you 
have children and grandchildren, and they are counting on us to 
step up and be leaders and work together to solve the problem. 
If we don't have this sense of urgency, we don't have a plan, 
if we don't exercise political courage to execute the plan, we 
will be the first generation of leaders to fail to leave the 
country better than we found it.
    What a sad commentary. I refuse to accept that, and I know 
you do too. As I said before, this isn't a Republican or 
Democrat problem. This is our collective problem to solve, and 
it is a mathematic reality that will require real leadership on 
both sides of the aisle and in both chambers. Unfortunately, 
over the last several years, maybe even the last few decades, 
too many Americans have become desensitized to the trillions of 
dollars of accumulating debt, and too many lawmakers have been 
disengaged with a false sense of security that we can continue 
down this treacherous fiscal path without any real consequence.
    However, the past two years, I think, have provided a 
wakeup call. Record spending, $11 trillion, six of which has 
been added to the national debt, has resulted in a cost-of-
living crisis for the American people, and because of inflation 
and because of soaring interest rates, the American people are 
waking up to the bad fiscal and monetary policies that are 
impacting their own pocketbooks. There is a silver lining there 
because they are engaged in this, which means we might have a 
fighting chance to actually address it together.
    As I have said before, this trajectory we are on is 
unsustainable, but it is not unfixable, and I believe that, but 
both parties have to acknowledge they have contributed to it. 
Mr. McGovern, the Republicans have made their fair share of 
contributions to get us in this financial mess, and I say it at 
every hearing. We don't get a pass. We don't get a pass. Seven 
years since I have been here, I have watched it, waiving pay-
fors, waiving spending caps, and the list goes on of fiscal 
recklessness and irresponsibility of both parties.
    So, now that I have called out both sides, Mr. Ranking 
Member, I don't think a fiscal commission is the panacea for 
all of our financial woes. I just don't think there is a silver 
bullet. At the end of the day, we have to have the political 
courage as a body to cut through the brinkmanship, the 
weaponization, the fear mongering that we get from the outside 
and the inside, and we have to hold hands, as they say, and 
move forward with courage for the sake of our seniors who are 
now in jeopardy of insolvency in two very important safety net 
programs that they rely on, but also for our children.
    I know I am going over time. I can see you kind of getting 
restless, but I am just getting warmed up. No, I am kidding. 
Guys, I have met with a lot of interest groups, some of them 
with a very righteous cause, many of them with a mutual 
interest. I have yet to meet with the people who represent my 
children. I have yet to meet with the people who are concerned 
about a country that has been bankrupted because of our 
recklessness. We are sowing the wind and our children will reap 
the whirlwind of this fiscal disaster if we don't work together 
and do it quickly.
    So, we are going to evaluate these proposals. We are going 
to look for common themes. We are going to ask a lot of 
questions about the various contours and constructs and 
structural designs so that if we can move forward with a 
bipartisan, bicameral fiscal commission, even though I don't 
think there is a silver bullet out there, maybe, just maybe, it 
will provide a forum, Ed Case, for constructive, like real 
constructive, not posing for cameras and posturing for 
different groups, but real constructive dialogue that could 
lead to a real outcome with a real impact on the national debt 
and put us on a more sustainable path for the sake of our great 
country and our children. Amen? And the people said, amen.
    With that, I yield as much time as my Ranking Member shall 
desire to make his opening remarks.
    [The prepared statement of Chairman Arrington follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Boyle. Well, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I 
appreciate your passion for this issue, and I hope they know I 
respect every single one of my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle and appreciate their sincerity when it comes to this 
issue.
    I don't know how to go about this without being repetitive, 
because we just had a hearing on exactly this topic a couple of 
weeks ago, and so I don't want to repeat everything that I said 
then, but some of that overlap will obviously be unavoidable. 
For those of you who were at our last hearing just a couple of 
weeks ago on this topic, you know that I have real skepticism 
when it comes to the topic of commissions. I thought the panel 
that we had a couple of weeks ago, of those Members, former 
Members of the House and current Members, or current Member of 
the House, who participated in prior commissions talked about 
their experiences. Every one of those commissions ultimately 
ended in failure.
    So, rather than focus on a commission, which ultimately is 
about process, I want to focus my remarks actually on substance 
and very specifically on Social Security. Here is why. As 
someone who watches the Republican presidential debates, I have 
been--I have interesting viewing habits, I know--I have been 
struck by how a number of the leading candidates have flat out 
said they want to raise the retirement age. One of the leading 
candidates who just got a major endorsement from a Republican 
establishment group yesterday, she has repeatedly said we need 
to raise the retirement age from 65. She seems to be entirely 
unaware that the retirement age for Social Security hasn't been 
65 for quite some time.
    Almost a decade ago, when my father, after 50 years of hard 
work at blue collar jobs from the age of 16 to the age of 67, 
went ahead and retired, his retirement age then was 66. In a 
few years, it will be 67 because of changes that were made in a 
law that passed this body in 1983. So if someone wants to send 
an email to the Governor of South Carolina and let her know 
this, it would be wonderful.
    I would also like people to know a few other facts about 
Social Security, greatest antipoverty program in American 
history. Just think, back in the throes of the Great 
Depression, 46 percent of seniors lived in poverty. Today that 
number is a fraction of that. So, those who are saying that in 
order to save the program, we have to extract exorbitant cuts 
or we have to raise the retirement age, I don't know, to 70, or 
beyond, that is a little like saying we need to burn the 
village in order to save it. It just isn't true.
    And as I pointed out at the very last hearing, I have 
actually put down a plan on paper that would extend the life of 
the Social Security Trust Fund through the year 2100. I have a 
piece of legislation with Sheldon Whitehouse, the Senator from 
Rhode Island, who is the Chairman of our counterpart, the 
Senate Budget Committee, he and I have a bill that would do 
that for Social Security simply by bringing in more revenues 
from those who make more than $400,000 a year.
    Now, some might object to more revenues coming into the 
Social Security pot. I would say two things in response. First, 
and this comes up every single time I have a town hall, whether 
it was in person or a tele town hall, maybe some of you have 
had the same experience. For years and years, the Social 
Security Trust Fund was running a surplus. In the 1960s and the 
1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s, and here is where I would 
agree with the Chairman. Congresses under the control of both 
parties, instead of using that surplus to set it aside for 
future retirees so it would be there, they decided to spend 
that surplus to meet the needs of the current day. That is a 
tragedy.
    You know, I remember those great Saturday Night Live skits 
about Al Gore and making fun of his lockbox in the year 2000, 
but, you know, he was right. Had that surplus been saved in a 
lockbox or whatever you want to call it, there would be more 
revenue available now that those who were earning those wages 
to pay those Social Security taxes back in the 1970s, 1980s, 
and 1990s, making them available for their retirement today.
    So, it is only fair that more revenue is brought into the 
system when you consider back when there was more revenue than 
was going out to meet the needs of retirees then, that money 
was spent on things that were other than Social Security. So, I 
think that it is entirely appropriate when it comes to 
extending the life of the Social Security Trust Fund.
    I would also point out, and this has come up repeatedly 
throughout the year in the hearings that we have had here in 
this room, when you take the 2001 George W. Bush tax cuts that 
weren't paid for, the 2003 Bush tax cuts that weren't paid for, 
the reauthorization of most of that a decade later, and then 
the 2017 TCJA, I asked numerous witnesses, what is the 
cumulative amount of those tax cuts that weren't paid for? And 
the figure that was cited repeatedly at that table was $10 
trillion. So, when we look at that national debt of about $33 
trillion, remember, about $10 trillion of that is missing 
revenue from the last 22 years of tax cuts that weren't paid 
for.
    So, I appreciate again the sincerity of those who believe 
that a commission would be a better process, but as I pointed 
out a couple of weeks ago, and I will repeat today, whether it 
is a commission or some other process, at the end of the day it 
will come down to individuals voting from a couple menus of 
options, and the main menu will have either more revenues or 
cuts or some combination of thereof, and you can have the 
greatest, biggest blue ribbon possible and put that on a 
commission, that won't be a substitute for the fact that 
ultimately individuals will have to put up a vote either 
saying, yes, this is how we are going to raise more revenue, or 
yes, this is how we are going to enact cuts.
    I am very clear the side that I come on. It would be very 
easy and intellectually dishonest if I sat here and said, oh, 
we don't need more revenues and things are going to be 
perfectly fine. No, I acknowledge, as I have said, the Social 
Security Trust Fund is projected to fall short of meeting 75 
percent of benefits somewhere between the year 2033 and 2034. 
The Trustees of Social Security say it is 2034. CBO says it is 
2033. We can safely say in roughly a decade we will meet a 
critical point. It is pretty clear on which side I come down. 
More revenues into the Social Security Trust Fund, and we will 
be able to say for the lifetime of my daughter, who in the year 
2100, God willing, if she is still alive, would be 86 years 
old, I will be able to look her in the eye and say, Social 
Security will be there for the rest of your lifetime and beyond 
that simply by bringing in more revenues from those who are in 
the top one percent of earners.
    I think that is fair. I think that is appropriate, and for 
those who disagree, I would be very interested in seeing what 
their plan is and their alternative, and with that, I will 
yield back. Thank you, Chairman.
    [The prepared statement of Ranking Member Boyle follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Chairman Arrington. I thank my Ranking Member. Just for the 
audience and for context, the Democrats had total control of 
Congress the last couple years, and none of that vision or 
those proposals have come to fruition, and Republicans had 
total control of Congress when I got here. Both sides have 
contributed. Neither of them have passed a Social Security 
proposal, a solvency proposal, and both parties have 
contributed to our growing deficits and debt. I think that is 
just a fact I think everybody needs to keep in mind when I say 
no party gets a pass, but I appreciate the sincere views and 
your vision for addressing the solvency of Social Security.
    Now, let's move on to our panelists. If there are any other 
Members or organizations who have written statements for the 
record, I will hold the record open until the end of the day to 
accommodate those who may not have had prepared written 
statements.
    [The information follows:]

    Chairman Arrington. Once again, I would like to welcome our 
panel of witnesses on behalf of our Committee. Thank you for 
your time and your insights. The Committee has received your 
written statements. They will be made part of the formal 
hearing record. You will each have three minutes to deliver 
your oral remarks. I now yield three minutes to Representative 
Bill Huizenga.

 STATEMENT OF HON. BILL HUIZENGA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN

    Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member. I 
am going to go quickly on this with this three minutes, and as 
has been acknowledged, our national debt is now $33.8 trillion 
and climbing. Just the interest we pay on this debt already 
exceeds everything we spend on children, and within three 
years, the amount we pay on interest will eclipse our defense 
budget. Social Security will become insolvent by 2034, forcing 
a 23 percent mandatory cut. Medicare Part A will be depleted by 
2031, even sooner than Social Security, resulting in an 11 
percent cut. As has been noted, this isn't a Republican saying 
this. It is not Democrats saying this. It is the Trustees of 
these trust funds themselves.
    So, I am not interested in a partisan food fight either. I 
want results that protect our seniors and current beneficiaries 
while preserving these key programs for future generations. If 
the status quo holds and Congress does nothing, simply put, it 
will result in a cut. A best path forward, in fact, the only 
path forward, in my opinion, is a bipartisan, bicameral 
solution, such as the Fiscal Commission Act.
    Before you or the public, frankly, writes this off as, 
``just another commission,'' know that we can learn from both 
the failures and the successes of our Nation's long history of 
utilizing commissions. For example, Simpson-Bowles suffered 
from an atmosphere of partisanship, much like what we see now. 
Yet, it focused the national conversation on fiscal reforms, 
and whereas the Greenspan Commission benefited from a clearer 
purpose, fostering agreement that helped rescue Social Security 
was the end result.
    Acknowledging these lessons, I introduced the Fiscal 
Commission Act in September, along with my BFF, my co-chair of 
the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum, Scott Peters, which has gained 20 
evenly divided partisan co-sponsors. Our commission proposal 
features equal representation from both chambers and both 
parties, is transparent and focused on clear goals, retaining 
Congress's Constitutional duties, and has real teeth. 
Specifically, our bill forces Congress to vote on a package of 
proposals offered by this bipartisan, bicameral fiscal 
commission. It begins with the four corners of the 
Congressional leadership, each appointing four members to the 
commission, 16 appointees total. Three of each leader's 
selections must be colleagues from our respective chambers, in 
addition to one individual from the private sector.
    This commission must craft a package of recommendations to 
both improve the fiscal situation in the medium term as well as 
to achieve a sustainable debt-to-GDP ratio in the long term. 
For any recommendations related to Federal programs for which a 
Federal trust fund exists, the commission must improve their 
solvency for a period of 75 years. No stone can be, or 
hopefully will be, left unturned, Mr. Chairman. In the first 
week after the 2024 election then, the commission must vote to 
report its proposal to Congress. After that, before the lame 
duck session ends, both the House and the Senate must put the 
proposal to an up or down vote without amendment and without 
delay.
    So, let's be clear, I don't expect that this will be an 
easy vote for any of us, and frankly, Congress has proven it is 
not able to simply pass a bill like many have noted. Yet, I 
believe a fiscal commission may not be the magic potion, as the 
Chairman had said, and it may fail. It may, but we cannot stop 
trying, and I do believe this is the most practical and 
immediate way Congress can break the status quo here in 
Washington. With that, I yield back.

    Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman from Michigan, 
and now yield to the gentleman from California, Mr. Scott 
Peters, for three minutes.

 STATEMENT OF HON. SCOTT PETERS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

    Mr. Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. 
Ranking Member, for holding this hearing. Despite a healthy 
economy, our country's deficit is growing. We are borrowing 
nearly $2 trillion a year just to pay our expenses, and as a 
result, this year we are spending more than $663 billion on 
interest alone. That is more than we spend on Medicaid. That is 
more than we spend on our children. Soon to be more than we 
spend on defense. Democrats should be very worried about what 
the ballooning debt and interest payments will mean for current 
and future investments in our kids. These interest payments 
crowd out the investments we want to make, like an expanded 
child tax credit, crowd out investments like making college 
affordable, and expanding apprenticeships, crowd out our 
ability to ensure the clean energy transition leaves no one 
behind.
    I have heard many of my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle contend, sometimes emphatically, sometimes indignantly, 
that we should get our debt under control through regular order 
with the tools we already have, and of course, they are right, 
we should do that, but I have been here now almost 11 years. It 
is clear to me and everyone in this room that we are not going 
to do that. That this process we have today, it doesn't allow 
us to get to 218 and 60. To spend less and to keep tax policy 
right, we are going to need something outside of that. 
Indignity will not solve our problem.
    And it is a problem of historic proportions. It did not 
appear overnight. Our failure to manage the national debt is 
not the sole responsibility of one party or one administration, 
as the point has been made. Over the last 20 years, our 
conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, President Bush's tax cuts, 
President Obama's extension of the Bush tax cuts, the Trump tax 
cuts, and vital COVID relief programs, on top of our trillions 
in annual borrowing, remember, $2 trillion every year have 
added more than $10 trillion to the national debt. When the 
Trump tax cuts expire in a couple of years, we will have a lot 
of pressure to extend those tax cuts. A commission with outside 
experts can help ensure we are driven by the truth about what 
really happens to the deficits when we do that.
    Finally, a lot of folks have said that Republicans want to 
cut Medicare and Social Security. I believe that some of them 
do. Under current law, Republicans are in the driver's seat. 
Current law says in ten years when the trust fund is insolvent, 
there will be automatic cuts to close the gap, an overnight 23 
percent benefit cut for the average recipient on the order of 
$17,000 a year, and I worry that come 2033, a year before we go 
insolvent, Republicans say, okay, let's compromise. Let's call 
it a 15 or 20 percent cut, and they will have all the leverage 
in the room.
    The best thing we could do to protect Medicare and Social 
Security is to act now, and to act now to get something that 
can get 60 votes in the Senate and 218 votes in this House and 
a presidential signature. A commission gives us a fact driven 
venue instead of some waiting till the last minute, backdoor, 
11th hour deal between party leaders to do that, and I think we 
should take advantage of it.
    So, I introduced the Bipartisan Fiscal Commission, which 
Bill Huizenga has explained. I welcome your thoughts, input, 
and recommendations to ensure we can make this process better. 
A commission is a good start. I think it is the best chance we 
have to deal with these problems, and I look forward to working 
with all of you to get a resolution, not just on this process, 
but on the policy. Thank you. I yield back.

    Chairman Arrington. I thank my friend from California and 
now yield three minutes to the Chairman for opening remarks.

 STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE WOMACK, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                   FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS

    Mr. Womack. I am not going to read my prepared remarks. I 
seek unanimous consent that they be entered into the record as 
submitted to the Committee. I just have a couple of 
observations, and then I think it is important that we get to 
the questions and answers. First of all----
    Chairman Arrington. Without objection, so ordered.
    Mr. Womack. Thank you. First of all, let me just say this: 
with all due respect to my colleagues, the only people that can 
fix this is the United States Congress, and to think that the 
United States Congress is going to be willing to do this is 
laughable. That is why I support a fiscal commission. We need 
an outside group of experts to help us understand what the 
absolute truth is. Now, I have advocated for, for a long time, 
a Fiscal State of the Union, a joint session of Congress 
specifically designed to target, I believe, the most important 
and incredible threat to the Republic as we know it, and that 
is the fiscal condition of this country. I personally think it 
would be much more beneficial to have a Fiscal State of the 
Union than that theater that we have once a year, sometime 
early in the year, called the State of the Union.
    I have got a couple of observations that I want to make. We 
have spent, this Congress has spent the better part of this 
year, going into last year, debating the spending on the 
discretionary side of the budget. It is about a third of 
government spending, probably a little less, but we have tried 
to convince, through our actions, that the way we are going to 
fix the fiscal condition of this country is by having these big 
food fights on discretionary spending, and that is only going 
to touch the edges.
    The real issues out there are in the entitlement programs 
and we have to do something. Now, I will say this, that if we 
wanted, we, either Republicans or Democrats, wanted to cut 
those programs, we would do exactly what we are doing today--
nothing, because those programs are going to be cut on their 
own in due time.
    So, I support a fiscal commission. Now, Ed and I, Ed Case 
and I, have jointly worked since 2019 on this sustainable 
budget formula and we will talk about that today, and that is a 
way forward. Now, it uses a debt-to-GDP target. It doesn't go 
after specific changes to get where we need, but we do need a 
fiscal commission to help us outline what are the options.
    Brendan Boyle talks about revenues. If revenues need to be 
part of that discussion, the fiscal commission needs to tell us 
revenues are part of that. If raising the age needs to be part 
of that discussion, then the fiscal commission will tell us 
that raising the age.
    I would submit to you and then I will yield back my time, 
that given the condition that we are in today, you cannot 
rationally take any option off the table because it only 
increases the cost of the remaining options. So, with that 
said, I support anything that works to get us to an end result 
that can save the fiscal condition of our country. I yield 
back.

    Chairman Arrington. Thank you, Chairman Womack. Now we will

fiscal commission, the Honorable Ed Case----
    Mr. Boyle. Watch that phrase around here.
    Chairman Arrington. Three minutes.

 STATEMENT OF HON. ED CASE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM 
                      THE STATE OF HAWAII

    Mr. Case. Mr. Chair, Ranking Member, good morning, aloha. 
You have my written testimony, which I am not going to repeat, 
but I will summarize it. Number one, our Federal finances are 
in dire straits and declining. Number two, continued inaction 
will prove disastrous. Number three, Congress has proven 
absolutely unable to do our job, at least without some help, 
and number four, a truly bipartisan inclusive fiscal commission 
can and will help.
    I would like to instead spend my time responding to some of 
the principal arguments against a commission. The first 
principal argument goes like this: we don't need it because we 
are not in trouble to start with. This is denial at its most 
insidious. We are in deep trouble and heading in the wrong way 
by any metric whatsoever, and the consequences of inaction will 
include forced and indiscriminate reductions in core base 
Federal defense and non-defense spending and foundational 
entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and 
we do a disservice to the tens of millions on Social Security 
and Medicare and the tens of millions more that are coming up 
on it by not stating that very frontally. The American people 
agree that this is a problem. In my reliable Democratic 
district, it is one of the top issues that is of concern to my 
Democratic constituents. This is not a partisan issue.
    The number two argument goes like this: fiscal commissions 
supersede Congress's role. No, we always retain our role at the 
end of the day. We have not ceded our responsibility, but we 
have not been able to do our job, and if we could do our job, 
then maybe we wouldn't need a fiscal commission, but we 
haven't, and we do. We have the ultimate decision. The question 
is how to present that decision to us in a way that we will in 
fact make the decisions that need to be done.
    The third argument goes like this, and we heard it from my 
respected Ranking Member, fiscal commissions have failed. They 
don't work. Well, that is a matter of definition. First of all, 
my colleague cited the successes in 1983 to save Social 
Security for 50 years. That came about because of a commission, 
the Greenspan Commission, which recommended the way forward to 
save Social Security. That worked. The Simpson-Bowles 
Commission, which is much maligned, actually did work in the 
sense of framing the issues to Congress, which led to the 
negotiations that did actually provide some a better path for 
our fiscal situation, at least for some period of time. So, 
they can work even if ultimately Congress doesn't agree with 
them.
    And fourth, substantively, the argument goes like this: 
let's skip forward to the feared result of the fiscal 
commission and therefore deny that we need a fiscal commission 
to start with. Let's just start debating the merits. The fact 
is that if we could actually have that debate on the merits in 
Congress in a reasoned, inclusive, broad way, that we would do 
so, but the fiscal commission needs to frame those issues, and 
so, to skip forward to a presumed result against the commission 
is the wrong way to look at it. We obviously need to make those 
decisions, but we need the help of a commission to get to those 
basic decisions to start with.
    So, the bottom line here is if you do agree that there is a 
major problem or a crisis, then how are you going to solve it? 
Because you haven't, we haven't. A fiscal commission is the 
best way forward through a difficult but unavoidable debate and 
we can talk about how that commission gets put forward and put 
together, but the bottom line is it is not really the process 
that matters, but the putting together of the commission to 
start with that we need to start there. Thank you.

    Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman from Hawaii and 
now yield three minutes to the Ranking Member, Mr. McGovern.

 STATEMENT OF HON. JIM McGOVERN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS

    Mr. McGovern. Well, Chairman Arrington and Ranking Member 
Boyle, thank you for inviting me to testify. I want to say that 
it is an honor to be here alongside my colleagues, who I know 
all care deeply about this issue, and I look forward to a 
productive conversation. I may be a little bit of an outlier on 
this panel, but let me say upfront that I am deeply skeptical 
of a fiscal commission.
    First, there already is a bipartisan forum where these 
kinds of decisions should get made. It is called Congress, and 
we shouldn't pass the buck to a fiscal commission to do the 
work that we ourselves don't want to do. If we don't want to do 
it, maybe we should leave. There isn't some secret formula. We 
either cut spending, tax the rich, or a combination of both. We 
don't need a commission to tell us that. We just need common 
sense.
    And I want to echo what the former Chairman of this 
Committee, Mr. Yarmuth, said in October on the same issue: the 
problem is not the process, it is the people. There is no 
shortage of legislation to address our fiscal challenges. 
Legislation has been introduced to extend Social Security 
solvency indefinitely, to demand that the Pentagon actually 
pass an audit, and to end the billions of dollars of subsidies 
we give to big oil, just to name a few. Committees and 
subcommittees of jurisdiction can hold hearings and markups. 
That is what we are supposed to do. That is what the American 
people pay us to do. The buck should stop with us.
    We also don't need a commission to acknowledge a few simple 
mathematical facts, and as the Chairman says, no one has clean 
hands here, but for decades, Republicans have driven up the 
debt with their tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations. 
Of the $33.8 trillion national debt, $10 trillion, nearly a 
third, is from the Bush and Trump tax cuts. My friends on the 
other side promised that both of those tax cuts would trickle 
down and pay for themselves. They were wrong. In fact, without 
those tax cuts, revenues would have kept up with spending 
indefinitely, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have and 
will add another $6.5 trillion to our debt.
    Look back further. Bill Clinton balanced the budget after 
Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush racked up the debt, and 
today Republicans are still pushing bills that would increase 
the deficit. The very first bill this Congress considered was a 
giveaway to ultra rich tax evaders that would add $114 billion 
to the deficit, according to the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office.
    So, I am a little skeptical of the sudden realization from 
my friends that they care about this issue. My friends tell us 
that millionaires and billionaires can't pay a cent more in 
taxes and not a dollar can be saved from the Pentagon's blow to 
budget, where we know, waste runs rampant, but when the time 
comes to pay for it all, they want to nickel and dime American 
families. Look at Social Security. It should be a national 
scandal that middle and working-class families have to pay 
Social Security taxes on all of their income, but millionaires 
and billionaires do not.
    And if we want to ensure long term solvency, there are two 
choices. Some on the other side think we should cut benefits. I 
think we should ask the ultrarich to pay their fair share. We 
don't need a commission to tell us that, and my fear is that a 
commission would be used by some as an excuse to slash Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal antipoverty 
programs.
    I know some of you are thinking that I am just a tax and 
spend Massachusetts liberal, but I think that investing in our 
people actually saves us money. Look at hunger. It is not just 
a moral problem, it is an economic one. Hunger in America costs 
us tens of billions of dollars every year in the form of 
increased healthcare costs, lost productivity, kids who can't 
learn. I go on and on. Investing in our antihunger safety net 
will actually save us money in the long term.
    Now, I hear some of my colleagues say that they lose sleep 
over the debt. Well, let me tell you what I lose sleep over. 
There are 40 million hungry people in this country. Half a 
million people who sleep out on the streets every night. 
Seniors on fixed incomes who can't make ends meet. Those are 
the things I lose sleep over, and so, yes, we ought to talk 
about the debt and do something, but the real challenge here is 
an increase in extremism and a lack of political will to make 
the wealthy pay their fair share and cut our bloated and 
wasteful military budget. I thank you, and I yield back my 
time.

    Chairman Arrington. I think, Mr. McGovern, you are not just 
a liberal from Massachusetts, you are a good man who happens to 
be a liberal from Massachusetts, and I appreciate your 
compassionate and thoughtful insight.
    Now, to round the Committee, or panelists out with final 
comments from our fellow Budget Committee Member and my dear 
friend who cares a lot about this issue, Lloyd Smucker, tell us 
about that commission in Pennsylvania. How did it work? How in 
the world was that commission successful?

 STATEMENT OF HON. LLOYD SMUCKER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                 FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA

    Mr. Smucker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this important 
hearing and for the opportunity to share with you some of my 
thoughts regarding a fiscal commission. I believe our debt and 
our fiscal trajectory pose an existential threat to America's 
future, and I think establishing a commission is our best 
chance of addressing it, and I say that based on my experience 
with a highly successful commission in Pennsylvania, which I 
would say was perhaps the most successful legislative effort 
that I have ever been part of. Now, I will acknowledge to those 
who have mentioned they are skeptical of commissions, that many 
commissions do fail. They are right on that, but this is one 
that was very successful and everyone associated with it 
believed that.
    So, it was the Basic Education Funding Commission 
established in 2014, and in this case, it was to address a 
decades old problem that existed in Pennsylvania of how state 
dollars were divided among the 500 school districts there. It 
was bipartisan, bicameral, and it also included representatives 
of the governor's administration.
    The commission held hearings around the state for over a 
year receiving testimony and input from all stakeholder groups, 
from experts, and even any member of the public who wanted to 
participate. It worked across two legislative sessions and 
interestingly, also across two governors' administrations, 
first a Republican governor and then a Democrat. 
Recommendations were released unanimously by the commission 
members in June of 2015, and they were enacted into law in 
2016. So, in a relatively short period of time, this commission 
solved a really very difficult and what had previously been 
seen as sort of an unsolvable problem.
    Some factors that were critical to its success. There was 
broad bipartisan agreement in the legislature on the nature and 
scope of the problem. For a fiscal commission to work, both 
parties must believe that it is necessary, and that goes for 
leadership as well. If either party or the President opposes a 
fiscal commission, it just simply will not work. The right 
people were placed on the commission. They were members who had 
skin in the game, including the chairs and minority chairs of 
relevant committees, and by the way, just to correct the record 
slightly, I was not the chair of this commission. There were 
two capable co-chairs. I was a member as the chair of the 
Education Committee in the State Senate at that point, but I 
suggest that our fiscal commission here should include the 
Chairs and Ranking Members of relevant committees like the 
Budget Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee, Senate 
Finance Committee, and the Senate Budget Committee as well, as 
well as Speaker appointees, and I think members of the 
administration are critical as well.
    Third point of why the commission was successful: 
everything was on the table and all options were considered and 
all opinions were welcomed. A fiscal commission must be willing 
to consider all options. Democrats and Republicans alike are 
responsible for where we are. The debt has increased under the 
watch of both. So, we all share responsibility and must 
consider options that we may not like.
    Final point, public engagement. Public education was 
absolutely critical to the commission's success and I would say 
it was perhaps the most important key to success of the 
commission and would be of the fiscal commission. The job of 
the commission would be to convince the American public that 
debt will impact them directly and that change is necessary. 
This is done through a very transparent public process and at 
the same time, amplifying the work of a debt commission with a 
corresponding public relations campaign, which is what occurred 
in Pennsylvania.
    We know it is tough work. There is no guarantee of success, 
but based on what happened in Pennsylvania and some other 
commissions, we know it can be done. We can change the 
trajectory. We can ensure the promise of America for future 
generations, and in my view, we have no other choice. Thank 
you, Mr. Chair.
    [The information follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Chairman Arrington. I thank my friend, Representative 
Smucker. Now, we are going to move to the Q&A portion before we 
have the Senate panelists join us. I will yield three minutes 
to myself to begin the Q&A portion.
    Look, I wish that I saw more political courage demonstrated 
on a lot of issues. Our country faces a number of challenges. I 
just happen to think this is one that will undo the Republic 
and will jeopardize every aspect of what we may disagree about 
in terms of the constitutional core mission of the Federal 
Government, but we can be sure that a sovereign debt crisis 
will undermine all of it.
    I think about the defense side. You are a defense 
appropriator, Mr. Case. We talk about crowding out investment 
in the private sector, which affects the economy, exacerbates 
the current situation with inflation and interest rates, but we 
are also crowding out important investment of taxpayer dollars 
in the number one job and responsibility of a government, which 
is to provide for the common defense or the safety and security 
of the American people. Tell me if you see that happening right 
now in terms of the impotence and--the impetus, not impotence, 
the impetus and urgency to act and act quickly.
    Mr. Case. Well, I think there is no doubt if you take a 
look at the trends, that interest is crowding out all of our 
discretionary programs. Interest is certainly crowding out 
defense. My colleague on that subcommittee and I both see that 
every single day, and it is certainly happening on the 
nondefense side. So, when we have these budget fights over how 
much to put into defense and nondefense, we are clearly dealing 
with a reduced total pie that is going to noninterest payments 
on our national debt. That is unavoidable by any stretch of the 
imagination.
    But I would go back to my colleague Mr. Womack's comment, 
and that is that is just part of the problem. We have to deal 
with Social Security and Medicare in this context, not only 
because we have to save those programs from insolvency and from 
forced automatic reductions, but because Mr. Boyle's comments 
are correct because we are funding Social Security and Medicare 
shortfalls out of that portion that would otherwise be 
allocated to discretionary funding. So, we are having a double 
whammy. So, we have to take this across the entire spectrum.
    Chairman Arrington. That is well said. I don't know of a 
time where Social Security's solvency and sustainability has 
been addressed ever unilaterally by one party. I don't know if 
it has ever happened. I don't believe it has, ever. So, we can 
talk about all these grand proposals we have on both sides, but 
it is just still talk and it is cheap, and cheap talk is not 
going to give peace of mind to the seniors, to my parents, who 
are both on Social Security.
    So, Scott Peters, Bill Huizenga, the whole panel, just one 
thing across the board. If we could do one thing differently 
than we did with Simpson-Bowles and other commissions, 
Greenspan, and others, that would help position us for the best 
probability of success, just name one thing. We will go through 
the board and then I will delegate the next set of questions to 
my----
    Mr. Huizenga. To me----
    Chairman Arrington [continuing]. Ranking Member.
    Mr. Huizenga. To me, Mr. Chair----
    Chairman Arrington. Yes.
    Mr. Huizenga [continuing]. One of the most significant 
elements of this is having a proposal that is not amendable and 
is forced to have a vote in both the House and in the Senate.
    Chairman Arrington. Thank you. Scott.
    Mr. Peters. I agree with a recognition that, you know, that 
was 20 years before the programs go insolvent, now we are ten 
years before. Pretty soon we are going to get pretty close to 
insolvency and we are not going to be able to do anything about 
it. So, with a sense of urgency.
    Chairman Arrington. Chairman.
    Mr. Womack. Up or down vote.
    Chairman Arrington. Mr. Case.
    Mr. Case. I agree with Mr. Womack.
    Chairman Arrington. Mr. McGovern.
    Mr. McGovern. I think we should bring legislation like Mr. 
Boyle's bill or Mr. Larson's bill, or my friends have bills to 
cut Social Security, bring them to the floor. Let's have the 
debate and figure this out. We ought to do our job.
    Chairman Arrington. In addition to the up or down vote, 
what would you add to a commission so that it can work?
    Mr. Smucker. Yeah, I have already mentioned, I think it is 
very important to have members on the commission with skin in 
the game, and that would mean perhaps leaders of the committees 
through which the legislation will ultimately go, and then 
secondly, I think we have to look at the commission as--a big 
part of the commission is a public relations effort, building 
support for the efforts of the commission with the American 
people. I think it is really important.
    Chairman Arrington. Thank you. Thank you all for the 
indulgence. I yield three minutes to the Ranking Member for his 
questions.
    Mr. Boyle. I have really appreciated this discussion. I 
mean, it is not exactly a coincidence or an accident that some 
of the most outstanding Members who serve in this body are on 
this panel. So, I am not going to grill anyone. Really, more 
than anything, I just want to give you an opportunity to 
address what I thought was one of the really key points in our 
hearing a couple of weeks ago about a commission. Chairman 
Arrington's predecessor, Chairman Yarmuth, served on one of 
these commissions, and he read something in his opening 
statement that I want to quote, and then I simply want to open 
it up to any one of you to comment on why you think it is 
either wrong or something is missing and what you would say in 
response to it.
    So, quoting him now: ``While some of the other Members of 
that committee might take issue with my evaluation, I believe 
the process illuminated one fairly obvious but unavoidable 
truth. The problem is not the process, it is the people. In 
other words, if Members of Congress are not willing to muster 
the determination and courage to take on our fiscal challenges, 
even the best ideas will never be implemented.'' So, I would 
just open it up, if anyone wanted to, Mr. Huizenga, and then 
Mr. Peters.
    Mr. Huizenga. I will go real quickly because I know this 
has been asserted that somehow we are ``new to this issue.'' 
This has been going on, and I quickly tried to get this sorted 
in my head and I ended up going down a little bit of a rabbit 
trail. I mean, it goes back to the 1930s where there were 
proposals along with constraining spending. For me personally, 
I got here in 2011, right after the 2010 election. I was one of 
the founding Members of the Balanced Budget Amendment Caucus 
that we put together, and part of that was to push through what 
had been in 1995 a very consequential vote on a Balanced Budget 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
    It failed in 2011, when we even had David Dreier on the 
Republican side, Steny Hoyer on the Democrat side, people who 
were here in 1995, who voted for it then and voted against it 
in 2011, but it also goes back to 1982. It goes back to 1985, 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act.
    So, there has been a pattern of this. I think that the 
unfortunate element is we have proven that we can get it close 
oftentimes, but we just can't get it across the finish line in 
a timely enough manner, and that is why I do think the up or 
down vote unamendable is helpful on that.
    Mr. Peters. I think the problem is that the incentives 
right now are exactly in the opposite direction. Congress has 
gotten used to eating cake for breakfast and getting away with 
it. So, what we do is we borrow money to pay our expenses. Now, 
I want you to appreciate all the criticism we have had of these 
tax policies and COVID relief pales in comparison to the $2 
trillion we are adding every year because we borrow money to 
pay our expenses and we get away with it because we go home, 
say I would have done, but I blame the other side. We all get 
re-elected. It is just not solving the problem, and I think 
that is why putting a fact-based commission together with, you 
know, experts on the ground, cops on the beat to force us to 
deal with the issue, I think is the most constructive way to 
get us away from those incentives.
    Mr. Boyle. You wanted to say?
    Mr. Womack. A couple of people in this room served on the 
Joint Select Committee on Budget Process Reform in 2018. The 
Chairman, myself, there may be somebody else in here. I don't 
see them, but I am going to use it as an example to reinforce 
what I said earlier in support of an up or down vote on 
whatever a fiscal commission would bring to the U.S. Congress, 
and that is in that Joint Select Committee for Budget Process--
and by the way, I think we would all agree, even my friends in 
the red coats back here would agree that the budget process of 
the United States Congress is broken. I mean, Exhibit A is the 
fact that on January 19, we will have the first of a series, 
probably, of discussions about whether or not we are going to 
shut the government down again, and this is based on 2024 
appropriations.
    By the way, I think the fiscal year started October 1. So 
just let that marinate for just a minute, but in the Joint 
Select Committee on Budget Process Reform, this group came up, 
16 Members, bipartisan, bicameral, came up with a set of 
recommendations that would have gone a long way toward 
establishing a process that actually could save us from 
ourselves, but at the end of the day, when the final vote was 
taken because we had to have five Republicans and five 
Democrats to vote for it, we had five Republicans, but we only 
had two Democrats, and, oh, by the way, one of those was Mr. 
Yarmuth, who has been quoted here at this table today. The 
other one, Mr. Kilmer, but four Members on these acceptable 
proposals from my friends on the left voted present. Present, 
which I think only illustrates and magnifies the importance of 
whatever a fiscal commission is able to do, a panel of experts 
to come back to Congress and say, these are the issues that you 
have to tackle. These are the options that you have to consider 
if you are going to fix the problem. Then I think an up or down 
vote is going to be required, or else it will go the way of a 
lot of commissions and be put on a shelf somewhere.
    Mr. Boyle. Thank you, and I know we are a good bit over 
time for the questions, but I didn't want to cut off any of the 
answers. I will just say this before handing it back to the 
Chair. One thing I think we can all agree on, on a bipartisan 
basis, is with the Social Security Trust Fund expiring or 
becoming insolvent in about a decade, Medicare Trust Fund is 
even sooner, we cannot solve these problems and wait until the 
very last minute, a year beforehand. That would just exacerbate 
the problem and make all of our options less desirable. So, I 
fully agree with the impetus that we address these challenges 
now, and with that, I will yield back.
    Chairman Arrington. It was a Freudian slip for me to say 
impotence and Congress in the budget process, I will say.
    Mr. Boyle. I am not touching that one.
    Chairman Arrington. Look, I know it may seem a little 
undisciplined to let the clock go beyond our three minutes, but 
I find that this is a serious issue and that we can have a very 
candid--with our audience of fellow American citizens here--and 
constructive dialogue to get to a real outcome. So, I am trying 
to keep that flow going and manage moving it along, but I am 
going to ask a couple more comments and then I am going to ask 
my colleague from Wisconsin to kick off his questions, line of 
questions for three minutes. Mr. Case, quickly.
    Mr. Case. First of all, I want to commend to the Committee 
this excellent report from the Manhattan Institute from 2019, 
Why do Budget Negotiations Succeed and Fail? And what this 
report concludes is that the marks of success are threefold. 
Number one, some kind of forcing mechanism for the decision 
makers to have to make a decision. I think that is really key. 
Number two, public support, which Mr. Smucker spoke to, I think 
it is really critical. I think the public does support this on 
a bipartisan basis, and number three, healthy negotiations, 
which does very much get to the people.
    I think that in Congress and to your question, Mr. Boyle, 
it is the people, not the process. If we all had confidence in 
a polarized Congress to actually have people come together to 
negotiate and decide this on a bipartisan basis that had 
everything on the table as opposed to shouting down 
alternatives up front to kill them off before we even start 
with them, then we probably would feel better about not going 
with the commission, but the fact is that we are dealing with 
the world we have, and I don't think that the Congress is going 
to get better at this in the next couple of years, and the 
budget is declining rapidly. So, yes, it is the people.
    Chairman Arrington. Well said. Mr. Smucker? Mr. McGovern, 
did you have a comment? Go ahead.
    Mr. McGovern. Well, but he----
    Chairman Arrington. Go ahead, Mr. McGovern, then we will 
have----
    Mr. McGovern. Look, I think, you know, what concerns me 
about some of the conversation we are having is that it is 
about kind of getting the numbers aligned and, you know, on a 
balance sheet, and we are talking about how much we spend and 
not what we spend the money on, and there are some things we 
can spend money on that actually will save us money in the long 
term, and this is very much a values question.
    So, it is not just about getting numbers aligned on a 
balance sheet. It is about what our values are, and again, we 
talk about everybody saying everything is on the table. Yeah, 
we have Members who have signed pledges that no new taxes. 
Well, then obviously revenue is not on the table. If you have 
signed a pledge that you swear that you will never vote to 
increase revenues at all.
    So, again, I hope we don't lose sight of the fact that the 
reason why people like me are so concerned about potential cuts 
to Social Security is because I think it is a vital program and 
people rely on it and cutting it would be devastating to 
millions of people in this country.
    Chairman Arrington. Good points. Mr. Smucker?
    Mr. Smucker. So, I would just like to make two points, and 
the first would be in response to Mr. Yarmuth's points. When 
people are doing or behaving, they don't need rules, and when 
we are doing our job in Congress, we don't need to look at 
reform, we don't need to look at rules, but when we don't do 
our job, and I think it is hard for anybody to argue that we 
are, then we are going to need to look at additional reform in 
the process, I think, to make this place work more effectively. 
So, my argument would be different than Yarmuth's. We do need 
reform.
    Then secondly, you know, I sort of, again, based on my 
experience, and it is only one experience, but I view the 
commission as a body within Congress that is helping Congress 
do its job, not as some separate organization that is taking it 
away from Congress, and so, sure, we can have an up or down 
vote. First of all, if people really believe that the debt is a 
problem and we all engage in putting forward a commission, then 
the role of the commission is, while it is doing its work, to 
bring Members of Congress along with it and to understand the 
problem, understand the potential solution, and by the way, 
bring the public in as well.
    So, it is almost like a special select committee. It is a 
vehicle that we put in place as Members of Congress to help get 
us to the point where we are able to negotiate. We are looking 
at everything, putting everything on the table and then we are 
presenting that as a package. So again, the argument of it 
replacing what Congress should be doing, that is not the way 
this commission should work, in my view.
    Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania. All very good and important counsel from the 
panelists. Now, to my friend from Wisconsin, I yield three 
minutes for his line of questions.
    Mr. Grothman. Well, thank you. A couple of comments first 
as far as that tax cut. I was here when the tax cut was done. I 
think a huge amount of time the Republicans sat in close 
conference is making sure that nobody could say these were tax 
cuts for the rich, and I can tell you on a personal level, the 
complaints I almost always got on the tax cuts were from the 
rich who got a tax increase because they lost their state and 
local tax deduction. So, to me we did disproportionately deal 
with that.
    I also want to point out as far as the necessity of tax 
increases, we just got done with a biennium in which the 
Democrats had both houses and could have used reconciliation to 
do what they have been promising to do for many years, and that 
is raise the cap on what you tax, for tax revenue on Social 
Security, and they didn't do it, and that would have been, I 
guess you could say solely a tax cut on the rich.
    Now, I am a little bit concerned, even though I am a co-
sponsor of the amendment--of the commission--people talking 
about putting Social Security on the table. I agree that Social 
Security is kind of a contract we have written with a good 
segment of America and there are all sorts of parts of this 
budget that should be unconstitutional under the 10th 
Amendment, and really should be left to the states, and if the 
programs are that good, the states would pick them up. I am 
thinking particularly things like education, corporate welfare 
under the Department of Commerce, the entire welfare safety 
net, which is so utterly broken, should be left to the states.
    Can you comment, one of you, and I share with Mr. McGovern 
that sometimes we haven't really looked at the defense budget 
like we should have. Could you comment on, when we look at 
balancing the budget, the degree to which the 10th Amendment 
should play a role and we should begin just shoving wholesale 
items back to the states who can do things more efficiently and 
are probably in a better position to judge whether these 
programs are effective?
    Mr. Huizenga. I will take the bait. I would say----
    Mr. Grothman. Let me just say----
    Mr. Huizenga. Yeah.
    Mr. Grothman [continuing]. It really bugs me that we have 
all these unconstitutional programs----
    Mr. Huizenga. Sure.
    Mr. Grothman [continuing]. And I hear congressmen say we 
got to bite the bullet and cut Social Security.
    Mr. Huizenga. Yeah, and I know, Mr. Grothman, you are a 
stalwart in bringing that particular issue up in closed 
conferences and in other places, and I commend you on that. In 
an ideal world, for me, as a constitutionalist, I would love to 
have those things back at the state level, having served in the 
state legislature, and I know you did too. I think we are more 
effective at many of those. However, at this point, much like 
my desire for a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution, I think that might be a bridge too far or a 
future bridge that needs to be crossed, that what we need to 
deal with right now is the immediate and looming problems that 
we are going to have with all of our--and by the way, it is not 
just Medicare and Social Security, it is all of our trust funds 
need to be examined, and there is a significant number of them.
    Mr. Grothman. Anybody else? I think we got over 140 
Republicans to vote to get rid of the Department of Education. 
I was shocked, but any other comments on using the 10th 
Amendment as a guide in getting us back to the straight and 
narrow here where our forefathers would have wanted us ahead of 
any, remotely touching Social Security?
    Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin. I 
think it is a great point and one that we can debate in a 
commission or on this Committee, and now I would like to yield 
three minutes to my friend who has been a leader on this issue 
as well, Mr. Jimmy Panetta, from California.
    Mr. Panetta. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to you and 
the Ranking Member for not just holding this hearing, but for 
the way you conduct this Committee and your focus on issues 
that are very important not just to us and this Congress but to 
the future of this Nation. So, thank you very much, and I am 
pleased that once again we are focusing on addressing our debt 
and deficits. While last hearing we had looked at the successes 
and challenges of past fiscal commissions, it is good that we 
are moving forward by actually talking and looking at specific 
pieces of legislation thanks to our witnesses.
    I admit as a steering Member of the Bipartisan Fiscal 
Forum, I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of one of the 
bills we are discussing, the Fiscal Commission Act that was 
introduced by two of our witnesses, Reps. Peters and Huizenga. 
This is a bipartisan bill that will create a fiscal commission 
involving bipartisan Members of Congress and outside experts 
who will propose a set of policies to put us on a fiscally 
responsible path. These recommendations will then get an up or 
down vote in both chambers. Now, this hearing also gives us an 
opportunity to compare and contrast fiscal commission bills, 
including those by Reps. Case and Womack and Senators Manchin 
and Romney.
    Now, while a commission will still require hard choices, I 
think we have heard that and we understand that it will 
facilitate the conversations that are necessary to discuss our 
fiscal issues and solutions in a fair and honest manner, and 
Mr. Chairman, you may say impotence, I say Viagra. That is what 
this will be in regards to looking at Congress, in regards to 
looking at our budget process. So, if we can empower a 
successful commission through one of the legislative proposals 
today, we may be able to set ourselves up for a more fiscally 
disciplined and economically stable future.
    Now, Mr. Peters, my colleague from California and good 
friend, of course, there has been a lot of focus on general 
revenues and annual spending, but we are facing a real cliff. I 
think we know that we have heard that when it comes to Social 
Security and Medicare in the near future, and I appreciate Mr. 
McGovern's comments. I think all of us do.
    And looking at the demographics, basically the issues have 
to depend on demographics, which we are not going to control. I 
think everyone here wants to ensure that retirees are held 
harmless when it comes to Social Security and Medicare 
benefits, but there are risks to doing nothing. There are risks 
to doing nothing. So, Scott, will we protect our seniors from 
benefit cuts if we do nothing to address Social Security and 
Medicare shortfalls?
    Mr. Peters. No, we will not, and that is the frustrating 
thing for me about being a Democrat trying to save Social 
Security and Medicare is that many people on our side of the 
aisle say don't touch it. Social Security is in the hospital 
bed with a weak heartbeat. We know it is dead in ten years. We 
are talking about 23 percent across the board cuts if we do 
nothing. So, those of us who want to save Social Security, we 
need to act now. Because as people have made the point, the 
longer we wait, the more expensive, the more difficult those 
choices will be and the more likely cuts will be.
    So, that is why I think it is really imperative for us to 
get on this right now. People want to make it a political 
issue. That has been successful, but now we are coming up on 
the precipice of the actual cuts to seniors that are going to 
take effect across the board. We have to act if we want to save 
these programs, and if we don't, we will lose them.
    Mr. Panetta. Thank you, and thanks to all the witnesses. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
    Chairman Arrington. Thank you, Mr. Panetta. I now yield 
three minutes to my friend from Virginia, Mr. Bob Good, for 
three minutes.
    Mr. Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for holding this 
hearing. Thanks to our witnesses. I think it is laughable to 
use a term that was used by one of our panelists already, the 
notion that Congress will have the wherewithal to reform 
mandatory spending when we have zero demonstrated willingness 
to cut our discretionary spending at a time, think about where 
we are today, at a time when we have historic deficits, we have 
historic debt, historic debt-to-GDP, historic inflation, 
historic interest rates, historic interest payment on the debt, 
the amount we are paying just to pay the interest on the debt, 
and historic downgrading of our debt, and yet, we have no 
demonstrated willingness by this Congress to cut our spending 
on the discretionary side, and I wish I had a nickel to help 
the deficit, but every time I have heard this year with our 
Republican majority, oh, it is not discretionary it is 
mandatory as an excuse for our unwillingness to deal with 
discretionary. Gosh, if we just didn't fund the stuff that is 
not authorized, or if we didn't fund the stuff that is not a 
Constitutional role of the Federal Government, that is a 
foreign concept here, obviously, but the snowball effect now, 
the snowball effect, it is going so fast now, the unprecedented 
debt, the monthly deficit of over $200 billion now, the 
interest rates, it is causing the debt to swell and surge like 
we have never seen before.
    We are on track as a Republican majority to have a year 
from now, a $36 trillion debt by next year's election. We took 
what, 200 years to reach $1 trillion in debt, and we have got 
$36 trillion in debt now, 40 years later. Thank goodness, I 
guess, we had the unlimited increase of the debt ceiling. So, 
as much as we can spend and grow the deficit, we don't have any 
limit to it until January 2025.
    It would seem that since all the discretionary spending, 
that is, you know, all of it, all $1.7 trillion or so, it is 
all deficit spending. It is all borrowed, again with a $2.5 
trillion deficit, that we would be willing to cut or reduce 
some of it, but we don't even have a consensus now. We don't 
even have a consensus now on to comply at least with the $1.59 
trillion that was the FRA levels passed by two thirds of both 
Houses, signed by the President. We don't even have a consensus 
that that would be the top line level for the remainder of this 
year. We are going to vote on no appropriation bills this week 
in our majority. The President signed again that level, and 
both Houses voted for it. We don't even have an agreement to do 
that level.
    So, no demonstrated interest in cutting our spending with 
the Republican majority, let alone of course, it wasn't even 
talked about the previous two years that I was here in the 
Democrat majority. I guess maybe it is progress, Mr. Chairman, 
that we are at least fighting over it to some degree, if 
unsuccessfully, on cutting our spending. We can't even get 
agreement in both Houses to pay for supplementals that we 
wouldn't further exacerbate the issue we are talking about 
today, but we can't even get consensus in here to pay for 
supplementals, let alone on the House floor or in our friends 
across in the Senate.
    If not now, when? If not us, who? Do some of us just lack 
an understanding? Do some of us just lack a care about what 
this will do? As Mr. Chairman said in addition to the border, 
this is the issue that will crush and destroy the country, and 
none of the commissions matter. Whichever one's better, none of 
them matter unless we are willing to implement them. So, I 
yield back, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman from Virginia. I 
agree with his sentiments. The Speaker, I will say, our new 
Speaker, I am encouraged by his willingness to set a precedent 
that we will in fact pay for emergency supplementals, and I 
thought that was a really good sign and I hope we can build on 
that.
    Mr. Good. That was historic.
    Chairman Arrington. It was historic, and I would like to 
now yield to my friend, also from the mother of all states, Mr. 
Scott from Virginia for three minutes.
    Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I get a 
little tired of this both sides thing. I just want to remind 
everybody that for the last 60 years, every Democratic 
Presidential Administration, every Democratic Administration 
has left their Republican successors a better deficit than they 
inherited, without exception, and every Republican during that 
time, every Republican Administration has left for their 
Democratic successors a worse deficit situation, without 
exception.
    So, it is not both sides. We have heard the mention of a 
continuation of some of the Bush tax cuts under Obama. I voted 
against that because I thought it was a bad idea, but even so, 
the deficit as a percentage of GDP went down under Obama, and 
when President Trump came in, he increased the deficit before 
the pandemic, and so, it is not both sides.
    And we have a problem and everybody knows what the problem 
is. The problem is we need to cut spending or increase revenue 
or both. A commission can say you need to cut a percentage of 
this, a percentage of that. I assume they are not going to get 
down too much into specifics, but Congress will still need to 
make those decisions. The commission doesn't make that 
situation any easier. It just gives temporary cover to those 
who don't want to decide.
    Now, some are suggesting that we have a spending problem, 
not a revenue problem. Fact is, we have a pay for what you 
spend problem, and if you compare Obamacare to Medicare Part D, 
when we passed Obamacare, we paid for it. We raised enough 
taxes to pay for that spending, and so, the decision was if you 
want Obamacare, here are the taxes that are going to pay for 
it. If you don't want to pay for it, you don't get Obamacare, 
and we decided, yeah, we want Obamacare, and we took the taxes 
along with it. Medicare Part D. How would you like a 
prescriptive drug benefit? Sounds good to me. Well, how are you 
going to pay for it? We didn't worry about it, and $500 billion 
in spending not paid for.
    Now, we have already heard that one major reason for our 
deficit is the unpaid for tax cuts. Under Republicans, you 
don't have to pay for tax cuts. Just how would you like a tax 
cut? Well, let's do it. So, if we just paid for our spending 
and paid for our tax cuts, we have heard that $10 trillion of 
the debt wouldn't be where it is today. Mr. McGovern, let me 
ask you a question. Can the conclusions of a commission be 
manipulated by the appointment of Members who have preexisting 
ideas like Social Security needs to be cut?
    Mr. McGovern. Absolutely, and, you know, I have been 
listening to some of the comments. Mr. Grothman, you know, 
talked about the importance of a commission, but he also signed 
a pledge saying that he will never raise taxes.
    Mr. Scott. So, just----
    Mr. McGovern. Yeah.
    Mr. Scott [continuing]. Who is on a commission can kind 
of----
    Mr. McGovern. Yeah, absolutely.
    Mr. Scott [continuing]. Predetermine what the conclusions 
are? And does this up or down vote thing, Mr. McGovern, make it 
more or less likely that Social Security and Medicare will be 
cut?
    Mr. McGovern. I fear that it will make it more likely it 
will be cut.
    Mr. Scott. I yield back.
    Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman from Virginia. I 
now yield three minutes to my friend from Utah, Mr. Blake 
Moore.
    Mr. Moore. Thank you, Chairman. Thanks for holding this. We 
had a great conversation about this a month or so ago, and it 
is even better to have actual official legislation on the books 
with the House in a bicameral way and the Senate talking about 
it today. Look, the Chairman highlighted my main point, and so 
I will just quickly ask Representative Huizenga and ask 
Representative Peters to weigh in as well. I work closely with 
you both on the Bipartisan Fiscal Forum. I got four boys and 
given a general timeline of how my wife and I want to see their 
lives progress when they are raising their young kids, maybe 
have their first major job, they are going to send, every tax 
dollar they send to Washington, half of it is going to be 
paying interest, and that is a different paradigm than what I 
am doing now and what my parents did. It is a totally new 
paradigm, and I look at it as we have ten years to address this 
and have any chance to avoid that catastrophic effect. Do you 
see this commission idea as the best way forward for us right 
now to take action, Representative Huizenga?
    Mr. Huizenga. Yes. I don't think it is going to be that 
magic potion that has been acknowledged by the Chair and 
others, but it has to be a piece of the puzzle.
    Mr. Moore. Anything to add?
    Mr. Peters. I think, too, as I said, I think the incentives 
here are wrong for solving the problem. The incentives are to 
avoid the problem. I also would just say, in light of some of 
the previous comments, that having a cop on the beat, experts 
in the room to inform us of what the truth is, is really 
important here. I think that there are investments that do pay 
that you should borrow from. We should understand that and not 
use that as an excuse for borrowing to pay for the groceries, 
is what we are doing.
    The other thing is, I would say, just in response to the 
Chairman, Democrats want a cop on the beat when you talk about 
tax policy. The Speaker said that he was paying for the 
supplemental, but what he offered was an IRS cut that would 
have actually doubled the cost of it, and that is the kind of 
thing I don't want to hear. I want a cop on the beat. Somebody 
to tell me the truth about Republican tax policy. You want 
someone, a cop on the beat, someone to tell you the truth about 
the value of whether the value of Democratic investments pay 
off. We don't have that today, and that is why we need a 
commission.
    Mr. Moore. I think you bring up a great point because we 
are ships in the night, Republicans and Democrats, on how to 
adhere to CBO, right? We have differences on how we believe CBO 
actually addresses their projections, right? I personally wish 
we were taking a longer-term perspective into consideration, 
and I think we would have a more realistic approach to how this 
stuff plays out.
    We are, and I can speak for every single one of my 
Republican colleagues, a strong supporter of economic growth 
and making sure that we have pro-growth tax policy, and 
sometimes that doesn't play out well with a line-item CBO 
score. It doesn't, and we recognize that, and it is tough to 
reconcile because we have this CBO score that we all have to 
address, but we have to have strong economic growth. I don't 
see the fiscal commission as anything that would deter from 
that if we can continue to make sure that we have pro-growth 
tax policies.
    Representative Huizenga, anything else to add before I 
yield my time back?
    Mr. Huizenga. I would just say historically, deficit 
spending happened when there was either economic or literal war 
happening. We have been deficit spending in the good times when 
we haven't had those. That has compounded the problem.
    Mr. Moore. Thank you. I yield back.
    Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman. Just because I 
was mentioned in a comment I made about the pay for, I would 
just say to my friend from California that it is just a pay 
for. It is, leaders make decisions. They don't pass the buck, 
and the decision by the Speaker was to pay for it by offsetting 
the $80 billion expansion of the IRS, and I think we all agree 
that we should enforce tax policy. How we do it in the most 
cost-effective way is another discussion and debate.
    I think the Speaker would welcome a response from the 
Senate. I bet we don't get one in terms of what alternative 
options for pay fors are. So, I got to give the Speaker credit 
for at least putting on paper what he believes would be a 
responsible pay for, and I bet he is open to real dialogue 
about other alternatives if alternatives were presented by Mr. 
Schumer. With that, I would like to yield three minutes to my 
friend Mr. Blumenauer from the great State of Oregon.
    Mr. Blumenauer. Thank you. I must confess I am having 
flashbacks. I have been doing a lot of reminiscing recently, 
closing out 50 years of public service, and I have memories of 
what I did chairing a tax committee in Oregon, working in local 
government with thorny, very controversial issues and different 
approaches that worked and then some that didn't. I think we 
could with these six panel members, we could actually hammer 
out an approach. It is helping Congress do its job as several 
of you have mentioned.
    I am deeply concerned that we as a Congress are not taking 
advantage of opportunities that shouldn't be controversial. I 
have raised savings in terms of a farm subsidy that I did 
earlier with Speaker Ryan that could make a huge difference. 
There are areas in the Defense Department. We have talked about 
the battleship that the Navy doesn't want that is kept alive 
just simply for the jobs in Florida. This is not rocket 
science.
    Now, I came in, I must say, skeptical about another 
commission. Maybe it is the triumph of hope over experience, as 
Benjamin Franklin said about second marriages, but I do think 
that there is a role for what is being talked about here. There 
is an opportunity for us to be able to fashion a consensus with 
a different approach. One thing we haven't talked about, and 
that is engaging the public in this mechanism, and some of you 
have been involved with efforts that engage broad public 
involvement in terms of where they would put Federal budget 
priorities, quite different than what Congress does in the 
controversies.
    There are mechanisms about how people would solve the 
Social Security problem, and it really would provide cover. It 
is pretty balanced and effective, and it would work. They don't 
tie themselves in knots, and I don't think we delegate it 
entirely, but I think in actually having some mechanisms to 
engage the public can cut through some of the falderal.
    I reluctantly, I am not going to be here, but I do think 
there is a role for a carefully crafted commission to provide 
some guardrails to force some of these things going forward. 
Because what we are doing now is adding to the deficit, not 
just in terms of avoiding the problem, but there are costs for 
the failure that we have. Every run up to a shutdown adds to 
the deficit because of the unnecessary costs and confusion, and 
Mr. McGovern wants us to think about how we are actually 
spending the money. We don't do that in Congress.
    So, I am hopeful that a commission can help. I do think 
there needs to be a role to engage the public. I have had a 
notion, a national Save Social Security Day, where we would 
have high school students and college students come together on 
one of those simulations and do something that would engage the 
public in a broader sense. I do think there is a role for the 
mechanism that we have with the Base Closing Commission because 
it forces us to act. It used to be the third rail. It has been 
extraordinarily successful, and I think a combination of a 
commission, a mechanism that forces action, and engaging the 
public would help us move it forward.
    Chairman Arrington. Well said.
    Mr. Blumenauer. Because I think this is an important thing 
for us to do.
    Chairman Arrington. Very thoughtful. Thank you, Mr. 
Blumenauer. Look, our Senate colleagues are here, and I am 
going to do something that is a little unorthodox. We haven't 
done it, but we are going to attempt at a rapid round of just 
thoughts, and I apologize for not giving my colleagues the 
opportunity to ask questions of this group of panelists, but 
you are our colleagues. We know where you live, as we say.
    So, if Mr. Estes from Kansas, take a minute, share your 
thoughts, your takeaways, anything you want to emphasize, and 
then we are going to go to Mr. Espaillat and then Ms. Bice and 
work our way through the list. Just a rapid round of thoughts, 
please.
    Mr. Estes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is important for us 
to talk about this. Over the last year, we have borrowed 
$90,000 a second, and it is important for us to come out and 
address this. We know that over the last 40 years, there have 
been several commissions implemented. Some of them worked, some 
of them didn't. The Social Security Trust Fund that has been 
talked about today would have been empty in 1983 without a 
commission that successfully worked for that. So, we have got 
to be able to focus on that. We have got to be able to make 
sure that we take those lessons learned, whether it is from 
Pennsylvania, whether it is from the discussions in 2018, and 
how do we create a successful commission with the right checks 
and balances and implementation schedule, up or down vote and 
other issues, and make sure that works. So, with that, I will 
yield back. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to talk 
about this very important topic and appreciate all of you as 
panelists being here.
    Mr. Bergman [presiding]. Thank you. The batting order is 
Mr. Espaillat, you have a minute.
    Mr. Espaillat. I am glad I am the cleanup hitter, but thank 
you, Mr. Chairman, and fiscal commissions have generally 
failed. We saw how Speaker McCarthy's H.R. 5525 failed. Very 
bipartisan stuff going on makes it almost impossible to 
reconcile, but is it really service cuts, benefits are the very 
needed, or is it a lack of revenue as a result of decades of 
tax cuts to the very rich? Corporate welfare, if you may? That 
is the question. Do we have enough revenue to help out AARP and 
the seniors that are here today that are very needy?
    I represent the district in the Heights. You may have seen, 
Washington Heights, you may have seen the movie where we have a 
significant number of people dependent on benefits and their 
rent overburdens them. Over 55 percent of their salaries are 
spent on rent, and so, is it really tax cuts to the people that 
are starving, or is it a lack of revenue? Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Mr. Bergman. Ms. Schakowsky, you have a minute.
    Ms. Schakowsky. Let me just say, I have had an experience 
with such a study, such a commission. I was on the Simpson-
Bowles Commission many years ago in 2010, and this was about 
coming up with a budget agreement and we couldn't do it, and I 
have felt since then, and I was happy that we couldn't because 
the proposal that was on the table was to include cutting 
Social Security, which I said no, and I had my own plan.
    But it seems to me that doing this kind of commission is a 
way for Members of Congress to get out from under having to 
take the blame for the kinds of cuts that may be presented, and 
I think that this is the kind of discussion and John Yarmuth 
certainly agreed that we have enough capacity to do with the 
Committees that we have to do something, and I just wanted to 
ask my dear colleague well, if I could just ask Jim McGovern to 
comment on that. Do you think we----
    Mr. Bergman. Ms. Schakowsky, we are at----
    Ms. Schakowsky [continuing]. Need this?
    Mr. Bergman [continuing]. I am going to ask you to, we are 
trying to roll this with a minute. Jim, you got a three-word 
answer?
    Mr. McGovern. I didn't hear the question because you 
interrupted.
    Ms. Schakowsky. The question is----
    Mr. Bergman. I want her to repeat the question.
    Ms. Schakowsky [continuing]. Do we really need such a 
commission?
    Mr. McGovern. No, I don't believe that we should have a 
commission. I think we do have the capacity to be able to 
resolve these issues and we have proposals that we should bring 
to the floor and debate them and vote up or down on them.
    Mr. Bergman. Thank you, and Mr. Brecheen, you are 
recognized for a minute.
    Mr. Brecheen. Waive.
    Mr. Bergman. Ms. McClain, you are recognized for a minute.
    Ms. McClain. Thank you. One thing, I want to get a plug in 
for all these horrible, awful businesses out there. As a 
business owner myself, the business owners, last I checked, we 
have a progressive tax system. It is the businesses who 
actually pay taxes themselves. Not all of them are horrible, 
and number two, it is the businesses who actually employ people 
who, yes, they pay taxes, and I might want to remind everybody 
that it is the economic system that gives us our social 
program. So, I think we should incentivize businesses to be 
profitable and to hire more people who, in essence, pay more 
taxes, but that is a separate topic.
    I also want to think and talk about, and I haven't heard 
much of. I think the commission is a good idea, bad idea, it 
doesn't matter. I actually seem to think it is a good idea, but 
with that business idea, I would like to hear about two things. 
How do we follow the rules? Because if we have a commission and 
the commission says X, we in Congress have a tendency to raise 
the rules.
    Mr. Bergman. Will the gentlewoman yield? We are in a 
minute.
    Mrs. Mcclain. Yep.
    Mr. Bergman. Quick round here, okay?
    Mrs. McClain. So, rules and accountability. I would like to 
hear a little bit more talk about that. Thank you.
    Mr. Bergman. Okay, thank you. Without objection, I would 
like to submit for the record a letter in support of a 
bipartisan fiscal commission from my friend and colleague, 
representative David Schweikert of Arizona, who is a partner in 
fiscal accountability and as Vice Chairman of the Joint 
Economic Committee. So ordered.
    [The information follows:]

    Mr. Bergman. With that, thank you again, Representative 
Huizenga, Representative Peters, Representative Womack, 
Representative Case, Representative McGovern, and 
Representative Smucker for appearing before us today. This 
concludes our first witness panel.
    Mr. Boyle. Thank you, gentlemen.
    [Recess.]
    Chairman Arrington. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let's 
continue with our second panel of witnesses, our friends and 
truly stalwart leaders on the issue of not just the debt 
commission, but other strategies to address this looming crisis 
and this unsustainable path that we are on. Both of these 
gentlemen recognize that and we are all grateful for your 
leadership. So, welcome Senator Manchin and Senator Romney. 
They together have introduced Senate Bill 3262, which I 
mentioned earlier, the Fiscal Stability Act of 2023.
    We want to thank you again for your time today. I know due 
to scheduling conflicts that we will only have you for a short 
while, but it is going to be----
    Mr. Romney. We will stay longer if you want.
    Chairman Arrington. Well, we want to respect your time, but 
we want it to be a meaningful experience. So, we are going to 
start with your testimony, and then we are going to ask a 
couple of questions before you have to go back to the upper 
chamber. So, with that, let me yield five minutes to Senator 
Joe Manchin, and again, we appreciate you being here.

 STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN, A SENATOR IN CONGRESS FROM THE 
                     STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA

    Mr. Manchin. Thank you, Chairman Arrington and Ranking 
Member Boyle, for providing me with the opportunity to appear 
before the House Budget Committee today, and all the Members 
here. I appreciate being here. I would also like to thank my 
friend and colleague, Senator Romney, for his dedication to 
seeking solutions for our Nation's fiscal challenges, and thank 
you to the Committee for steadfast commitment to improving our 
fiscal health.
    The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 sets a timeline for 
Congress to follow when it comes to the budget process. So, we 
have it in law that by April 15 of each year, Congress must, I 
will repeat, must pass a budget resolution, and by September 30 
of each year, Congress must pass all 12 appropriations bills. 
Unfortunately, it is a timeline without any teeth.
    On September 30, 1996, Congress passed all 12 appropriation 
bills for Fiscal Year 1997. As the Committee is likely aware, 
the national debt at that time was $5.4 trillion. Today, we 
spend that much and more in one year, and the national debt 
exceeds $33.7 trillion. On August 5, 1997, Congress and 
President Clinton enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, 
which was negotiated in a bipartisan way by then White House 
Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and then House Budget Committee 
Chair John Kasich. Among other things, it set enforceable 
budget caps for Fiscal Years 1998 through 2002. What followed 
those bipartisan compromises were balanced budgets and 
surpluses of more than $550 billion.
    Unfortunately, the United States of America has not posted 
a surplus since. Over 22 years in the red, every year, we spend 
more than we take in. There have been attempts to get us back 
on track. In 2010, the Simpson-Bowles Commission published 
recommendations that would have capped spending at 21 percent 
of GDP and reduced debt to 65 percent of GDP by 2020. 
Unfortunately, Congress refused to act for political reasons.
    In August 2011, Congress tried again with the Budget 
Control Act of 2011, which coupled a debt ceiling increase with 
a mandate of more than $2 trillion in cuts. Unfortunately, 
Congress again refused to act for political reasons, blowing 
through those caps and spending another $1.3 trillion more than 
we took in.
    Now it is too late for another warning. In 2011, Standard 
and Poor's downgraded the U.S. credit rating from a AAA to AA+. 
In the past few months alone, Fitch has followed suit, and 
Moody's Corporation is on the brink of its own downgrade. We 
are the only AAA rated country in the world that does not have 
a multiyear fiscal planning process. The only one.
    We must reverse the catastrophic financial demise of our 
own making before it is too late. As evident by the chart 
behind me, in Fiscal Year 1997, revenues totaled $1.58 trillion 
and spending totaled $1.6 trillion. Fast forward to 2023, 
revenues totaled $4.4 trillion, while spending clocked in at an 
astounding $6.13 trillion. Outside the fiscal years during the 
COVID-19 pandemic, 2023 total deficit of $1.7 trillion was the 
highest in United States history. Let me repeat that. Last 
year's imbalance between spending and revenue was a record 
high.
    Years of fiscal irresponsibility have brought us to the 
crisis we face today, which is more than $33.75 trillion of 
national debt. In 2023, we spent more than $650 billion just on 
interest alone. By 2051, if we maintain this trajectory, the 
money that the Federal Government spends on interest to service 
the debt will be greater than what we spend on anything else, 
including defense, Social Security, Medicare. This is why 
Senator Romney and I, along with Senator Sinema, Young, 
Hickenlooper, Lummis, Warner, Cornyn, Tillis, and Shaheen, 
equally Democrats equally Republicans, introduced the Fiscal 
Stability Act.
    More than 227 years ago, President George Washington 
warned. He warned of two things really. The first thing he 
warned about is beware of the political parties for they will 
usurp the power from the people. The political parties will 
usurp the power from the people. In his farewell address, he 
advised also against accumulation of debt. Very much concerned. 
Fast forward to 2011. In one of my first hearings in the Senate 
when I came to Washington, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff was Admiral Mike Mullen. I just came from governor and I 
didn't know a whole lot about on the national concerns that we 
had on a national level with our defense. The question was 
asked: what is the greatest threat the United States of America 
faces? He didn't skip a beat, didn't waste a minute. He says, 
the national debt, the debt of this Nation will take us down 
before any foreign adversary will take us down with their 
military might. He said, don't worry about the military might. 
It will be we will take ourselves down, and he was so right.
    So, every family in America understands this, and this is 
what we don't seem to get right. Every person in America 
understands that they have to live within their means. They 
can't figure out why we don't even try. So, it makes the 
sacrifices today to give the children and their grandchildren a 
chance of life better than their own, we are basically, we have 
just let our future generations, especially our children and 
grandchildren, we have let them down so drastically. We are the 
only generation that will turn it over worse than what we 
received it, much worse.
    So, it is the American Dream. We are in Congress. We have 
an obligation to get our finances in order so our children and 
all of them to come after will be in a stable situation, and 
the time to act is now. So, I want to thank you all so much for 
having me, and I turn it over to my dear friend from Utah and 
he has the same passion I have for this.
    [The information follows:]

    Chairman Arrington. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Manchin. 
By the way, you just took my Ranking Member's place as my 
favorite Democrat in this place.
    Mr. Manchin. I don't know, Brendan's hard to replace.
    Chairman Arrington. Thank you for your thoughtful and 
insightful words. Senator Romney, thank you for joining us.

 STATEMENT OF HON. MITT ROMNEY, A SENATOR IN CONGRESS FROM THE 
                         STATE OF UTAH

    Mr. Romney. Thank you so much. It is impressive to listen 
to Senator Manchin. He said a lot. I hope we listen carefully 
to what he had to say, with which I fully agree.
    Chairman Arrington. Well, let's just say goodbye to our 
friend who wants to do nothing and leave Social Security 
beneficiaries with a 20 percent cut----
    Mr. Boyle. May I----
    Chairman Arrington [continuing]. As a result of our 
inaction.
    Mr. Boyle. May I just interject, Mr. Chairman?
    Chairman Arrington. Please.
    Mr. Boyle. Senator Romney, it must be refreshing to know 
that you still animate some folks on the left as well.
    Mr. Romney. Exactly right.
    Mr. Boyle. So, it must be reassuring for you.
    Mr. Romney. Exactly right. Well, I am actually here to 
announce our candidacy for----
    Chairman Arrington. Senator Romney, thank you for your 
patience.
    Mr. Romney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, 
appreciate the chance----
    Chairman Arrington. Continue.
    Mr. Romney [continuing]. To be with you and the Members of 
this Committee. Let me underscore what Senator Manchin has said 
about the urgency of us addressing our shortfall, our fiscal 
crisis. I am going to start with three reasons that this is 
something we need to do and do now. One relates to interest and 
I am going to get there by showing you as a percentage of the 
economy what has happened to defense spending, which is the 
solid line, and domestic discretionary spending, which is the 
yellow line, and where the CBO projects them to go over time.
    As you will note, our spending on discretionary items has 
come down both for the military as a percentage of the GDP, 
both for the military, and for the discretionary domestic 
spending, but because of baby boomers, what is going to happen 
on Medicare and Social Security is a very different pattern. 
Social Security is the orange line there and Medicare is the 
blue line. You will see that Medicare over the next--by the 
way, this first dotted line is current 2023. The dotted line 
over here is 2030, which would be six years from now, the end 
of the next group of Senators' term.
    So, as you will see the pretty dramatic increase and you 
will also note that we haven't yet layered on interest. If we 
now turn to adding the interest line, here is the interest 
line. The red line is interest, and you will note that as of 
2030, as of 2030, only six years from now, interest expense for 
the Federal Government will exceed either defense spending or 
domestic discretionary spending. That is where we are headed.
    So, we are going to have to do massively awful things 
either in defense or domestic spending. This is a huge 
increase. That is one reason we need to move soon. So, unless 
we fix the fiscal calamity, we are no longer going to be able 
to have a military leadership in the world and we would have 
major consequences for our safety and our national security.
    There is a second reason. Our mounting debt is placing us 
in the same hazardous category as Greece and Italy. This shows 
government debt, gross debt, and by the way, debt held by the 
public, as a percentage of GDP out through 2028. Ours is the 
red line. Here is Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Spain. 
Notice they are all getting better. We are the one getting 
worse, and we are now in a category as of 2028 where we are 
going to have more debt as a percentage of our GDP than Italy, 
and remember what Greece and Italy and the others went through. 
This is the trajectory we are on unless we take action soon.
    Simpson-Bowles told us about this crisis, but it is already 
here, and our legislation has a built-in path to avoid some of 
the challenges that were associated with the Simpson-Bowles 
failure to actually reach a conclusion. Let me just mention 
what they are. First of all, four corners appoint the Members 
of this commission. Three will be Members, elected Members, and 
then one will be an expert, but the expert will not be voting. 
Only Members will be voting on the commission's 
recommendations. The objective of the commission is to 
stabilize debt as a share of the GDP. It doesn't talk about any 
particular program. It just says, let's get our debt as a 
percentage of the GDP at a stable level.
    And finally, all spending is being considered and 
everything is on the table. We don't say, this program has to 
be added, that program. No, everything is on the table, and 
finally, if there is a bipartisan consensus, if we have 
Republicans and Democrats on this commission that vote together 
on a bipartisan basis to proceed, then there is a privileged 
process to take the legislation to the floor and to vote on it 
in the House and the Senate. In the Senate, by the way, the 20-
vote rule would apply. So, it is the same numbers required in 
order for it to become law, and, of course, the President would 
then be given the opportunity to sign it.
    If we don't fix this mess that our country is in, it is 
hard for me to imagine a circumstance where America is able to 
continue to lead the world. If we are spending more on interest 
than we are spending on defense, then how in the world are we 
going to keep up with China, which is already spending a lot 
more on procurement than we are today?
    So, this is a decision we have. We are either going to be 
known as a generation that took on tough challenges and solved 
them, or one that didn't. We all lived in the shadow of the 
greatest generation. If we don't fix this problem, we are going 
to be known as the worst generation. Our children, our 
grandchildren depend on taking action and everything's on the 
table.
    I will just mention one thing, and that is, when Bill 
Clinton was President, he looked to see what Republicans and 
Democrats could do together. Each came together and found an 
equal amount of tax increases, revenue increases, and spending 
cuts and got a deal done and got us on track and actually got a 
balanced budget. This is something we can do, but only if we do 
it on a bipartisan basis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking 
Member.
    [The information follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Chairman Arrington. I thank both Senators. We are honored 
by your participation today. I am inspired by your words and 
your courageous leadership, and I hope we can get this done. I 
really do, and I know you have a short time, so we will respect 
that, and we will continue this dialogue as we move these 
proposals through our respective chambers.
    I am going to ask, because I have done a lot of talking 
here at this hearing, that my friend, my best friend actually, 
from Georgia, believe it or not, former Chief Deputy Whip Drew 
Ferguson, we will yield three minutes to you for a line of 
questioning, and then I will yield to the Ranking Member. So, 
Drew?
    Mr. Ferguson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and normally when I 
sit down with Senators, I always say, as a Georgian, I used to 
want two Bulldogs, two Atlanta Braves, and two Falcons to be my 
pallbearers so they could let me down one last time. When I got 
to DC, I figured I really needed six Senators, but I am just 
going to let y'all, I am going to let y'all off the hook on 
that because I appreciate you all being here today.
    Bottom line, we have had a lot of discussion today on a lot 
of topics, mandatory spending, revenues, all of the different 
things, and we have had discussions about where should we be 
making investments? Is it in our people? Is it in our systems? 
Is it in defense? You cannot invest in anything if you are 
broke, right?
    And I go back, I am a process guy. I think if you develop a 
good process, you learn to love that process. The process will 
love you back. You stay on, you develop a good process, and I 
go back and I look at the one thing that is a common thread 
through every single person that has pledged to run for 
Congress and has been elected, and we have all said we want to 
be fiscally responsible. What is standing in the way of us? It 
is a horrible budget process. It is a process where there are 
50 acceptable pathways to failure and about one or two 
acceptable pathways to success.
    So, I think one of the things that I would, and I would 
love to get y'all's opinion on this, as we look ahead, how 
important is it that not only do we deal with a fiscal 
commission as you have advocated, but let's talk about, as part 
of that, do you see a budget reform process as being part of 
that? Because quite candidly, we have a budget process that 
yields an aspirational document that is really not ultimately 
tied to appropriations or tied to the authorization, and none 
of it is tied to the revenue stream.
    So, Senator Romney, I would start with you on this. Talk to 
us a little bit about process reform and how important it is to 
put a process in place that rewards early success and punishes 
late failure so that Congress is incentivized to do the right 
thing.
    Mr. Romney. I am not going to disagree with you. I am not 
going to disagree. I agree with you that we need to have a 
budget process which follows the law, and finding teeth to make 
sure that that budget process is followed is going to be a 
challenge which this commission can take on, among other 
things. I would note that I don't think process is sufficient. 
It is necessary, but not sufficient, and I say that because 
increasingly people have found we can make things mandatory. 
Both chambers have said, hey, we can put this outside the 
budget. We can put it as a mandatory spending item, and now 
almost 70 percent of our Federal spending is mandatory. So, if 
we had a perfect budget process, we may do a better job taking 
out some waste and abuse and excess in our spending. Although 
you saw that as a percentage of the GDP, domestic spending and 
defense spending is actually going down. Our challenge is we 
have baby boomers, a lot of us, and just recognizing that 
presents a real fiscal challenge for us, and we are going to 
have to deal, not just with the process of dealing with our 
budget, but also dealing with the non-budget, if you will, the 
nondiscretionary items of our spending as well.
    Mr. Manchin. Mr. Chairman, can I say one thing very quickly 
to that?
    Chairman Arrington. Please, sure.
    Mr. Manchin. We have the budget on the laws right now, 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974. It sets the timeline. It sets 
it basically April 15 of each year. We are supposed to 
basically pass a budget resolution and then again by September 
30, pass our appropriation bills. No teeth. You have heard 
about no budget, no pay, and all the different things. We have 
got to find a way to put teeth to the law we have, and if it is 
not going to be something as draconian as saying no budget, no 
pay, makes sense to me and back in West Virginia, if you don't 
do your work, you don't get paid, and if you do get paid, you 
have done your work. Pretty simple.
    But with that, why not have mandatory cuts if we don't do 
it on time? That is what could be done, and the bottom line is, 
if we don't, I am trying to preserve Social Security. I got 
400,000 people. Out of 1.7 million people in my state, 400,000 
depend on Social Security and Medicare. Social Security is 
their lifeline. Within ten years, they are going to have a 20 
percent cut. So, if Aunt Mary is getting $1,000 a month now, 
she is going to open the mail and get $800 and say, what in the 
hell happened? How come you all cut me?
    I am trying to preserve that from happening. That is what 
we should be talking about. How do you preserve the system? Not 
this. Is he on your staff?
    Mr. Romney. Not that I recall.
    Mr. Manchin. Okay. The guy that was screaming back here, 
okay, those people there, they don't want it because his 
generation may have to have some adjustments made, but anybody 
50 and over we have been talking about, we are preserving the 
system that we have, and they are trying to weaponize it is 
what they are trying to do. We can't let it happen.
    Mr. Ferguson. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you. I thank you all.
    Chairman Arrington. I thank the gentleman, and I now yield 
as much time as you may take for your line of questions.
    Mr. Boyle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
Senators, for being here. First, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the following in the record, letters to the 
both of us from the American Federation of Government 
Employees, the Bipartisan Policy Center, and the National 
Postal Mail Handlers Union. A letter to all Representatives and 
Senators from the AARP, and finally, a letter to all Members of 
Congress from the President and CEO of the National Committee 
to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
    Chairman Arrington. These are all based in West Texas?
    Mr. Boyle. I----
    Chairman Arrington. Without objection, so ordered.
    [The information follows:]
   [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Mr. Boyle. Good organizations, but well, thank you again 
and I very much admire both of your careers in public service. 
Just a couple points and then I wanted to give you both the 
opportunity to address something that my predecessor who served 
on one of these commissions that didn't succeed said when we 
had a hearing here a couple of weeks ago on exactly the same 
topic.
    First, I always point out to people because, you know, 
sometimes through nostalgia sort of fairy tales get told about 
a perfect past that was never so, sadly. Everyone points to the 
great example in 1983 where President Reagan and Tip O'Neill 
shook hands and they saved Social Security. That part is true. 
The part that is often left out is that we were literally just 
weeks away from Social Security payments being missed. That is 
how close to the deadline they were.
    So, I point out to people I have good news and I have bad 
news. The good news is we have time. The Social Security Trust 
Fund will become insolvent either 2033 or 2034 depending on if 
you use the CBO figures or the Social Security Trustee figures. 
So, we have about a decade. Medicare Trust Funds become 
insolvent a little bit before that. So, the good news is we 
have time. The bad news is we have time.
    And given the way human nature is, given the way Congress 
tends to act just basically based on deadlines, time in this 
regard is not our friend. I would also point out that, and you 
gentlemen weren't here for this, but in previous hearings and 
in the previous panel, where we had three different bipartisan 
sets of Representatives with their own commission ideas, which 
actually are very similar to what you have come up with. 
Ultimately, regardless of the shape and form of a commission or 
if Congress just finally did its job in terms of the 
legislative process, it ultimately will come down to a decision 
of either more revenues or cuts or a blend of the two.
    I have been quite clear I come down on the side of more 
revenues. I have a piece of legislation. I put it right there 
in writing what my plan would be to ensure Social Security is 
there through the year 2100. Sheldon Whitehouse has the 
companion piece of legislation in the Senate, and I think it is 
important to keep in mind where the American people are on this 
issue. According to Navigator polling from this June, when 
asked about approaches to reducing the deficit, 82 percent of 
Americans opted for raising taxes on the top one percent and 
corporations, including closing tax loopholes, and only seven 
percent opted for cuts to Social Security and Medicare. See, 
the American people are pretty clearly overwhelmingly on the 
more revenue side of this equation as opposed to cuts.
    Now, finally, I just want to give you the opportunity to 
respond to something. My predecessor, the Chairman of this 
Committee, John Yarmuth, who served on one of these commissions 
that unfortunately did not succeed, which has been the history 
of the commissions, the various ones that have existed over the 
last decade or two, and he said something in his opening 
statement that I am just going to read, and I wanted to invite 
the both of you to comment or point out where you think he may 
be wrong. He said, ``While some of the other Members of this 
Committee might take issue with my evaluation, I believe the 
process illuminated one fairly obvious but unavoidable truth. 
The problem is not the process, it is the people. In other 
words, if Members of Congress are not willing to muster the 
determination and courage to take on our fiscal challenges, 
even the best ideas will never be implemented.'' So, I would 
open up to the both of you to either agree or disagree or in 
any way react to what Chairman Yarmuth said. So, I will yield. 
Senator Romney, Senator Manchin?
    Mr. Manchin. Let me just say on, you know, I look back in 
history and try to figure out, Ross Perot ran as an 
independent, okay? He ran on one item, the finances of our 
country and made that his focal point of running. We were maybe 
$2-3 trillion of debt at that period of time, if that, but that 
was, he knew we were going in the wrong direction, and no one 
was stopping it. So, that caused some concern. We should have 
been alarmed, and we weren't. How many of us know people that 
we talk to that says, I don't mind paying taxes, I just don't 
like how you spend it? We hear that from everybody, people of 
high net values and all. How did we do it in 1997? How did they 
do it with Clinton and basically Newt Gingrich, putting 
Erskine-Bowles, the most responsible, reasonable person, I 
think one of the top ones I have ever met, and then having John 
Kasich, one of the most sincere people I have ever met on that 
side too, come together and form basically a rate, a tax rate 
that basically did not cripple or hamper our economy 
whatsoever. We grew under that. We were on a trajection that we 
would have been basically debt free by 2006. Debt free.
    We had 9/11 happen. We declared two wars, never paid for 
them. We had two tax cuts we never took in consideration, and 
then when those tax cuts, I was there when basically they went 
off, the ten years, all President Obama had to do was be 
silent, say nothing, and we would have been right back where we 
were, same thing with 1997, but they had to interject, anybody 
that makes less than $250,000 will not be affected in any way, 
shape, or form.
    Then, further down the road, just recently, as President 
Biden says, anybody that makes less than $400,000 will not be 
affected. We are all in this. We are all Americans. We are all 
in this. So, if it worked in 1997 up to 2001, we had balanced 
budgets, we had surpluses. Look at the last success we have had 
and see how that would cripple us today or not, and if it 
wouldn't, we have to start looking at how do we save the Trust 
Funds?
    I have got to answer to Medicaid and Medicare people depend 
on in my state. The Trust Funds are going to be basically 
insolvent, and we have talked about this. Take the cap off, the 
FICA cap. Okay. Well, if you said you spend it strictly to save 
the Trust Fund and not being going into the Treasury could be 
spent for discretionary or non-discretionary, whatever, people 
may be more acceptable. You have to look at everything and we 
don't have to cut and basically scare the bejesus out of people 
that we have in our home states right now.
    So somehow, we have got to calm it down but we have got to 
come to the realization someone is going to pay the piper here, 
and one of the graphs that Mitt had here showed that where our 
interest is going. When interest basically surpasses every 
spending item that we have, that is as critical as it gets.
    Mr. Boyle. Senator Romney, did you want to make a comment?
    Mr. Romney. Yeah, just a couple of comments. One, that poll 
is amazing. I can't believe there are eight percent of the 
people who think we ought to cut Social Security.
    Mr. Boyle. It was seven. It was seven.
    Mr. Romney. Was it seven?
    Mr. Boyle. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Romney. It is astonishing. I would like to see who they 
are because I don't know a single Republican or a single 
Democrat who thinks we ought to cut Social Security, reduce the 
funding for Social Security. They may exist out there, I just 
haven't met them. So, there is zero interest on the part of 
either side of the aisle to cut Social Security or cut Social 
Security benefits. Both the leading contenders for 2024, former 
President Trump, current President Biden, have both said we are 
not going to touch Social Security, and Joe and I fully agree 
and my guess is every Member of this commission would fully 
agree.
    The question is, well, how about for people in their 20s 
and 30s, what should it look like at that point? How long will 
they live? What should the tax be? I mean, what part of income 
should it be? Should we lift the cap as Senator Manchin has 
indicated? So, all those things are on the table for 
discussion.
    One thing that is not on the table is the idea that we are 
going to cut benefits. That would simply be unacceptable. It is 
not realistic. I do agree that we have to look to the people, 
the people that have been elected to solve these problems. Your 
quote about that is absolutely right, and what we found is that 
over time, we have come closest to dealing with this challenge, 
our taxing, spending, fiscal challenge, when there has been a 
bipartisan effort.
    Joe and I just worked together on a bipartisan effort on an 
infrastructure bill where equal number of Republicans and 
Democrats worked together, crossed the divide, if you will, and 
got something done. So, a bipartisan effort is what I think the 
Huizenga bill proposes, what we are proposing, they are very 
similar pieces of legislation, is saying, hey, let's create a 
bipartisan effort of elected officials to work together to see 
if they can come up with something that passes muster on both 
sides of the aisle, and if it does, let's vote on it, up or 
down.
    I do think that the urgency today, I mean, I didn't 
underscore this urgency, but I spent my life in the private 
sector, in the financial sector. It is going to get hard to 
sell U.S. debt and we might want to lower interest rates, say 
okay, we are over the tough times, inflation has been dealt 
with, let's bring interest rates down. The Fed is not going to 
be able to control interest rates if people don't want to buy 
our treasuries. Interest rates are going to start going up all 
by themselves, and you can have a spiral where interest rates 
go higher, our deficit gets larger. We need to issue more 
treasuries. We have to raise interest rates higher. We can find 
ourselves in a Latin America type circumstance.
    So, sometime during the next few years we can have failed 
treasury auctions, interest rates going up. This is the 
reality. I recognize Social Security Trust Fund runs out, 
Medicare Trust Fund runs out down the road. We have time on 
those, but the urgency of a potentially failed treasury 
auction, rapidly rising interest rates, and not being able to 
keep up militarily, that is with us right now.
    Mr. Boyle. No one should misunderstand me and the Chairman 
knows this because we have had a ton of hearings, I have never 
suggested that the deficit or debt is nothing to worry about. 
Clearly, and actually my colleague who was on one of the 
previous panels, Mr. Peters from California, points this out 
that interest taking an increased percentage of our budget 
should concern both Democrats and Republicans alike, probably 
for different reasons, but that is something on which we should 
all agree.
    I will say though, to your point, Senator Romney, I just 
looked this morning, the yield on the 10-year is down to 4.3. 
It was above five about a month ago, which was a peak. It 
hadn't been at that level in over a decade. The demand right 
now in the world for U.S. treasuries is still as high as it can 
possibly be. So, I don't think that we are anywhere close to 
the sort of nightmare Latin American-like scenario that you 
described but I am by no----
    Mr. Manchin. Congressman, if I----
    Mr. Boyle [continuing]. Means suggesting that we have 
nothing to worry about and that it will always be that way.
    Mr. Manchin. If I can say just one thing.
    Mr. Boyle. Yeah.
    Mr. Manchin. On that there are basically if you look at how 
much we have increased as far as the Treasury, how much of a 
quantity of easing we bought ourself----
    Mr. Boyle. Yeah.
    Mr. Manchin [continuing]. We have never been in this 
category. They went quite close to $10 trillion. They are about 
8.3, 8.4 now, and we were about $3 or $4 trillion back in 2018, 
2019. There is no reason in the world that we should be buying 
this much paper of ourself. We raise cane about other countries 
manipulating their dollar, their currency. We have been the 
worst in the world of manipulating our currency. Buying our own 
paper, and have false pretenses of what we have, and how strong 
our demand is. Demand is pretty damn strong if you are 
competing with us. We are competing with ourselves. That didn't 
make any sense to me at all.
    And I have said this, that if we don't stop and I think 
they have been bringing it down to a certain extent, but not 
fast enough, but go ahead, I am sorry.
    Mr. Boyle. I am sorry, I didn't want to cut you off. Were 
you----
    Mr. Manchin. I am fine. I am fine.
    Mr. Boyle. I can dispense with my further questions and 
yield my time to my colleague Mr. Scott, if he had questions, 
or if not. So, I will yield a minute or two to Mr. Scott.
    Chairman Arrington. Let's make it quick, Mr. Scott, just 
because they have got to get out of here.
    Mr. Boyle. Okay.
    Mr. Scott. Well, thank you. Well, I just want to make a 
point about, we have heard about giving credit to Mr. Kasich 
and President Clinton for that. I was there in 1993. I think I 
am the only one on the Committee. In 1993, we passed a budget, 
zero Republicans, House or Senate, and when we passed it, when 
the 218th vote was cast in the House by Marjorie Margolies-
Mezvinsky, it wasn't, way to go, Marjorie. No, it was, bye-bye, 
Marjorie. She lost her seat, along with a total of 34 Democrats 
lost their seats along with the majority. First time in a long 
time.
    By 1997, the deficit had already about gone, and so we 
didn't need a balanced budget amendment. The budget was just 
about balanced by then. All the political price had been paid. 
Now, I guess we give credit for George H. W. Bush because he 
paid a price a couple of years before I got there, but all of 
that heavy lifting was done in the 1993 budget without a single 
Republican vote, and then everybody wants to jump on the 
bandwagon after all the work has been done, after all the 
political price has been paid, and try to get credit.
    I did have one question, Senator Romney. I think everybody 
knows we got a problem, and the solution is, as we have said, 
revenues and cut spending, or combination of both. You have got 
all spending, everything on the table. Is that suggesting that 
there is no revenue as part of the solution?
    Mr. Romney. No, no. Meaning all the spending categories, 
mandatory, non-mandatory--discretionary, all of them are all 
available to look at, and everything is on the table, meaning 
revenues as well as spending. There are other ideas. There is 
an arbitrage idea that has been put forward by a couple of 
Senators. So, basically all ideas are open.
    Mr. Scott. Including revenue?
    Mr. Romney. Including revenue, yes.
    Chairman Arrington. The gentleman's time has expired. I 
think it is a good question.
    Mr. Scott. Could I just make one last quick question?
    Chairman Arrington. Sure.
    Mr. Scott. The Ranking Member said we have got time. The 
more time we take, the more expensive it gets. Thank you.
    Chairman Arrington. I couldn't agree more. Boy, I have got 
all kinds of good counsel over here. Listen, we can all talk 
about this all day because we care about it and we just want to 
find a path to success for the sake of the generations of 
Americans. I love what you said. I couldn't say it more 
poignantly and eloquently. People are counting on us to lead 
and make sacrifices and make tough decisions and we may be the 
only generation that fails to do that. The American spirit, the 
American way of putting the interest of the country before our 
political interest. That is really what this boils down to.
    Can this commission help facilitate that courage and 
getting to those decisions? I think we got to give everything a 
shot.
    Mr. Manchin. Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Arrington. What is happening now doesn't seem to 
be working. Mr. Manchin.
    Mr. Manchin. If I may say this. We have two bipartisan 
bills. You have one on your side----
    Chairman Arrington. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Manchin [continuing]. With Congressman Peters and 
Congressman Huizenga.
    Chairman Arrington. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Manchin. We have ours with bipartisan support. We have 
enough Members who aren't returning. They have decided to take 
a hiatus, okay? There are enough people here that will bite the 
bullet.
    Chairman Arrington. Yes.
    Mr. Manchin. There are enough people that will bite the 
bullet, do the right thing. It is a small price to pay for our 
country.
    Chairman Arrington. Amen.
    Mr. Manchin. We are in absolutely, we have never been in 
this condition before. We have never come close to this. So, we 
got to figure out how we can do this. Put the right people on 
that----
    Chairman Arrington. Yes.
    Mr. Manchin [continuing]. That aren't afraid, that aren't 
afraid to do something right, and I think it will be the most 
rewarding thing we do for our country.
    Chairman Arrington. Well said, and one last point. We have 
got to sound the alarm because we have been sleepwalking----
    Mr. Manchin. Yeah.
    Chairman Arrington [continuing]. Off the fiscal cliff and 
we are numb to the trillions of dollars, and our young people, 
they are especially numb to it because to date, we have had the 
reserve currency. We still have it to date, but when the 
dominoes start falling it is hard to put all the pieces 
together again, right? So, at a minimum, at a minimum, this 
commission can sound the alarm and have a national campaign to 
tell the American people and generations of Americans what is 
going to happen if they don't put pressure on us to have the 
political will to do the right thing for them.
    So, with that, any last word and then we will call this--
Mr. Manchin?
    Mr. Manchin. The only thing I would say--go ahead.
    Mr. Romney. I am good.
    Mr. Manchin. The only thing I would say on that is if the 
people in America know what would happen to the United States 
of America if we do not maintain the reserve currency of the 
world if they know what a factor that is and what it plays into 
our national defense, God help us.
    Chairman Arrington. God help us.
    Mr. Manchin. You want to raise the alarm, that is the way.
    Mr. Romney. We are going to sell our treasuries as long as 
we are the reserve currency of the world, but a famous person 
in a wonderful book once said in terms of going bankrupt, first 
you go slowly and then you go suddenly.
    Chairman Arrington. Yes.
    Mr. Romney. This is something we are going to have to deal 
with at some point. I hope it is not real soon, but we have to 
deal with and we need to be responsible enough, and we were 
elected to deal with the challenges we face. This is clearly 
one of them. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Arrington. Thank you for being generous with your 
time.
    Mr. Romney. I appreciate it, Ranking Member.
    Chairman Arrington. I appreciate all the comments. This 
concludes today's hearing, and with that, this Committee stands 
adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:20 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
