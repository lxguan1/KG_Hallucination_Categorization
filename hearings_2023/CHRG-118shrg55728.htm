                         WEDNESDAY, MAY 1, 2024

                                       U.S. Senate,
                            Committee on Veterans' Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 3:27 p.m., in 
Room SR-418, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Jon Tester, 
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

    Present: Senators Tester, Murray, Brown, Blumenthal, 
Manchin, Hassan, King, Moran, Boozman, Cassidy, Rounds, Tillis, 
Sullivan, Blackburn, and Tuberville.

        OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, CHAIRMAN,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Chairman Tester. We're going to welcome everybody to this 
hearing today. What the plan is here if we get 10 of us, and 
you'll just have to forgive me, if we get 10 Senators here, 
we've got some Leases we need to get done. So if you're 
talking, I'm going to probably gavel you down. You can take up, 
we'll do the business meeting, we'll get it done because these 
Leases are very, very important and this is the way it has to 
be done.
    That being said, I want to welcome everybody to today's 
hearing on the President's fiscal year 2025 budget for the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. All right, we are joined by the 
Honorable VA Secretary Denis McDonough and the Veterans Service 
Organizations, authors of the Independent Budget. This year's 
request is $370 billion, represents 10 percent increase over FY 
'24. I look forward to discussing how this budget proposal will 
ensure we're meeting our veterans needs now and into the 
future.
    It is undeniably a historic time for the VA, and for 
veterans' healthcare and benefits. With the PACT Act delivering 
the largest expansion of VA healthcare and benefits ever, and 
more focus coming into the system, we have to ensure that the 
VA can deliver for those veterans timely and in a way that they 
have earned.
    I know that is your primary focus, Mr. Secretary. VA's 
recent hiring surge allowed the department to deliver an all-
time record number of healthcare appointments due, in part, to 
the PACT Act. VA needs to continue to build on this momentum 
and continue to hire and retain quality personality, especially 
in critical specialties, mental health, and especially in rural 
America.
    When veterans can't be seen in a timely manner, or they 
have to drive too far for services, they need to be connected 
up with community care and quickly. In Montana, community care 
has played a key role in bolstering veterans' access to care 
and nationwide. In FY '23, nearly 40 percent of VA's total care 
workload was delivered in the community.
    But study after study shows that VA healthcare is as good 
or better to what the folks are getting in the private sector. 
And veterans almost always like their VA care more than non-
veteran counterparts, like in the private sector. So, the VA 
needs to maintain its capacity to deliver healthcare to 
veterans with an eye on safeguarding its role in medical 
education, research, and acting as our Nation's backstop in 
emergencies. And it needs to right-size what healthcare 
delivers and the healthcare that it buys.
    In addition to investments and the staffing, VA and 
Congress must continue to push for more stable funding for 
improvements to infrastructure. At the moment, we're barely 
scratching the surface. Without safe, modern buildings, and 
equipment, VA's direct care system will struggle to meet the 
ever-evolving needs of the veteran.
    On the benefits side of the ledger, VA needs to continue to 
deliver veterans quality claims decisions in a timely manner. 
It must also ensure the Board of Veterans Appeals is adequately 
funded to handle an increased workload. Passage of the PACT Act 
makes that more important as ever.
    Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for being here today. I 
appreciate your continued leadership and dedication to our 
Nation's veterans. I also want to welcome our second panel of 
advocates to discuss these challenges from a veteran's 
perspective on the ground and how this budget applies to them.
    With that, I'm going to turn it over to Senator Moran for 
any opening comments he would like to make.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN,
            RANKING MEMBER, U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Chairman, thank you very much, and welcome 
to Secretary McDonough and our VSO witnesses.
    I'm anxious to discuss the VA's budget request and what 
resources the VA needs to deliver care and benefits to our 
Nation's veterans. Congress and this Committee have a long 
track record of working in a bipartisan manner to provide the 
VA with the resources it requires. This Committee has worked to 
address major challenges veterans face, including streamlining 
access to disability compensation, and providing healthcare for 
veterans exposed to toxic substances during their military 
service.
    It is up to the VA workforce and leadership to faithfully 
execute the legislation passed by Congress, and deliver the 
care and benefits our veterans rely on. I know many VA 
employees in Kansas and across the country who selflessly serve 
our Nation's veterans.
    However, I hear from VA employees that despite record 
hiring and retention last year, the VA still faces staffing 
shortages, which are straining the workforce and increasing 
wait times for veterans. The VA leaders have repeatedly said 
there's not a hiring freeze, but that is not the message that 
the VA facilities across the country have received.
    In contrast, the VA has noted that community care costs are 
rising too rapidly, and VA facilities must recapture care from 
the community. The VA is also expecting to reduce 10,000 
employees in the direct care system, yet VA's system for 
assessing medical center performance for veterans shows 
meaningful decline in access across the VHA.
    Mr. Secretary, I'd highlight a letter that I think the 
answer we were requesting a due date today from Senator Tester 
and I on this topic of workforce and the 10,000. Mr. Secretary, 
I hope this afternoon we can have a frank discussion on these 
conflicting messages. Veterans deserve the right to decide when 
and where, and how they seek the care they need. I remain 
committed to making certain they continue to have the 
opportunity to make informed choices about their own 
healthcare.
    VA has a responsibility to consistently provide veterans 
with timely information, approvals, and improve veterans' 
experiences when seeking care. I want to highlight this point, 
and the Chairman mentioned this topic in his opening statement, 
but I want to highlight again; non-VA emergency care costs are 
the biggest driver of increased community cost care, yet the 
department has not articulated a strategy to address the 
emergency care spending.
    Additionally, I'd like to know the impact of VA's decision 
to delay preventive care and cancel appointments during the 
pandemic, and how that may now be impacting the current 
increased demand for emergency care.
    I look forward to our discussion today, and I thank you Mr. 
Chairman. I thank you, Mr. Secretary.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you, Senator Moran. I want to 
welcome Secretary Denis McDonough, Secretary of the VA. The 
floor is yours to talk about the FY '25 budget.

                            PANEL I

                              ----------                              


          STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE DENIS MCDONOUGH,
                 SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

    Secretary McDonough. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking 
Member Moran, and distinguished Members of the Committee, 
thanks for the opportunity to testify.
    Maureen Ropes is an Air Force and Coast Guard vet who comes 
from a long line of military service. Her family members served 
in Vietnam, World War II, and the Korean War. Maureen qualifies 
for community care, but chooses to get her care at the 
Manchester VA Medical Center. After a recent routine mammogram, 
Maureen was diagnosed with breast cancer. She says her VA nurse 
navigator Kelly Hunt, was by her side every step of the way, 
making sure that her surgery and radiation happened right away.
    Today, thankfully, Maureen's cancer free and receiving 
treatment to safeguard against recurrence. Maureen says, ``It's 
such a comfort knowing I have this team on my side.'' She goes 
on to say, ``The difference I feel when I get care at VA is 
significant. I feel like I'm home. The providers take that 
extra time to understand my complex health history. I feel like 
they see me.''
    We owe vets like Maureen and all vets our very best. We're 
fighting like hell to give them exactly that. We're delivering 
more care, more benefits to more vets than at any other time in 
our Nation's history. Since March 5th; expansion of healthcare 
eligibility to all veterans with toxic exposures, we've 
enrolled more than 12,500 veterans under that PACT Act 
authority alone. That's just since March 5th.
    And over the course of the last year, we enrolled over 
400,000 new vets, 30 percent more than the previous year, and 
an increase in all 50 states. 6.5 million vet patients had over 
118 million clinical visits, 47 million in the community, 42 
million in person at VA, and 29 million via telehealth. The 
last data point bears repeating, millions of vets use VA 
telehealth. Now onto benefits. We decided over 1.9 million 
claims, shattering the previous year's record by 16 percent.
    We've all heard justifiable frustration with CMP exams, yet 
in the last year, we processed 2.4 million CMP exams, a record 
by nearly 30 percent, and took an average of just 31 days to 
complete them. In total, we've delivered $163 million in earned 
benefits, billion dollars in earned benefits to over 6 million 
veterans and survivors. Another record.
    And the PACT Act has opened the door to millions of toxic-
exposed veterans and their survivors, bringing generations of 
new vets to VA healthcare and expanding benefits for many more. 
The PACT Act is also delivering additional benefits for 
veterans to the GI Bill, VR&E, homeownership, survivors' 
pensions, and so much more. Benefits that not only improve the 
veterans' lives, but strengthen the American economy.
    We still have a lot of work to do, and the President's 
budget fully funds VA's ability to do that. That work is also 
about preventing veterans' suicide, ending veteran 
homelessness, supporting healthcare for women vets, modernizing 
our IT systems, processing benefits, and honoring vets with 
eternal resting places.
    No single investment is more critical to the veterans who 
we serve in VA's future than the people we hire and retain. 
Teammates like Tarina Brafton, a housekeeping supervisor at the 
Cincinnati VA Medical Center. Tarina's husband is a vet. She 
says she goes to work each day striving to provide the kind of 
welcoming environment she'd want for him at VA.
    That's the kind of deep devotion that characterizes VA's 
people. And Tarina says she's grateful for the Critical Skills 
Incentive that she received, a CSI. Her daughter's prescription 
costs her $700 a month, and the CSI has allowed Tarina to focus 
on her work as a supervisor without the financial stress of 
wondering whether she'll be able to afford her daughter's 
lifesaving medication.
    Now, today marks the first day of nurses' month, where we 
honor VA's 122,000 nurses. Let me repeat, 122,000 nurses. The 
largest nursing workforce in the country. That's up about 
14,000 nurses since December 2021. Now, that's one reason why 
we feel quite comfortable with the staffing numbers outlined in 
this budget. The work of caring for brave men and women who 
fight our wars and their families, survivors, and caregivers--
do you have 10, Mr. Chairman? If you've got 10, I'm happy to 
suspend.
    Chairman Tester. We don't. We don't. We're looking for 
them, though.
    Secretary McDonough [continuing]. Is in full swing and 
continues to grow. The MISSION Act, the COVID pandemic, and the 
PACT Act, all over just the past six years, have changed the 
American healthcare landscape and the statutory basis for the 
work we do at VA. Any one of those on its own would lead to 
monumental change for VA, but together, they have changed the 
way we do business, creating some challenges, but mostly 
opportunities for veterans and VA. And right now, we're at a 
critical moment for shaping and securing the future of veteran 
healthcare.
    So, we'll work reliably to offer VA care options to every 
veteran, even vets who qualify for community care under the 
MISSION Act. We want to bring as many vets as possible into our 
care because study after study shows that vets do better when 
they come to get their care with us, whether in person, via 
telehealth, in our community, living centers, mobile medical 
units, or elsewhere, vets can access VA at almost every turn.
    What we do this year and over the next several years, 
building on the bipartisan generosity of Congress and the 
innovative hard work of VA's workforce, the best in the Federal 
Government, will determine what vets can expect from VA now and 
how we'll deliver that high standard of care well into the 
future.
    So, we look forward to collaborating even more effectively 
with you to build on what's working and being candid in 
addressing what's not.
    Thank you. I look very much forward to your questions.

    [The prepared statement of Secretary McDonough appears on 
page 39 of the Appendix.]

    Chairman Tester. We appreciate your opening statement. I'm 
going to turn now to the chairman of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee, Patty Murray for questions.

                       HON. PATTY MURRAY,
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    Senator Murray. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, 
and welcome, Mr. Secretary. Good to see you. Thank you for all 
you do for our Nation's veterans. We appreciate it.
    I want to ask you, as you're probably not going to be 
surprised about the EHR system. It has two facilities in 
Washington State.
    Secretary McDonough. Yes.
    Senator Murray. As you know, and I am still hearing from 
veterans and providers about their struggles with that system 
and how it has undermined their healthcare. We're still hearing 
about some outages, and referrals, or notes that aren't being 
recorded, canceled procedures. So, it's still a work in 
progress that we've got to focus on.
    And I know we're in a reset right now. I know you're taking 
that seriously and trying to get this corrected. You are asking 
for $894 million for the EHR program in FY '25. Can you talk to 
us about how VA will use those funds to make safety 
improvements in IT updates, upgrades?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. Thank you very much, and I'm not 
surprised by the question, Madam Chair. Our Deputy Secretary 
just spent yesterday and the day before in Spokane and Walla 
Walla. She's now in Oregon, and she'll be in Columbus tomorrow 
at the five sites.
    What we've said is that we've tried to right-size our eyes 
and our stomach on this budget so that what we're asking for is 
a significant drawback from what we would have anticipated 
under the original 10-year plan. So, what we've also said that 
we won't leave reset until we're ready, but we don't intend to 
stay in reset forever.
    So, I hope that by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be in 
a position to be out of reset, but that'll be determined by the 
facts on the ground. The Deputy Secretary's visit is a big part 
of that right now, as is of course, the experience in your two 
facilities.
    Now, since the last time we talked, where we're not in 
reset, as in Lovell, in the federal healthcare center in 
Chicago. That's gone better than expected, based principally on 
the learnings from the five live sites. They've gone back to 
much higher productivity than we had anticipated. So the 
investments we anticipate in '25 are based on both the 
experience of the five sites and the experience at Lovell that 
will get us moving out on a more realistic timeline to new 
sites based on that facility.
    Now, we've also forward-deployed much of the funding in 
those in FY '25 in the next level of facilities, getting them 
ready with pre-investment for some of the deployments. So, we 
anticipate, as I say, by the end of this year, making that this 
fiscal year, making that decision and moving out smartly with 
that more reduced investment in '25.
    Senator Murray. Okay. Thank you very much. Obviously, we're 
going to continue to follow that.
    Secretary McDonough. Yes.
    Senator Murray. I fully funded the President's $23 million 
requests in the FY '24 bill to expand VA's childcare pilot 
program that we established back in 2010. It's really important 
to me that veterans don't forego their healthcare because they 
don't have any childcare.
    And I have to say, I am disappointed that VA is not making 
progress faster on this. According to a recent study published 
by NAH, a staggering 58 percent of respondents reported missing 
or canceling VA healthcare appointments due to childcare 
challenges.
    Last year at this hearing on your '24 budget request, you 
told me you would get the regulations moving on the expansion. 
We're sitting here today and we've been told it may take 
another year now for them to be finalized. When are we going to 
see movement on that initiative?
    Secretary McDonough. Well, I think, I appreciate the 
question very much. We have a two-pronged strategy as we've 
discussed. One is to reimburse veterans for their care that 
they get somewhere else. And then consistent with your 
authorization, to make sure that we have onsite childcare where 
possible. We think the two places most likely for that are 
Fresno and Shreveport, and we're working with those two 
facilities to invest in those opportunities.
    The regulations are in process, and we're hoping to have 
those regulations done this year. But----
    Senator Murray. Okay. The Chairman's going to----
    Chairman Tester. Hold that thought. Patty still gets a 
minute. We've got 10 folks here. I want to recess and call 
executive session.
    [Proceeded to other business.]
    Chairman Tester. Now we'll come out of recess, and Patty 
Murray has one minute.
    Senator Murray. Well, 45 seconds, so I'll just ask it 
really quickly. In your '25 budget request, you assume that 
there's going to be 10 onsite centers in '24 and 20 additional 
in '25. Will VA meet that goal?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes, it is our intent to. Yes.
    Senator Murray. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. 
Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Secretary, thank you. This question is 
written as for me to ask you to say ``yes'' or ``no.'' I 
dislike doing that to people, but if you can answer it ``yes'' 
or ``no'' and it's straightforward way, that would be great.
    Secretary McDonough. Good.
    Senator Moran. Could you assure this Committee, assure me, 
that even if the VA acts to incorporate telehealth into access 
standards, a veteran who prefers an in-person appointment will 
not lose their opportunity to seek community care if the VA is 
unable to provide them an in-person appointment within the 
current access standards?
    Secretary McDonough. I think the answer is yes.
    Senator Moran. Thank you. Same yes or no type question. 
Would any element of this budget request restrict a veteran's 
ability to seek care in the community?
    Secretary McDonough. No. Veterans are guaranteed that based 
on the law that you passed in 2018. We anticipate updating 
parts of that law and the regulations that govern it. But I've 
committed to you in this hearing, on this hearing room and in 
private that when we do that, that will be in the light of day. 
And that's not necessarily anticipated by the budget request 
here by any means.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Secretary, I'd only highlight for you 
that while if done in the light of day, that's better than 
being done in darkness. But I still have concerns about it 
being done.
    Secretary McDonough. I hear you. But the way we do it would 
be by rulemaking, and obviously, that would be subject to 
public comment and everything else. So, I guess, I want to give 
you that assurance.
    Senator Moran. On this growth of employees----
    Secretary McDonough. Yes.
    Senator Moran. You and other Veteran leaders, VA leaders, 
have noted your intent to recapture care in the community due 
to increased community care budgets. But community care 
provides needed care, access for veterans. If the VA wants to 
recapture care, VA's focus should be on providing timely, high-
quality care to veterans.
    This is why the decision to implement the goal of net zero 
growth for the workforce, while simultaneously expediting PACT 
Act eligibility is confusing to me if the VA's goal is also to 
recapture care and reduce reliance on the community. Can you 
confirm that any efforts to reduce community care reliance will 
only include increasing the efficiency of direct care system 
and not include pulling back veterans' ability to seek 
community care?
    Secretary McDonough. The veterans' ability to seek 
community care is a statutorily granted question. So, I want us 
at VA to compete apple to apple on that. So that's why, as I 
said in my opening statement this year, we hope to ensure that 
every time a veteran qualifies for a referral to the community, 
we also have a conversation with that veteran to show what is 
available to him or to her in the direct care system.
    This is based on not some kind of sociological or 
ideological view. It's based on what we think is the highest 
quality engagement for the veteran. And so, we want to have the 
conversation about quality. Veterans are very discerning in 
their healthcare choices. And I think when given those choices, 
they'll make the choice that's best for them. This is about 
quality outcomes for veterans. That's the way we judge 
ourselves.
    That's the way using the VSignals, we judge each of our 
facilities, which is what is the veteran satisfaction with that 
care. And then when we're competing on that basis, I like our 
odds to be able to provide timely access to care that's high-
quality outcomes, and we'll see how that proceeds during the 
course of this year.
    Senator Moran. I see it, I think, in at least the way you 
said it just now, which is we want the VA to provide the best 
absolute care possible and then let the veteran make a choice 
where it is best for him or her to seek that care. That true?
    Secretary McDonough. That is true. And we think that, 
overwhelmingly, the veteran will decide to stay with us. That's 
what our data suggests to us. That not the uniform case by any 
means, but we want to make sure that we're competing there, and 
that we demonstrate the courage of our conviction.
    Now, I'll just give you an example. You know in VISN 7, 70 
percent of veterans qualify for a referral based on drive time 
alone. It's probably roughly similar in Kansas, but I don't 
have that number. So in those cases where we're making a 
referral for the veteran to the community, I want us to also 
tell a veteran, ``Hey, if you want to stay in with us, here's 
your options,'' if you stay in the VA direct care system.
    And since we're seeing such amount of change, especially in 
rural provision of healthcare in the country, in your state and 
my state, we think that those are going to be very competitive 
options. And we want the vets to be able to make that choice.
    Senator Moran. And those who work for you in VA Central, in 
the VISN, and in the hospital across Kansas, and other states, 
they understand what you just said is how the VA operates when 
giving a veteran the opportunity to choose where care occurs. 
Is that true?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. Like, I mean, we have 451,000 
people at the VA. They're awesome. They're the best portion of 
the federal workforce that I've experienced by far. So I think, 
yes, they do believe that. And I want us to just demonstrate 
the courage of our conviction, which is, hey, they all got in 
this business to provide care to veterans. Let's make sure that 
we give vets a good option to come get their care with us.
    Senator Moran. If my time returns to me, I'll ask you about 
State Veterans Home.
    Secretary McDonough. Good. Thank you, and we can follow-up 
if the time doesn't return to you.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you Senator Moran. Secretary, I'm 
going to continue on the community care line.
    Secretary McDonough. Please.
    Chairman Tester. It grows between 16 and 20 percent over 
the last number of years. At the same time, VA trust scores, 
which you've already pointed out, continues to measure very, 
very high, almost 92 percent. Study after study shows the VA's 
doing a pretty damn good job providing healthcare, in fact, 
superior, as good as, or superior to the private sector. With 
that as a bracket, and knowing that this 16 to 20 percent 
increase every year is not sustainable, unless you correct me 
on that, it's not sustainable. What's the VA doing to find the 
right balance between community care and VA care?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes, thanks very much. I mean, look, 
we want to make sure that we compete for the veterans' care, 
and we can compete on quality, and we want to make sure that 
veterans know that we're invested in their quality.
    We had a very good couple of years hiring. I just said that 
we hired, net, 14,000 nurses in the last two and a half years. 
There's no healthcare system in the country that has seen 
growth like that, and it's nursing workforce. We're not perfect 
on nurses, but we have the personnel. And when we have the 
personnel, we should be able to compete.
    And when we compete on quality and lay out the options for 
the veterans, they're discerning choosers. They're discerning 
participants in their healthcare choices. When we're operating 
on that level, I feel really good about our opportunities to 
get this to the right place.
    At the end of the day, VA has always relied on the 
community. And by the way, the community always relied on VA. 
We just have got to make sure that this is a decision about 
quality outcomes for veterans. Quality health outcomes for 
veterans, rather than simply a question of convenience.
    Chairman Tester. The ranking member talked about emergency 
care being a main driver of community care costs. Overall 
spending 30 percent, in fact, I believe is what the figures 
show. Go down the same line that Jerry talked about in his 
opening statement, is the VA reviewing emergency care 
utilization, how to manage it, how to recapture some of those 
vets getting back into direct care?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes.
    Chairman Tester. And let me know what you're doing about 
that, because 30 percent driver that could have a major impact.
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. Well, look, I mean, first, you 
know, we want vets to make sure that they're having a 
relationship with their primary care provider. When they need 
to see emergency care, they should see it. But if they need to 
see their primary care docs and make sure that they're managing 
their healthcare over time, that's first best, because that 
allows us to coordinate that care. One.
    Two, we are in the field with one of our more innovative 
updates, I think, which is called tele-emergency care. A 
veteran can arrive at tele-emergency care through our Veteran 
Health Connect. Veteran Health Connect last year had 40 million 
enterprise-wide calls in the VA system. This is like something 
that's available to each one of us--well, you guys have special 
access to care--but available to us at Blue Cross Blue Shield.
    You call the nurse practitioner to triage. You call that 
you can get connected to telehealth tele-emergency care with a 
trained emergency provider. You can discern whether what you're 
experiencing is actually an emergency. Since October, we've 
seen roughly 16,000 cases. Of that, 60 percent of those had 
issues resolved on the phone, and the median time for that 
interaction is 10 minutes.
    So, the veteran doesn't have to get in his car, doesn't 
have to drive, and sit in an emergency room, and ends up having 
his issue resolved in 30 minutes or less. Those are the kinds 
of innovations that we want to make sure are happening.
    The alternative is the veteran goes to an emergency 
department. The incentives in the private system are for the 
veteran to be then checked into the hospital. And then we risk 
being in a situation where we're over utilizing care where the 
veteran's getting care that's not good for the veteran, is 
exposing the veteran to infection and further sickness. Let's 
make sure that we get the veteran the care they need, when they 
need it, where they need it, and tele-emergency care is a good 
example of that.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Tuberville.

                     HON. TOMMY TUBERVILLE,
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ALABAMA

    Senator Tuberville. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thanks for 
being here.
    Secretary McDonough. Sure.
    Senator Tuberville. In Alabama, we're having huge problems 
with doctors' exhaustion, nurse exhaustion. Lines are long. You 
hearing that?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. Well, interestingly, in our most 
recent surveys, Veteran burnout is down on our employee 
engagement surveys. That's a good thing. That has to do a lot 
with the generous authorities you've given us for paid 
increases and some decisions that we're making about how we're 
treating veterans. So we feel much better this year than I did 
a year ago when I was talking to you.
    Senator Tuberville. So, your recruiting nurses and doctors 
is improving down, up, since COVID, you know, I can understand 
the problems----
    Secretary McDonough. Up, up. Not only is recruiting 
improving, but retention is at historic highs. Yes.
    Senator Tuberville. Yes. I had a situation in Tuscaloosa, 
my VA over there. A gentleman, basically had to have some 
special service done, approved. A few days later, they called 
me. You can't do it. You can't do community care in town. 
You've got to go 150 miles away. What rules and regulations do 
your doctors and administrators go by when it comes from VA 
care to community care? I mean, does it have to be approved by 
somebody? It has to go up the chain? Are they set by you, your 
staff?
    Secretary McDonough. Well, they're set by regulation and by 
the law. And so, it depends on what exactly this engagement 
was. And I'd, obviously, love to follow up directly with you 
and with that veteran on it. Has to do with a--in the first 
instance primary care, or is it specialty care? Then it has to 
do with where that veteran's home is. And how far is that home 
from Tuscaloosa, you know, in your state and in your VISN? 
Entirely, 70 percent of veterans are eligible right now. In New 
Hampshire and in Alaska it's 100 percent of veterans because 
there's no full-service hospital.
    So if that's the case, if you're 30 minutes from a facility 
for primary care, you qualify off the bat, irrespective of 
whether the private provider is 45 minutes from where you are, 
or 60 minutes from where you are. So we just have got to do a 
better job of making sure that the veteran has an informed 
choice.
    Senator Tuberville. Good. Let me ask you about this one. 
This is kind of old news here. You know, the VA came to a 
settlement with union related to the termination of employment. 
Approximately, what? 4,000 people?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes.
    Senator Tuberville. Who had been fired under the 
accountability authority enforced by President Trump, you know, 
through Congress. In some instances, they were terminated 
because of Regis, you know, criminal negligence, but they'd 
been brought back. Correct?
    Secretary McDonough. Not entirely correct. The action that 
was taken, that you're referred to, was subject to both 
administrative body review. So, Merit System Protection Board, 
National Labor Relation Board, and subject to federal judicial 
ruling, leaving us really very little option to manage.
    So what I did is, I engaged in a settlement arrangement 
with the union where I said those employees alleged to have 
carried out, as you said, egregious activity would not be 
welcomed back.
    Senator Tuberville. Good.
    Secretary McDonough. And so, they are not welcomed back. So 
I could get you the exact numbers of the 4,000. We can get you 
an update. I think we're keeping your teams pretty well updated 
on those numbers over time. But those, again, by virtue of the 
fact that we're before administrative bodies and federal 
courts, that settlement includes a lot of things that, you 
know, we wouldn't necessarily choose to do of our own accord to 
include back pay, things like that. But bringing these 
employees back who are charged with egregious misconduct was 
not something I would agree to.
    Senator Tuberville. You basically went case by case and 
looked at it?
    Secretary McDonough. Correct. And we fought that out.
    Senator Tuberville. It's important to the veteran we don't 
put anybody in harm's way. Still hadn't got the accounting of 
abortion in the VA. You can get that to me.
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. I did promise you that, but I've 
also ascertained that we've given those numbers, I think, 
relatively recently to the Committee. And since, generally, 
that's the kind of information that we treat, that we would 
require a chairman or ranking member letter on. We've also 
communicated to your team that that's available to the 
Committee, and we'll get you those updated numbers.
    Senator Tuberville. Well, I appreciate it. The Chairman 
doesn't like people from Alabama, so he didn't pass that down 
the line.
    [Laughter.]
    Chairman Tester. Did you refer to Tuscaloosa sometime in 
your questioning there? What the hell, what kind of football 
team do they have there? I was just wondering----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Tuberville. It used to be pretty good.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Tuberville. We lost our coach.
    Chairman Tester. Senator King.

                    HON. ANGUS S. KING, JR.,
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM MAINE

    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I want to start 
with a couple of compliments. Last week I was at the ribbon 
cutting and the opening of a new CBOC in Presque Isle, Maine.
    Secretary McDonough. Awesome.
    Senator King. And to give you an idea of where Presque 
Isle, Maine is, Portland, Maine is about halfway between 
Presque Isle and New York City.
    Secretary McDonough. Wow.
    Senator King. So we're talking far north----
    Secretary McDonough. Way up there.
    Senator King. It was wonderful. The design was almost 
identical to the one that we toured last year in Rumford. Just 
a fantastic facility.
    Secretary McDonough. Good.
    Senator King. Your staff in Maine, your medical staff, 
Tracy Davis at Togus and her supporters are really fabulous.
    Secretary McDonough. We're really proud of them.
    Senator King. You should be. They're great, and I've never 
heard a negative word from a veteran about the treatment. 
Second compliment. If you've onboarded 14,000 nurses in the 
last couple of years, you're doing something really good.
    Secretary McDonough. Well, you're doing it. You gave us the 
authorities to pay them.
    Senator King. Well, there's a nationwide nursing shortage, 
and it's amazing.
    Secretary McDonough. We're really thrilled to accomplish 
that.
    Senator King. That's fabulous. Now, on the negative side, 
as you know, there's a provision in your budget that sees a 
reduction in staff of about 10,000. How do you justify that in 
terms of the growth and demand for services? How do we be 
confident in this Committee that we're not sacrificing the 
quality of service to our veterans if we are reducing staff and 
at the same time, demand is going up?
    Secretary McDonough. The budget here reflects the budget 
agreement, the bipartisan budget agreement. And I think it's 
generous to VA, but it does force some choices on us. And we've 
put those choices in black and white in the budget. One.
    Two, we do believe that because of the strength of the 
hiring in the last couple of years, that we, in particular, are 
better, not 100 percent, obviously, but better sourced with 
clinicians. The nurses are an example of that.
    Three, we have tested this proposition with access sprints 
since last October. And between October and February, we saw 
25,000 more new veterans, unique new veterans for care than we 
did a year ago. That is because in that----
    Senator King. It's a good thing. I just want to be sure you 
have the staff to serve them.
    Secretary McDonough. Right. And that's because we did 
evening clinics, weekend clinics. And fourth point is, as the 
Chairman, pointed out in his opening comments, with mental 
healthcare, we do have a goal of net zero FTE during the course 
of the next year. We can manage that through attrition, we 
believe. And we can continue to strategically hire where we 
need care provision, for example, on mental health care. Or 
recently, I talked with our VISN director in Texas who working 
with our hospital director in San Antonio made a decision to 
hire two GI docs, which they'd been looking for three years. 
That's strategic hiring.
    Senator King. Let me change the subject. And these are two 
suggestions that are policy, but could end up actually saving 
money in treating veterans. Ninety-plus percent of seniors want 
to stay in their houses as long as they possibly can. I've 
never had anybody raise their hand and say, I want to go to a 
nursing home. And yet 55 percent of your geriatric and extended 
care goes into institutions.
    I hope you can take a look at that and think about how do 
you change the environment in people's homes so they can stay 
longer. Grab bars, non-skid mats on the floor, those kinds of 
things. Because people would rather stay in their homes, and 
it's a lot cheaper for the taxpayers if they stay in their 
homes. So I hope that's something you'll look at, because if we 
want to keep people in their homes, we ought to be putting more 
money into what amounts to prevention.
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. I think we're there. You know, 
maybe not as much as you want to see, or as much as I want to 
see, but we're bending that curve up. Home-based primary care 
is one of our fastest growing interventions. That's a place 
where we're hiring a lot of those nurses I talked about.
    And if you look, just to go back to this question about 
community care, after emergency care, the next two or three 
highest investments in community care are various 
manifestations of home-based care.
    Senator King. Good.
    Secretary McDonough. I think that's an example where 
community care allows us to skate to the puck here, and by the 
way, save money over time for taxpayers.
    Senator King. I'm out of time, but I want to follow-up on 
this and we'll follow-up for the record.
    I'm going to be introducing legislation to have you take a 
special focus on falls. Huge issue. Medicaid, Medicare spent 
$38 billion a year treating falls that many of them can be 
prevented. So, I want to follow-up with you.
    Secretary McDonough. Good.
    Senator King. I hope you'll keep an open mind, because this 
is a way--it's a lot cheaper to buy somebody a bath mat than to 
fix a broken hip.
    Secretary McDonough. Some of our best innovations in our 
innovation office are around these manifestations, including 
new AI innovations that track gait of a veteran. So these are 
things that we'd be more than happy to have that conversation 
with.
    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. With my apologies, Senator Cassidy.

                       HON. BILL CASSIDY,
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA

    Senator Cassidy. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, you mentioned 
that you've hired 14,000 nurses on net. How many more nurses do 
you have in the system knowing that there's been attrition?
    Secretary McDonough. Right. So that's a net number. So 
that's a net increase of 14,000. That period, the number we've 
hired is going to be substantially more than that given the 
churn, especially in 2022. Remember, 2021----
    Senator Cassidy. I got that. Hang on. I got limited time. 
So, on your Red Team, I didn't mean to be rude, I just----
    Secretary McDonough. Yes.
    Senator Cassidy. On your Red Team analysis you gave us, you 
mentioned that there is anecdotal reports that the increased 
number of veterans to community care providers is adversely 
impacting some VHA graduate medical education programs. Now, 
what I know that to mean is that there's fewer patients----
    Secretary McDonough. Correct.
    Senator Cassidy [continuing]. In the hospital.
    Secretary McDonough. That's what I understand. By the way, 
I think your staff gave you that. I still have not seen that 
report, but I'm glad you've seen it.
    Senator Cassidy. But I think it's generated by your folks.
    Secretary McDonough. Well, it's generated by our Red Team 
that we asked to stand up to take an independent look at what's 
happening. I still haven't seen it, but it sounds like you guys 
have, and I think that's a good thing.
    Senator Cassidy. Now, if there's fewer patients, there's 
less staffing required, theoretically. Knowing that the union 
seems to be particularly strong with the VA, are you allowed to 
decrease staffing if you don't have patients in the bed? Do you 
follow what I'm saying?
    Secretary McDonough. I do.
    Senator Cassidy. Do you still have the ward clerk there? Do 
you still have the nurses there, even though there aren't any 
patients?
    Secretary McDonough. No. I mean, like, this is----
    Senator Cassidy. Are you sure about that?
    Secretary McDonough. I'll make sure that I come back to you 
on it, but we're in this budget. We're managing our workforce 
to try to meet the budget targets that are laid out in the 
bipartisan engagement.
    Senator Cassidy. But I'm so struck that the unions are so 
powerful that I just want to be comfortable that you're 
actually adjusting your staffing. Because if the residents 
don't have enough patients to see, but you're still short on 
nurses, then that somehow is not all kind of connecting in my 
brain.
    Secretary McDonough. Remember that, I again, I'd have to 
ask the Red Team members about that, and maybe you could if 
you'd meet with them, but whether there's enough patients in 
the hospitals could be a function of community care, could also 
be a function of more outpatient----
    Senator Cassidy. Did they say, specifically, community 
care?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. So, it could be a function of 
more reliance on outpatient care.
    Senator Cassidy. Can I move on? Prior auth, we've talked 
about that----
    Secretary McDonough. Yes.
    Senator Cassidy [continuing]. And I mentioned I've been 
interested, and I've been interested in prior authorization. 
And the VA, frankly, always tells me they're getting to it, but 
it doesn't seem like it's ever gotten to. So knowing that if it 
goes to a community care and there's no prior auth, in the 
private hospital, in the private insurance experience, 
oftentimes there's over utilization of tests.
    So, one, have you found increased intensity of services for 
the same diagnosis in the community care versus the VA? And 
two, where are we in terms of instituting a prior authorization 
process?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. So, we do see some evidence of 
multiple tests for the same diagnosis, and that's a function of 
our not doing a better job of coordinating the care when we 
send it out. We don't do a good job of following up to get the 
radiology report or something like that. So that's mostly on 
us, but we ought to do a better job of that.
    Second, our prior authorizations, we do a pretty good job 
of this in dental, by the way, and so that's worth looking at. 
But we, going back to 2019, do standard episodes of care. And 
we, for example, cardiology appointments may come with 10, 12 
standard episodes of care. And what we know----
    Senator Cassidy. When you say episode of care, you mean 
visits to the doctor's office?
    Secretary McDonough. Could be, after a shoulder 
replacement, then you're going to have PT associated with that. 
So, it's the shoulder operation----
    Senator Cassidy. But let me kind of put a point on what my 
question is, right. It's a fraction, but it's a small fraction, 
but it's an expensive fraction. If you send the patient to that 
doctor, every test that's in that doctor's office is going to 
be ordered.
    Secretary McDonough. Correct.
    Senator Cassidy. Whether indicated or not.
    Secretary McDonough. Correct.
    Senator Cassidy. And the point of prior authorization is to 
prevent that over utilization.
    Secretary McDonough. Correct.
    Senator Cassidy. And so where are we in terms of prior 
authorization in terms of preventing that sort of sometimes 
harmful activity, always expensive?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. Sometimes harmful, always 
expensive. That's why we're looking at the standard episodes of 
care, because it's often under that these extra diagnostics are 
asked for. Or in the instance of cardiology where we've looked 
at 300 COX since 2019, we've seen almost a 20 percent increase 
in the use of catheters, the imposition of catheters, for 
example in the community, when during the same period where I 
have a 30 to 40 percent reduction in the use of catheters in 
the VA system. So something is different there. That's prior 
authorization.
    Senator Cassidy. That's suggesting to me that there is not 
a prior authorization. If we're going to do a catheterization, 
the VA has to approve it, rather the doctor wants to do it, the 
doctor can do it.
    Secretary McDonough. Correct. Because of our reliance on 
standard episodes of care, that's what ends up happening.
    Senator Cassidy. Now, I will say, I think it's been a year 
and a half to two years that I've been told that the VA is 
trying to put in a system to address that. And I can just tell 
you that that's going to be, again, expensive, and sometimes 
harmful. And that would be a way to rein in the cost----
    Secretary McDonough. Agreed.
    Senator Cassidy [continuing]. To some of this community.
    Secretary McDonough. So, this is among the things that 
we'll be looking at as we're looking at each of these questions 
given the rapid growth in community care and then the rapid 
rise in cost overall in healthcare.
    You know, as I said to a couple of you guys on the phone, 
if we were growing at 15 percent and we weren't looking at it, 
I think you would have asked me what's going on. So we're 
trying to get our hands around each of these things. Whether 
it's me who's over-promised to you on standard prior 
authorizations, I apologize for that, but I'll make sure that 
we stay on top of that.
    Senator Cassidy. Okay, thank you. I yield.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Blumenthal.

                    HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL,
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT

    Senator Blumenthal. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. 
Thank you for your great work----
    Secretary McDonough. Thank you.
    Senator Blumenthal [continuing]. Mr. Secretary, and thank 
you to the many, many men and women who work in the VA. They 
are----
    Secretary McDonough. They're the best.
    Senator Blumenthal [continuing]. Unsung heroes. And I know 
how hard they work to deliver benefits, healthcare, and service 
to our veterans. First of all, I appreciate what you're doing 
on the New Haven facility, moneys in the budget. We need to do 
the authorization.
    Secretary McDonough. Definitely.
    Senator Blumenthal. And rather than berating you on that 
topic, I'm very glad to be thanking you for the----
    Secretary McDonough. Well, I think it's you-all who did it, 
so.
    Senator Blumenthal. Well, with your leadership. I want to 
ask you about the PACT Act. I noted 1.3 million claims, about 
1.149 processed and completed. I may have missed it in the 
testimony, but how many of those have been approved or 
disapproved, if you have a breakdown?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. About 950,000 or so have been 
granted. So, we're at a grant rate of about between 70 and 75 
percent, which is the beauty of the presumed service-
connection.
    Senator Blumenthal. That is really the beauty of it. And I 
am wondering what you anticipate will be necessary by way of 
outreach to the many veterans who may not know about the PACT 
Act or about the expansion of it. And I was really just 
overjoyed to see the expansion.
    Secretary McDonough. Well, so we have 550 outreach events 
scheduled yet this year. And so, we think that there are still 
a lot of veterans who don't know that they've qualified for 
this additional care and/or additional options for benefits.
    And importantly, you'll recall that in the run-up to last 
year's August 9th deadline, we reminded veterans that 
establishing an intent to file by August 9th protected that 
August 10, 2022, effective date provided once you establish 
that intent to file, in the next year, you file a claim.
    So we're readying an outreach plan right now where we will 
go back to each of the people who have filed an intent to file 
to urge them to turn that intent to file into an actual claim 
before August 9th, again, because what that will do is that 
will protect their August 10, 2022, effective date which will 
be a meaningful benefit to those veterans who get their 
service-connection rating as a result of the PACT Act.
    So not only are we reaching out to veterans who don't yet 
know, we are re-reaching out to veterans who have filed an 
intent to file. Which is near as I can tell, there's no 
evidence of VA ever having done that before.
    Senator Blumenthal. That's great. If you could let me know 
about events that you're planning in Connecticut----
    Secretary McDonough. Count on that.
    Senator Blumenthal. I would love to be involved to help 
elevate them and help with the outreach.
    Secretary McDonough. Count on that.
    Senator Blumenthal. Great. Let me ask about a painful but 
perennial topic, veteran suicide.
    Secretary McDonough. Yes.
    Senator Blumenthal. Are we making any progress? I know the 
numbers are still too high. How do you feel about how the VA's 
doing?
    Secretary McDonough. Well, the numbers went up last year 
for the first time in several years. And that is heartbreaking. 
We also, I just want to underscore one more time, that any 
individual veteran suicide is one too many. This budget is 
generous as it relates to suicide prevention. You-all have been 
very generous as it relates to suicide prevention, including in 
giving us new authorities particularly under the Staff Sergeant 
Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program, which 
allows us to make investments in local organizations in each of 
your states, who know your veterans best.
    And I think that's a positive thing. You've also given us 
the COMPACT Act in the last two years that allows any veteran 
who's experiencing acute mental health crisis to go into any 
hospital irrespective of his enrollment status with VA--so, any 
VA hospital, any private hospital--and to get care that day, 
and we pay for that.
    In the first year of that, just over a year of that, 
47,000, almost 48,000 veterans have taken advantage of that. 
It's heartbreaking that there's still that many veterans who 
have to avail themselves of that service. But it's there. So 
the tools are there, but the challenge is still a major one. 
And we'll stay on top of it until there's none.
    Senator Blumenthal. Thank you. My time has expired. I just 
want to thank you, again, for the work that you're doing, 
particularly on women's healthcare in the VA. Thanks.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Tillis.

                       HON. THOM TILLIS,
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Tillis. Secretary McDonough, thank you for the time 
on the phone earlier this week.
    Secretary McDonough. Thank you.
    Senator Tillis. I appreciate it, and you really stand out 
as one of the more accessible members of the administration. I 
really appreciate your work. We had the vote earlier about the 
Lease, and I was a little bit jealous when I heard all those 
southern states listed and North Carolina not on it. As you 
know, we had a Lease, I believe, submitted for Jacksonville. 
Didn't make the cut.
    Secretary McDonough. Not yet. We're still working it, but 
not yet.
    Senator Tillis. Yes. Can I just get a commitment to get a 
debrief, figure out what we can do to help on that specific 
matter?
    Secretary McDonough. You got my commitment.
    Senator Tillis. And I think it's also in talking with the 
VISN director, we talked about the broader issue of how do we 
get the brick-and-mortar facilities in place to meet the 
increasing demand, particularly in a state like North Carolina, 
which is growing by leaps and bounds massively in terms of 
veterans' population.
    And what more with the question I have is what do you 
already have the authorities to come up with some creative ways 
for joint use, either with the DHA or with the private sector? 
When I was on Senate Armed Services, we started doing some 
relationships with the private sector, the trauma center down 
at Camp Lejeune. We ended up getting into a public-private 
partnership there, and what more should we be doing and what 
more authorities do you need to do that kind of stuff?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. So, I think we have a lot of 
authorities that we're now starting to exercise. The most 
important is working with DHA, with DoD. So, we're having, 
actually, a summit in your state later this summer on that 
where we're trying to turbocharge our efforts there.
    We just announced a new facility up in the Hudson Valley in 
New York, where we're seeing, jointly, VA veterans and active 
duty. I think we have to make better use of that. We're also in 
your state working with USDA-supported community hospitals to 
make clinical space available where we can afford to employ 
care teams to see veterans----
    Senator Tillis. But you feel then like you don't need any 
more authority? You just need to better exploit or use the 
authorities you have, or are there any sticking points or 
things that we could do that could facilitate the product?
    Secretary McDonough. You know, aside from the Leases, you 
just did us a big solid on the Leases you just did. We might 
have to come back to you and ask that you reauthorize at a 
higher cost level, the Leases we talked about earlier in the 
week because of the high interest rates. We've seen them 
anywhere from 60 to 150 percent above the authorized level, 
which we can't do under current law.
    My theory is we really just need, at the end of the day, 
need dollars. And we want to prove to you that we've exhausted 
remedy using all of our authority. So this DoD cooperation, the 
USDA cooperation, our academic partner cooperation, in your 
state in particular, working with Duke is a really good 
example. And then, you know, maximizing community care.
    When we've done all those things, then we can come to you 
and say, listen, I know it's like $1.5 to $2 billion of 
hospital, but we've done everything else. We only can now do 
the hospitals.
    Senator Tillis. Well, I just think, creatively, for North 
Carolina in particular, because I'm happy to help with the 
state legislature and the Governor's office to come up with 
creative ways for our state legislature to get engaged. We've 
done that with the DoD and the Department of Navy in the past. 
And I'd like to see if we can help you.
    When you and I talked, I discussed the--I see your budget 
requests. I see that you're managing some of the employee, the 
position cuts through attrition. But at the end of the day, 
you've got some future requirements that are going to outstrip 
your current funding stream. So how do we get ahead of--you 
know, before it just becomes we're flogging you because you're 
not hitting service levels because you don't have the funding, 
that you need it for policies that we passed.
    Tell me a little bit about what we should be thinking about 
now. You know, it was not a vote that I was happy with, but I 
voted against the PACT Act because I didn't think it was fully 
ready for prime time. Now I'm here to help get it implemented, 
and it is one of several areas that, I think, are stressors 
that could affect provision of care to veterans. So what do we 
need to be concerned with and step up to make sure that gets 
implemented?
    Secretary McDonough. Well, what I'm challenging our agency 
to do is to manage the dollars that we have now, mindful that 
we're operating under a capped budget. And that means that, you 
know, we have two big costs in the VHA side; one is the cost of 
the care, the provision of the care, and the direct care 
system. So that's people, and then what we pay to purchase the 
care. And so, we're minding both of those things, and we're 
trying to demonstrate that we can manage that well.
    Meanwhile, we have a really big opportunity and challenge 
in the PACT Act that says we can either go ask Congress for 
more money because we can't manage either the workforce number 
or the provision of the care, or we can go to Congress and ask 
for more money because we have more veterans in our care.
    And that's what we're doing now. As I said, 12,500 new 
veterans just since March 5th alone. So I feel much better 
coming to have a conversation with you to say, ``Hey, we're 
managing the workforce levels here. We're managing access to 
care utilization. And we're doing that around quality.'' And by 
the way, more veterans are choosing to get their care with us 
because they do see that they can leverage greater quality of 
care at VA. That's what our goal is here.
    Now it's facilitated by the fact that, or necessitated by 
the fact that we're now operating under a budget cap. But you 
know what, you've done this in a lot of different places. 
You've got to manage your operations through the budget, and 
that's true in the government as well. But again, if we need to 
ask for more money, which we may, I'd much rather do that 
because we have more veterans than because we are not able to 
manage our system.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Hassan.

                   HON. MARGARET WOOD HASSAN,
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE

    Senator Hassan. Thanks, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Mr. 
Secretary for being here.
    Secretary McDonough. Thank you.
    Senator Hassan. For the work you're doing and for the work 
that your entire team does.
    Secretary McDonough. Thank you.
    Senator Hassan. Our veterans are better for it. You 
mentioned that New Hampshire doesn't have a full-service 
hospital along with Alaska. And you and I have had several 
discussions that not only we don't have the full-service 
hospital, but we have a really aging facility in Manchester. We 
have needed repairs and upgrades.
    It's a 70-year-old facility, and the services for New 
Hampshire veterans have been disrupted by issues such as flood 
damage, from pipes that burst in 2022. And you always have this 
kind of sense of, are we going to keep doing this with this 70-
year-old facility? Is it a facility that we can really make 
sound?
    So, we've had these discussions as a result. We asked for a 
multi-year plan to improve this facility publicly released. I'm 
really glad you guys released that last September, and I know 
that the VA has been working toward goals laid out in the plan. 
In fact, you broke ground on the Women Veterans Health Clinic 
in Manchester last Wednesday. So, congratulations on that step.
    But I just want to follow-up today to get a detailed sense 
from you on the timeline for several projects in that multi-
year plan. Can you give us a sense of when the Women Veterans 
Clinic will be complete, and can you tell me what the next two 
projects slated for completion are, and what their timelines 
are?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. Thank you very much, and you're 
generous to congratulate us on it, but it's just because you 
and your fellow Senators have kept the heat on and the 
delegation have kept the heat on us. So the Women Veterans 
Health Clinic is slated to open in fall 2025.
    The next two projects are the renovation of the new lab 
suite. We will award that in summer, and that will be completed 
in spring 2025. And then, the specialty care clinic, it's a 
minor construction project. So, you-all did us a big solid, by 
the way, by raising the threshold for minor construction 
projects up to $30 million in the Defense Authorization Bill.
    That's a major help to us. That specialty care clinic will 
have audiology and optometry. That will also be awarded this 
summer, and we anticipate completing that fall of 2026. So the 
demolition of several outbuildings will be awarded in 2024 to 
make room for that. So, we should see progress on that as well.
    Senator Hassan. Thank you. And we will keep in touch about 
it. And it's really important that we have these discussions 
publicly, so New Hampshire veterans can get a sense of what's 
in store.
    I'm also going to take a minute to repeat something you 
know, but I think veterans need to hear over, and over, and 
over, again, which is thanks to the PACT Act and the VA's 
decision to expedite enrollment eligibility; veterans who were 
exposed to toxins as well as veterans who served in the Vietnam 
War, Gulf War, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, or 
any combat zone after 9/11, are now eligible to enroll in VA 
healthcare.
    And I've just been trying to get that message out as I know 
you have been. Now that we're providing care for these 
veterans, to Senator Tillis's point, we have to make sure we 
can do it for as long as they need. So just to build on the 
discussion you had, and you don't have to repeat anything, but 
what is VA doing to ensure that it can support, and provide top 
quality care for PACT Act veterans now and into the future?
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. Well, so look, there's no doubt 
that we are going out to get new veterans into the system. And 
we're going to let that--you know, because the alternative is 
we hope that we get the investments in the system, and then we 
can lure the veterans. I think the better investment is to take 
advantage of this terrific opportunity of the PACT Act to get 
more veterans into our care.
    So how are we going to do that? Well, we are tracking with 
each of our visits, at the VISN level, what their spend every 
month, what their enrollment is every month, and what their FTE 
count is every month. And it's our intention to make all that 
information available to your staff so you can follow right 
along with us and hold us to account on that.
    As we have more robust patient census counts, and we lay 
that against our access efforts. And as I said, those access 
sprints are in large measure those innovations we took, we put 
in place last October. Many VISNs are maintaining those, night 
clinics, weekend clinics. And so, we should be able to watch 
this develop and be in a position to make sure that we have the 
people and the space to take care of those vets.
    Senator Hassan. Well, excellent. And I see that I am out of 
time. I'm going to follow-up with you on work that the VA is 
doing to support surviving spouses because, obviously, spouses 
are part of this service, too. I have a couple of bills that 
address helping surviving spouses get some of the benefits that 
the veteran themselves gets, and just would like to follow-up 
with you and your team about that.
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. There's no question we can do a 
better job on spouses and on survivors than we've done. We're 
working with the VSOs on that. We're trying to learn that and 
directly with surviving spouses. So, we welcome any further 
help you can give us on that.
    Senator Hassan. Okay, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Sullivan.

                       HON. DAN SULLIVAN,
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, 
good chatting with you yesterday. Appreciated the time. I 
wanted to follow-up on some of the topics we talked about. One 
is this issue of the cemetery formulas that go to helping 
communities establish veteran VA base cemeteries. I mentioned 
to you, with the exception of Metlakatla, which is our only 
Indian reservation in Alaska, we've actually never been 
granted----
    Secretary McDonough. Yes.
    Senator Sullivan [continuing]. That ever, which is kind of 
shocking given that we have more vets per cap in the state, in 
the country. Under Secretary Quinn, when he testified a couple 
months ago, was pretty forward-leaning saying, hey, we'll take 
a look at that, Senator, because a lot of our formulas have 
been focused on maintenance of current cemeteries.
    We haven't done much. Although the program allows for money 
that goes into new cemeteries. As I mentioned, great veteran 
group in Fairbanks, Alaska, has got land selected, land bought 
land, and now they're trying to get a grant. And I'd like to 
just get your commitment. You probably can't say they're going 
to get it, but Under Secretary Quinn was pretty forward-leaning 
on that topic.
    Just to make sure you're not just doing it for maintenance. 
It can go to new programs like the people in my state who are 
working hard on this, and like I said, we've never gotten one.
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. Well, so we have this goal to 
increase the number of cemeteries within 75 miles of veterans 
and survivors so that survivors can visit their veteran. It's 
consistent with that goal to make sure that we're leaning in, 
in a place like Alaska, which not only got a lot of vets, but 
it's got a lot of surface area.
    So, we'll make sure that we're biasing toward that outcome. 
You know, I want to be careful to not----
    Senator Sullivan. No, I get it.
    Secretary McDonough [continuing]. Over promise, but I get 
it. I understood the arguments made yesterday. I talked to Matt 
about them.
    Senator Sullivan. Oh, good.
    Secretary McDonough. And, you know, we'll lose Matt, 
unfortunately, at the end of this May----
    Senator Sullivan. Yes, he's done a good job.
    Secretary McDonough [continuing]. But you've got my 
commitment to stay on top of this.
    Senator Sullivan. Great, thank you. Next one we talked 
about--look, we're talking a lot about the PACT Act. One of the 
big flaws was the Camp Lejeune component of that which did not 
have trial lawyer contingency fee caps. To his credit, the 
Attorney General of the United States went and looked at the 
existing law and came back and said the Federal Tort Claims Act 
actually covers this.
    So, the announcement made by him, you, Secretary of the 
Navy Del Toro, was very helpful. I was disappointed--my team, 
you know, mentioned to me, I would've mentioned on our call, we 
had asked a number of questions of the VA on this topic last 
year. We just got the answers yesterday. And you guys 
essentially didn't take a position. I hope you can be a little 
bit more forward-leaning the way the Attorney General was.
    And here's the issue. Despite you guys, Secretary of the 
Navy, the AG saying, hey, veterans of America, Camp Lejeune 
veterans, don't do anything above 20 or 25 percent. Matter of 
fact, the Attorney General of the United States said any law 
firm charging above that is subject to civil and criminal 
liabilities.
    But, you know, some people don't follow the law. Saddle 
Rock Legal Group, the AVA Law Group based in Montana. Just 
recently my team was looking into these guys are advertising on 
TV. They're still charging 60 percent contingency fees. The 
American Legion, the VFW made this their number one issue, to 
get these law firms to stop ripping off the families of sick 
Marines. And we solved it.
    But guess what? These law firms don't give a damn. They 
don't give a damn what the Attorney General says. We're 
reporting them to the Attorney General. I hope he smacks them 
with criminal penalties--60 percent. That's like highway 
robbery against veterans.
    So, Mr. Secretary, can you commit to me to continue to work 
with us, but also importantly, have at the local VA offices on 
your website, which I think you already do, veterans should not 
sign up for anything more than 25 percent. It's against the 
law. Yes. And don't get ripped off by these unscrupulous law 
firms. So can you kind of strongly stand against these----
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. Like, as I told you, and we 
discussed when the Attorney General did what he did, that we 
supported him in that we think this is the right thing to do to 
make sure that vets get their fair share.
    Senator Sullivan. Can you commit, though, to keep--you guys 
have a great network with veterans' VSOs. Like I said, American 
Legion, VFW, made this their top priority. Keep trying to get 
the word out.
    Secretary McDonough. We'll keep pushing.
    Senator Sullivan. I saw these ads on TV like three weeks 
ago, as I mentioned to you, and it's just, like, come on, 
really. These cockroaches are trying to take money from sick 
marines and their families. It's just wrong. It's wrong. Gosh, 
it's wrong.
    Let me just make one final quick question. I know on the 
community care, a lot of discussion on that. Senator Hassan 
mentioned Alaska, New Hampshire, are not having full-service 
hospitals. Can I get just--maybe not right now, unless you have 
it--an update. There was expansion plans for VA facilities, not 
hospitals, but clinics in Fairbanks, in Anchorage, in the Mat-
Su Valley, on the Kenai Peninsula, Homer, Juneau.
    And what I'm concerned about, Mr. Secretary, is you guys 
are looking to cut back on staffing. You know, in Alaska, 
what's worked is actually getting more staffing as we've built 
up these facilities. Like North Carolina, we're seeing a big 
increase in our veteran population in our state.
    Secretary McDonough. It's good.
    Senator Sullivan. So can you make sure as you're trying to 
rightsize more broadly, that the places where your facilities 
are increasing, the veteran population is increasing, that 
you're not cutting there. We want more VA officials, doctors, 
nurses. We love them in Alaska. As I mentioned, you know, our 
referral backlog alone, which is quite big, I mentioned the 
number of 10,000, is important to make sure we continue to have 
robust staffing as we're growing up the VA not cuts.
    Secretary McDonough. Yes. So I had good conversation with 
our VISN lead. They've really appreciated the engagement with 
you on that. So just two things. On the infrastructure, I'll be 
more than happy to talk to you about our infrastructure plan 
for Alaska.
    Senator Sullivan. Good.
    Secretary McDonough. We're not backing off that.
    Senator Sullivan. Thank you.
    Secretary McDonough. As I said, we're trying to skate to 
the puck. As I told Senator Tillis, exercising every authority 
we have and being really creative about it, you know, the next 
place to do this is JBER.
    Senator Sullivan. Great.
    Secretary McDonough. You know, and so there's no reason 
that we should be sending vets downtown and active duty docs 
downtown to operate on vets down there. We can do that right at 
JBER and save the taxpayer a lot of money. So, we're not 
backing off the infrastructure plan. On the backlog, we've seen 
substantial improvement since February. In large measure----
    Senator Sullivan. It's really big, though, as you have to 
acknowledge.
    Secretary McDonough. No, I'm not saying it's not, but I 
don't see that number that you talked about. But I'm going to 
leave this with you so that we're on the same page. And so, I 
can find out if I'm looking at the wrong thing. In large 
measure, we've been able to do that by ramping up MSAs. So 
those are the schedulers who help make those appointments, 
yes----
    Senator Sullivan. Who need to be based in Alaska.
    Secretary McDonough. Exactly. And so, that's an example of 
strategic hiring where we need those kinds of personnel, you 
know, we're going to make those decisions. But again, when 
you're operating under a cap, you got to balance this 
somewhere. We put out those, the tradeoffs in the budget, but, 
you know, we're making good progress here, working together 
with you guys. We're going to stay on top of it.
    Senator Sullivan. Okay. Thank you.
    Secretary McDonough. And again, we're not walking back from 
our infrastructure investments. We just have to prove to you 
guys that we're really serious and we've done everything we 
can, and then we're going to come and say, hey, we need the 
whatever, you know, the $2 billion per copy for hospitals. 
That's going to be really expensive. But I don't feel right 
that we should come to you with an aggressive ask like that 
until we've done every single creative thing we can.
    Senator Sullivan. Great. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. Yes. Before we conclude the first panel, I 
feel, for tradition's sake, I've got to recognize Tillis just 
for five seconds.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Senator Sullivan and 
I served together for eight years on Senate Armed Services, and 
he repeatedly quotes on a per capita basis, Alaska has the more 
veterans. I remind Senator Sullivan that we have more veterans 
than he has people.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Tillis. And if you were to cut my veterans 
population in half, we'd still have more veterans.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Sullivan. All right. Well, but it's true, Mr. 
Secretary, we got more veterans per capita. I think Montana's 
second, but Alaska's number one.
    Secretary McDonough. 7,000 veterans a month in new--in 
North Carolina. August, September, October last year, 7,000 a 
month. New ones.
    Chairman Tester. So with that, thank you, Secretary 
McDonough.
    Secretary McDonough. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Tester. I will say this at the end of the hearing, 
but there will be questions. I would ask that you and your team 
answer them as----
    Secretary McDonough. We'll get them back to you before a 
year from now.
    Chairman Tester [continuing]. Quickly as you can. Thank you 
very much.
    Secretary McDonough. Thank you.
    Chairman Tester. Now we're going to hear from three 
Veterans Service Organizations responsible for the Independent 
Budget. I want to introduce the folks on this next panel. 
Kristina Keenan--all these folks are familiar to the Committee, 
by the way.
    Kristina Keenan, Deputy Director of the National 
Legislative Service at VFW. We have Roscoe Butler, Senior 
Health Policy Advisor for Paralyzed Veterans of America. And 
last, but certainly not least, we have Shane Liermann, who's 
the Deputy National Legislative Director for Disabled American 
Veterans.
    I'm going to give you guys two minutes, but it'll be a--I'm 
not going to drop the gavel on you. All right. So make it 
quick, though, if you can because we appreciate your input. 
It's very, very important. And please know this, just because 
it's Tillis and I here. The people that really do the work are 
the folks that sit behind us. And so, we appreciate you being 
here. And Kristina, you have the floor.

    STATEMENT OF KRISTINA KEENAN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, NATIONAL 
         LEGISLATIVE SERVICE, VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS

    Ms. Keenan. Chairman Tester, and Members of the Committee, 
on behalf of the Independent Budget Veterans Service 
Organizations, DAV, PVA, and VFW, thank you for the opportunity 
to present our recommendations for fiscal years 2025, 2026.
    For more than 30 years, the IBVSOs have provided 
independent budget recommendations to ensure that VA remains 
fully funded and capable of carrying out its mission. First, 
it's important to note that VA's full-year appropriation was 
not enacted until half the year had passed. The routine use of 
continuing resolutions limits VA's ability to expand access to 
benefits and services for Veterans. Congress must do better.
    A critical component of VA's healthcare delivery is its 
infrastructure. We're concerned that VA's request for major and 
minor construction is one-third lower than what VA requested 
last year, and far below what is necessary. It's important to 
have modern and up-to-date facilities. We recommend $5.2 
billion for major construction, more than four times the 
current funding, and $910 million for minor construction. A 30 
percent increase.
    VA infrastructure funding has remained stagnant for far too 
long. In the past 10 years, it has only increased 5 percent. 
Meanwhile, the construction backlog has grown exponentially; 
116 percent since 2014. Funding must increase to keep up. 
Private healthcare, on the other hand, invest considerably more 
into the infrastructure of their networks.
    Last Congress, Kaiser Permanente testified before this 
Committee that they invest about 3 percent of their overall 
operating budget into infrastructure. VA invests about 1 
percent. Unless there's a drastic increase in resources for VA, 
we will continue to see this backlog grow. Infrastructure costs 
have increased year after year, and they will not get any less 
expensive over time.
    I will now turn over to Roscoe Butler from PVA to present 
our recommendations for VA healthcare.

page 52 of the Appendix.]

   STATEMENT OF ROSCOE BUTLER, SENIOR HEALTH POLICY ADVISOR, 
                 PARALYZED VETERANS OF AMERICA

    Mr. Butler. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the 
independent budgets, recommendations for VA medical services 
for fiscal year 2025. As noted in the Independent Budget 
Veterans Service Organization's written statement, the IBVSOs 
recommended approximately $151.8 billion in total resources for 
VA medical care for FY '25 appropriations.
    Our fiscal year 2025 recommendation primarily reflects the 
increased funding baseline for all medical care programs 
established over the past three years, continuing enrollment 
increases, continuing inflation, a federal pay raise, and 
increased workloads.
    However, I would like to address some funding concerns the 
IB identified with funding trends in the VA's budget. Over the 
past decade, VA's reliance on community care has risen 
dramatically. While we agree that veterans must have non-VA 
options to fill gaps in care, we believe VA must remain the 
primary provider and coordinator of veterans' care.
    While VA is requesting an overall increase for medical 
care, the community care program is growing at a faster rate 
than VA direct care. In addition, VA's request would cut 10,000 
healthcare FTE, including 600 physicians, 2,400 nurses, 500 
non-physician providers, and over 2,000 healthcare technicians 
despite VA's reporting more than 66,000 healthcare vacancies at 
the start of the year. We should not be cutting positions when 
we can't even fill the ones that are already there.
    Also, we are concerned with VA's projected use of $12.7 
billion in carryover funding rather than requesting new 
discretionary appropriations. If VA's unobligated balance at 
the end of FY '24 is less than projected, it could trigger a 
funding shortfall next year.
    This concludes my oral statement. Now, Mr. Liermann from 
DAV will speak briefly about our funding recommendations for VA 
benefits and services.

   STATEMENT OF SHANE LIERMANN, DEPUTY NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE 
              DIRECTOR, DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS

    Mr. Liermann. Veterans submitted over 2.4 million claims in 
fiscal year 2023 for benefits primarily disability 
compensation, which is 39 percent higher than the prior year. 
The Veterans Benefits Administration processed 1.9 million 
benefits claims in fiscal year 2023, surpassing the previous 
all-time record by 16 percent. As of April 28th, just a few 
days ago, there are over 946,000 claims pending within VBA, 32 
percent of them are considered backlogged.
    Therefore, it's critical that VBA be appropriately funded. 
And the IBVSOs recommend a total of $6.2 billion for VBA in 
fiscal year 2025, a 9 percent increase. This includes plus-ups 
for more employees, as well as 130 million for overtime to 
process the backlog and pending claims.
    The Board of Veterans Appeals continues to resolve more 
appeals in recent years. Yet, at the start of fiscal year 2024, 
there were over 200,000 appeals pending, 72,000 of those were 
awaiting hearings. Additionally, we are concerned that the 
board conducted 11,000 fewer hearings in fiscal year 2023 than 
before.
    For fiscal year 2025, the IBVSOs recommend $333 million for 
the board, a 14 percent increase, which includes a plus-up of 
220 new FTE to address the backlogs of appeals and hearings.
    In closing, we believe that the greatest roadblock to 
properly funding veterans benefits and services comes from 
budgetary enforcement mechanisms designed to limit federal 
spending. To ensure that our Nation meets its sacred obligation 
and its moral imperative to our Nation's veterans, we call on 
Congress to exempt veterans' programs, services, and benefits 
from congressional PAYGO and CUTGO rules, as well as work to 
eliminate the use of CRs for VA care and services.
    Mr. Chairman, that concludes our testimony. We are prepared 
to answer any questions you may have.
    Chairman Tester. I thank all three of you for being here 
and for your testimony. And Shane, I think your last statement 
really speaks more to dysfunction in Congress than anything 
else. The fact is, if we were getting our budgets done and done 
on time, we wouldn't have to be talking about CRs. That seemed 
to happen far, far, far more often than we should.
    So, I very much appreciate all your comments and understand 
what you're saying, for sure. Because the truth is, a veteran 
serves this country and they serve it, and we make promises, 
and CRs don't live up to those promises, quite honestly.
    So, any one of you can answer this question. The testimony 
that you've three brought forward raises concerns about 
community care spending, especially as it compared to spending 
for direct care. Given the memberships of your organizations 
and the impacts that their military services had on their 
abilities physically and mentally, what should we keep in mind 
as we emerge--as we engage in this conversation about community 
care versus direct care?
    Mr. Butler. I'll just say, Chairman, VA has always had 
community care. That's not nothing new. We need to continue to 
realize that direct care, to maintain VA to be able to be a 
provider of care, we need to ensure that acute care is primary 
and/or direct care is primary. And that only when VA cannot 
provide the care in the community should community care be 
provided outside of the VA.
    Chairman Tester. Okay. Appreciate that.
    Ms. Keenan. Mr. Chairman, I'll just----
    Chairman Tester. Yes, go ahead.
    Ms. Keenan [continuing]. Add really quickly. Our veterans 
consistently tell us that they prefer VA healthcare, and that 
community care can supplement when needed. So, we hope, and we 
ask that VA continue to focus, and focus even more on improving 
their direct care, primarily.
    Chairman Tester. Thank you. Okay.
    Mr. Liermann. Yes. Thank you, Senator. One of our concerns 
always is, is VA really managing that veteran. Once they go out 
in town, they do community care. Is all that information, 
medications, treatment, being put back in the record, and is 
the VA successfully managing it? Because if they're not, then 
we have concerns of polypharmacy. Are veterans being 
overmedicated? Are the medications being interactive 
negatively? Is anybody really looking at the negative impacts 
that this has on their long-term care?
    Chairman Tester. Appreciate it. Appreciate all three of 
you. Look, we all know the importance of VA staffing, 
especially VHA staffing. It's all important though, but 
truthfully, when it comes to healthcare, those healthcare 
workers are very important. Benefits are important, too, but I 
want to focus on the VHA staff.
    The VA has hired a bunch of folks. There's no doubt about 
that. It's been pretty well documented. It's also documented 
pretty well that they're stopping for a second. They're taking 
a breath. They're going to analyze what they got. I don't 
necessarily think that's a bad thing. But what I do think is a 
bad thing is after that analysis is done, they either have to 
not hire or hire, depending on what that analysis is.
    Talk about shortcomings and reduced staff, and 
understaffing of VHA, and what that does to the VA, especially 
when we consider we're having a record enrollment right now.
    Ms. Keenan. I'll just start with record enrollment, as you 
said, we want to make sure that we're not increasing increases 
in wait times either. We want to be able to serve the veterans 
that we're estimating are going to be coming in in the next 
fiscal year. And VA has roughly 75,000 vacancies still. Our 
budget recommendations are to try to reach, at least, a quarter 
of that. So, we hope that VA will continue to rigorously hire.
    Chairman Tester. So right now, your predictions--before I 
get to you, Roscoe--your predictions are right now is that the 
VA is 75,000 short on healthcare workers?
    Ms. Keenan. Yes.
    Chairman Tester. Okay. Go ahead, Roscoe.
    Mr. Butler. VA's first quarter staffing report shows that 
there's 66,000 vacancies in VHA. For us, you know, we go out 
and conduct site visits at VA Medical Centers, SCI/D Centers. 
And the impact we are seeing is that there are nursing 
shortages in the SCI/D program, and they're not able to fill 
those vacancies. So that means that the current nursing staffs 
have to take on more responsibilities and duties, burnout, and 
physician burnouts.
    And it will only get worse with increasing enrollment as 
more veterans are enrolled in the system, unless we're hiring 
more people than the shortages, the staffing will tend to burn 
out. And, you know, working in a unit like spinal cord is not 
the same as working in an acute care setting.
    Chairman Tester. Amen.
    Mr. Liermann. Obviously, when we don't have enough staff, 
veterans are not going to have timely access that they need. 
But then if you think about it, we're actually now feeding into 
community care.
    So the fewer appointments, and physicians, and nurses that 
are available, the more we're going to be sending into 
community care. So then that cost is going to continue to rise. 
And so, then we're going to have less money to spend on direct 
care, and then we're going to have less people. We're going to 
feed into this entire system if we're not appropriately 
staffing healthcare now to make sure they're getting what they 
need upfront when veterans come in for assistance.
    Chairman Tester. Appreciate that. Senator Tillis.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you-all for 
being here today.
    I've tried to reconcile the comments from Secretary 
McDonough, which was to through attrition manage down 10,000 
positions. Does that mean that that number goes from 75,000 to 
85,000 in your view?
    Ms. Keenan. Honestly, I'm not sure how attrition is going 
to affect vacancies. I think it's important that attrition is 
stable. I think that's a very good thing, and we're happy to 
hear that.
    Senator Tillis. I understand that your assessment that 
there are some 75,000 more positions that need to be filled. Do 
you believe that that is the view and a priority of the VA?
    Ms. Keenan. I mean, from anecdotal evidence, we've heard 
that there's been a pause. So we hope that that really is just 
to regroup and we're strongly urging VA to continue hiring and 
to fill those vacancies.
    Senator Tillis. I talk with Secretary McDonough, and 
incidentally, I'm very positive about Secretary McDonough. He's 
very prepared. I think he's doing a good job. Everybody can 
improve. I'm sure you-all could say that about your own 
organizations. But I feel like we're not really addressing the 
elephant in the room, and that is we are going to get more 
enrollments.
    I was going to talk to you all about maybe the increase in 
disability claims as a result of the PACT Act. I'm kind of 
interested, it seems like they're triaging the claims pretty 
quickly. I'm kind of interested in the quality of those exams 
on the back end and the timeliness.
    Maybe I can get to that, but I want to get to a macro thing 
here. And maybe I could be disproven, and maybe I should have 
thought twice about voting against the PACT Act that had TEAM 
Act in there, Camp Lejeune toxics. I know that you-all know my 
office was carrying that through.
    But I worried about making sure that we got all this stuff 
squared, and I worry about whether or not we have the funding 
tail, the staffing tail. You know, at what point do these bills 
come due? At what point are we potentially going to run into a 
cliff in the VA for all the commitments we've made versus the 
positions we can hire and the money we can appropriate.
    We've got to really step back and make sure--see in the 
same way that we're running into a fiscal cliff with Social 
Security that's probably going to hit somewhere in the next six 
or eight years, that's when you don't have the money and you 
start cutting and breaking the promises you've made.
    So how would you-all suggest we kind of get a big-picture-
view of--I feel like we're kind of talking past each other when 
I hear we're managing down 10,000 fewer positions, we need 
75,000 more positions, we need less community care, but we're 
not producing--yes, we don't want to put an emphasis on 
community care, but we're not producing enough indigenous 
capacity to handle the veterans and the population's growing.
    So, am I just being overly cynical, or do I feel like Cool 
Hand Luke--what we have here is a failure to communicate?
    Mr. Liermann. Actually, I think all three of us would 
agree. When we went to the budget briefings, and we've 
discussed all of this internally, we're still trying to wrap 
our head around some of these concepts as well. We're going to 
lose 10,000 physicians positions due to attrition, but yet, we 
still need 75,000 more.
    To your point, it doesn't make sense. So our concern, I 
think, will always be making sure there is enough staffing so 
veterans have the high quality VA healthcare when they need it 
so we're not over reliant on community care.
    And if I may address the PACT Act real quick just because I 
was very involved in that, and I do a lot of the claims and 
benefits for this team. We've been pleasantly surprised. Over 
956,000, I think, roughly, as how many claims have been 
actually granted of 1.2 million PACT Act claims that have been 
filed.
    So, they've actually done a great job in processing the 
claims. They really have. As far as examinations, I'm always 
willing to bend somebody's ear for a few hours to talk about VA 
exams. I won't do that right now, but I think we've seen some 
improvement in that area. But overall, I think they've done a 
great job on the PACT Act.
    Now, right now, as I noted, Senator, 32 percent of the 
claims that are pending are backlogged. We knew there was going 
to be a peak of claims and a backlog of claims because of the 
sheer volume coming through. Overall, I think VA has done a 
great job with the PACT Act. Obviously, there's more things 
that they could improve on, they could do better, and we can 
discuss that later. I can with your team. But I really think 
overall, they've done much better than most of us were 
expecting.
    Senator Tillis. And I'm glad to hear that because in spite 
of the fact I voted against it, I'm rooting for it. You know, a 
lot of the policy in there, but I still worry about this cliff 
out there because I stipulate what you-all say as being 
accurate, needs that are unmet. I just don't see how those all 
square, and I just don't know over what period of time.
    And Mr. Chair, the only other thing that--you know, I hear 
almost a $1 billion of funding request for the electronic 
health record. Is that what I heard? And you know, I mean, 
there's going to be more if they decide not to step back from 
it, which I hope they don't do. But I mean, there's just so 
much stuff out there, and it would be nice over the course of 
this Congress if we could get it written down or just soothe my 
worries out, your worries.
    We could have a change of administration next year. We 
could have a change of VA secretaries. You know, a lot of stuff 
needs to be documented, finish to start. How do we make sure 
that we're not going to run over a cliff here with all these 
deficiencies either in funding and manpower. That's what I'm 
mainly worried about, and mainly worried about it for the sake 
of the veterans. Thank you-all.
    Mr. Butler. Just, Mr. Tillis, let me say----
    Senator Tillis. Yes, sir, Mr. Roscoe.
    Mr. Butler. To your question, we're at that tipping point, 
and to the Secretary, pretty much is telling us that because he 
said they have to make difficult decisions and they made those 
difficult decisions. And so how you turn things around, that's 
the question. Because at some point, if community care 
continues to rise over direct care, if staffing they're not 
filling all of the vacancies that they need to fill, people 
continue to work longer hours and get burned out, then that has 
a very negative impact on the quality of care VA provides.
    Ms. Keenan. I'll just add one last thing. A lot of the 
budget recommendations that we're making is to make the VA more 
efficient, and that's going to be cost-saving over time. Thank 
you.
    Chairman Tester. Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I think many of the 
points on questions I would've raised with you, and asked for 
your views and your points have been asked, I'm told, because a 
lot of my questions always relate to community care. And that 
has been addressed by my colleagues.
    A couple of things I would ask you, though. The PACT Act 
directed that the VA hold quarterly engagements with VSOs to 
help evaluate presumptions of service-connection. I guess tell 
me about the engagements. Are they mattering, but importantly, 
do you feel the VA's resourcing the Vet Home, the Office of 
Research and Development, and the broader execution of the 
presumptive decision process? Are those things adequate and 
focused on delivering the promises of the PACT Act?
    Mr. Liermann. Thank you, Senator. They do have quarterly 
meetings that we've been invited to offsites about PACT Act 
implementation. However, specifically to diseases, and what 
they're looking at and with the Home, I don't believe any of 
those have happened. If they have, they haven't invited DAV, 
PVA, or VFW. Not to say that they haven't, but we've been 
asking those questions about when are the presumptives being 
done.
    They are informing us they are looking at different 
categories of diseases, and I believe the K-2 study will be out 
in June. They're looking at a few other diseases, but overall, 
we're not aware of that those quarterly meetings have actually 
started. They haven't with the VSOs.
    Senator Moran. That's useful information. And assuming that 
you want those meetings to take place, I would guess that 
Senator Tester and I would join each other in insisting and 
encouraging that the department do what the law requires them 
to do.
    Let me talk a moment about the independent budget. PACT Act 
implementation has led to an uptick, a large uptick in 
disability claims filed and processed. Can you speak to what 
your service officers are seeing with access to disability 
claims and the quality of these exams during this process?
    Are your service officers and veterans in your organization 
seeing any decline in the quality of the outcomes of 
adjudicated claims? And do you believe that processors are 
receiving the proper training to adjudicate both PACT Act-
related claims, but also specialty claims?
    Ms. Keenan. From the perspective of the VFW service 
officers, we have a wide network of service officers throughout 
the country, and there seems some positive outcomes with PACT 
Act claims. For the veterans that we represent, they are being 
processed in a timely manner.
    Of course, it could be quicker, but we are seeing positive 
outcomes. There's always more to be worked on. But from this 
point of view, for the moment those PACT Act claims are going 
through. Now, we are recommending through our budget 
recommendations that VA hire more claims processors, raters, 
and that they constantly have the oversight of C&P exams so 
that veterans can if need be rescheduled depending on their 
daily lives. That kind of thing.
    So we are continuing to monitor this, but we are optimistic 
that this has been a good outcome with the PACT Act, and the 
VA's taking this seriously, and they are processing more claims 
than ever before in history.
    Senator Moran. Kristina, do you see any reduction in the 
quality of the examination of the determination?
    Ms. Keenan. So we know that the approvals for PACT Act 
claims have gone up percentage-wise, and that was sort of a big 
concern of ours before the PACT Act. So that is a positive 
change. There are always going to be some cases where we're not 
satisfied or the veteran is not satisfied, and we really think 
oversight and quality assurance is really key to monitoring 
that process.
    Senator Moran. Thank you for both of your answers. This is 
the question that I was going to ask the Secretary, but I'd 
like for you to express your views on this topic. State 
Veterans Homes play an important role in caring for aging 
veterans and our critical partners of the VA. I'm concerned 
that the VA is only requesting $141 million for grants for 
construction of state home facilities, which represents a 14 
percent decrease from FY '24.
    The current priority list is over a hundred projects with a 
total VA cost share of nearly $1.8 billion. That doesn't come 
close to meeting the need. And I would like your response to--
since I can't ask the Secretary, the justification, maybe you 
can help me make the case for either this is appropriate or 
insufficient?
    Ms. Keenan. I mean, just looking at the numbers, $141 
million is what VA's requesting. And collectively, the IBVSOs 
are requesting or suggesting $600 million for State Veterans 
Home construction grants. So, we really see that there's a 
strong need. We have an aging veteran population, and so we 
really need to be considerate of all aspects of healthcare for 
veterans.
    Mr. Liermann. And if I may, there's a local cemetery--or 
excuse me, state home--been a long day--not too far from where 
I live. I'm very active in a DAV Chapter in Arlington, Fairfax 
Northern Virginia. There was a State Veterans Home that was 
authorized and paid for grants by VA and by the state. It's 
been built and empty for two years.
    We try to get answers so that our aging members in that 
area can have access. We're being told by the State of Virginia 
that the problem is actually a federal VA problem because VA 
needs to make decisions. VA is saying, ``No, we gave you the 
grants. You have everything you need.'' So an example of a 
problem within the system for grants and getting it done. 
There's a nursing home in Northern Virginia that's been 
complete for two years when nobody's occupied it.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Liermann, you used your time just like I 
did use mine just to get somebody else to highlight a problem 
in hopes that they fix it. And we'll work with you on this as 
well to see if we can't get VA attention.
    Mr. Chairman, that concludes my questions.
    Chairman Tester. So it's not being used? Is this a State 
Veterans Home or is this a federal, it's a VA?
    Mr. Liermann. That's the problem. It's a State Veterans 
Home, but we're being told it's controlled by the federal and 
that's why it's a very confusing problem.
    Chairman Tester. Look, I mean, you ping pong things back 
and forth, but the truth is there's an expenditure of taxpayer 
dollars here. That was a total waste of money unless they get 
that thing opened up and provide the services. I'm going to 
tell you that I will get ahold of Kane and the other fellow's 
name--what's his name? I can't remember it really quick.
    Senator Moran. You're not asking me. You're asking your 
staff?
    Chairman Tester. No, that's it.
    [Laughter.]
    Chairman Tester. At any rate, I say that in jest, but we 
will get ahold of the two Senators from Virginia.
    Senator Moran. Oh, Virginia. I do know those guys.
    Chairman Tester. Do you?
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Moran. Yes.
    Chairman Tester. Well, we'll put them to work, because the 
truth of the matter is this is crazy and it's just flat stupid. 
So, we'll do that. So, they might be calling you. So, it's 
good. I want to thank you guys for being here--gals, guys--
everybody for the independent budget. Of course, thank the 
Secretary. Both these panels are really critically important as 
we work through the 2025 appropriations process.
    This record will be kept open for a week. Any questions, I 
would ask that you respond to them as quickly as you can.
    Chairman Tester. This hearing is now adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 5:19 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
