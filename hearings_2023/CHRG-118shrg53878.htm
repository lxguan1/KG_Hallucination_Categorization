                      TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2023

                              United States Senate,
                                Committee on the Judiciary,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:08 a.m., in 
Room 216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. Richard J. Durbin, 
Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Durbin [presiding], Whitehouse, 
Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Hirono, Booker, Ossoff, Graham, 
Grassley, Cornyn, Lee, Hawley, Cotton, Kennedy, Tillis, and 
Blackburn.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD J. DURBIN,
           A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

    Chair Durbin. This meeting of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee will come to order. This hearing, entitled ``Book 
Bans: Examining How Censorship Limits Liberty and Literature,'' 
will come to order.
    In 1928, the City of Chicago banned a book, known as ``The 
Wonderful Wizard of Oz,'' from all of its public libraries. 
Local leaders claimed that the book would have, quote, ``an 
ungodly influence on its readers.''
    We now consider ``The Wonderful World''--pardon me, ``The 
Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' to be, in the words of the Library of 
Congress, a timeless American classic. Unfortunately, there is 
a long history in our country of banning books we now consider 
classic works of literature.
    This video, which I'm about to show, will indicate this is 
not the first time that the Senate Judiciary Committee has 
considered the negative influence of books. I ask them to start 
the video.
    [Video is shown.]
    Chair Durbin. In the 1850s, ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' the 
classic antislavery novel, was banned throughout the Southern 
United States. Two decades later, in 1873, Congress passed the 
Comstock Act, a law that mandated up to 5 years in prison for 
any person who sold or distributed a book that was, quote, 
``obscene, lewd, or lascivious.'' The law did not define the 
terms, and hundreds of Americans were convicted for 
distributing books about topics such as atheism and 
reproductive health.
    As the video showed, this Committee itself held a series of 
hearings in 1954 to examine the threat that comic books, like 
``Superman,'' posed to children. The anti-comics' panic 
culminated in the industry's comics code that censored comic 
books for decades. That may seem absurd today, but extremists 
continue to fight popular graphic novels like ``Maus,'' and 
other books.
    In 2022, there were over 1,000 requests to ban books at 
public schools and libraries, the most in almost 20 years.
    Here are just a few of the books that have been banned or 
restricted in schools and libraries over the past few years: 
``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,'' ``The Handmaid's Tale,'' 
``Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,'' ``A Raisin in 
the Sun,'' ``Brave New World,'' and ``Beloved.'' These are 
books written by some of the greatest American authors, 
including trailblazing Black women like Toni Morrison and Maya 
Angelou. Even works written by Martin Luther King, Jr., were 
banned temporarily in a fervor to limit access to books about 
race or racism, all in the name of prohibiting material 
supposedly related to Critical Race Theory.
    Let's be clear: Efforts to ban books are wrong, whether 
they come from the right or the left. While we ban books like 
``Maus'' or ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' in the name of protecting 
students, we are instead denying these students an opportunity 
to learn about different people and difficult subjects. 
Limiting access to a book about antisemitism or racism does not 
protect students from the actual history, or the reality, that 
hate still exists.
    In the name of protecting students, politicians have 
targeted books that include LGBTQ+ subject matter. One out of 
every 4 banned books features LGBTQ+ characters and themes, 
according to PEN America. No one is advocating for sexually 
explicit content to be available in an elementary school 
library or a children's section of a library. That's a 
distraction from the real challenge.
    I understand and respect that parents may choose to limit 
what their children read, especially at younger ages. My wife 
and I did. Others do, too.
    But no parent should have the right to tell another 
parent's child what they can and cannot read in school or at 
home. Every student deserves access to books that reflect their 
experiences and help them better understand who they are.
    I want to commend Senator Cornyn, who said last year, and I 
quote, ``As a general rule, I don't favor banning age-
appropriate and subject-appropriate books for children. They 
need to hear a diversity of views.'' I agree with him. That's 
exactly right.
    Unfortunately, librarians and teachers across this country, 
who are just doing their jobs, have been threatened with 
physical violence and criminal prosecution by a small group of 
zealots. These efforts to ban books violate our most cherished 
principles as Americans and betray our values as a Nation. We 
must protect our students and their freedom to read and learn. 
With that, I hand this off to Ranking Member Graham for his 
opening statement.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY O. GRAHAM,
        A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, if you're a 
parent out there listening to this hearing, I would encourage 
you to advocate for your child. I would encourage you to go to 
the school district, the library, wherever you believe is 
appropriate, on behalf of your child. You have an obligation, 
as a parent, to lend your voice to the cause you think helps 
your child develop in the right way.
    About this hearing, what is our role here? What am I 
supposed to do? Am I supposed to take over every school board 
in the country and veto their decisions about what books go 
into public schools? In the library--you know, I didn't spend a 
lot of time in the library. That speaks poorly of me. But am I 
supposed to, as a United States Senator, take over the 
libraries all over this country and be the final say of what 
goes in a library? I hope not. I think not.
    So, this is an important hearing in this regard: It shows 
the difference of the two parties on this issue. School boards, 
whether elected or appointed, in our system, should be the 
people we go to to talk about what's in a school. A library 
board should be the group of people decides what goes in a 
library. And if you don't like the outcome, at least you can 
complain.
    And to all the parents out there who believe there's a 
bunch of stuff in our schools being pushed on your children 
that go over the line, you're absolutely right.
    To governors and to local officials who want to make sure 
that agendas are not being pushed upon your children, you're 
right to speak up.
    In Burbank, California, some school district banned 
``Huckleberry Finn'' [holds up a book cover], ``To Kill a 
Mockingbird'' [holds up a book cover.] I don't agree with that, 
but that was your right to make that decision.
    So, what I want to leave with you, Mr. Chairman, is that 
we, on this side, I think to a person--I understand what 
Senator Cornyn's saying, but he'll speak for himself in a 
minute. I don't think there's one person on our side of the 
aisle believes that we, the Federal Government, should be 
deciding these issues.
    And if you don't like the outcome, pick a school board you 
do like. And it's wrong for conservatives to try to pick school 
board members--it's absolutely okay for every liberal 
organization to destroy conservatives who make decisions they 
don't like.
    So, we're not buying this. We're not going to be 
intimidated. To governors out there, I look to you for 
leadership on such issues. Some are providing it, and 
congratulations to you. To parents, don't give an inch on this. 
Speak up. Violence is never the answer. But show up, speak up. 
And a lot of the times, the books that are being complained 
about by parents you can't even read in the public hearing. And 
I won't read it today. But somebody needs to understand that 
this is a big issue for many parents in this country.
    And, Mr. Chairman, this Committee has done a lot of good 
work on social media reform. I like you. We've worked on 
immigration. We can have our differences. But to me, here's 
what we should be talking about right now. And I'll be brief.
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. As we talk about the Federal Government's 
role in deciding what goes in a library or a school, there's 
been 347 percent increase in illegal crossings since 2020--
183,000 people came over illegally in July. We've had 146 
people on the terrorist watchlist. In FY22, which is about 2.4 
million, came across.
    Since President Biden's been President, five-and-a-half 
million people have come across illegally. That's bigger than 
the State of South Carolina.
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham. Last couple of weeks, smugglers with ISIS 
ties helped migrants enter U.S. from Mexico, raising alarm 
bells. I'd like to be talking about that. And, matter of fact, 
you can go get the classified briefing. You ought to. It would 
scare you. And, finally----
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Graham [continuing]. It's just not me saying these 
things. New York City--the mayor--is ``at capacity . . . We 
have no more room in the city, and we need help.'' ``This is a 
national crisis that's begged for a national response since day 
one.'' The migrant crisis ``will destroy New York City.'' ``New 
York City will experience a `financial tsunami'.''
    The mayor is right. We should be trying to find a way to 
fix this problem. That, to me, is the biggest priority facing 
this Committee.
    And as to this panel, I'll listen, but I'll end where I 
started. It's not our job to decide these things, and if you're 
a parent, don't be intimidated.
    Chair Durbin. I'll say to my colleague and friend from the 
State of South Carolina that we joined in a bipartisan effort a 
few years ago. Gang of Eight--four Democrats, four 
Republicans--wrote a comprehensive immigration reform bill, 
which I still think, in the whole, can be used today as a 
template for where we need to go.
    But for 30 years, Congress has failed to pass immigration 
reform, and as a consequence, many of the things that are 
happening on the border and across our Nation are the result.
    I stand ready, and I mean it, sincerely and personally. I 
say this, to my friend from South Carolina, to gather together 
for another Gang of Eight or Ten or Four, whatever the number 
may be, to put together a comprehensive immigration reform 
bill. I think we both know what the likelihood of that passing 
in the other body is, but that shouldn't deter us from doing 
our duty. I'm ready to do it again.
    Is the publication of books an important part of----
    Senator Cornyn. Mr. Chairman?
    Chair Durbin. I'll be with you in just a second. Is the 
publication of books an important part of our jurisdiction? The 
Constitution is our jurisdiction, and the Constitution raises 
questions that I think will be addressed today in this hearing. 
Senator Cornyn.
    Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to 
point out that we haven't had a markup of an immigration bill 
in this Committee, which is the Committee of jurisdiction, 
since the current Chairman has been Chairman, and even when our 
Democratic colleagues were in charge of both the House, the 
Senate, and the White House, we haven't considered any 
immigration bills.
    I think Senator Tillis joined me in a letter to you, as 
Chairman, asking that we make some attempt to try to craft 
something that might generate bipartisan support.
    About 2 years ago, Senator Sinema, the Senator from 
Arizona, and I, and also Tony Gonzales, who represents the 
largest border district in the country, and Henry Cuellar, a 
Democrat, introduced a bipartisan, bicameral Border Solutions 
Act, I think we called it. And my thought was that at some 
point things would get so bad that President Biden, or perhaps 
even our Democratic colleagues, might be prompted to actually 
do something instead of just talk about it. And I guess I was 
wrong.
    In the meantime, as Senator Graham points out, there've 
been literally millions--I think seven million people coming 
across the border since President Biden was President.
    There've been 108,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last 
year alone, and we know that the fentanyl, which is taking many 
of our children's lives in our schools--that 71,000 of those 
800,000 were synthetic opioids. We know where it comes from. We 
know where the precursors come from. We know where the drugs 
are manufactured and pressed into pills that kids take and die.
    And then, of course, there's the 300,000 children who've 
been placed with sponsors, unaccompanied children, and the 
Biden administration can't tell you where they are. They can't 
tell you whether they're going to school, whether they're 
getting health care. They can't tell you whether they're being 
trafficked for sex, or forced into involuntary labor. They just 
can't tell you, and frankly, they don't care, because if they 
did, they would want to do something about it.
    So, I will volunteer to work with you, or anybody, but it's 
got to be more than just talk. It's got to be action. Nobody 
else can do this job. We are the ones who have to do the job, 
if it's going to get done, and so far, I don't see much in the 
way of action. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. I would just say, in response, that the bill 
we worked on with the Gang of Eight--Senator McCain, Senator 
Graham, and others--was a good faith, bipartisan effort, which 
I still think has validity to this day. And it took more than 
just a Committee hearing to achieve. It took people of good 
will, trying to work together and compromise. I'm sorry that 
you didn't support that bill, but I think it was a bill that we 
ought to return to, at this time. I'm ready to do that at any 
point, and I think we need to do so.
    Senator Graham. Mr. Chairman, I'll take you up on that. 
Bring the bill forward. Let John tell us what he doesn't like 
about it, how we can make it better, and let's vote. America is 
really in a national crisis, according to the mayor of New York 
City--not Lindsey Graham. This is incredibly dangerous, 
incredibly irresponsible. Afghanistan is now in the hands of 
the Taliban. The threat of terrorism against the United States 
is getting worse, not better. ISIS smugglers are involved with 
getting people into the United States. I think if you brought 
the Gang of Eight bill, or any other bill, as the base bill and 
have a debate on it, this Committee would be well served. We 
could all vote, we could all amend it, and I look forward to 
doing that.
    Chair Durbin. So, let's start by having our staff take a 
look at the bill. What is it, 7 or 8 years now since----
    Senator Graham. Count me in.
    Chair Durbin [continuing]. And let's update it, which I'm 
sure we'll have to do in some respects, and see if we can move 
it forward. As long as it's bipartisan and has a chance of 
passing in the Senate, as well as the House, I think it's a 
good effort.
    Senator Cornyn. Mr. Chairman, if I can just respond 
briefly? I can't even remember when the Gang of Eight bill was 
on the floor. Was that 2016?
    Chair Durbin. 2013.
    Senator Cornyn. 2013. Oh, 10 years ago. And it didn't pass 
the House. I mean, I know you are proud of that product, but, 
unfortunately, it didn't pass the House.
    And, of course, as we all know from ``Schoolhouse Rock,'' a 
bill becomes a law when it passes both Chambers of Congress and 
gets a Presidential signature.
    So, forgive me for saying this, but that bill failed to 
succeed. I know you're proud of it, but that was also at a 
different time than we're in now, and before the Biden border 
crisis became so dire. And I think there's a different dynamic. 
Certainly, there's a Republican House. They're not going to 
take up and pass a Gang of Eight bill. You know that. I know 
that. Everybody knows that. So, forgive me, but when you keep 
talking about the Gang of Eight bill as somehow being the gold 
standard, I have to disagree.
    Senator Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, may I ask you a question?
    Chair Durbin. You may.
    Senator Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, I wasn't here when the bill 
that you obviously favor was considered by the Senate. My 
question's simple: Did it grant amnesty to folks who are in our 
country illegally?
    Chair Durbin. No, Senator, I don't believe it did. I think 
the decision in the bill was that those who are undocumented, 
currently living in the United States, would report themselves 
to the Government and pay their taxes and their Social 
Security. They would not qualify for citizenship, at least in 
the outset. And the idea was to get everybody on the books, 
once and for all. I think that is a positive step forward. It 
did have favorable sections for DREAMers, which you can imagine 
I had some interest in, but there were several things we----
    Senator Kennedy. How is that not amnesty?
    Chair Durbin. DREAM Act?
    Senator Kennedy. How is that not amnesty?
    Chair Durbin. Well, it isn't as if they're being forgiven 
for wrongdoing. They were brought to this country as children 
and infants. I don't think that there was any culpable conduct 
on the part of these DREAMers, if you wish. And amnesty----
    Senator Kennedy. So, you were allowed to register, and if 
you registered, you could stay indefinitely?
    Chair Durbin. No, it was a path to citizenship for 
DREAMers. But there was no culpable conduct on the part of 
infants brought here to this country.
    Senator Kennedy. I'm just trying to understand. It just 
sounds to me like that's amnesty.
    Chair Durbin. In your eyes, it may be, but if a child is 
brought here at the age of two, to say that they are guilty of 
some criminal act or should have criminal culpability, I think, 
is an extreme position.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, I'm not trying to say two-year-olds 
are bad people. I'm just trying to understand what your bill 
does, and it sounds like----
    Chair Durbin. It's lengthy.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. It's amnesty.
    Chair Durbin. It's lengthy.
    Senator Graham. If I may, Mr. Chairman?
    Chair Durbin. Sure.
    Senator Graham. I was part of that, and sort of--here's 
what I'll tell my good friend from Louisiana. You got to get 
bipartisan buy-in. Right? You got to secure your border. If you 
don't, it's a fruitless exercise. You need to increase legal 
immigration, because we don't have enough people to work in our 
economy, and you need to deal with the people here illegally.
    And I've been very open to doing all those things, but it 
is 2023, and Senator Cornyn mentioned our effort didn't make 
it. If you want to use it as a base product, fine.
    But even I would say, in 2023, the problem is so much 
bigger than it was before. It would take more effort on the 
border. It would take a real lift to stop the flow. And I'm 
willing to work with you. I'm willing to compromise. But the 
administration has done nothing.
    Senator Kennedy, they sent a bill that nobody on our side 
would support, and it was a dream of the left. I mean, again, 
at the end of the day, I don't mind disagreeing with 
Republicans about how to fix an immigration system. I do mind 
doing nothing about it.
    And the sooner we can have this debate in this Committee--
and you may be surprised, there might be consensus, be it big 
bill, small bill, middle bill. Something's better than nothing. 
America is under siege, and we need to fix this problem.
    Chair Durbin. We're going to return----
    Senator Klobuchar. Mr. Chairman----
    Chair Durbin. Just a second. We're going to return to the 
subject of this hearing--shortly.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes. I'm looking forward to hearing the 
witnesses. But Mr. Chairman, I did want to point out, the 
argument that nothing has been considered for 8 years, or 
something like that--I actually view, when you look at the arc 
of time on this, when President Bush was in, he wanted 
desperately--a Republican President--to get this done.
    I remember Senator Graham was in the group that worked on 
this. Then you fast-forward, right, to Obama, and this was the 
effort you're talking about during that time. But even during 
President Trump, there was a major effort made, led by Senator 
Rounds, if you remember, an introduced bill that was, maybe, 
what Senator Graham was getting at when he talked about a more 
limited bill.
    It had funding for the border, significant funding for the 
border, but it also included more work on work permits and on 
visas, something people on this Committee, a number of people 
on both sides of the aisle, care about very much. DREAMers were 
covered under that bill. Temporary status people, who are 
already here, were covered under that bill.
    I don't remember every single detail, but I do remember, is 
that we had enough Republican Senators to get it over the line. 
The House was going to pass it, and then, unfortunately, 
President Trump rejected the proposal, and so then it died. 
That is what happened. I only point that out because that was a 
very recent bipartisan effort, compared to the one that was 8 
years ago.
    So, this has continued, and there has been a--to say that 
this was about amnesty or any of that, this was actually about 
moving our country forward, because, yes, border--do more, but 
no great country has expanded with a shrinking workforce, and 
we have made it so difficult for doctors and nurses and for 
people that want to be here. It has made it really hard, in 
many of our States, in the ag sector, in the hospitality 
sector, and others. And I just believe immigrants don't 
diminish America, they are America. And we have to find a way 
to do this. And one of the arguments that always seems to get 
lost is the economic argument for how important this is right 
now for our country's future.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator. Senator Whitehouse.
    Senator Whitehouse. I just wanted to observe, Mr. Chairman, 
your long and passionate advocacy for immigration reform, 
particularly around DREAMers, and recognize the Ranking Member 
for his helpful participation in multiple efforts at reforming 
the immigration system.
    I think with you both, as Chair and Ranking Member, there 
really is a prospect for doing something bipartisan and useful 
in this Committee, and count me in. I would also flag that the 
next Budget Committee hearing coming up is on the economic 
value of more robust immigration, which has very powerful 
economic value for Americans. Thank you.
    Senator Graham. Mr. Chairman, if I may? Then I'll----
    Chair Durbin. Senator Graham.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. Get you--I know you want to 
conduct the hearing, but I'm glad I brought this up. It seems 
to be--there are a lot of interest about what to do, and the 
bill that Senator Klobuchar mentioned got 54 votes. I remember 
it well. There're many combinations, small, medium, and large. 
The problem is not just small, medium, and large. It's 
unbelievably out of control.
    I've been doing this since 2006. I never dreamed that we'd 
be where we are, here today, with policies that basically are--
are in shambles. Whether you like President Trump or not, we 
had the lowest illegal crossings, in the last 40 years, on his 
watch. Now, what happened? A Democratic President changed all 
those policies, and we have a tsunami of illegal immigrants 
that are destroying New York City and other cities.
    Rather than talking today about what we should do--I don't 
care what the base bill is. It could be what Senator Klobuchar 
said. It could be any bill you want as the base bill. I'd like 
to get this Committee involved in trying to fix this problem.
    Chair Durbin. I accept your invitation to be part of that, 
and let's do it starting with that bill, perhaps others.
    Today we welcome five witnesses. I'll introduce the 
Majority witnesses, then turn to Ranking Member Graham to 
introduce the Minority witnesses.
    Our first witness is the Secretary of the State of Illinois 
Alexi Giannoulias. Secretary Giannoulias serves as State 
librarian for Illinois, as well. He's advocated for libraries 
in our State and successfully worked to prohibit restrictions 
on books, based on partisan or personal objections in Illinois. 
I look forward to hearing more about his effort in my home 
State.
    We're also joined by Professor Emily Knox, associate 
professor at the University of Illinois, an expert on 
censorship of literature, and the author of the book, ``Book 
Banning in 21st-Century America.''
    The final Majority witness is Cameron Samuels. Cameron is a 
current student at Brandeis University and graduate of Seven 
Lakes High School in Katy, Texas. In high school, Cameron led 
efforts to fight censorship in their community. They are the 
co-founder of Students Engaged in Advancing Texas, an 
organization that seeks to protect access to books for young 
people.
    Ranking Member Graham, would you like to introduce your 
witnesses?
    Senator Graham. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    We have Nicole Neily. Is that right? Ms. Neily. Yes, I got 
it right. She's president and founder of Parents Defending 
Education, the organization that has the goal of reclaiming 
schools from activists promoting political agendas, by 
fostering education based on scholarship and facts. She's also 
the founder of Speech First, a national campus free speech 
organization, has worked at the Independent Women's Forum and 
the Cato Institute. She received a bachelor of arts in 
political science from the University of Illinois, Urban-
Champaign, I guess that is----
    Chair Durbin. Urbana.
    Senator Graham [continuing]. And her master of public 
policy, in economic policy and foreign policy, from Pepperdine.
    Our second witness is Max Eden. Max, thank you. He's a 
research fellow at AEI, American Enterprise Institute, focusing 
on education reform, specifically K through 12, and early 
childhood education, and was briefly senior member at the 
Manhattan Institute.
    AEI is a public policy think tank dedicated to defending 
human dignity, expanding human potential, and building a freer 
and safer world. He co-wrote the book, ``The Book Ban Mirage,'' 
a report with scholars from the Heritage Foundation, debunking 
the myth of a book ban crisis in the United States. He received 
his B.A. in history from Yale University. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Graham. The procedure is 
customary: 5 minutes for each witness to make an opening 
statement, and then rounds of questions, each Senator allotted 
5 minutes. Please try to remain within your allotted time. Now 
I'm going to ask the witnesses as a group to stand and raise 
their right hands and take an oath.
    [Witnesses are sworn in.]
    Chair Durbin. Let the record show that the witnesses have 
answered in the affirmative. Secretary Giannoulias, you're the 
first up.

 STATEMENT OF ALEXI GIANNOULIAS, SECRETARY OF STATE, STATE OF 
                  ILLINOIS, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

    Secretary Giannoulias. Good morning, Chairman Durbin, 
Ranking Member Graham, and distinguished Members of the 
Committee on the Judiciary. Thank you for allowing me the honor 
and privilege of being here this morning.
    One of the most exciting responsibilities of serving as 
Secretary of State in the State of Illinois since January of 
this year is the ability to serve as the State's librarian. As 
our youth continue to need educational assistance in catching 
up after the disruption caused by COVID, I believe libraries, 
in every single community across this country, have had an 
especially critical role to play in increasing educational 
opportunities for all Americans. So imagine my surprise when, 
in the year 2023, instead of inheriting a debate over what more 
can be done with and for our libraries, I was confronted with a 
book banning movement upon taking office.
    You see, our libraries have become targets by a movement 
that disingenuously claims to pursue freedom but is instead 
promoting authoritarianism. Authoritarian regimes ban books, 
not democracies. Tragically, our libraries have become the 
thunderdomes of controversy and strife across our Nation, the 
likes of which we've never seen before. These radical attacks 
on our libraries have divided our communities, and our 
librarians have been harassed, threatened, and intimidated for 
simply doing their jobs. The need to stand up and fight for our 
freedoms and our librarians, especially at this perilous time 
for our democracy, is why I initiated House Bill 2789 in 
Illinois.
    This legislation, the first of its kind in the United 
States of America, is a triumph for our democracy, a win for 
First Amendment rights, and, most importantly, a great victory 
for future generations to come.
    Under this legislation, Illinois libraries will not be 
eligible for State-funded grants if they ban books. This right-
to-read legislation will help remove the pressure that 
librarians have tragically had to endure over the last couple 
of years. This legislation is important because both the 
concept and practice of banning books contradicts the very 
essence of what our country stands for and what our democracy 
was founded on. It also defies what education is all about: 
teaching our children to think for themselves.
    If the book banners care to, they can go to our libraries 
and check out the Federalist Papers, the U.S. Constitution, and 
even Supreme Court cases on the First Amendment. What they will 
learn is that our democracy depends on the marketplace of 
ideas.
    That marketplace of ideas will not function if we ban 
books, because we will be banning ideas and preventing our 
children from thinking for themselves and having the ability to 
debate and learn and understand different perspectives. We will 
be banning knowledge, culture, empathy, understanding, and 
diverse and differing world views.
    Ray Bradbury, the acclaimed Illinois author, who wrote 
``Fahrenheit 451,'' was quoted as saying, ``The problem in our 
country isn't with books being banned but with people no longer 
reading. You don't have to burn books to destroy culture. Just 
get people to stop reading them.'' And that's where the real 
danger lies.
    Parents--parents, and only parents--have the right and the 
responsibility to monitor the access of their children, and 
only their children, to library resources.
    There are more than two-and-a-half thousand instances of 
books being banned in schools last year, including many 
American classics such as ``1984,'' ``The Adventures of Huck 
Finn,'' ``The Catcher in the Rye,'' ``The Color Purple,'' ``The 
Kite Runner,'' ``Of Mice and Men,'' and ``I Know Why the Caged 
Bird Sings,'' by Maya Angelou.
    Look, I have three young daughters, and there are some 
books and titles that my wife and I don't feel are age 
appropriate for them, but I could never imagine a world where I 
would tell another family what books their kids should or 
should not be allowed to read.
    Book banners say they want, quote, ``local control.'' 
What's more local than controlling what takes place in your own 
household? That's the very definition of local control. And the 
ultimate irony is that by instituting more book bans, these 
groups want the Government to have more of a say in telling 
everyone's children what to think and believe. Well, that's 
government overreach at its peak.
    Books are a vital way to open our minds to other cultures, 
religions, identities, and possibilities. Let's also remember 
the mental health crisis growing across the country. Access to 
books and the freedom of expression help battle isolation. 
Books connect us and promote empathy and understanding. Our 
legislation establishes a clear path, opposite and away from 
the damaging trend to ban and censor books that a small but 
loud few disagree with.
    We need to take any hint of censorship seriously, because 
free speech is not only crucial to democracy but imperative for 
the survival of our civilization.
    Last point I will make. This issue should have nothing to 
do with political party. This isn't a Republican or Democrat 
issue. This is a freedom of speech and a freedom of ideas 
issue. Not once during the creation of this legislation did I 
ask a librarian if they were a Democrat or Republican.
    Not once did I ask an author if they were a Democrat or 
Republican. Not once did I ask a constitutional expert if they 
were a Democrat or Republican. Every single person we spoke to 
not only was in favor of our legislation but was deeply 
concerned with even the concept of book banning.
    We want our schools and libraries to be open and welcoming 
settings for education, not cultural battlefields. This 
legislation aims to unify our communities and seeks to restore 
a right that some of us may have grown to take for granted: the 
freedom to think for ourselves.
    It's my hope that others may look toward Illinois and see 
the value in adopting our legislation as a model to stop book 
banning in its tracks and to protect the right to read freely 
and without fear of retribution. I could not be more proud of 
this legislation, and I implore everyone in this room to 
please, please be on the right side of history and push back 
against these book bans in every and any way possible. Thank 
you, again, to the Committee.
    [The prepared statement of Secretary Giannoulias appears as 
a submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Secretary Giannoulias. Mr. Eden.

  STATEMENT OF MAX EDEN, RESEARCH FELLOW, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE 
                 INSTITUTE, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

    Mr. Eden. Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, Members 
of the Committee on the Judiciary, thank you for inviting me to 
testify. My name is Max Eden, and I'm a research fellow with 
the American Enterprise Institute.
    To put it bluntly, books aren't being banned, and it's good 
that they are. The media keeps using the word ``banned,'' but 
that word doesn't mean what you think it means. In common 
usage, ``banned'' means ``made unavailable,'' yet the most-
banned ``Gender Queer'' is still available on Amazon. The same, 
unfortunately, can't be said for Ryan Anderson's ``When Harry 
Became Sally.'' Only books on one side of that issue, it seems, 
actually get banned.
    Rather, this conversation focuses on school library 
availability. If ``banned'' means ``made unavailable,'' then 
virtually every book ever published has been effectively banned 
in school libraries, but that's not even what this word means 
here. Indeed, a book can be both banned and totally available 
in a school library. That's because the media has accepted the 
expansive definition of ``banned'' offered by PEN America. If a 
book has been taken off the shelves, reviewed, and placed back 
on the shelves, it has, according to PEN, been banned. If a 
school places a parental permission requirement on a book, it 
has, according to PEN, been banned. If a school moves a book to 
a guidance counselor's office, it has, according to PEN, been 
banned. In their report, ``Banned in the U.S.A.,'' PEN draws 
parallels in all this to Nazi Germany.
    Now, my public school library didn't carry ``Mein Kampf.'' 
Was it banned? I don't know. But I do know that I've read a few 
books about this era since, and I've so far missed the part 
where the Nazi party forced schools to relocate books to 
guidance counselors' offices. To provide a linguistically 
honest account, the Heritage Foundation's Jay Greene and 
Madison Marino and I set out to assess how many of the 2,532 
books in PEN's 2022 report, that were labeled as ``banned,'' 
were actually removed from school libraries.
    We did this with one simple trick. We checked the card 
catalogues. As it turns out, nearly three-quarters of the books 
that PEN labeled as banned were still in school libraries. 
Careful analysis also belies the claims that books are being 
banned because of race or LGBT issues, or as PEN America labels 
the Black Lives Matter-inspired ``The Hate U Give'' as the 
fifth-most-banned book, we found it available in every single 
school library in question.
    And when The Washington Post examined over 1,000 review 
requests made by parents, less than 7 percent mentioned LGBT 
without also containing the word ``sexual,'' although those 
requests may have contained words like ``pornographic'' or 
``obscene.'' And that's what this issue is really about: the 
provision of sexually explicit material to children by public 
employees.
    This is a question of judgment. Few would say it's 
unreasonable to keep Hustler, with its close-up genital 
photographs, out of school libraries, and few would insist that 
``Romeo and Juliet,'' with its lyrical allusions to sex, should 
be removed. Communities must draw the line somewhere between 
those two points. But where, exactly? Take the previously 
mentioned book, ``Gender Queer.'' That graphic novel famously 
includes a picture of a strap-on dildo blow job.
    Is this okay for kids? Some think that it is, and some 
think that it isn't. You know something weird is going on, 
though, when parents try to read passages of these books at 
school board meetings, and the school board cuts them off 
because they insist the material is too obscene to be read out 
loud. I guess kids could be listening? Great for them to read, 
but unacceptable for them to hear? I think that's the 
principle, maybe.
    It's kind of gross to say, and I don't want to, but this 
hearing has been called, and we really can't have an honest 
discussion without knowing what we're actually talking about. 
We're talking about books with explicit passages about fisting, 
butt plugs, anilingus, the spit-or-swallow decision, and rape. 
I won't read those verbatim, but I will read a passage from a 
few of the most-banned books.
    From the fourth-most-banned, ``All Boys Aren't Blue'': 
``You were fully erect at this point. You promise that you not 
going to tell anyone? I promised. You then grabbed my hand and 
made me touch it. It was the first time I'd ever touched a 
penis that wasn't my own. I knew that what was happening wasn't 
supposed to happen. Cousins weren't supposed to do these things 
with cousins.''
    And from the also fourth-most-banned, ``Lawn Boy'': ``In 
the fourth grade, at a church youth group meeting, out in the 
bushes behind the parsonage, I touched Doug Goble's dick, and 
he touched mine. In fact, there were even some mouths 
involved.''
    Ten-year-olds performing sodomy, underage incest, strap-on 
dildo blow jobs. Is this okay for kids? Judging by the fuss 
made by the media, NGO's, and some Democratic politicians, it 
seems there is a politically significant contingent that 
believes this is all actually very good for kids.
    But personally, I'm not at all troubled by the fact that 
some moms believe that this is inappropriate and that some 
school boards agree. And I find it kind of weird that the 
United States Senate is troubled enough to call a hearing about 
all this. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Eden appears as a submission

    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Mr. Eden. Professor Knox.
    Professor Knox. Thank you, Chairman Durbin----
    Chair Durbin. You need to turn on the microphone. There you 
go.

  STATEMENT OF EMILY KNOX, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF 
                ILLINOIS, BLOOMINGTON, ILLINOIS

    Professor Knox. Thank you, Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member 
Graham, and Members of the Committee, for giving me the 
opportunity to testify at this hearing.
    I'm an associate professor in the School of Information 
Sciences, the iSchool at the University of Illinois, Urbana-
Champaign. I'm also board chair of the National Coalition 
Against Censorship. I previously served as president of the 
Freedom To Read Foundation, the legal arm of the American 
Library Association. My testimony does not reflect the views of 
the University of Illinois, NCAC, FTRF, or the ALA.
    My research focuses on information access, intellectual 
freedom and censorship, information ethics and policy, and 
print culture studies. I was born in Nashville, Tennessee, and 
grew up in Columbia, Maryland. I studied religion at both Smith 
College and the University of Chicago. And after working as a 
project assistant at the law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, I 
received my MSLIS from the iSchool at Illinois. After working 
as a theological librarian for 5 years, I attended the doctoral 
program at the School of Communication Information at Rutgers 
University.
    Books and libraries have always been a part of my life. My 
mother was a high school librarian at Magruder High School, in 
Montgomery County, Maryland, for 32 years. And I often spent my 
summers with her, shelving, conducting inventory, and checking 
in magazines. We always observed Banned Books Week. Ma would 
bring home the list of books that had been challenged, and my 
favorite author, Judy Blume, was almost always on the list. The 
characters in her books seemed like real people to me, like me 
and my friends. I could not understand why people would want me 
to not read books--to read books--would not want me to read 
books about my own life.
    My father was a professor at Morgan State University in 
Baltimore, and when I followed in his footsteps by getting a 
Ph.D., I knew exactly what I wanted to study: Why do people 
attempt to ban books? It is not surprising that the reasons are 
clear. Reading is powerful, and the freedom to read can be 
frightening.
    According to the ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom, 
over 2,500 unique titles were targeted for censorship in 2022. 
Almost all of the books can be categorized as diverse, or books 
by and about LGBTQIA, Native, people of color, gender 
diversity, people with disabilities, and ethnic, cultural, and 
religious minorities. At the same time, researchers have found 
that 71 percent of Americans oppose book bans in public 
libraries, and 67 percent oppose banning books in school 
libraries.
    Books are one of the most powerful technologies in the 
world. They bring ideas across both time and space in a small, 
portable package. During this current crisis, there's a lot of 
discussion about whether or not books are harmful or dangerous 
or hurtful. This actually depends on who is reading them.
    As Jesse Shera noted, we do not know what happens when an 
individual reads a book. Each person brings their own 
experiences to the book, and those experiences will determine 
their response. These interpretations are never static. Rudine 
Sims Bishop argued, books are mirrors, windows, and sliding 
glass doors--a book can ``help us understand each other better 
by helping to change our attitudes toward difference.''
    What we see right now is that people are fixated on the 
idea that books are only mirrors and sliding glass doors: they 
only reflect something true about the reader themselves, or the 
reader's world, or they invite the reader to mimic an identity, 
or action, they read about in a book. It's important to 
remember that books are also windows. They give us access to 
other people's lives. Kerry H. Robinson notes that adults often 
censor difficult knowledge or knowledge that many adults find 
challenging to address in their own lives, but especially with 
children. What could be more difficult than knowledge that can 
define your identity?
    But in order to describe your truth, you must have the 
words to do so. These campaigns to censor books are 
unconstitutional and against every person's right to 
intellectual freedom. That is, the right of every individual to 
hold, express opinions, and seek access, receive, and impart 
information and ideas without restriction. The First Amendment 
states that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of 
speech. Our right to speak, write, publish, and read are all 
protected by the Constitution. This right is not based on 
whether or not people agree with the ideas being expressed. We 
must remember that, as citizens of the United States, we are a 
free people, and it is our right to read freely.

    STATEMENT OF NICOLE NEILY, PRESIDENT, PARENTS DEFENDING 
                 EDUCATION, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

    Ms. Neily. Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Graham, and 
distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting 
me today.
    My name is Nicole Neily, and I'm the president of Parents 
Defending Education, a membership association that gives 
parents the knowledge and tools they need to be effective 
advocates for their children's education.
    Yes, books have become a flashpoint in schools over the 
past few years, yet headlines and research papers by activist 
organizations have intentionally muddied the waters between 
World War II book burning and what's happening in America's K-
12 schools. If you hear one thing today, know this: Families' 
concerns about books in schools are not book banning.
    First, the book issue is a curation issue. It should be 
obvious that a book that is part of a lesson plan in a second-
grade classroom is more concerning than a book that can be 
voluntarily checked out from a public library. And also, that 
sensitive topics read to children at very young ages is more 
concerning than high schoolers learning about the human body in 
health class.
    But today, merely suggesting that kids who believe in Santa 
not have unfettered access to graphic sexual novels is 
tantamount to murder. In Connecticut, one resident said that 
the school board's desire to put parental consent rules in 
place for a few books described as obscene and explicit was, 
quote, ``a matter of life and death.'' It's not. When we do 
hear from parents about books, the phrase that we hear the most 
frequently is, ``age appropriate.'' Radical, indeed.
    School boards across the country cut the mics on parents 
who read passages from these books, stating, this is 
inappropriate. There are children in the room. Yet those same 
books are being provided to children in schools. While it may 
seem politically convenient to scapegoat parents, I ask you to 
read some of these explicit paragraphs and look at these sexual 
images with your children, or your grandchildren, and then tell 
your constituents whether you consider such content 
educational.
    As a society, we don't put Playboy in kindergartens. This 
isn't considered a book ban but common sense. Strangely, media 
coverage over this issue frames any discussion at all as 
tyranny. It is disingenuous at best and deceptive at worst. 
Classrooms, schools, and libraries have finite space and must 
select which materials are on display at any given time. Nor do 
they have unlimited budgets so must prioritize certain 
purchases over others. How these decisions are made and who is 
involved in that process is a matter of public accountability. 
Yet, when people ask questions, they're crucified. Pretending 
that objections to minors accessing explicit sexual content is 
a threat to liberty and literature is a strawman and a 
distraction from real concerns about the quality of children's 
education and whether students are safe in school.
    Second, the book issue is a parental awareness issue. It is 
not partisan to assert that children do better when their 
families know what's going on in their lives. This isn't rocket 
science. The more information parents have, the better they can 
support their kids, emotionally and academically.
    America has a youth mental health crisis. Yet, while 
schools lobby for increased mental health funding, for which 
the Federal Government has provided hundreds of millions of 
dollars, they're exacerbating that problem. When kids are given 
assignments beyond their comprehension level, that even adults 
find challenging--violence, war crimes, rape, incest, and 
more--it should come as no surprise when children become 
depressed or hopeless. Books from schools should be discussed 
with loved ones, perhaps to provide historical context or 
another perspective.
    Parents know their young learners' quirks and preferences 
and whether certain material might resonate with, or would be 
appropriate for, their loved ones. These decisions may differ 
between children in the same family at the same age, based on 
factors like maturity and sensitivity.
    Children deserve an education that meets their specific 
needs. Yet, when families ask to simply know when their 
children have--what their children have access to, or may wish 
to put guardrails on material for children of certain ages, 
they're pilloried in the public square. Such public 
flagellation is intended to not only extract a pound of flesh 
from the perpetrator but to send a message to any other parent 
with similar reservations: Speak up, and the mob will come for 
you, too.
    Far too many schools keep families at arms' length, which 
could not come at a worse time. Kids would benefit if the 
adults in their lives worked together in their best interest. 
But families are now considered adversaries, not even entitled 
to basic information about their children. In Wisconsin, one 
school district's teacher training session stated, ``Parents 
are not entitled to know their kids' identities. That knowledge 
must be earned.''
    My organization has documented over 1,000 districts across 
the country with parental exclusion policies, which state that 
families don't have a right to know their child's gender 
identity in a taxpayer-funded school.
    And finally, it is not evil to want to be involved in your 
child's education. Every time a parent is falsely accused of 
wanting to ban a book because of reasonable concerns about 
subject-matter appropriateness, neighbors are pitted against 
each other based on dishonest premises. This is a deliberate 
attempt to demonize parents, and to chill both their speech and 
activism.
    Twenty years ago, if a 6-year-old went to school and talked 
about sex, teachers would assume that that child was being 
abused. In 2023, children are not only learning about sex at 
school but are being told to keep secrets from their families, 
as well. Please stop mocking parents. Please stop name-calling. 
Please listen to the families who want their children to learn 
basic grammar rather than be policed on pronouns, who want 
their children to read at grade level and not taken out of 
class for political rallies, who want their young children's 
innocence to be preserved for a few years longer than an 
activist academic might insist. We are your constituents, too. 
Thank you.

STATEMENT OF CAMERON SAMUELS, STUDENT, BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY, CO-
   FOUNDER, STUDENTS ENGAGED IN ADVANCING TEXAS, KATY, TEXAS

    Mx. Samuels. Members, thank you for this opportunity to 
address you this morning.
    I am Cameron Samuels, a student from Katy, Texas, and I use 
gender-neutral pronouns, ``they/them.'' I'm the executive 
director of Students Engaged in Advancing Texas. In 2022, I 
graduated in a district of more than 90,000 students.
    In recent years, we have faced a so-called culture war over 
books. My experience began when a few people sought to ban 
Jerry Craft's ``New Kid,'' a children's book like any other, 
but some weaponized identity to censor Black books.
    The conversation on books quickly escalated, and I signed 
up to speak at the next meeting. Walking into the board room 
that night, I realized I was the only student there. I was the 
only one whose future was directly affected by the district's 
decisions. Adults spoke for restricting student access to 
literature. When my turn came, I spoke for a complete education 
and the freedom to learn. They applauded the adults but gave me 
silence, leaving me isolated in a room of people making policy 
about students without us at the table.
    In the following months, I stood up for my freedoms, but my 
school district removed age-relevant books at record pace. 
Nearly all were targeted for identity, such as LGBTQ themes, 
racial diversity, and religion. These books represent students. 
We found ourselves more in challenged books than in school 
libraries. So, I gathered student groups to distribute hundreds 
of challenged books, district wide. We packed board meetings 
with a community who knew that students deserve better. 
Libraries offer discovery beyond classrooms. Censorship limits 
our liberty to learn and erases our identity and humanity.
    When Katy targeted Art Spiegelman's ``Maus,'' I could not 
fathom that cartoon mice, walking shamefully naked to Nazi gas 
chambers, were considered sexual by the book's challengers. My 
ancestors fled religious persecution in Eurasia. I've faced too 
many antisemitic remarks in school to remember. Classmates told 
me the Holocaust did not exist. Many cannot name a Jewish 
person, so they learn about Judaism from media representation, 
often dominated by stereotypes. Books like ``Maus'' teach 
accurate reflections of Jewish identity. If a friend knew the 
real extent of the Holocaust, maybe they would've thought twice 
before spraying cologne in my face, saying he was gassing the 
Jew.
    Where they burn books, they burn people. Mike Curato's 
``Flamer'' illustrates a queer Boy Scout bullied and 
traumatized. I saw myself in the book, having faced similar 
harassment in school. ``Flamer'' gave me words for my trauma, 
but it was banned. Censorship bars students from age-relevant 
materials, leaving them unable to realize their actions can 
traumatize others.
    Responding to a police report against the book, officers 
entered a high school in my district to remove it. In history, 
the Gestapo secret police in Nazi Germany acted similarly. My 
community faced tactics my ancestors fled from across the world 
to escape.
    Not only schools censor books, but our State. Students and 
I introduced amendments with senators to book-ban bills for 
accountability and nondiscrimination. They were rejected, and 
already the bill faces a court injunction.
    Historically, censorship is never on the right side of 
history. My State is home to 8 million people under the age of 
20, and since everything is bigger in Texas, we lead the Nation 
for book bans. Censorship impacts our futures. Students deserve 
to be decision-makers. Censorship is undemocratic. Viewpoint 
discrimination is contrary to the First Amendment. The Supreme 
Court rules to protect literature from scrutiny against 
identity.
    We may not see eye to eye, but we are facing a students' 
rights crisis, nationwide. As a 17-year-old, I should not have 
been focused on defending my rights from bigotry. I should have 
been learning. Ensuring education reflects its primary 
stakeholders, the students, we can proceed with a solution to 
censorship that facilitates collaboration between students, 
families, and educators. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mx. Samuels appears as a 
submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Mx. Samuels. We have a round of 
questions from the Senators. Each have 5 minutes.
    I'd like to direct my question to Secretary Giannoulias. 
The American Library Association has written the following: 
``1,269 demands to censor library books and resources in 2022, 
the highest number of attempted book bans since ALA began 
compiling data about censorship in libraries more than 20 years 
ago. The unparalleled number of reported book challenges in 
2022 nearly doubles the 729 challenges reported in 2021.''
    My first part of my question is going to ask you to address 
that statement by the American Library Association, in light of 
testimony before us that this is much ado about nothing.
    And the second one is the notion that extremist attacks on 
student and book bans are not that prevalent. Book banning has 
reached new heights over the past 2 years. Local leaders in 
States such as Texas, Florida, Utah, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, 
and others, have all recently enacted legislation facilitating 
banning books in local school districts and libraries. These 
new laws provide for civil penalties and/or jail time for 
violations, and pose great risks to teachers and librarians, 
and that's why groups like the American Library Association 
have spoken out. Can you reflect on those two statements?
    Secretary Giannoulias. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The two are 
related. As State librarian, I travel the State of Illinois, 
and we talk to librarians, we talk to libraries--school 
libraries, public libraries. The level of threats--
intimidation, physical threats--in talking to librarians, these 
are not my viewpoints--they have never seen it in their entire 
careers.
    Because of these political attempts to ban books, we're 
seeing libraries close down at record numbers. It's difficult 
to find new librarians who want to serve in roles that used to 
be their dream jobs. And just a few weeks ago, in the suburbs 
of Chicago, numerous libraries received bomb threats and were 
forced to close their doors.
    So, I can tell you, in Illinois, it's a very real--and 
across the country, the problem is worse. And again, what our 
bill aims to do, and will do, is to fight for and protect these 
librarians. We have to fight for our librarians.
    We also have to trust that they have the professional 
judgment, experience to make decisions on what books belong in 
circulation. It should not be up to fringe elements screaming 
from the rooftops about books that they've never read. These 
are librarians and individuals that have advanced degrees in 
library science, masters of library science, masters of 
information and library science. And it's important to make 
sure that we allow them to determine what's in circulation, and 
it's important for us to trust parents to determine what books 
their kids should read. And again, it is not up to parents to 
tell other parents what books kids should read.
    Another point I'd like to make, when it comes to our 
legislation: We are not advocating for any single book to be at 
a library, or not be at a library. What we're saying is, let's 
trust our librarians to make these decisions, not an individual 
parent that's angry or disagrees with a certain viewpoint. Judy 
Bloom said recently, ``I believe that censorship grows out of 
fear, and because fear is contagious, some parents are easily 
swayed. Book banning satisfies their need to feel in control of 
their children's lives. This fear is often disguised as, quote, 
`moral outrage.' They want to believe that if their children 
don't read about it, then their children won't know about it. 
And if they don't know about it, it won't happen.''
    As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I have three young 
daughters. Of course, there are books that are not age 
appropriate, but that's what being a parent is all about: Doing 
your best to keep an eye on what your children read, and what 
they consume. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. I would just add, as well, to put this in the 
context of the world we live in, where so much information is 
so available to people carrying simply iPhones, or any laptop 
computer that they have access to, that we ought to be honest 
and realistic about that. I agree with you. The first 
responsibility is the parents' responsibility, and we believe 
there are age-appropriate restrictions that can be introduced 
in libraries, and other places, which generally are consistent 
with freedom of expression. I thank you. Senator Graham.
    Senator Graham. Thank you. Let's just build on what has 
been said. How do you say your name, sir? Alex----
    Secretary Giannoulias. Alexi Giannoulias.
    Senator Graham. Okay.
    Secretary Giannoulias. Alexi is fine.
    Senator Graham. I want to see if I got the point here. A 
public library is supported by public dollars. Does that make 
sense?
    Secretary Giannoulias. Yes.
    Senator Graham. Okay. Are you telling taxpayers of this 
country to shut up? Is--all you worry about is your kids, don't 
have a voice about how your taxpayer dollars are being spent, 
and what kind of community you're living in here? Because 
you're a parent and you don't let your three daughters read 
something, is it possible that the other things--that the books 
in question may hurt the community, in the eyes of parents? Can 
a parent, a taxpayer, complain, under this theory, or should 
they just shut up?
    Secretary Giannoulias. I would make the exact argument you 
are. This is about parents----
    Senator Graham. No. We're----
    Secretary Giannoulias [continuing]. Making decisions----
    Senator Graham [continuing]. Not making the same argument. 
My argument is, you just said, if you've got kids, you police 
your kids. Otherwise, just shut up and trust the library 
system, the school system. Let them decide for your community. 
I completely, totally reject that. I don't have any kids. 
Should I shut up? I pay taxes. When you have a public library, 
and you have a board, somebody decides what books go in, and 
what not to go in. Lend your voice to the cause. It's okay to 
speak out for your community.
    Cameron, you have an advocacy group in Texas. Right?
    Mx. Samuels. That is correct.
    Senator Graham. And you have every right to do that. You 
can advocate for your point of view, and somebody in Texas has 
to decide who wins. But never shut up. Never be quiet. My point 
is, the theory of this case is, parents have a very limited 
role in life. Apparently taxpayers have a very limited role in 
this area. You're paying money to run these libraries. I mean, 
you're getting money from taxpayers. They should speak up.
    Ms. Knox, you said--is it unconstitutional for a parent to 
go to a school board, or a public library, and complain?
    Professor Knox. Thank you for giving me the chance to 
respond. Actually, almost all libraries have in their policies 
something called a ``request for reconsideration,'' that allows 
parents, or interested community members, to object, or say 
what they would like to have changed, in a library collection.
    I think what's important to remember is that this is a 
collective decision. It's not just one person who gets to say 
what is in a library collection.
    Senator Graham. I'm not arguing with you. Somebody has to 
decide. But the point is the individual here, the individual 
taxpayer, the individual parent--there's an effort in this 
country to shut you up. Ms. Neily, are you going to shut up?
    Ms. Neily. We will absolutely not shut up. I am here on 
behalf of more than 10,000 members of Parents Defending 
Education, who want to have a voice in their children's 
education. Yet they, every time they speak up, are mocked, are 
shamed, are intimidated, and silenced, and bullied, by elected 
officials and community members, who do not want them to speak 
up, who are told that they are book burners, who are shamed of 
that. And you know what? We will not stop, because after COVID, 
we saw--we had a window into what our children were learning or 
were not learning, and we were disappointed by that. So, 
parents have not stopped, and they will not stop, advocating 
for their children, because the gatekeepers--be it the 
teachers' unions, or anyone else--have shown that they do not 
have our children's best interest at heart. They have their 
money and their power structure at heart, at the end of the 
day.
    Senator Graham. Mr. Eden, is it your testimony there's an 
organized effort in this country to push ideas, books, 
literature, through the public school system and libraries, 
that has a very strong political agenda behind it? Is that what 
you're telling us?
    Mr. Eden. I think it's pretty clear that that is what is 
going on. Yes, sir.
    Senator Graham. And if you don't see that, you're blind. 
You know, in Florida, Ron DeSantis did something you may not 
like, Mr. Chairman. In Illinois, you do it a different way. But 
Governor DeSantis decided he would step in and stop what he 
thought was abusive, from his point of view.
    My point about this hearing is, there's no role up here for 
any of us. Illinois, you do it the way you want. Florida, you 
do it the way you want. Each school library, you'll decide, but 
the day that a parent, a concerned citizen, can't come forward 
and say, I object, without being humiliated, is a bad day for 
America.
    And there's nothing in the Constitution preventing 
everybody in this country from having a say, to express 
yourself, to try to mold the community in a way that you think 
is better. And some of the things being pushed through this 
agenda are just, quite frankly, offensive.
    Chair Durbin. I think you made the point earlier, and I 
want to repeat it. We all, I hope, agree, regardless of our 
political philosophy, that there are lines that cannot be 
crossed. Violence is one of those lines. Humiliation is one of 
those lines, as far as I'm concerned. I think what we're 
talking about is policy here in this country when it comes to 
the basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Senator 
Whitehouse.
    Senator Whitehouse. Thanks very much. My question is going 
to be for Secretary Giannoulias. There is one view of the facts 
here, which is that the conflicts that we have seen in school 
libraries and in school board meetings, involving the school 
librarian and the local people who serve on the school board, 
grow out of natural concerns by school parents.
    There is also significant reporting suggesting that 
national groups, funded by right-wing organizations, fueled by 
dark money, using people who have no child in the school, and 
may not even be from the State, come into town and mount a 
surprise attack on local people, like a school librarian, 
people who work in the school, people who serve on the school 
committee, who are just local people trying to serve the 
school, and who don't have any preparation for dealing with 
that kind of sudden disruption and political attack, 
particularly one that is well scripted, well financed, and 
basically comes in like an out-of-State artillery barrage on 
the unsuspecting school. In your investigation into all of 
this, which of those two factual descriptions is closer to the 
truth?
    Secretary Giannoulias. Thank you, Senator. We have seen, 
heard, and read about instances where right-wing groups, 
extremist groups, are trying to shut down, or censor, a certain 
book, access to certain books, which is why, again, our 
legislation is so very important: to protect librarians and 
their ability to determine what books belong in circulation.
    I'm saddened that Senator Graham left. He didn't give me a 
chance to respond. And this whole notion that protecting the 
right to read and fighting against censorship is somehow anti-
parent is one of the most ludicrous arguments I've ever heard. 
What we're saying is, don't let one parent, who disagrees with 
a certain world view, determine what book--whether or not a 
book should be in the library.
    That goes against the very point of our democracy; what it 
means to educate our youth, which is to allow them to think for 
themselves; and, quite frankly, it's an anti-Republican 
argument. Republicans are the ones that--allegedly--are the 
ones who fight against censorship, and the ones who fight for 
our Constitution and the freedom of speech. Yet, here they are, 
picking a page out of a random book that they don't agree with, 
and making it sound like parents have no say. That's the exact 
opposite argument that we're trying to make.
    Senator Whitehouse. And that----
    Secretary Giannoulias. The goal----
    Senator Whitehouse [continuing]. Would be particularly true 
if the people involved weren't parents, weren't from the 
community, or even from the State, but were being shipped in 
just in order to stir up trouble, make news, and create 
division and controversy.
    Secretary Giannoulias. That's 100 percent correct.
    Senator Whitehouse. Let me ask consent that an article by a 
very good reporter named Amanda Milkovits, who covers Rhode 
Island for The Boston Globe, be made a matter of record. It's 
entitled ``Libraries Face Increased Attempts to Ban Books,'' 
and it's quite a comprehensive piece of coverage about the way 
in which this movement has appeared in Rhode Island to make its 
points, I guess, I'd say, would be the nicest way to say it. 
Thank you very much.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Chair Durbin. Senator Grassley.
    Senator Grassley. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to submit 
questions for answers and use my time just to make a few points 
on this subject.
    First and foremost, the notion that this is a, quote, 
``book ban'' is misleading, and not truthful. This has nothing 
to do with restricting books to the general public. These books 
can still be purchased through various retailers, if parents 
want their children to have access to these materials. The 
issue is protecting parental rights and their ability to raise 
their children.
    As a father of five, I can confidently say, no one knows 
what's best for a child more than their own parents. As such, I 
believe the first principle in education is that parents have a 
fundamental right and responsibility to guide their children's 
upbringing. This means parents ought to have the greatest say 
in determining what is best for their children.
    The Constitution gives this function to the States. 
Decisions on education need to be made at the State and local 
levels. These levels of education are closest, and most 
accessible, to the parents and children directly affected. 
States and school districts are best equipped to craft 
education policies according to the unique needs of the 
students. Further, moms and dads can more easily advocate for 
their children's needs in the classroom, or even voice concerns 
to teachers, school officials, and that's closest to home. And, 
if needed, they can reach out to their local and State elected 
officials to pursue broader educational policy changes much 
more easily than coming to Washington.
    In fact, this is something I regularly tell parents. 
Parents are their children's best advocate. Our children, and 
their future, thrive when State and local communities have this 
freedom to respond to the unique needs of families they serve.
    However, when this principle is violated, the results 
aren't to the benefit of children. For example, we saw this 
after the passage of No Child Left Behind. This law was enacted 
with the best of intentions, but showed just how challenging it 
is for one approach to successfully help millions of students 
attending schools in thousands of classrooms across the 
country.
    I've always been a critic of one-size-fits-all government. 
Those concerns ring especially true in education. Every child 
is unique. When we implement Washington-knows-best policy, like 
No Child Left Behind, the children suffered the most, and the 
teachers couldn't teach according to the way they want to.
    That is why Congress passed the Every Student Succeeds Act, 
to restore local decision-making, and better serve individual 
parents, schools, and educators. A Federal policy regarding 
classroom content set by Federal legislators, or some distant 
faceless bureaucrats in Washington, would take decision-making 
away from the parents, who know best how to raise their kids.
    Throughout my 99 county tours of Iowa this year, moms and 
dads shared their experience and concerns about some books and 
materials that have been presented in Iowa schools. They have 
expressed reasonable concern about young, impressionable minds 
to explicit and graphic materials and content, in some 
classrooms and school libraries.
    So, common sense knows best. Unsurprisingly, we've seen 
every State and school district--or, we've seen various State 
and school districts respond to parents' consent by enacting 
policies aimed at protecting children.
    Parents, in conjunction with State and local officials, 
must determine what is age appropriate for kids to ensure they 
are nurtured as they grow up. I'll continue to support efforts 
preserving the right of parents to determine their kids' 
education, and give State and local districts the flexibility 
to shape policies that fit communities they serve. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thanks, Senator Grassley. Senator Hirono.
    Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Nobody's talking 
about interfering with the right of a parent to determine what 
kind of material his or her child should have access to. The 
issue really is the ability of a group of people, not even 
parents of students in schools, but a group of people, or 
individuals, who are able to go into a school district, a 
school board, in an effort to ban certain books. That is really 
the issue, and by any definition, I would consider that kind of 
effort to be an effort on book banning.
    And, in fact, there are States that have already enacted 
legislation that makes it pretty easy for anybody to go in and 
list a book as inappropriate, and therefore removed, until it 
goes through some sort of a review process. I'm specifically 
talking about Florida, as an example.
    So, Professor Knox, you've done some research on why there 
is this effort to ban books. Can you tell me what sorts of 
books are usually--usually get on these banned book lists?
    Professor Knox. Yes, I would say that--thank you for the 
question. So, the books that usually show up on banned books 
lists are books that we consider to be diverse, and these are 
basically books about anybody who is not white, heterosexual, 
male, cis--books that are about LGBTQIA people, about people of 
color. These sorts of books are the books that we see on the 
banned books list.
    And I do want to approach--address the idea of banning 
books. So, really, what we often say is that these books are 
not banned, but they are challenged. So, like ``Biden's border 
crisis,'' ``Banned Books Week'' has a nice alliterative ring to 
it, but in fact, we talk much more about challenging books.
    And what this is, is removing books from access to its 
intended audience. So, that includes both age appropriateness--
but also, who did the author intend this book to be read by? 
That is an important part of thinking about what we call 
collection development in libraries. We consider all sorts of 
issues when books are put in a collection, not just issues of, 
you know, do we agree with what is being put on the collection, 
but also, how do we show many different viewpoints and ideas? 
When we look at the diverse books that----
    Senator Hirono. Okay. I'm sorry to----
    Professor Knox. Sure.
    Senator Hirono [continuing]. Interrupt you, but I do 
understand that the target of a lot of these kinds of lists is 
books that depict diverse-diverse lifestyles, for example, if 
you want to call it that. And so, for example, one of the books 
that is being sought, or challenged, in Iowa is a book called 
``Ho`onani: Hula Warrior.''
    [Poster is displayed.]
    Senator Hirono. This is a book about a child who doesn't 
see herself as a girl or a boy but something in between, and 
this child dreams of leading the hula group, but everyone else 
thinks that only the boys should lead the hula group.
    And Native Hawaiians have traditionally recognized the 
existence of a third gender, called mahu, and this book 
explores this, and many other parts, of Native Hawaiian 
culture. Yet, this book could potentially be banned, as I 
mentioned, from a school district in Iowa for running afoul of 
a law against books for younger grades that deal with gender 
identity. Mr. Giannoulias, do you think--and also, Dr. Knox, do 
you think this book should be removed from school libraries?
    Secretary Giannoulias. Thank you, Senator. I personally do 
not, which goes, again, to the fundamental nature of our 
legislation, which is to allow librarians to make that 
decision. My guess is they would determine this book belongs in 
our libraries. But the point I also want to make is, especially 
with regard to ``Hula Warrior,'' the goal of literature
    Senator Hirono. Mm-hmm.
    Secretary Giannoulias [continuing]. Is to reflect back to 
the reader either the struggles that the reader is facing or to 
provide insight into struggles that the reader has never had to 
imagine. Books are a safe place for people who are struggling, 
who need help. And I would----
    Senator Hirono. Thank you.
    Secretary Giannoulias [continuing]. Disagree with one of 
the opponents here today who----
    Senator Hirono. I do need to get to--sorry. And I don't 
even need the answer from Dr. Knox, but I do have another 
question for you. Is there any evidence that says that exposure 
to certain kinds of books leads to harm to a community? Does 
exposure to an LGBTQ+ book somehow cause harm to the reader? Is 
there any evidence to that effect?
    Secretary Giannoulias. Zero.
    Professor Knox. No, there is not. What I mentioned before 
is that books can be windows to learn about other people. So, 
it might be that you have a friend who is thinking about their 
own gender identity, and you want to know more. And reading a 
book like that one will help you understand what your friend is 
going through.
    Senator Hirono. Mr. Chairman, I should think that there is 
more harm to a young person who thinks that he or she can be 
shot to death in a school than being exposed to certain kinds 
of subjects in books. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Hirono. Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. I'm going to be showing a video clip in just a 
second, but at the outset of this, I want to make clear, I 
think nearly every American could agree that parents have some 
legitimate interest in what their child reads, or is taught, or 
otherwise exposed to, about sex. I think it's very, very 
difficult for anyone to disagree with that. That being the 
case, I think we need to proceed with this conversation with 
that backdrop and that understanding.
    I'm going to play a video clip right now. The video clip is 
from Deborah Caldwell-Stone. She's the legal counsel for the 
American Library Association. Here's what she has to say on 
some of these topics, these topics that deal not with book 
banning--because no one here has banned any book. You can still 
get these books anywhere you want them. The question isn't 
whether to ban them. The question is whether they should be 
included in curriculum, or in a school library. A library or a 
school curriculum, by definition, will be finite. There are a 
finite number of books that you can put in there. The question 
is which books should be included and which should not. Let's 
hear what Ms. Deborah Caldwell-Stone has to say on this topic.
    [Video is shown.]
    Senator Lee. Okay. So, I think what we saw here right now 
is someone saying the quiet part out loud, acknowledging what 
the goal is. There is a goal here, and the goal is to sexualize 
children, to provide minors with sexually explicit material, 
and then hide this content from the parents, hide it by 
changing the messaging, avoiding the heat by saying, no, no, 
these are not the droids you're looking for. This is not about 
sexually explicit content. This is about equality. This is 
about justice. This is about what's right and wrong. Has 
nothing to do with sex. Well, of course that's what someone 
would do if they were grooming your child, if someone were 
trying to sexualize your child.
    And make no mistake. That is what's happened. You see, 
there has been something that has happened in the last few 
years. During COVID, a lot of kids had online school, and 
parents were able to observe in the classroom in ways that they 
haven't been in the past--observe what was being taught, how it 
was being taught.
    And it's awakened something significant among parents 
throughout America, and that's why you've got groups that're 
standing up, groups of parents in places across the country, 
including Utah, like Utah Parents United, the American 
Accountability Foundation, and Ms. Neily's group, Parents 
Defending Education. They're providing parents with the tools 
they need, and the information that they desire, about how best 
to protect their kids from inappropriate things that they may 
be being taught, or may be being given at the school, where 
they spend most of the best hours of most days of the week 
throughout the school year, every year.
    Now, one of the explicit excerpts read by Mr. Eden just a 
few minutes ago, and presented to this Committee, is from ``All 
Boys Aren't Blue,'' a book available without restriction in at 
least 1 Utah junior high school attended by children ages 13 to 
15, and at least 5 Utah high schools. In 3 Utah high schools, 
the book was available to children over 16. Now, remember, from 
what was shared with us from Mr. Eden, this book has some 
really graphic sexually explicit stuff. This is pornographic. 
This is obscene. It's certainly not appropriate for children, 
and it is--no matter what else you think about it--it is 
something that is sexual in nature.
    And I really do think very few, if any, Americans could 
reasonably disagree with the statement that parents have an 
interest in what their children are taught when it comes to 
sex. And so the moment parents take reasonable steps to protect 
their children, and lawmakers honor those efforts to protect 
their children from exposure, then all of a sudden we've got a 
problem. The left, and Vice President Harris, cry, ``book 
ban,'' even though all of these books are still available. You 
can still buy them, all of them, on Amazon. You can still buy 
them, all of them, all over the place. You can't, by the way, 
buy Ryan T. Anderson's book, ``When Harry Became Sally,'' on 
Amazon. That's been taken down from Amazon.
    But the point is this: This is not a ban. This is about 
schools deciding what's appropriate for schoolchildren. And 
sexually explicit, obscene, pornographic material isn't 
appropriate, and many parents are legitimately concerned about 
that. So, I'm concerned about this in a variety of respects, 
and I'd just like to ask the question, Mr. Eden, is placing 
common-sense age restrictions on pornographic content or 
removing sexually explicit books from school curriculum and 
school libraries--is that book banning? And does that carry any 
ramifications for what we would talk about in terms of the 
First Amendment, in terms of book banning in the First 
Amendment sense?
    Mr. Eden. No, sir. No.
    Senator Lee. It does not. And why is that? Why is that not 
book banning? Why does that not offend the First Amendment in 
any way, shape, or form?
    Mr. Eden. It's a question of community curation, and no 
student is actually blocked from acquiring the book in a 
broader sense.
    Senator Lee. So, if you're providing content to a child, if 
spoken to a child by you, by the school--if that would 
constitute, in some jurisdictions, in some circumstances, a 
crime, or a tort, you've got a problem.
    These school districts are acting in response to legitimate 
parental concerns. They should be removing these. Shame on them 
if they don't, and shame on those who want to groom children 
sexually. Thank you.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Booker.
    Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd love to pick 
up exactly where my friend, Mike Lee, left off, by reaffirming, 
I think, the agreement--the bipartisan agreement is that there 
is no one in this Committee that believes that children should 
have access to materials that are inappropriate for their age. 
There is no one that believes that children should have access 
to inappropriate, pornographic materials. This, to me, is about 
something deeper that's going on in the American culture right 
now that is really troubling. And that's why I want to pick up 
where he talked about what's going on in our schools. I 
actually agree with Ranking Member Graham that I don't see much 
Congress can do. We will make no laws addressing this. But I do 
think it's important that we hold a Committee like this to talk 
to these larger issues.
    We have a country right now that is based in the ideals of 
a commitment to one another. We weren't founded on sameness: 
same religion, same ethnicity. We were founded on big 
principles of democratic ideals. And in a diverse democracy, it 
is so necessary that we know each other, that we see each 
other, that we understand each other. That's what makes us 
stronger. And in many ways, our schools become areas--
especially the ideals of public schools--where diverse people 
come together for an education.
    I am suspect of these books being taken out of libraries 
and schools, because I started seeing books that had been there 
not just for years but for decades, literally generations--25-, 
30-, 40-year-old books on shelves suddenly being taken off--
stunned that there were books that were important to me, when I 
was growing up.
    My parents, in 1969, had to fight a court case--had to go, 
to do legal fights to get into the town I grew up in. We were 
the first Black family ever to move in. They had to get a white 
couple to pose as them, to buy the home, to move into the 
community. I grew up, as my father used to call us, four 
raisins in the tub of sweet vanilla ice cream. And for me, 
finding certain books on my library shelf that not only gave me 
affirmation but a celebration, that expanded my understanding 
of history, they were anchors to me, lifelines in some ways.
    And, at a time that I was forming my self-concept and my 
sense of self-worth, these were the books that became the 
foundation of who I am, some of the greatest works of American 
literature. And so when I see books by some of the greatest 
authors--I see ``Frederick Douglass'' there--being taken off 
the shelf, that's when I begin to worry that we're falling into 
this trap where we are failing to do what is necessary in a 
democracy, which is to create public forums, educational 
pathways that engender empathy and understanding, that engender 
deep knowledge, that engender the kind of sentiment that is 
necessary for democratic democracies to exist. Not a culture of 
contempt for one another, but a deeper culture of 
understanding.
    Now, I had conversations with my parents as I got older and 
more sophisticated, like, wow, you brought up two Black boys in 
a predominantly white community. What were you thinking then? 
And we talked about a lot of the books that we read at home, 
and read at school, and she would laugh at me right now and 
say, of course, I could've bought you those books if they were 
removed from the library, but what was important to have them 
in the library wasn't for you. It was for your peers, for them 
to have access.
    I remember the power of reading ``Invisible Man'' in my 
high school English class, and the impact it had on my peers. I 
had the most nurturing, positive community to grow up in, but 
to hear what they experienced, expanding their understanding.
    I remember when I was a college student, counseling on a 
suicide crisis hotline to LGBTQ youth, coming out, who were 
considering suicide, and the power of just knowing they weren't 
alone, that there are other people sharing that experience. And 
so a lot is talked about today, but there are deeper issues of 
what kind of culture are we going to promote in our country? 
One of compassion, of empathy, of understanding, or one that is 
going to continue this false narrative of us versus them?
    Professor Knox, in the remaining seconds that I have, I--I 
actually think there's a problem when we are attacking our own 
history and trying to Disneyify it, as opposed to celebrating 
what was a rough, difficult, uncomfortable, messy American 
history. That what makes us even greater is the fact that we 
had a history that we had to overcome--but that there is some 
negativity when young people are learning a history that is 
bereft of the complications and the difficulties of race 
issues, of gender issues, of LGBTQ issues. Is there a danger in 
giving people a sanitized version of American history?
    Professor Knox. Absolutely, there is. It is important that 
we know the truth of our history. There was a time when I would 
not have been able to sit here in this hearing to speak to this 
Committee. We've grown from that, but it is important that 
people know that we have a history of trauma in our country 
that we have overcome, for some people, but we gain nothing by 
not telling our children the truth of genocide, and slavery, 
and Jim Crow. We gain nothing if we don't tell people the truth 
about that history.
    And this is one concern I have about many of the books that 
are being challenged right now, is that people want to sanitize 
this history and say, well, it was all in the past or, even if 
it was all in the past, it's too painful to discuss.
    It may be painful, but it is still the truth, and it must 
be said. It is important, to be citizens of this great country, 
that we know where we came from, so we can make the world 
better as we go forward.
    Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator. I might say that there's 
a vote on, and I may have to leave and recess for a few 
minutes, but the Senator from Tennessee is recognized.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, 
to each of you, for being here today. And as I've listened to 
your testimony and your answers to questions, Mr. Chairman, one 
of the things that has been of concern to me today is that 
there is apparent--your concern, or outrage, over some of the 
books and things that are being banned, or omitted, or 
disallowed, but there has been nothing said about what Big Tech 
platforms, or major publishers, are doing by banning, or 
refusing to work with, conservative authors. And that is a 
troubling trend that I have seen.
    I have heard from Tennesseans about some companies that are 
more left leaning, or are liberal media companies, and they are 
choosing to disallow publications. You've had something with 
Vice President Pence. You've had something with Justice 
Barrett. But that is not brought into this hearing. And there 
are--there are two discussions that ought to be taking place, 
because we do have very talented people that are being blocked 
out of that publishing, and that distribution network. So, that 
is of concern to me.
    Ms. Neily, in your testimony, you did talk a little bit 
about some of the egregious attempts that the left has made to 
silence anyone that doesn't agree with them, to remove 
publishing deals, to disallow distribution on platforms. So, I 
want to give you the opportunity to talk a little bit more 
about that, and the effect that that has.
    Ms. Neily. Sure. Parents are being intimidated, challenged, 
and canceled----
    Senator Blackburn. Your microphone.
    Ms. Neily. Parents are being intimidated, challenged, and 
canceled for speaking up. And I think, aside from the Big Tech 
platforms, what also concerns me is the State action that is 
being taken. You know, as much as we talk about the districts 
that might be discussing when a book can, or can't be, in a 
school district, I think it's also worth discussing the local 
control, the issue that Mr. Giannoulias mentioned, about 
districts that are actually removing control from families.
    In Montgomery County, Maryland, in Dearborn, Michigan, 
there have been countless Muslim families that have spoken up 
because they want the right to opt their children out of 
sexually explicit lesson plans. They are being denied that 
opportunity. They are being forced to have their children read 
books, again, that are graphic, that are sexual. And these are 
books that not only maybe aren't relevant to the curriculum but 
that don't comport with their family values. Those decisions 
are being taken away by localities. In some States, there are 
efforts by State actors, by the States themselves, as well. 
This is something that parents are concerned with. And so to 
conflate that issue, that I don't want my child to be forced to 
read something, with a book that is being burned in Nazi 
Germany, is disingenuous and false.
    Senator Blackburn. Well, parental rights are something we 
hear a lot about in Tennessee, and I think we are just very 
fortunate to have some really wonderful, dedicated teachers who 
have worked with parents, and have allowed parents to be 
involved in a child's education. I think it's important that 
parents have the ability to participate, and to have that say. 
So, tell me what you're hearing from parents, when it comes to 
directing the children's education, and what they are hearing. 
You've spoken about a couple of things. What are they hearing, 
when it comes to blocking some of this sexually explicit or 
pornographic material?
    Ms. Neily. One problem they have is simply gaining access, 
to know what their child is learning at all. Parents are being 
forced, on a regular basis, to file public records requests, 
and when they file those records requests, they are being 
charged hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars. Recently, from 
Fairfax County, Virginia, I received a FOIA estimate of $35,000 
to gain access to materials. That is appalling. That is meant 
to discourage and chill parental involvement and engagement in 
these issues. It is meant to tell families, go away, you're not 
welcome here, the experts know what they're doing.
    We saw the Democrat party of Michigan put a Facebook post 
out saying the purpose of public education is to teach children 
what society needs them to know. Implicit in that is that they 
know better than we do, than families do, what society needs 
them to know. That is an insult. It is a slap in the face to 
families. And that is something that families will continue to 
fight against.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the 
witnesses for being here. I think it's safe to say that all of 
you are here today because you are opposed to government 
censorship. Is that right? Have I got that broadly correct? 
Okay, we can agree on that much. Book banning is a form of 
government censorship. Is that, broadly speaking, correct?
    Professor Knox, you're an expert on this. Let me just ask 
you. Book banning is a problem under the First Amendment 
because it's the Government telling private individuals--
authors, what have you--what they can and cannot write, telling 
the public what they can and cannot read. Is that, broadly 
speaking, correct?
    Professor Knox. Yes, that's correct.
    Senator Hawley. So, now, what if--what if the books were 
digital only? Could the Government ban them then? So, no, no 
hard copies, no, no physical copies. It's just digital books. 
Could the Government engage in book banning, then, under the 
First Amendment, no problem?
    Professor Knox. No, that's about a format of the particular 
book, and that really doesn't matter when it comes to whether 
or not government is banning a book.
    Senator Hawley. Okay. What--what if--what if the Government 
made a list of authors whose books it wanted banned, and also 
went to all of the publishing houses in America--the Government 
did--and said, do not publish the books by any of these 
authors, or we will punish you? Is that a problem under the 
First Amendment?
    Professor Knox. My hope is that the Government would not be 
involved in the decisions of a private company.
    Senator Hawley. Good. I would hope so, too. But apparently 
that is not the case in the United States of America today, 
under this administration, because the hypotheticals I've just 
given you aren't hypotheticals at all. They've happened. And we 
know that they are happening. The Fifth Circuit Court of 
Appeals just ruled in a case, Missouri v. Biden, I'm sure 
you're all familiar with this, it's going to go down, I think, 
as a landmark case in the worst possible way in First Amendment 
law. Because what the Court of Appeals found is that the White 
House--not just the Federal Government, but the White House--
actively coerced every major social media platform in America--
let me say that again, every major social media platform in 
America, to ban speech that the White House did not like.
    What are we talking about here? Well, we're talking about 
speech on the COVID-19 pandemic, speech on the 2022 
congressional elections, speech related to mask mandates, 
speech related to vaccines. What did the White House do? Well, 
over a period of years, they met with, on a regular basis, the 
leaders of social media companies, and demanded that the speech 
they did not like be taken down.
    They further demanded that these same social media 
companies amplify the White House's speech. Amazing. So, take 
down all of this speech that we don't like. Amplify our own 
speech. Unbelievable.
    What kind of speech are we talking about? Well, for 
example, not just public officials but parents. Here's an 
example from my State, the State of Missouri. This is--I'm 
reading from the opinion, here--one parent, who posted on 
Nextdoor.com, which is a site operated by Facebook, posted an 
online petition to encourage his school to remain mask 
optional, found that his posts were removed without notifying 
him, and his friends never saw them.
    Another parent in the same school district, who objected to 
mask mandates for schoolchildren, responded to Dr. Fauci on 
Twitter, and promptly received a warning from Twitter that his 
account would be banned if he did not delete the tweets 
criticizing Dr. Fauci's approach to mask mandates.
    These objections, amazingly, these--this censorship was 
taken at the direct behest of the Federal Government, the 
direct behest of the Biden administration. Professor Knox, is 
this a violation of the First Amendment?
    Professor Knox. Only a judge can make that determination.
    Senator Hawley. And a judge has. I'm glad you said that. 
Multiple judges. District court--Federal district court said 
there was a direct First Amendment violation. Court of appeals, 
unanimously, three-judge panel unanimously said, direct First 
Amendment violation. I can't think of another time in American 
history when the President of the United States--and I say that 
advisedly, because the record reflects that White House 
officials were sending emails and communications to these 
companies, saying that the President himself wanted the 
censorship. So, you've got the Government doing exactly what 
Professor Knox said is not permitted under the First Amendment, 
directly coercing the speech of private parties, and not just 
one or two authors, but parents all across the country. 
Unprecedented in the history of this Nation.
    So, I'm glad we're having this hearing today. I hope that 
we will have more like it, to expose the censorship happening 
at the highest levels of our government. Mr. Chairman, I'd ask 
that this opinion, this judgment by the Fifth Circuit, Missouri 
v. Biden, be entered into the record in full.
    Chair Durbin. Without objection.
    [The information appears as a submission for the record.]
    Senator Hawley. I will leave it there. I know there are 
others--Senator Kennedy's here--who want to ask questions. But 
I just want to say, for the record, that this kind of 
censorship is un-American, it is unconstitutional, and I hope 
it will go down as a sad chapter in American history that we 
can close, here and now. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Durbin. Thank you, Senator Hawley. Senator Kennedy.
    Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I confess, I'm a little confused. And I appreciate the 
argument that, that we've--or, discussion that we've been 
having, but, for me, it's a little too conceptual or, I don't 
know, metaphysical, or teleological, or whatever you want to 
call it. I want to try to understand what you're asking us to 
do.
    Let's take two books that have been much discussed. The 
first one is called ``All Boys Aren't Blue,'' and I will quote 
from it: ``I put some lube on and got him on his knees, and I 
began to slide into him from behind. I pulled out of him and 
kissed him while he masturbated. He asked me to turn over while 
he slipped a condom on himself. This was my ass, and I was 
struggling to imagine someone inside me. He got on top and 
slowly inserted himself into me. It was the worst pain I think 
I have ever felt in my life. Eventually, I felt a mix of 
pleasure with the pain,'' closed quote, ``All Boys Aren't 
Blue.''
    The second is another much-discussed book. I'm sure you're 
familiar with it. It's called ``Gender Queer.'' Okay? Let me 
read an excerpt from that, quote, ``I got a new strap-on 
harness today. I can't wait to put it on you. It will fit my 
favorite dildo perfectly. You're going to look so hot. I can't 
wait to have your cock in my mouth. I'm going to give you the 
blow job of your life. Then I want you inside of me,'' end 
quote.
    Now, Mr. Secretary, what are you asking us to do? Are you 
suggesting that only librarians should decide whether the two 
books that I just referenced should be available to kids? Is 
that what you're saying?
    Secretary Giannoulias. No.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Tell me what you're saying.
    Secretary Giannoulias. Well, first of all, there's this----
    Senator Kennedy. Don't give me a speech. Tell me what 
you're asking----
    Secretary Giannoulias. I won't----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Me to do.
    Secretary Giannoulias. With all due respect, Senator--the 
words you spoke are disturbing, especially coming out of your 
mouth--it's very disturbing. But I would--I would also tell 
you, that we're not advocating for kids to read porn, to 
Senator Booker's point.
    Senator Kennedy. What are you advocating for?
    Secretary Giannoulias. We are advocating for parents, 
random parents, not to have the ability, under the guise of 
keeping kids safe, to try and challenge the world view of every 
single manner on these issues.
    Senator Kennedy. You're getting conceptual again.
    Secretary Giannoulias. I'm not getting conceptual. I'm----
    Senator Kennedy. Well, yes----
    Secretary Giannoulias [continuing]. Saying that----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. You are. Yes, you are, 
because I want to know what you're recommending. It sounds to 
me like some of you are saying the librarians should decide who 
gets to see that book.
    Secretary Giannoulias. I'm saying, when you're making--when 
individual parents are allowed to make a decision of where that 
line is, and, ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' which involves a rape 
scene--should that book be pulled from our libraries? I think 
it becomes a slippery slope.
    Senator Kennedy. Well, I think you ought to think about it 
a little bit more before you come here----
    Secretary Giannoulias. I've thought about it, Senator----
    Senator Kennedy. If you're going to propose something, you 
ought to be able, in 30 seconds, to be able to explain----
    Secretary Giannoulias. Senator----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. What you're asking us to do.
    Secretary Giannoulias. Senator----
    Senator Kennedy. Ms. Kelly, what do you understand--well, 
let me skip you for a second. Mr.--Cameron, tell me what 
you're--you're proposing.
    Mx. Samuels. It's pronounced ``Mix.''
    Senator Kennedy. Mx.? Is that how you--how would you like 
me to refer to you?
    Mx. Samuels. Senator, your definition of sexual is 
synonymous with LGBTQ identity. Libraries----
    Senator Kennedy. I'm not asking you that. I'm asking you to 
tell me--you read those two excerpts. Do you----
    Mx. Samuels. ``Gender Queer''----
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Think that--are you asking 
that only librarians, and not parents, have any say in whether 
minors can read those books? Is that what you're saying?
    Mx. Samuels. ``Gender Queer'' has never been in my school 
library, so it's never been banned. It's----
    Senator Kennedy. Well, suppose it was. Should it be up just 
to the librarian, or should parents have a say?
    Mx. Samuels. There should be facilitation of collaboration 
between students, parents----
    Senator Kennedy. Do parents have a say?
    Mx. Samuels [continuing]. And educators. Parents should be 
working with students and educators to be----
    Senator Kennedy. Okay.
    Mx. Samuels [continuing]. Making decisions----
    Senator Kennedy. All right.
    Mx. Samuels [continuing]. Because students are----
    Senator Kennedy. All right. Who decides, ultimately? The 
librarian? Or do you take a vote, or who takes the vote?
    Mx. Samuels. Book review committees in the community in my 
school district.
    Senator Kennedy. You want a committee to decide?
    Mx. Samuels. There are committees.
    Senator Kennedy. Okay. Well, I'm asking you, how do we 
decide whether the two books that I just referenced should be 
available in the library? What--what would you--if you were 
running things, what would you do?
    Mx. Samuels. ``All Boys Aren't Blue,'' the scene you 
mentioned, is about sexual abuse.
    Senator Kennedy. I know what it's about.
    Mx. Samuels. It's not erotic.
    Senator Kennedy. What would you do, in terms of making the 
books available? Would you say anybody can see them? Or, they 
have to be in a special section?
    Mx. Samuels. Students who do not read books like ``All Boys 
Aren't Blue'' cannot learn what is appropriate.
    Senator Kennedy. I understand that.
    Mx. Samuels. They cannot learn----
    Senator Kennedy. I understand, but----
    Mx. Samuels [continuing]. About abuse.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. None of you want to answer my 
question. You come here and you say, censorship is bad, and, of 
course, it's bad. But the obvious response is, okay, you heard 
the books we're talking about. Okay? We're not talking about 
``The Catcher in the Rye.'' So, tell me what you want. Who gets 
to decide? And all I've heard is, the librarians, and parents 
have nothing to do with it. And if that's your response, what 
planet did you just parachute in from?
    Secretary Giannoulias. Parents, Senator----
    Senator Kennedy. Or what country, more appropriately? This 
is not China.
    Secretary Giannoulias. Parents, Senator, with all due 
respect, parents absolutely have a say. My parents were 
immigrants, came to this country. We never checked out books 
without our parents seeing what--what books we were reading. 
They encouraged us to read books----
    Senator Kennedy. Mr. Secretary, I understand this is good 
for your politics back home.
    Secretary Giannoulias. It's got nothing to do with my 
politics.
    Senator Kennedy. But I'm not----
    Secretary Giannoulias. My bill has passed.
    Senator Kennedy. Of course, it does. It has----
    Secretary Giannoulias. My bill has passed.
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. Everything to do with your 
politics.
    Secretary Giannoulias. I'm here to----
    Senator Kennedy. But you came here with a problem, and I'm 
trying to understand the solution, and you don't have one.
    Secretary Giannoulias. We solved the solution----
    Senator Kennedy. Other than----
    Secretary Giannoulias. We solved----
    Senator Kennedy. Other than----
    Secretary Giannoulias [continuing]. The solution in 
Illinois.
    Senator Kennedy. Other than to tell us that if we don't 
agree with you, you're on the wrong--we'll be on the wrong side 
of history.
    Secretary Giannoulias. We solved the problem in Illinois. 
We fixed it, because we----
    Senator Kennedy. Well, there are others----
    Secretary Giannoulias [continuing]. Passed laws that make--
--
    Senator Kennedy [continuing]. You could work on.
    Secretary Giannoulias. Well, that's why I'm here, to----
    Senator Kennedy. I'm out of time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Secretary Giannoulias [continuing]. I'm here to help other 
States make these decisions.
    Chair Durbin. At this point, there are no Senators here who 
have not been recognized, and----
    Senator Kennedy. Can we have----
    Chair Durbin. No.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Kennedy. I've got some more books I can read.
    [Laughter.]
    Chair Durbin. I'm sure you do.
    I appreciate all our witnesses appearing before the 
Committee today, and I know that all my colleagues on the 
Committee want our children to have access to books that are 
appropriate for their age. There are some serious 
disagreements, however, about what content is objectionable. It 
is inevitable and healthy for our democracy. We need to work 
together as a country to try to create clear standards for 
access to books, so that no one individual can cause a book to 
be banned for an entire community.
    I'm proud of my home State and Secretary Giannoulias for 
leading the effort to push back against book bans, and I hope 
other States will follow your example.
    Libraries, and the treasured books within them, are just 
too important to allow this rise in censorship to continue any 
longer. Let's come together to protect the freedom to read, and 
learn, and stand up against book banning, wherever it occurs. 
The record for today's hearing will remain open for 1 week.
    Chair Durbin. The hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:03 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
