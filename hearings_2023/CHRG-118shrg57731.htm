                              ----------                              


                       WEDNESDAY, MARCH 22, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:51 a.m., in 
room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria 
Cantwell, Chairwoman of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Cantwell[presiding], Klobuchar, Schatz, 
Markey, Peters, Baldwin, Duckworth, Tester, Sinema, Rosen, 
Lujan, Hickenlooper, Warnock, Welch, Cruz, Thune, Fischer, 
Moran, Sullivan, Blackburn, Young, Budd, Schmitt, Vance, and 
Capito.
    Also present: Senator Brown.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    Chair Cantwell. The Science and Transportation committee 
will come to order for the purposes of a hearing. We are here 
this morning at the Full Committee for ``Improving Rail Safety 
in Response to the East Palestine Derailment.''
    I would ask the witnesses to please join us for the first 
panel at the witness table. Good morning, everyone. The hearing 
will come to order. On February 3, the town of East Palestine, 
Ohio, experienced a hazardous material event that no community 
should have to suffer from.
    A Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous material 
crashed just outside the town and 38 cars, more than a quarter 
of the train, derailed. Plastic pellets from one of the 
derailed cars caught fire with engulfed--and engulfed other 
rail cars, including five carrying vinyl chloride. After 
burning for 2 days, authorities became concerned that the vinyl 
chloride in one of the tanks was undergoing a chemical reaction 
that made it bigger and more dangerous.
    The authorities then initiated a controlled burn of the 
remaining vinyl chloride in five tanks to prevent a greater 
catastrophe. 2,000 residents were forced to evacuate and a 
community was forever changed. We look forward to hearing the 
witnesses and especially appreciate the Palestine moms for 
their leadership, and we look forward to hearing from Ms. 
Allison this morning.
    Let me be clear, this hearing is not only, though, about 
East Palestine derailment. Less than a week ago, a Burlington 
Northern Santa Fe train derailed in my state of Washington, the 
Swinomish reservation in Skagit County, spilling 5,000 gallons 
of diesel near Padilla Bay waterfront, a very sensitive aquatic 
ecosystem. These are important issues for all of America, and 
we look forward to working in a bipartisan basis on this 
problem.
    Fire Chief Comstock, I know, will be testifying, and he 
knows better that a fire department needs to deal with the 
hazardous materials, and we will be asking you what Congress 
can do to better equip the firefighters who have to respond. 
These derailments have occurred during a concerning trend.
    That is, we can't have railroads adopt operating models 
focused on just cutting cost to achieve higher profits and then 
have higher accident rates. We need to invest in the 
modernization of equipment that will provide the safety we 
need. From 2017 to 2021, railroads cut their workforce by 22 
percent and reduced investment in the network by 24 percent. 
And at the same time, accident rates increased by 14 percent.
    We will dive into these details today to better understand 
what that is about. Today, we will hear from Senators Brown and 
Vance about their bipartisan legislation, the Railway Safety 
Act of 2023, and from Ohio Governor Mike DeWine about his 
experience in responding to the derailment. We will hear from, 
as I mentioned earlier, East Palestine resident Misti Allison, 
who will give a firsthand account of how the derailment 
impacted her community.
    We will also hear from a second panel of witnesses who will 
speak to rail and hazardous materials safety policy failures 
that contributed to the derailment and what steps are necessary 
to protect communities, employees, and the environment. NTSB 
Chair Homendy will be here, and I look forward to asking her 
about their agency's recommendations to improve rail safety and 
about what investments in detection devices are necessary.
    Mr. Whitaker, you and your coworkers who have raised 
questions about safety, we will hear from you about why you 
believe these concerns have gone unaddressed. And we will hear 
from Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw about these trends and what 
he is going to do to ensure that safety is the top priority.
    A month ago, I sent letters to seven Class I freight 
railroads asking for information about their hazardous 
materials safety practices. Nearly all of them failed to 
provide the Committee with the specific information that were 
requested. I have to say BSNF did provide us with information 
about past inspections, but we need clear information from 
organizations where we are today with safety inspections.
    Let me be clear, we need to know exactly what organizations 
are doing today to make sure inspections are helping us to 
detect problems. I introduced legislation in 2015 that has some 
of the same provisions that we now see in the Brown, Vance 
Bill.
    I wish some of those who had been implemented sooner. Our 
two colleagues, though, are working very diligently to make 
this a top priority here in Congress and working hard to 
represent these communities.
    I believe that our committee can work in a bipartisan 
fashion to improve rail safety, but it shouldn't go unnoticed 
that the same issues are plaguing us in other areas of 
transportation. If you want to have the safest system, you have 
to have the most modernized equipment, the most minimal of 
workforce standards, and you have to continue to improve 
safety.
    With that, I will turn it over to the Ranking Member, 
Senator Cruz, for his opening comments.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank the 
witnesses for being here today. Welcome, Senator Brown. Like so 
many other Americans, I watched with dismay the horror that 
unfolded in East Palestine, Ohio.
    On television, we saw a fiery train wreck where nearby 
residents were understandably fearful that their water was 
poisoned and their air was polluted. The distress of East 
Palestine's residents was real then and it is real now. And Ms. 
Allison, thank you for being here and testifying today.
    That is why it is important that we are holding this 
hearing. This hearing will address two critical topics. First, 
what can be done to prevent derailments like the one that 
occurred in East Palestine? Second, what can be done more 
broadly to improve the safety of trains transporting hazardous 
materials?
    While these topics are related, and each topic, I think, 
merits its own hearing, it appears this morning may be our only 
opportunity as a full committee to examine the East Palestine 
derailment and the broader questions about railroad safety 
policy.
    To be clear, I agree with Senators Brown and Vance that 
railroad safety should be on our agenda, and that it is an 
opportunity for real and meaningful bipartisan cooperation. My 
team and I will continue engaging with their staff and with the 
Chairwoman's staff, and I am optimistic that we can achieve 
broad agreement on policies that improve safety, that protect 
our communities, without at the same time damaging our supply 
chain or imposing unreasonable costs that would ultimately harm 
American families.
    We need to do both. Today, we need to hear what led to the 
derailment in East Palestine. The NTSB has launched an 
investigation, and I appreciate Chairwoman Homendy's appearance 
here today. This committee is also looking very closely at this 
derailment. For as much as we know about the derailment, key 
questions remain unanswered.
    For example, who specifically made the decision to vent and 
burn the vinyl chloride from all five derailed tank cars, and 
why? Were alternatives considered? Were the right people 
consulted? I also want to know what can be done to prevent or 
to mitigate similar derailments in the future?
    This committee should hear more about wayside detectors and 
advanced technologies that could use algorithms and trending 
analysis to identify potential safety issues earlier. We should 
hear more about the information available to first responders 
and about the coordination with shippers of hazardous 
materials.
    Understandably, Americans across the country share the 
concerns of the residents of East Palestine and wonder, are 
essential hazardous materials being transported safely? Will 
residents be protected if a spill occurs? Unfortunately, the 
delayed and disjointed response by the Biden Administration has 
not allayed these concerns.
    Notably, we heard calls from residents of East Palestine in 
the local school asking, where is Pete Buttigieg? The response 
from East Palestine's Mayor, Trent Conway, was, ``I don't 
know.'' It took Secretary Buttigieg 10 days to even acknowledge 
the derailment. After he was called out, he did a 180 and tried 
to sell a slew of big Government regulatory proposals desperate 
to disguise the failure of the Administration to act sooner.
    For example, Secretary Buttigieg, as proposed, is 
reinstating a brake rule that was not supported by cost benefit 
analysis. Shortly thereafter, the Chairwoman of the NTSB, 
Chairwoman Homendy, tweeted about this rule.
    She said, ``some are saying the ECP electronically 
controlled pneumatic brake rule, if implemented, would have 
prevented this derailment. False.'' She proceeded to explain 
the proposed break rule would not have applied to the East 
Palestine train and would not have prevented the derailment, 
even if it had.
    Undeterred, Secretary Buttigieg then released a laundry 
list of regulatory proposals, many of which had little to no 
connection to the East Palestine derailment. In an effort to 
further distract from his own failed response, Secretary 
Buttigieg has suggested that President Trump was responsible 
for the derailment in East Palestine.
    I know that is a frequent playbook of this Administration, 
blaming every problem on President Trump, but not even The 
Washington Post fact checker, who usually goes out of his way 
to back Democrat claims, bought this claim.
    The Washington Post fact checker concluded, and I quote, 
``from our analysis, none of the regulatory changes made during 
the Trump Administration at this point can be cited as 
contributing to the accident.'' In contrast to Secretary 
Buttigieg, our colleague on this committee, Senator Vance, has 
kept his focus where it should be, on the people affected by 
the derailment.
    I applaud him and I applaud Senator Brown for focusing on 
their constituents, and I look forward to continuing to work 
closely with both of you and with the Chairwoman on a 
bipartisan serious rail safety package.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Cruz. The first panel 
will provide committee testimony about rail safety legislation 
being supported by Senators Brown and Vance. And we will hear 
how the Norfolk Southern derailment has impacted the community.
    First, we will hear from Senator Brown and then Senator 
Vance, who is on the Committee, about their legislation. Next, 
we will hear from Governor Mike DeWine, who will be joining us 
remotely, who has been Governor of Ohio since 2019, is a former 
Senate colleague and we welcome him back into the Senate for 
the purposes of his experience on this derailment. And we look 
forward to hearing from you, Governor DeWine.
    And last, we will hear from Misti Allison, who is a member 
of the community from East Palestine, Ohio. So, thank you all 
for being here. And Senator Brown, you lead off.

               STATEMENT OF HON. SHERROD BROWN, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Brown. Thank you, Madam Chair. Senator Cruz, thank 
you, and members of the Committee, especially my colleague from 
Ohio, Senator Vance.
    I want to thank Governor DeWine for the very good work he 
has done in responding to this. Misti Allison for her activism. 
She is here today with us, as Chair Cantwell said. This is her 
second trip to Washington on behalf of the East Palestine 
community. She is here soon after the loss of her mother.
    Misti, thank you for speaking up during this difficult time 
and for your leadership, and our thoughts and prayers, of 
course, are with you and your family. I appreciate the work 
that Senator Vance has done on this legislation. It has been a 
bipartisan effort from the beginning. I appreciate the comments 
of Senator Cruz and Chair Cantwell. I was just in East 
Palestine again yesterday.
    I want to thank Ohio witnesses and the second panel, Chief 
Comstock of the Western Reserve Joint Fire District, and Clyde 
Whitaker with SMART Transportation Division that represents 
some 3,000 rail workers in our state. I appreciate their work. 
Chief Comstock speaks clearly about the challenges first 
responders in communities the size of East Palestine have 
faced.
    Mr. Whitaker is an unrelenting advocate for safe working 
conditions for his members and for all people working in Ohio 
railroads. The nation now knows East Palestine is a tight knit 
community in Columbiana County, Ohio.
    The year I was born, and a couple of decades after that 
East Palestine--the Columbiana County made 80 percent of the 
tableware in this country, the dishes and glasses, and because 
of bad trade policy, those jobs first they moved South, then 
they moved to Mexico, then they moved to China.
    There are no potteries in Columbiana County anymore. This 
community and neighboring communities just a couple of miles 
away in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, are the kind of places 
that are too often forgotten or exploited by corporate America.
    Now, these Ohioans are worried about whether their water is 
safe to drink, whether the air is safe to breathe, whether 
their kids will get sick, and of interest to the Committee I 
chair, what happens to the value of their homes.
    We have heard Mr. Shaw say that Norfolk Southern is going 
to ``make it right'' in East Palestine, and do right, is his 
words, by the community. Senator Vance and I are going to make 
sure that East Palestine is not forgotten. He and I both make 
regular visits there. Not next week, not next month, not next 
year, not ever.
    Doing right by this community must include making sure more 
accidents don't happen and that is the reason for our 
legislative efforts. That will only occur if we take clear, 
commonsense steps to make our railways safer. Norfolk Southern 
followed the Wall Street business model, boost profits in its 
stock price by eliminating over the last decade 38 percent of 
its workforce.
    These profits were spent on stock buybacks that benefit 
executives instead of investing in workers and investing in 
safety. Instead, they compromised safety. Cut costs to boost 
profits, the communities along their route be damned. For 
decades, the railroads have lobbied to undermine safety rules.
    They are still at it even now, after what they have done to 
this Ohio town, even with the eyes of the country on them, 
Madam Chair. Today you are going to hear arguments from Norfolk 
Southern and the rail industry's lobbying arm that they support 
the intent of the bill, but they don't really need stronger 
rules. We have heard that before in this committee and 
elsewhere.
    The railroads are committed to safety. They say they are 
making changes. They claim. Mr. Jefferies's prepared testimony 
goes to great lengths to hide safety problems in his 
statistics. Here is a statistic you won't hear, taking out 
grade crossings.
    The accident and incident rate for Class I railroads, not 
including the short lines, Class I railroads is higher in each 
of the past 4 years than any year since 2008. A decade of 
progress has been wiped out. Their trains are growing longer, 
heavier, and more dangerous.
    The train that went off the tracks in East Palestine was 
149 cars. The train that went off the tracks in Springfield, 
Ohio, West of there, 150 miles, only 2 weeks later was over 200 
cars. They are longer, they are heavier, they are more 
dangerous.
    So, remember, when you hear about supposed quote, meaning, 
remember that when you hear about meaningfully improved safety. 
We have heard over the past month and Mr. Jefferies will repeat 
today, that 99.9 percent of rail has met shipments, reached 
their destinations without releasing toxic waste.
    I would urge him to talk to Ms. Allison and others whom I 
have gotten to know in East Palestine about how it feels to be 
that 0.1 percent. Ask her if she thinks that record is 
something to brag about. Railroads refuse to support new rules 
for trains that carry dangerous hazardous material, like the 
vinyl chloride that burned in Ohio.
    They have cut the amount of time their car men are given to 
inspect each railcar to less than a minute. The railroads have 
often argued against increasing fines for safety violations. Of 
course, they have. In most recent Fiscal Year available, 
Norfolk Southern had 579 violations in the cases that have been 
closed.
    They paid an average fine of less than $3,300. You heard 
that right. Not $30 million, not $3 million, just over $3,000. 
The largest fine Norfolk Southern paid that year was just over 
$25,000. The company, keep in mind, planned to spend $3.4 
billion on stock buybacks and they already did that, and even 
more, right before they were about to do it again when the 
train derailed. It is not a cost of doing business, the fines. 
It really is a rounding error.
    Finally, the railroads are fighting the most basic of all 
requirements, having two crew members in a train. If you ask 50 
people outside anywhere, how many people you think work on 
those trains that are 200 cars long or two or three miles long, 
you would hear people say 5, 10, 20. The railroads want only 
one person working on a train that is two or three miles long. 
That is frankly crazy.
    Earlier this month, Norfolk Southern issued a six-point 
plan of modest safety improvements. We don't need a voluntary 
plan. We need the Brown, Vance bill. We need safety rules. We 
need the Railway Safety Act. Our bill is a commonsense 
bipartisan plan. Senator Vance and I are both here today to 
urge this committee to embrace the obvious need for safety 
reform.
    It shouldn't, Madam Chair, Senator Cruz, it shouldn't take 
a train derailment for elected officials to put partisanship 
aside and work together for the people whom we serve, not 
corporations like Norfolk Southern.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Brown follows:]

    Prepared Statement of Hon. Sherrod Brown, U.S. Senator from Ohio
    I want to thank Governor DeWine and Misti Allison for joining us 
today. You both know too well the need for stronger rail safety.
    This is Ms. Allison's second trip to Washington, DC on behalf of 
the East Palestine and she is here soon after the loss of her mother. 
Misti, thank you for speaking up during this difficult time. Our 
thoughts and prayers are with you and your family at the loss of your 
mother.
    I also want to thank our Ohio witnesses on the second panel: Chief 
Chip Comstock of the Western Reserve Joint Fire District and Clyde 
Whitaker with SMART's Transportation Division that represents 3,000 
railroad workers in our state.
    Chief Comstock speaks clearly about the challenges our first 
responders in East Palestine have faced, and Mr. Whitaker is a constant 
advocate for safe working conditions on Ohio railroads.
    As the Nation now knows, East Palestine is a tightknit town in 
Columbiana County, Ohio, which once made 80 percent of the ceramics in 
this country, before those jobs--like so many in our state--moved 
overseas, so companies could pay workers less.
    This town--and neighboring communities in Beaver County, 
Pennsylvania--are the kinds of places that are too often forgotten or 
exploited by corporate America.
    Now, these Ohioans are worried about whether their water is safe to 
drink, whether the air is safe to breathe, whether their kids will get 
sick, and--of interest to the Committee I chair--what happens to the 
value of their homes.
    We've heard Mr. Shaw say that Norfolk Southern is going to ``make 
it right'' in East Palestine and ``do right'' by the community. Senator 
Vance and I are going to make sure that East Palestine is not 
forgotten--not next week, not in two years, not ever.
    Doing right by this community must include making sure more 
accidents don't happen. And that will only occur if we take clear, 
commonsense steps to make our railways safer.
    Norfolk Southern followed the Wall Street business model: boost 
profits, and its stock price, by eliminating 38 percent of its workers 
over 10 years. Those profits were spent on stock buybacks that benefit 
executives instead of investing in its workers and investing in safety.
    Cut costs to boost profits, the communities along their routes be 
damned. For decades, the railroads have lobbied to undermine safety 
rules.
    And they're still at it, even now even after what they've done to 
this Ohio town. Even with the eyes of the country on them.
    Today you're going to hear arguments from Norfolk Southern and the 
rail industry's lobbying arm that they support the ``intent of the 
bill'' but that we don't need stronger rules.
    The railroads are committed to safety, they say. They're making 
changes, they claim.
    Mr. Jefferies' prepared testimony goes to great lengths to hide 
safety problems in his statistics.
    Here's a statistic you won't hear: taking out grade crossings, the 
accident and incident rate for Class I railroads is higher in each of 
the past 4 years than in any year since 2008. A decade of progress has 
been wiped out.
    Their trains are growing longer, heavier, and more dangerous.
    So remember that when you hear about supposed, quote, 
``meaningfully improved safety.''
    We've also heard over the past month--and Mr. Jefferies will repeat 
today--that 99.9 percent of rail hazmat shipments reach their 
destination without releasing toxic waste.
    I'd urge him to talk to Ohioans in East Palestine, like Ms. 
Allison, about how it feels to be in that point-one-percent. Ask her if 
she thinks that record is something to brag about.
    Railroads refuse to support new rules for trains that carry 
dangerous hazardous materials, like the vinyl chloride that burned in 
Ohio.
    They have cut the amount of time their carmen are given to inspect 
each railcar to less than a minute.
    The railroads have also argued against increasing fines for safety 
violations. Of course.
    In the most recent fiscal year available, Norfolk Southern had 579 
violations in closed cases. They paid an average fine of less than 
$3,300.
    You heard that right--not $30 million. Not $3 million. Just over 
$3,000. The largest fine Norfolk Southern paid that year was just over 
$25,000.
    This company planned to spend $3.4 billion on stock buybacks. A 
$3,000 or $25,000 fine is meaningless. It's not even a cost of doing 
business--it's a rounding error.
    Finally, the railroads are fighting the most basic of all 
requirements: having two crew members in a train.
    Trains are miles long. Railroads want just a single human being on 
these trains. That is, frankly, crazy.
    Earlier this month, Norfolk Southern issued a six-point plan of 
modest safety improvements. We don't need a voluntary plan.
    We need real safety rules. We need the Railway Safety Act.
    Our bill is a commonsense, bipartisan plan. Senator Vance and I are 
both here today to urge the Committee to embrace the obvious need for 
safety reforms.
    It shouldn't take a train derailment for elected officials to put 
partisanship aside and work together for the people we serve--not 
corporations like Norfolk Southern.

    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Brown. And 
thank you for accentuating this one point, that is a trend 
change that I don't think people have fully digested is the 
length of trains has significantly changed.
    And so, I think it proposes definitely new challenges. 
Senator Vance, thank you. I look forward to your comments and 
appreciate your work on this legislation.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES DAVID VANCE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Vance. So, thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, 
Ranking Member Cruz, for both of your engagement with this 
issue. Thanks to Senator Brown for his partnership on this 
issue. Appreciate it. Appreciate you being here for the 
Commerce Committee.
    I want to thank all of our guests here, both during this 
panel and the next panel. But I particularly want to thank Ms. 
Allison for being here. I read your testimony this morning, and 
I won't reveal what is in it because I don't want to give 
anything away but let me just say that I am sorry this 
happened.
    And as the father of three kids under the age of six, I was 
particularly affected by some of the ways this has affected 
your children. And the only thing I would ask you, Ms. Allison, 
because you have already done so much with your activism, I 
appreciate that, is that, you know, always treat our office as 
an open door.
    If there is more that we could be doing, I would like to be 
doing it. I am a new Senator. You don't always see everything 
that is happening. And the thing that I would ask is, if you 
think we could be doing more, just come and tell us, because we 
will try to do that. So, look forward to your testimony.
    But let me just sort of address a couple of issues related 
to the Railway Safety Act. I have heard a couple of general 
complaints and a couple of specific complaints about the 
legislation from industry groups, from alleged conservative 
activists, and I would like to address them in broad strokes 
here and then address one specific consideration, and then 
finally suggest a way we might be able to deal with this bill 
and this legislation in the future.
    So, the most outrageous and the most ridiculous thing that 
I have heard from industry groups and other activists in 
response to this bill is that it is somehow a kind of 
Bolshevism to require the railways to engage in proper safety 
standards, that this bill is a big Government solution to the 
railway safety problem.
    It is funny that that complaint comes from a group that 
came before this body 3 months ago begging for a bailout from 
their labor dispute. And while I am on that topic, by the way, 
thank you, Ranking Member Cruz, for your leadership on that 
issue in particular. But you cannot, on the one hand, beg the 
Government to bail you out of a labor dispute 3 months ago and 
then say that it is big Government to have proper safety 
standards in the way that you conduct your railroads. It is a 
ridiculous argument. It doesn't pass the smell test.
    And the fact that they advanced that argument in their Op-
Eds, in their paid for activism is insulting to the people of 
East Palestine and it is insulting to the intelligence of the 
members of this committee. Let me offer a specific pushback to 
a criticism.
    One of the things that I have heard in response to our 
legislation is that it actually has nothing to do with what 
happened in East Palestine. Well, that is an interesting 
observation, and it is something that I would love them to go 
to East Palestine and say themselves. Say it to the 
firefighters who went into a chemical fire without proper 
hazmat protection because they didn't know what was on the 
train.
    This legislation fixes that problem as it should. But you 
cannot say that this has nothing to do with East Palestine when 
the very people on the ground are begging for some of these 
changes and the firefighters, not just in East Palestine, but 
all across the state of Ohio and all across the country, are 
saying that they need this stuff.
    Now, I have heard from people that the railroads are 
adopting certain voluntary standards. You heard some of that in 
Senator Brown's testimony. They allegedly have an app that 
notifies the firefighters and the first responders what is on 
the trains. Well, if the app was good enough, then why did it 
fail in East Palestine?
    If the app provided proper notification, then why did 
firefighters in my state 7 weeks ago go fight a chemical fire 
without knowing what was on it? It is a ridiculous argument. 
Now I want to look toward the future here, and I want to offer 
a suggestion to the rail industry and to anybody else who wants 
to engage on this legislation.
    I had a good meeting with Alan Shaw yesterday, and I am 
looking forward to Mr. Shaw's testimony. I would love to see a 
commitment from Mr. Shaw to defend and to support certain 
components of this bill. I think it would be good.
    I think it would be good for the people of East Palestine, 
and I frankly think it would be good for Norfolk Southern as 
well. But one of the things that we talked about is the hot box 
detectors and whether we need them every 10 miles or every 15 
miles or every 7.5 miles, and whether they should be enhanced 
by additional technology.
    That is the type of conversation I am willing to have, and 
I don't want to speak for Senator Brown, but I guess that he 
would probably be willing to have it, too. Let's have that 
conversation about what the proper pacing is for the hotbox 
detectors.
    Let's have the conversation about how we can advance this 
stuff with better technology. I am open to that. But to the 
rail industry, don't lie about my bill. Don't slander the staff 
who drafted it. If you would like to have a good faith 
conversation about rail safety, let's do exactly that.
    But we are going to learn a lot during this committee and 
in the weeks to come, if the rail industry would like to do 
that. I hope they will, because I am certainly ready to join 
that conversation. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Vance follows:]

      Prepared Statement of Hon. JD Vance, U.S. Senator from Ohio
    I thank the Chair and the Ranking Member for holding this hearing. 
I also want to thank Governor DeWine for his statement. Thanks as well 
to the witnesses, especially Misti Allison, who has joined us from East 
Palestine.
    The citizens of East Palestine have suffered a profound shock. They 
have felt the mental and physical consequences of an explosion in their 
community. They have felt the alienation of watching that disaster 
televised and dissected worldwide. They felt the terrible fear that all 
parents feel when their children are in danger.
    This should not have happened in America. This cannot happen again 
in America. Today this Committee gets down to the business of ensuring 
that it does not.
    Those are the emotional stakes of this disaster, but we are not 
charged in the Senate to proceed on feeling alone. This chamber rightly 
prides itself on being an island of reason in a political culture that 
has become increasingly frantic. Thinking logically, we might be 
inclined to suggest that an industrial economy like ours requires the 
transportation of hazardous materials, and that of course accidents 
happen. We might reason that industry provides enormous benefit to the 
American people, and so, while these circumstances are regrettable, 
they do not merit swift action.
    This assessment is logical, but terribly wrong. Both Europe and 
Japan move more trains over more miles of track than the United States. 
They have many fewer derailments. They seem to be able to have a 
freight rail system with much less risk. Their example demonstrates 
that we can safely remove some of the risk from the rail system through 
reasonable government action without endangering commerce. Perhaps 
accidents will happen, but surely they can happen less often.
    Senators Brown, Hawley, Rubio, Casey and Fetterman and I have 
offered a solution, the Railway Safety Act of 2023. Representatives 
Johnson and Sykes and a coalition of our state's delegation have put 
forward similar legislation. These measures' provisions are limited, 
prudent, and urgent.
    Presently, there is no Federal regulation requiring the 
installation of sensors for overheating parts on railway lines. The 
most common of these sensors detect the difference between the outside 
temperature and the wheel and axle assembly of a railcar as it passes 
by. If there is a failure in this equipment, wheels lock up, and 
friction between the metal wheel and metal track creates heat and 
sparks. If there is enough heat for long enough the car's wheel and 
axle assembly will fail, and the train will derail. This is what caused 
the disaster at East Palestine. These facts are not in dispute.
    In fact, on March 6, Norfolk Southern itself announced that it was 
installing additional sensors on its rails. The Senate should not be 
satisfied with a voluntary standard outlined with blurry legalisms. 
Phrases from their announcement, ``develop a plan,'' ``anticipates 
adding,'' and ``where practical'' are not enough, not when towns across 
America are at stake. Hot bearing detectors must be added to the 
network, and they must be added in sufficient frequency to detect 
failing equipment. The National Transportation Safety Board preliminary 
report says that the derailment occurred on a stretch of track where 
detectors were twenty miles apart. We propose to require detectors 
every ten miles. Currently, there are about 6,000 hot bearing detectors 
on the rail network, averaging approximately 20-30 miles apart, 
depending on the railroad and the traffic on a rail line.
    The railroad industry is unmoved by the fact that this requirement 
would have prevented the disaster at East Palestine. They have said 
that this requirement does not ``provide appropriate flexibility'' and 
that it is a ``prescriptive safety mandate.'' They say that they are 
``determining what improvements should be made.'' They say, ``this 
section fails to evince any need for prescriptive installation of such 
detectors . . .'' Such resistance to even this common sense, minimal 
requirement, that railroads have admitted themselves needs to be 
remedied, should color Senators' perceptions of the railroads' other 
objections to this legislation.
    Perhaps just as important as the frequency of detectors is the 
question of at what temperature reading the trains should stop. Outside 
of East Palestine, the train registered a reading of 103 degrees 
Fahrenheit above ambient temperature. This did not lead to the train 
stopping. We need to figure out at what sensor reading these trains 
need to stop, and it's clear that the voluntary guidelines are too lax, 
especially since Norfolk Southern claimed in the Washington Post that 
its stopping requirements are ``among the lowest in the industry.'' 
Even the most stringent voluntary standard in the industry wasn't good 
enough.
    As Governor DeWine stated in his press conference on February 14: 
``the railroad was not required to notify anyone here in Ohio about 
what was in the rail cars coming through our state.'' He called it 
``absurd.'' I agree. It is absurd that there are no notification 
requirements for trains carrying hundreds of thousands of pounds of 
flammable gases under pressure. The railroads claim they have an app. 
There is an app! In their telling, there is no need for a Federal 
requirement, because the railroads have an app, another voluntary 
standard.
    The railroads claim that the app tells first responders everything 
they need to know, and that there were check-ins on the app in the area 
of East Palestine. Ask the firefighters if they knew precisely what was 
on this train. Ask them, and they will tell you that the placards of 
the trains were damaged by fire, and that the app was not sufficient. 
In the crucial early moments firefighters fought an inferno with 
limited protective equipment, because they didn't know they were facing 
dangerous materials.
    The terms of service for this app state: ``When using the AskRail 
app at the scene of a rail incident, users should try to secure the 
most up to date, federally-required shipping papers (consist) directly 
from the train crew or the railroad.'' First responders should not have 
to come hat-in-hand and beg for these papers in the middle of an 
emergency. Many of these trains run through rural areas, where Internet 
connectivity is limited. There needs to be a mandatory requirement for 
notification. Senators on the Commerce Committee are intimately 
familiar with the issues attendant with rural broadband access. 
Emergency response in rural areas cannot be held hostage to the 
resolution of those issues--it is far too urgent.
    Notification is not something new or hasty that was dreamed up in a 
crisis atmosphere. There was another rail accident, in recent memory, 
also involving vinyl chloride, in Paulsboro, New Jersey. The NTSB 
stated, in 2016, that ``notification requirements do not include such 
materials as the Class 2.1 vinyl chloride that was carried by Conrail 
(not a Class I railroad) and released in the Paulsboro, New Jersey, 
accident, from which this safety recommendation was derived. We urge 
PHMSA to require all railroads to provide advanced notification to 
communities for all hazardous materials transported on a given route.'' 
If the railroads app is as comprehensive as they say, then compliance 
with a new, mandatory requirement for notification that the NTSB has 
been requesting for nearly a decade should be quite simple.
    The new regulation on flammable gas trains should also have a 
similar, but not precisely the same requirement as other High Hazard 
Flammable Trains to ensure that the safety regulations on the 
transportation of hazardous materials appropriately reflect the danger 
presented to the community. Before the transportation of millions of 
pounds of flammable gas, the railroad should have to have a plan in 
place if there is a release, just like for oil transportation. The 
government needs to take a look at other standards as well, including 
routing, consist, and train length and weight. We're working on scoping 
this provision, and listening to stakeholders about our approach, but 
the rulemaking as it stands in the Railway Safety Act accomplishes 
those objectives.
    Some rationalization of the inspection regime for railcars is also 
a must. Some have claimed there are as many as ninety points of 
inspection on each side of a railcar. That inspection currently occurs 
in thirty seconds per side under current railroad practice. The 
voluntary requirements of the railroad do not provide enough time for a 
carman to actually review a railcar with sufficient care. Failing 
journal bearings, such as what happened in East Palestine can show 
signs of leaking oil or grease. These signs can be missed when the 
railcar is being inspected too rapidly.
    Abbreviated pre-departure inspections have now become a regular 
occurrence in American railroading, where trains enter yards less 
frequently. This is a provision in the regulations that allows for a 
reduced inspection when there is not a qualified mechanical inspector 
in the facility. This regulation must be changed so that this practice 
becomes the exception rather than the norm once again, lest an 
abbreviated pre-departure inspection contribute to the next East 
Palestine as it has to other, fatal railroad accidents.
    The railroads suggest that the time for an inspection has no 
relationship to its quality. This is nonsensical. Clearly, there is a 
minimum amount of time required for a human visual inspection to be 
effective. There is a question as to what the appropriate figure for 
that minimum might be, and I welcome that discussion, but this 
committee should not be subjected to the absurdity that reducing 
inspection time to a hurried glance would have no effect on safety. 
Airlines welcome a careful pilot-driven inspection regime. If railroads 
are serious about safety, they will as well, especially for hazardous 
materials.
    The bill increases civil penalties for violations, which is a 
commonsense provision when the maximum fine for rail safety violations 
is only $225,455. This is a multi-billion-dollar industry, and fines 
must be a sufficient deterrent to lax safety behavior. The bill 
requires two-man crews, to ensure that there are adequate personnel to 
manipulate the train in order to take tension out of a consist so that 
cut levers may be pulled to separate rail cars from the site of a 
derailment, so that the proper braking of partially derailed trains may 
be achieved, and so that engineers can manipulate the train while other 
employees respond to the emergency, which is what happened in East 
Palestine.
    These provisions are reasonable responses to a national disaster, 
which will cost untold sums to remediate. This is an industry that was 
created by land grants and subsidies from the Federal government in the 
first place, and enjoys a host of special privileges currently, not 
least of which was the recent congressionally-mandated termination of a 
railroad strike. Enacting modest advances in safety regulation after a 
disaster of the magnitude of East Palestine will steer Federal policy 
away from the current status quo, which concentrates reward in the 
hands of the railroads while socializing the risk of their cargoes and 
practices onto everyone else.

    Chair Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Vance, for your 
passionate support on this issue. I know it will make a 
difference, and I appreciate you pushing back on some of the 
misinformation that is out there.
    We are now going to go to Governor DeWine, who is joining 
us remotely. Governor DeWine, always good to see you. Not good 
to see you on these circumstances but we appreciate your 
leadership in helping to articulate a path forward.
    And I would be remiss if I didn't also thank you for your 
leadership on the CHIPS and Science Act and helping us get that 
legislation done. So, we look forward to you getting your help 
and support on moving the Brown, Vance legislation as well.
    So, Senator--I mean, our colleague, but now Governor, 
Governor DeWine.

       STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE DeWINE, GOVERNOR FROM OHIO

    Mr. DeWine. Chairwoman Cantwell, thank you very much, 
Ranking Member Cruz, members of the Committee. Thank you for 
the opportunity to testify today. I am actually, as you can 
see, remote and I am in the East Palestine High School Library. 
Let me tell you a little bit about this community.
    The New Year started off normally in East Palestine. It is 
a village of about 4,700 people. They just enjoyed Christmas, 
The annual Snowflake Festival in December. The third quarter of 
school started in late January. Parts had been cast for the 
high school musical, The Lion King Junior that, frankly, my 
wife and I had the opportunity to watch a few days ago.
    And the athletic director was preparing to host 25 to 30 
teams for the Bulldog Invitational Track Meet in April. The 
evening of February 3, 2023, started off really not unlike a 
lot of Friday nights at that time of year in East Palestine.
    Parents and members of the community were gathered at the 
high school cheering on the varsity boys basketball team at the 
Bulldogs home game against United High School Eagles from 
nearby Hanoverton. Girls varsity team had played against the 
Eagles just the night before.
    The backdrop, of course, to all things in East Palestine is 
a near constant rumble of trains running through the village. 
But the people of East Palestine are certainly used to that and 
many don't even notice them anymore.
    That was until 8:55 that Friday night. At 8:55, life 
stopped being normal for everyone in this community. It stopped 
feeling safe, when 38 cars of the Norfolk Southern freight 
train, carrying hundreds of thousands of pounds of hazardous 
material, hurtled off the track. Since then, I have visited the 
community a number of times and have had mothers tell me that 
they are afraid to let their children go outside in the grass 
to play.
    Some residents have told me about their bloody noses, their 
rashes, their coughs that they have developed, while others who 
don't have symptoms now ask, what is going to happen to me in 
10 or 15 years? What is going to happen to my children?
    Some want to know if it is safe to plant a garden this 
spring, and if they do, will the vegetables be safe to eat? 
People wonder about their property values, the values of their 
homes. If they want to sell, will they ever be able to sell 
their homes?
    Businesses worry about are they going to be able to stay 
afloat? Many people just wonder, will life ever return to 
normal? What is clear for all of East Palestine is this, this 
has been a deeply traumatic experience for this wonderful 
community. While all the tests of the air and the soil and the 
water have thus far shown repeatedly that things are safe, 
fear, fear remains.
    The people of East Palestine have told me that they want 
their community back. They want things to go back to the way 
they were before the train wreck. Members of the Committee, 
Norfolk Southern has an obligation to restore this community. 
It was their train, their tracks, their action that they are 
responsible for this tragedy.
    I want to thank Senator Vance, Senator Brown, the other co-
sponsors of their bill, the Rail Safety Act of 2023. I want to 
also thank Congresswoman Johnson and Congresswoman Sykes for 
their bill, the Rail Act. I am grateful the drafters of both 
bills included my request for a provision requiring that the 
rail carriers in the future be required to provide advance 
notification to State and local emergency responders about what 
these trains are in fact carrying.
    Let me go further, what--I urge the Senate and House to 
swiftly act to improve the safety, the safety of our railroads. 
Norfolk Southern must do everything in its power to put 
everything back as it was in East Palestine before 8:55 p.m., 
Friday, February 3. The people of this village have a right, 
they have a right to get their lives back. They have a right to 
get their community back, and simply to get their piece of 
mind.
    Let me just add, if I could, one additional thing. Shortly 
after the derailment, I heard repeatedly from residents they 
were concerned about their health. So, we worked with the East 
Palestine community, with the health department, and others to 
create a clinic for the residents so they could be assessed 
immediately, so they could walk in and be cared for. We started 
that clinic shortly after this tragedy occurred.
    This morning in this library I met with medical leaders 
from the East Liverpool City Hospital, and we are announcing 
today that we will be making this clinic into a permanent 
clinic for the community. It is going to be a full-service 
clinic that will provide comprehensive care and treatment.
    Anybody can walk in, anyone can be treated. And this is a 
long-term commitment to the health of the people of East 
Palestine. They are worried about their future. They are 
worried about where things are going to be in 5 or 10 or 15 
years. It is important that they be able to continue to get 
assessed.
    It is particularly important--I talked to the Fire Chief 
the other day, very, very concerned about the 300 responders, 
not just from East Palestine, but from all the areas into 
Pennsylvania who responded that night, they all need to be 
assessed. There needs to be established a baseline. And they 
need to be assured that in 5 years or 10 years, there is still 
a place where they can go. We look to the railroad.
    We look to the railroad to establish that fund. I have 
talked to the CEO who is testifying in just a moment. We 
believe that fund needs to be established. It needs to be large 
enough to give people the confidence they have that they are 
going to be protected in the future. Thank you so much for 
inviting me to testify, and I am very, very grateful.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. DeWine follows:]

       Prepared Statement of Hon. Mike DeWine, Governor from Ohio
    Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and Members of the 
Committee--Thank you for holding this very important hearing this 
morning and for the opportunity to testify remotely from East Palestine 
High School.
    East Palestine is a village of just over 4,700 people. The New Year 
started off normally for the people of East Palestine. They had just 
enjoyed Christmas and the annual Snowflake Festival in December. The 
3rd quarter of school started in late January, parts had been cast for 
the Spring high school musical--The Lion King Jr.--and Assistant 
Principal and Athletic Director Dwayne Pavkovich, was preparing to host 
25 to 30 teams for the Bulldog Invitational Track Meet that occurs 
every year in April.
    The evening of February 3rd, 2023, started off not unlike a lot of 
Friday nights in East Palestine. Parents and members of the community 
were gathered at the high school, cheering on the varsity boys 
basketball team at the Bulldogs home game against the United High 
School Eagles from nearby Hanoverton.
    The girls varsity team had played against the Eagles just the night 
before.
    The backdrop to all things in East Palestine is the near constant 
rumble of trains running through the village. But, the people of East 
Palestine are used to this. Many don't even notice them anymore.
    That was until 8:55pm that Friday night. Life stopped being normal 
for everyone in this community--it stopped feeling safe--when 38 cars 
of that Norfolk Southern freight train, carrying hundreds of thousands 
of pounds of hazardous materials, hurtled off the track.
    In an instant, life turned upside down.
    In the six-and-a-half weeks since the derailment, I have visited 
East Palestine a number of times and have had mothers tell me they are 
afraid to let their children play in the grass in their yards. They 
want to know when it will be safe or if it ever will be safe.
    Some have told me about their bloody noses and rashes and coughs 
they have developed, while others, who don't have symptoms now, ask 
what is going to happen to them in 10 or 15 years?
    A young mother worries about what is going to happen to her 15-
month-old baby?
    Some want to know if it is safe to plant a garden this Spring. Is 
it ok to till the soil or will that disturb toxins in the dirt? If they 
do plant a garden, will the vegetables be safe to eat? Local farmers 
are wondering about their winter wheat crops and if they will be able 
to sell to anyone come June when it is harvested.
    People in the community worry about the valuation of their 
properties. Will they ever be able to sell their homes?
    Will their small businesses stay afloat?
    Many just wonder: How are we going to return to normal?
    What is clear for all of East Palestine is that this has been a 
deeply traumatic experience for the entire community. But, while all 
the tests of the air and the soil and the water have shown repeatedly 
that things are safe, fear remains.
    What the people of East Palestine have told me is that they want 
their community back. They want things to be back to the way they were 
before the train wreck.
    Members of the Committee, Norfolk Southern has an obligation to 
restore this community. I will continue to do everything in my power to 
hold Norfolk Southern accountable. This was their train, their tracks, 
and they are responsible for this tragedy.
    In addition to the full cleanup and restoration of East Palestine, 
the railroad must do all it can to prevent similar derailments in the 
future and invest significantly in improving rail safety around the 
country.
    It is my commitment that the State of Ohio will not abandon East 
Palestine. Our state agencies arrived at the scene almost immediately--
and we remain there today.
    Less than an hour after the train derailed, the East Palestine 
Police Department requested the assistance of our Ohio Highway Patrol. 
Our troopers in the area responded immediately, followed less than an 
hour later by Patrol units from a seven-county area. They quickly began 
going door-to-door with local police and Sheriff Deputies to check on 
residents and notify them of the one-mile evacuation zone.
    By 10:30pm, the Columbiana County Emergency Management Agency (EMA) 
notified the Ohio EMA, who then began to monitor the situation and 
dispatched regional coordinators to East Palestine. Throughout the 
night and all day Saturday and Sunday, the Ohio Highway Patrol had a 
Sergeant embedded in the local incident command center.
    Shortly after midnight at 12:25am on Saturday, February 4th, the 
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Emergency Response arrived 
on scene and immediately began containing the chemicals that had 
already spilled into the nearby creek. The U.S. EPA responded shortly 
thereafter and began monitoring the air.
    Initial reports were that nobody was injured, there was no 
significant property damage, and that the local first responders had 
the situation under control. They had decided that they were going to 
contain the fire, and let it burn itself out.
    But by late Sunday afternoon, February 5th, the situation 
significantly changed as the experts monitoring the train car noticed a 
sharp rise in the temperature of the chemicals in one of the derailed 
tankers. By Sunday evening, there was serious concern about the 
potential explosion of one of the rail cars containing vinyl chloride.
    Upon learning this, I immediately sent my Director of the 
Department of Public Safety, Andy Wilson, to East Palestine to assist 
with the coordination of state emergency response. I also activated the 
Ohio National Guard and ordered the Ohio Highway Patrol to help with 
evacuations and knock on every door in the evacuation zone. By 8:28pm, 
an evacuation notice went out.
    Throughout the night, Troopers went house by house through the 
evacuation zone alerting every person who remained that the situation 
had changed, it was extremely dangerous, and that they should leave 
immediately. Over the course of the emergency, public safety and 
emergency responders knocked on the doors in the danger zone on four 
separate occasions in an attempt to ensure the safety of the people 
residing there.
    When the Ohio EPA officials initially arrived at the scene, they 
quickly determined that the wells supplying the Village's water were 
upstream of the derailment, and therefore, should be unaffected by the 
chemicals spilled in the derailment. In the days and weeks following, 
the Ohio EPA implemented a rigorous plan for testing the creeks. We 
know the creeks are contaminated, but we are excited to see the return 
of aquatic life which indicates that the waterways are recovering.
    Team members from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) 
arrived on scene within 24 hours of the derailment to begin surveying 
the impact on aquatic life and other wildlife in the area. As I 
indicated, it was clear that chemicals from the derailment had entered 
nearby waterways, significantly contaminating Sulphur Run and Leslie 
Run. Our ODNR team immediately began working with independent 
contractors to set up four separate survey locations where impacted 
aquatic life were identified, counted, and measured.
    Also within those first 24 hours, Ohio Department of Health (ODH) 
staff engaged with U.S. EPA and Federal partners to review and provide 
guidance on proposed community air monitoring values for the health and 
safety of residents. ODH senior leadership contacted the Columbiana 
County health commissioner to get an on the ground report and to offer 
any needed assistance.
    In the days following the derailment, it also became clear that the 
people of East Palestine were very concerned about the short-term and 
long-term effects on their health. I instructed my Department of Health 
Director, Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, and his team to work with local health 
providers, the local health district, faith-based organizations, and 
community leaders to open a clinic, where members of the East Palestine 
community could have individualized and comprehensive medical 
evaluation informed by the best state and national experts. In addition 
to physicians and nurses, the clinic has also offered behavioral health 
services on site.
    Further, they have coordinated with that patient's own primary care 
physician, if they have one, and have worked to establish a medical 
home for them if they did not. The importance of linking each patient 
back to their medical home or helping them establish a medical home is 
essential as part of a continuing journey to support each patient's 
best health over the years to come.
    The interest in the clinic has exceeded our expectations. To date, 
more than 275 patients have been seen, and while many have medical 
homes or have been established new medical homes, some have expressed 
interest in continuing with our clinic. To meet those needs, we will be 
establishing this clinic as a new primary care practice in the East 
Palestine community to better meet the comprehensive healthcare needs 
of the community. This is a long-term commitment to the health and 
vitality of the people in the East Palestine region.
    The State of Ohio's response was fast and nimble. But much more 
remains to be done.
    The community of East Palestine is not unique. There are thousands 
of villages all over America just like it. Much of the Midwest and the 
West was built around railroads. Communities grew up where the 
railroads went.
    At least 1,000 train derailments happen each year across this 
country. The next train derailment could be 10 times worse. The next 
derailment could be in your state.
    No other community should ever have to go through this. And so, 
there must be a great sense of urgency to make our railways safer. As 
you know, Federal law and regulations have preempted state authority in 
almost all areas of railroad safety and security. So, I called on 
Congress to take strong and quick action.
    I want to again thank Chairwoman Cantwell and Ranking Member Cruz 
for holding this hearing today. I also want to thank Chairman Carper 
and Ranking Member Capito of the Environment and Public Works Committee 
for the hearing they held two weeks ago. I understand that Congressman 
Johnson is holding a hearing next week and that Ohio EPA Director Vogel 
will be testifying before his subcommittee.
    I want to thank Senators Vance, Brown, Casey, Fetterman, Hawley, 
and Rubio for their bill--S. 576--the Rail Safety Act 2023. And, thank 
you to Congressman Johnson and Congresswoman Sykes for their bill--H.R. 
844--the Rail Act, and the nine additional members of the Ohio 
Congressional Delegation who support this bill.
    I agree with the changes in the law proposed in both bills and 
understand that they are very similar, with only a few differences. 
What I learned following the derailment in East Palestine is that our 
state emergency management personnel are not informed when hazardous 
materials are transported by rail unless a train meets the very 
specific definition of a ``high hazard'' train. We don't truly know how 
much hazardous material is transported on Ohio railways every day, 
month, or year.
    I thank the drafters for responding to my request to include a 
provision requiring rail carriers to provide advance notification and 
information to state emergency response officials about what they are 
transporting and for including new safety requirements and procedures 
for trains carrying hazardous materials, such as vinyl chloride.
    I urge the Senate and the House to swiftly act to effect meaningful 
change and improve the safety of our railroads.

    Chair Cantwell. Thank you, Governor. Thank you so much for 
highlighting those two details about the clinic and about the 
need that the community has to be further protected with 
resources. We will now turn to Ms. Allison.
    Thank you so much for being here. I am sorry to hear about 
your personal loss. And we very much appreciate you being 
willing to testify today. Ms. Allison.

                  STATEMENT OF MISTI ALLISON, 
                   RESIDENT OF EAST PALESTINE

    Ms. Allison. Thank you for inviting me to testify. I am 
honored to be here, but I wish it was under better 
circumstances. I am here to put a face on this disaster. This 
isn't just a political issue, it is a people issue. Everyone 
who lives in East Palestine is aware of the trains that pass 
by, but we have never really thought about them.
    Now, we can't think about anything else. We will never 
forget the night the train derailed. I could see a huge 
fireball from my driveway. It didn't seem real. Little did we 
know this was only the beginning.
    My family chose to evacuate, but many did not. None of us 
knew exactly what dangers were on that train. We now know that 
train carried multiple toxic petrochemicals. When authorities 
conducted a controlled burn, it was like a bomb went off, a 
bomb containing vinyl chloride, which releases dangerous 
chemicals.
    When burned, these chemicals never go away. Chemicals such 
as dioxins, which are not safe at any level and cause damage 
that may not show up for years. Two days later, our Government 
told us it was safe to come home. But is it safe? People and 
animals in my community are sick.
    The EPA tells us the data is fine, while independent 
researchers say that there are high levels of carcinogens all 
around us. Who do we trust? And then there is our mental 
health. The anxiety is real. My 7-year-old has asked me if he 
is going to die from living in his own home. What do I tell 
him?
    This preventable accident has put a scarlet letter on our 
town. People don't want to come here. Businesses are 
struggling. Our home values are plummeting. Even if we wanted 
to leave, we couldn't. Who would buy our homes?
    There were over a thousand train derailments last year, and 
the expansion of the petrochemical industry means that more 
trains carrying toxic chemicals will put more families at risk. 
Alan Shaw has repeatedly said that Norfolk Southern will make 
it right, but who determines what is right here?
    East Palestine residents expect meaningful relief, 
including short-and long-term health care monitoring, home 
value protection, and an actionable economic development plan, 
including the Norfolk Southern training facility placed in our 
town. As though the train derailment wasn't enough, less than 2 
weeks ago my mother lost her three-year battle with cancer.
    My mother taught me to fight for what is right, and I will 
always fight to protect the health and safety of my children, 
of your children, and of every child in America. Remember, this 
is about people. This is about a community that no one had ever 
heard of before becoming ground zero and a small town being 
destroyed overnight.
    We must have strong businesses, but I urge all of you to 
support commonsense safety regulations so this doesn't happen 
again. Together, we can make sure that East Palestine and the 
surrounding areas not only recover, but thrive, and that no 
other community experiences this tragedy.
    My mom always told me, either you find a way or you find an 
excuse. So, it is time to learn from this and move forward 
together. Let's find a way, not another excuse. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Allison follows:]

                  Prepared Statement of Misti Allison
    Thank you for inviting me to testify. I'm honored to be here, but 
wish it were under better circumstances. I'm here to put a face on this 
chemical disaster. This isn't a political issue. It is a people issue.
    Four years ago, my husband and I moved to his hometown of East 
Palestine, Ohio. We love raising our two children in Small Town 
America--where our family all lives down the road.
    Everyone who lives here is aware of the long trains that regularly 
pass by. But we've never really thought much about them. Until the 
night of February 3rd. Now, we can't think about anything else.
    We will never forget the night 38 cars of a Norfolk Southern 
freight train derailed. It erupted into a fire that released toxic 
chemicals into our air, water, and land--about a mile from my home.
    I could see a huge fireball from my driveway. It didn't seem real. 
Something was horribly wrong. Little did we know, this was only the 
beginning.
    My family chose to evacuate when a chemical smell persisted after 
the crash. But many of our neighbors did not. None of us knew exactly 
what dangers were on that train.
    But we now know that train carried multiple petrochemicals, 
including vinyl chloride, which is linked to cancers and especially 
harmful to infants and children.
    Three days later authorities released toxic chemicals from five 
tankers--in a so-called ``controlled burn.'' We watched as a huge cloud 
of black smoke overtook our village. It was like a bomb went off. We 
were all terrified. And we're even more terrified now that we know 
burning vinyl chloride can result in the release of toxic chemicals 
that never go away, including hydrogen chloride and dioxins.
    No amount of dioxins is considered safe for humans.
    And the damage caused by these chemicals may not show up for many 
years.
    On February 8th, two days later, our government told us it was 
``safe'' to come home. Within minutes, a train went through town--on 
top of highly contaminated soil that was left behind.
    But we don't know if it's really safe. Since returning home, people 
and animals are sick. The EPA is telling us the data is fine while 
independent researchers are telling us that there are high levels of 
acrolein and other cancerous chemicals around us. Who do we trust with 
these conflicting reports?
    Some of the companies testing for toxic chemicals are paid by 
Norfolk Southern. How could their findings be unbiased? They are not a 
neutral third party. How can we trust them to act in the interests of 
public safety?
    Mental health is also a huge issue right now. The anxiety is real. 
My 7-year-old son has asked me if he is going to die from being in his 
own home.
    Kids are not allowed to play on the playground because it hasn't 
been cleaned. So the kids now play a game they invented called 
``EVACUATION'' during recess. This train derailment has robbed our kids 
of their childhood, and perhaps more.
    The damage caused by Norfolk Southern's gross negligence is 
immeasurable. This preventable accident has put a scarlet letter on our 
town. People don't want to come here. Sports teams refuse to play here. 
Events won't be held here. Businesses are struggling. Our home values 
are plummeting. Even if we wanted to leave, we couldn't. Who would buy 
our homes?
    There were over a thousand train derailments last year, and the 
rapid expansion of the petrochemical industry into the Ohio River 
Valley, Texas, and Louisiana means that more trains carrying toxic 
chemicals will traveling through more communities. This puts all our 
families further at risk.
    As Senator Vance said last week, we can--and we must--have strong 
businesses. But that doesn't mean businesses should be allowed to 
reject common sense safety regulations. Americans need to be protected. 
And when these organizations fail to operate safely, they must be held 
accountable.
    Months from now, when Norfolk Southern has removed the debris, 
patted themselves on the back, and moved on from this horrendous 
disaster, my family, my friends, and my neighbors will still be living 
with the aftermath and the uncertainty.
    Alan Shaw has repeatedly said that Norfolk Southern will ``make it 
right.'' But who determines what is right in a situation like this? 
East Palestine residents expect real steps with measurable results 
including: 1. short-and long-term healthcare monitoring and assistance, 
2. home value protection, and 3. an actionable economic development 
plan to ensure our community can recover and thrives.
    As though this train derailment wasn't enough, less than two weeks 
ago, my mother lost her three-year battle with cancer.
    My mother taught me to fight for what's right. And I will always 
fight to protect the health and safety of my children . . . of your 
children . . . and of every child in America.
    That's the decision that you will be making. This is about people. 
This is about a community no one had ever heard of becoming ground zero 
and a small town being destroyed overnight.
    We ask you to support basic safety regulations so this doesn't 
happen again.
    We can never go back to our life before this disaster, but we can 
make sure that East Palestine not only recovers but thrives. And that 
no other community experiences this tragedy.
    My mom always told me, ``Either you find a way, or you find an 
excuse.''
    It's time to collectively learn from this and move forward with 
bipartisan support and the support of Norfolk Southern. Let's find a 
way. Not another excuse.
    Thank you.

    Chair Cantwell. Thank you, Ms. Allison. And unfortunately, 
in these safety accidents, we have often found that it is the 
voice of the families who come forward and help keep the focus 
on to safety and security.
    So, thank you for helping to lead this charge on this 
particular issue. We very much appreciate it. I don't know if 
anybody has any questions for these panelists here. If not, we 
will turn to the second panel.
    But maybe Ms. Allison, I just wanted to emphasize, maybe 
for you or the Governor, or actually or any of our colleagues, 
this issue of making sure that there is proper equipment in the 
community. Everybody is in agreement that we have to come up 
with something that gives proper equipment to the community in 
advance. Is that right? Governor DeWine, is that where you are?
    Mr. DeWine. Well, absolutely. I think, Madam Chair, the 
other thing that I have talked with the CEO quite extensively 
about is training. You know, in Ohio, most of our fire 
departments, particularly in our rural areas, are volunteers.
    And so, the railroad really has unique information and it 
is important that they share that information about how you 
deal with these train fires, how you deal with the train 
wrecks. As you pointed out, you know that particular night, 
they didn't know what they were fighting.
    They didn't know what they were dealing with, at least not 
for sure. So, training is very, very important. And I think, 
you know, we are making some progress in that regard. And I 
would, you know, like for all the railroads to really 
participate in that training.
    Senator Brown. Madam Chair.
    Chair Cantwell. Yes. Senator Brown, then Senator Vance.
    Senator Brown. Thank you. We are working to create a fund, 
sort of a regional fund, both for training, as Governor DeWine 
said, and for equipment. So, East Palestine has one paid 
firefighter, the chief, and about 20 volunteers, 22, I think. 
And they obviously are not going to be able to train them all 
to combat hazmat fires.
    But we want--we look at it in a regional way all over the 
State and all over the country with funding from the chemical 
companies and the railroads so that they can all descend on a 
place like East Palestine from 15, 20 minutes away with the 
right equipment and the right training.
    Chair Cantwell. Senator Vance.
    Senator Brown. Yes, I just, I forgot my manners earlier, 
Madam Chair. So, appreciate--I just wondered why we still 
hadn't, Governor DeWine, thank him for being here, and thank 
him for his leadership, and his hard work over the last six, 7 
weeks because he has done a great job. Thank you.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Well, the reason I bring this 
issue up is because we have had the same issue in the Pacific 
Northwest as it relates to oil train derailments.
    And unfortunately, they happen in communities where you 
might be dealing with a volunteer fire department, and what 
resources are there going to be in that community. So, I think 
the Committee here has to really think about how we are going 
to--what we can do to help communities be prepared in these 
incidents. Senator----
    Voice. Madam Chair----
    Chair Cantwell. Yes----
    Voice. Madam Chair----
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes, I just----
    Chair Cantwell. I just--Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes, Senator--I just wanted to thank 
Senator Brown and Vance, and the Governor, as well as Ms. 
Allison for this incredibly constructive testimony. This is--I 
can't even imagine what you have been through, Ms. Allison, and 
the fact that you are able to come forward and testify in such 
a meaningful way. We really appreciate.
    And the bill, I am on the bill. I am a strong supporter of 
it. And I just thank you for working across the aisle because 
you could actually get things done that way, so thank.
    Chair Cantwell. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank each 
of the witnesses for your testimony. It has been powerful. Ms. 
Allison, in particular, I want to thank you for your courage 
coming and speaking up. I am sorry about the loss of your mom.
    That is very difficult. And you are sharing the story of 
your young children and what they are going through, is really 
powerful and moving, and so thank you for giving voice to their 
fears, their concerns.
    Thank you also for giving voice--there are other moms from 
East Palestine who are here with you and standing with you. And 
thank you for speaking for them as well. I wanted to ask you, 
we are still relatively early in the aftermath of the 
derailment, but at least to date, are you satisfied with the 
response you have seen, number one, from the Federal 
Government, and number two, from Norfolk Southern?
    Do you feel that the families who have been impacted by 
this have received what you need, have received the 
compensation you deserve? And if you are not satisfied, what 
more do you think is needed?
    Ms. Allison. I would say there is always room for 
improvement. And this is something that at least in our 
community, we never expected it to happen here. I would say 
that there has been some response, but specifically in regards 
to Norfolk Southern, I do think there are a lot of 
opportunities for improvement, at least from a lot of the 
community members.
    And, you know, I just shared my experience, but I do have 
testimonies from about 50 other residents with me today that I 
can share with you. I was reading those last night in my hotel 
room and just tears streaming down my face. It is absolutely 
heartbreaking.
    I am a market researcher by trade, and so looking at all of 
this data in the aggregate, what I saw time and time again was 
people were saying essentially, they feel like Norfolk Southern 
is just offering breadcrumbs throughout the community with 
funding.
    And then, so right now, for people that don't feel safe at 
home, we did receive a flyer that said that you could leave the 
community for the time being if you wanted to re-evacuate, and 
some people have chosen to do that.
    However, there is not clear guidelines of what is going to 
be paid for and what is not. And so, when people go to the 
assistance center, some people are having a good experience and 
then some people are really being questioned about why do you 
feel like you should leave? Why do you feel like you need this 
money from us and really feeling interrogated, and so that is 
really concerning because I think a lot more data needs to come 
out.
    This testing that the EPA finally said that they are, you 
know, testing for dioxins, et cetera, that is really good, but 
there is so much data that needs to come out there. And again, 
you can--a couple of things, one, you can make the data look 
however you want, and also two, you can test or not test for 
whatever you want.
    So, I think from a community perspective, we just want to 
make sure that everything is being tested, that should be 
tested, and we are not really sure if that is being done or 
not. So, I would say, we are just really--everybody loves 
living in East Palestine and we would like to stay there, but 
only if it is safe.
    And so, there is a lot of confusion in the community about 
whether long term, if it is a good choice to stay or not.
    Senator Cruz. Well, I am certain with you mentioned the 50 
statements you had, I am certain that the Chair would love to 
have you submit those statements for the record for the 
Committee. And I am sure members on both sides of the aisle 
would like to see those statements.
    One of the things you testified about is the concerns about 
the drop in home values. And I can understand that being a very 
real concern. You mentioned you have done work as a market 
researcher. Are there any data that are actually quantifying 
what the loss in home values has been?
    And if so, at this point, are the residents being offered 
any compensation? Is Norfolk Southern offering to make 
residents whole for the loss in home values? If a resident, if 
a family decides that they want to move, are families able to 
sell their homes? Are there any buyers, or I mean--one of the 
things you said powerfully is, even if we want to leave, we 
can't leave.
    That--is there any relief being offered now to say, if you 
make the decision to move your home and to move your family 
somewhere else, there is an avenue for you to sell your home 
and get a fair market price for it?
    Ms. Allison. The short answer is, as of today, no, there is 
not a clear-cut explanation or parameters of how you would do 
that. We have heard time and time again from Norfolk Southern 
that they are going to make it right and that they are looking 
into some long-term health care monitoring and assistance and 
home value protection. But details of that plan have not been 
disclosed to residents as of today.
    Senator Cruz. I would encourage that for you to let this 
committee know as it goes forward, if there are residents who 
are looking to move and can't sell their homes, this committee 
is very interested in making sure that the community of East 
Palestine is treated fairly and that what you are going 
through--you receive what is just. And so, we--I would invite 
you to provide this committee with the specifics so that we can 
expedite and facilitate making it right.
    Ms. Allison. Thank you.
    Chair Cantwell. We are going to get to the second panel, 
but Senator Welch, did you have a question?

                STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT

    Senator Welch. Yes, just briefly. This is really very 
moving. You know, listening to Ms. Allison, small communities 
have something that is really very, very special. It is trust, 
you trust one another.
    And there has been a breach of trust here. One of the 
biggest beneficiaries of the trust in a community like yours, 
and we have many like yours in Vermont, one of the biggest 
beneficiaries is Norfolk Southern. They can roll their two-to-
three-mile trains through there without anybody asking a 
question because you trust them to do the right thing. And they 
didn't do the right thing.
    And they had the opportunity to do the right thing, but 
they made other priorities, stock buybacks in the billions, 
shortening crews, doing the things that a mom would never do to 
take a shortcut to provide that security like to your 7-year-
old.
    And the heart of the discussion here is whether, as a 
result of the breach of trust by a very large and very 
powerful, very wealthy corporation, your Government, and it is 
your Government, should step in to restore justice to you and 
your fellow citizens. And that is what this hearing is about.
    Will Government step up to provide physical, emotional, and 
health security as a result of this, just like it would if 
there was a military threat to our country where Government is 
got to be on the side of folks like you and your neighbors. So, 
I am very grateful to you. Feel very badly at that breach of 
trust.
    Because you know that trust gets you through hard times. 
You don't even complain because you know your neighbor has got 
your back. Well, you have to know the Government has got your 
back. We admire you.
    This is going to go on for some time, as Governor DeWine 
said. But I think all of us in this legislation are going to do 
our level best to respond to you and your neighbors and what 
you are going through. Thank you.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Welch. And again, thank 
you to our colleagues, to Governor DeWine, to Ms. Allison. 
Thank you for a very compelling testimony. We will now move to 
the second panel.
    We are going to hear from Jennifer Homendy, the Chair of 
the National Transportation Safety Board. We will hear from 
David Comstock, Fire Chief of Ohio's Western Reserve, joined 
Fire District, whose department responded to East Feldstein's 
derailment. We will hear from Mr. Clyde Whitaker, the 
Legislative Director of Ohio State Smart-TD, who is a long-time 
railroader.
    Mr. Alan Shaw, CEO of Norfolk Southern. And last, we will 
hear from Ian Jefferies, CEO of the Association of American 
Railroads, who represents the railroad sector. If all of those 
witnesses would come forward and we will start in a minute with 
Ms. Homendy from the NTSB. Welcome to all the witnesses.
    We appreciate you being here. Look forward to hearing--look 
forward to hearing your testimony. If the--we will start with 
you, Ms. Homendy. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for 
being here. We appreciate all the work that the NTSB does.
    I expressed to you earlier in private your leadership in 
the investigation of the seaplane accident in the Pacific 
Northwest, and we continue to look forward to your comments on 
aviation in general.
    We appreciated your comments prior to the aviation summit 
last week about the fact that the FAA needs to implement its 
open action items that will help us on near-miss incidents at 
airports.
    So, thank you for your continued voice. I think when we 
envisioned the safety legislation that we passed, we wanted to 
know trends and we wanted FAA to respond faster to trends. So, 
thank you for helping to identify these trends in aviation and 
some of the issues.
    So, with that, we will turn to you, Ms. Homendy, for this 
hearing on rail safety.

    STATEMENT OF HON. JENNIFER L. HOMENDY, CHAIR, NATIONAL 
                  TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD

    Ms. Homendy. Thank you so much, and good morning. I would 
like to begin with addressing the people who were impacted by 
the derailment in East Palestine. On behalf of the NTSB, we are 
so sorry for all that you are going through. Please know that 
the agency is committed to conducting a thorough, independent, 
and transparent investigation of this derailment.
    We will issue safety recommendations to prevent similar 
tragedies from reoccurring, including urgent safety 
recommendations, which we can do at any point if our 
investigation warrants it. In the next few months, we will hold 
an investigative hearing in East Palestine, where it will 
include time for community members to provide comments and ask 
us questions about our investigation.
    My written testimony goes into more detail on the 
derailment, and by now the preliminary facts have been well 
covered. The bottom line is this, there are no accidents. This 
derailment, as all accidents we investigate, was 100 percent 
preventable. As is the case with all our investigations, we are 
looking into every factor that could have led to this tragedy.
    We are looking into the wheel bearing, the wheels sets, the 
axle, and the rail car, including their manufacture, 
maintenance, and inspection, the hot bearing detectors, Norfolk 
Southern temperature thresholds for alerting train crews of 
safety concerns, and their use of real time monitoring and data 
trending, and the company's policies, practices, and overall 
safety culture.
    We are also looking into the design, maintenance, and 
performance of the tank cars used to transport hazmat, 
including the pressure relief devices on the five vinyl 
chloride tank cars, emergency response preparedness and 
communications, the decisionmaking process that led to the vent 
and burn, the U.S. Department of Transportation's oversight of 
rail and hazmat safety, and so much more. I know that there are 
a lot of questions about our investigation, and I will provide 
what I can today.
    I also know that Congress is eager to improve rail safety 
more broadly, so I offer the following five issues for your 
consideration. First, the definition of high hazard flammable 
terrain should be expanded to a broader array of hazmat.
    And the definitions threshold of 20 loaded tank cars in a 
continuous block or 35 tank cars dispersed throughout a train 
should be eliminated. Second DOT 111 should be phased out of 
all hazmat service.
    They are not as protected as DOT 117 tank cars. Third, 
people deserve to know what chemicals are moving through their 
communities and how to stay safe in an emergency. That includes 
responders who risk their lives for each of us every single 
day. They deserve to be prepared.
    That means access to real time information, obtaining the 
right training and gear, and having the right communications 
and planning tools. Fourth, like cockpit voice recorders in 
aviation, audio and video recorders in the locomotive cab are 
essential for helping investigators determine the cause of an 
accident and make more precise safety recommendations. 
Recorders also help operators proactively improve their safety 
policies and practices.
    In the East Palestine derailment, the locomotive was 
equipped with an inward facing camera. However, since the 
locomotive was put immediately back into service following the 
accident, the data was overwritten.
    That means the recorder only provided about 15 minutes of 
data before the derailment and 5 minutes after. The FAST Act, 
following terrible tragedies in Chatsworth and in Philadelphia, 
required Amtrak and commuter railroads to maintain crash and 
fire hardened, inward and outward facing image recorders in all 
controlling locomotives that have a minimum of a 12-hour 
continuous recording capability.
    This was extremely helpful in our DuPont, Washington 
investigation. Now is the time to expand that requirement to 
audio and include the class I freight railroads in that 
mandate. In fact, now is the time to address all of the NTSB's 
open rail safety recommendations, many of which are on our most 
wanted list.
    Fifth, and finally, as the Committee works on enhancing 
rail safety, I trust that you will consider the resources that 
we desperately need to carry out our critical safety mission. 
Investments in the NTSB are investments in safety across all 
modes of transportation.
    To that end, we look forward to working with the Committee 
on this year's reauthorization of NTSB, and hope that you will 
approve the President's budget request for the NTSB of $145 
million. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Homendy follows:]

        Prepared Statement of Hon. Jennifer L. Homendy, Chair, 
                  National Transportation Safety Board
    Good morning, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of 
the Committee. Thank you for inviting the National Transportation 
Safety Board (NTSB) to testify on improving rail safety in the 
aftermath of the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) freight train derailment 
and the subsequent release of hazardous materials in East Palestine, 
Ohio.
    As you know, the NTSB is an independent Federal agency charged by 
Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United 
States and significant events in other modes of transportation--
railroad, transit, highway, marine, pipeline, and commercial space. We 
determine the probable cause of the accidents and events we investigate 
and issue safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents 
and events. In addition, we conduct transportation safety research 
studies and offer information and other assistanceto family members and 
survivors for any accident investigated by the agency. We also serve as 
the appellate authority for enforcement actions involving aviation and 
mariner certificates issued by the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) and the United States Coast Guard, and adjudicate appeals of 
civil penalty actions taken by the FAA.
    The NTSB does not have authority to promulgate operating standards, 
nor do we certificate organizations, individuals, or equipment. 
Instead, we advance transportation safety through our recommendations, 
which are issued to any entity that can improve safety. Our goal is to 
identify issues and advocate for safety improvements that, if 
implemented, would prevent tragedies and injuries and save lives.
    First and foremost, I want to thank each of you for your 
partnership with the NTSB to improve safety across all modes of 
transportation, including rail safety. I commit to you, the people of 
East Palestine, and all others who were affected in Ohio, Pennsylvania, 
and West Virginia, that the NTSB will conduct a thorough, independent, 
and transparent investigation into how this event occurred. We will 
examine the derailment, fire, hazardous materials release, and the 
emergency response in the hours and days after the derailment, and we 
will make recommendations that, if acted on, will prevent other 
communities from suffering a similar tragedy.
    Despite recent accidents, I want to be clear that rail remains one 
of the safest means of transportation. For transport of some classes 
and quantities of hazardous materials, there is no safer alternative. 
Certainly, carrying them over our Nation's roadways where more than 
43,000 people die every year in millions of crashes is not a safer 
alternative. Moreover, such small quantities of hazardous materials 
shipped by rail may not be economically feasible for pipeline operators 
to ship.
    For communities that are impacted by rail accidents, particularly 
involving hazardous materials, I know that is little consolation as 
just one derailment, as we have seen in East Palestine, can be 
devastating. I also want to be clear that there is work that can be 
done to further improve rail safety, related to East Palestine and 
aside from our investigation. The NTSB has over 180 rail safety 
recommendations that are currently open.\1\ These include 5 
recommendations to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), 80 
recommendations to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), and 9 
recommendations to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration (PHMSA). The safety issues we see in our investigations 
are tragic because they are preventable, and therefore should be acted 
on.

The Derailment
    Our preliminary report on the derailment, issued on February 23, 
2023, summarizes the factual information that was collected during the 
on-scene portion of our investigation.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ National Transportation Safety Board. Norfolk Southern Railway 
Train Derailment with Subsequent Hazardous Material Release and Fires, 
East Palestine, Ohio, February 3, 2023 (Preliminary Report: February 
23, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On Friday, February 3, 2023, NS freight train 32N, comprised of two 
head-end locomotives, 149 railcars, and 1 distributed power locomotive, 
was traveling east on the Fort Wayne Line of the Keystone Division. The 
consist included 20 placarded hazardous materials tank cars 
transporting combustible liquids, flammable liquids, and flammable gas, 
including vinyl chloride; 17 of these were fully loaded, 3 were residue 
cars. The train crew consisted of an engineer, conductor, and conductor 
trainee.
    NS had equipped its rail network on that line with hot bearing 
detectors (HBDs) to assess the temperature conditions of wheel bearings 
while trains are en route. When the HBD detects overheated bearings, it 
provides an audible, real-time warning to train crews. According to 
NS's criteria, a reading above 200+F triggers a critical alert.
    Train 32N passed three HBD systems in the last 30 miles before the 
derailment. About 30 miles before the derailment, a wheel bearing from 
the 23rd car was recorded at 38+F above ambient temperature (about 10+F 
at the time). When the train passed the next HBD about 10 miles later, 
the bearing's recorded temperature was 103+F above ambient temperature. 
The third HBD, about 20 miles later, recorded the bearing's temperature 
at 253+F above ambient temperature and sent a critical alert to the 
crew to stop the train and inspect the axle.
    At the time, the engineer was already slowing the train because 
there was another train ahead. Once the critical alert was received, he 
increased the brake application to further slow and stop the train. 
During the deceleration, the wheel bearing on the 23rd car failed and 
the car derailed, resulting in an emergency brake application stopping 
the train. After the train stopped, the crew observed fire and smoke, 
and reported a possible derailment to the NS train dispatcher. 
Responders arrived at the derailment site and began response efforts.
    A total of 38 railcars derailed, 11 of which were carrying 
hazardous materials. The combination of the plastic pellets in the 23rd 
car and the hot axle of that car likely started the initial fire. First 
responders implemented a 1-mile evacuation zone surrounding the 
derailment site, affecting up to 2,000 residents.
    On February 5, responders mitigated the fire, but five derailed 
tank cars, carrying a total of 115,580 gallons of vinyl chloride, 
continued to concern authorities. The temperature inside one tank car 
was still rising, which suggested that the vinyl chloride was 
undergoing polymerization, a chemical chain reaction that could pose an 
explosion hazard. Responders scheduled a controlled venting of the five 
vinyl chloride tank cars to release and burn the vinyl chloride. They 
expanded the evacuation zone to a 1-mile by 2-mile area and dug ditches 
to contain released vinyl chloride liquid while it vaporized and 
burned. The controlled venting began about 4:40 p.m. on February 6 and 
continued for several hours. The NTSB had no role in the decision to 
vent and burn the five vinyl chloride tank cars; however, we will 
evaluate that decision and the process for carrying out the vent and 
burn in our investigation.
NTSB's Response and Investigation
    Each of the NTSB's investigative offices assigns a duty officer who 
is on call 24/7 to receive notifications of accidents and incidents, 
gather pertinent information, and make a recommendation as to whether 
the event meets the criteria for launching an investigation. The duty 
officer for the NTSB's Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous 
Materials Investigations (RPH) was first contacted about the derailment 
on February 3 at about 10:00 p.m. and began collecting initial 
information, including contacting NS. At 10:53 p.m., the National 
Response Center (NRC) received a report on the derailment.\3\ At 11:16 
p.m., the NRC formally notified the NTSB's Response Operations Center 
of the derailment. From the time of notification and throughout the 
night, NTSB staff worked to collect and assess information from 
industry, labor, emergency responders, and others on the scene to 
determine whether to launch an investigation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ The NRC is staffed by the U.S. Coast Guard and serves as an 
emergency call center that fields initial reports for pollution and 
railroad incidents and forwards that information to the appropriate 
Federal or state agencies for response.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At about 12:00 a.m., the RPH duty officer, having obtained 
sufficient information, informed the director of RPH, who, by 
regulation, is authorized to initiate an investigation.\4\ RPH notified 
NS, the FRA, and the railroad unions that the NTSB would be 
investigating. This notification to NS also served as an order to 
preserve evidence.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ See Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.25(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Following these calls, the RPH director requested a call with 
agency leadership to discuss whether a Board member should launch to 
the accident, as well as to determine any additional resource needs. 
Board members are typically launched on major investigations and act as 
the spokesperson on scene. At 7:15 a.m., the determination was made to 
launch the on-duty Board member, Michael Graham, and a full ``go-team'' 
of 14 NTSB staff members. Member Graham and the initial responding 
staff departed at 11:30 a.m. and began arriving in East Palestine at 
1:30 p.m.
    While on scene, investigators examined railroad equipment and track 
conditions; reviewed data from the signal system, wayside defect 
detectors (including the HBDs), local surveillance cameras, and the 
lead locomotive's event recorder and forward-and inward-facing image 
recorders; and conducted interviews. The wheel bearing and affected 
wheelset from the 23rd car have been collected as evidence and will be 
examined in our laboratories in Washington, DC.
    Investigators returned to Ohio on February 21 to examine each 
hazardous material tank car, document damage, and secure evidence for 
laboratory analysis. The vinyl chloride tank car top fittings, 
including the pressure relief devices (PRDs), were examined on scene. 
The top fittings were shipped to Texas for testing under the 
supervision, direction, and oversight of the NTSB.
    Testing of the PRDs and angle valves was carried out the week of 
March 13. The testing was intended to determine if the valves still 
function in the as-received condition and to what level; document any 
foreign matter fouling, and document what fire/heat damage occurred 
with photographs and test forms on condition. Following testing, the 
valves and PRDs were disassembled, and the conditions of the parts were 
documented and photographed. Investigators found that further 
metallurgical testing of the PRDs and valves, including valve stems, is 
warranted to evaluate their performance and compatibility with the 
vinyl chloride lading. This testing will be conducted at the NTSB's 
laboratory.
    While on scene, Member Graham hosted two press briefings to provide 
updates regarding the status of our investigation: one on February 4 
and another on February 5. The briefings, additional videos of the 
scene, and all investigative updates are available on our website.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For the on-scene and continued fact-finding phase of this 
investigation, we have designated regulators, the carrier, shippers, 
manufacturers, workers, and first responders with relevant information 
as parties to the investigation. These parties provide the agency with 
technical expertise. This party system process has been our practice 
for decades because it is the most effective way to investigate major 
transportation accidents. The party system also ensures that the 
appropriate regulatory agencies and the parties whose products or 
services were involved in the accident or incident will have access to 
factual information, so they can initiate any necessary safety actions 
without delay. For this investigation, the parties are the PHMSA; the 
FRA; the Ohio State Highway Patrol; the Village of East Palestine; NS; 
Trinity Industries Leasing Company; the GATX Corporation; Midland 
Manufacturing; Occidental Chemicals, the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen; 
the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and 
Transportation Workers; the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and 
Trainmen; and the International Association of Firefighters.
    Our investigation is ongoing. Future investigative activity will 
focus on the wheelset and bearing; tank car design and derailment 
damage; performance of PRDs and other valves; a review of the accident 
response, including the venting and burning of the vinyl chloride; 
railcar design and maintenance procedures and practices; NS's use of 
wayside defect detectors; and NS's railcar inspection practices.
Investigative Hearing
    To support our investigation, we plan to hold an investigative 
field hearing in East Palestine in June. NTSB's investigative hearings 
have four goals: to inform the public, to collect factual information 
from witnesses, to discuss possible solutions, and to build consensus 
for change. An investigative hearing will allow us to gather sworn 
testimony from witnesses on issues identified by the investigative team 
for this accident. The hearing will be wholly fact-finding in nature 
and open to the public; it will be preceded by a town hall for the 
public to provide comments to the NTSB.
Special Investigation into Norfolk Southern Railway's Safety Practices 
        and Culture
    On March 7, we announced a special investigation of NS's 
organization and safety culture. Given the number and significance of 
recent NS accidents, we also urged the company to take immediate action 
to review and assess its safety practices, with the input of employees 
and others, and implement necessary changes to improve safety. We are 
undertaking this special investigation because, since December 2021, we 
have launched investigation teams to six significant accidents 
involving NS. We are concerned that several organizational factors may 
be involved in the accidents, including safety culture.
    The NTSB has long recommended the implementation of safety 
management systems (SMS) in all modes of transportation. SMS is a 
systematic approach to managing safety, including the necessary 
organizational structures, accountabilities, policies, and procedures. 
An effective SMS program can help companies reduce and prevent 
accidents and accident-related loss of lives, time, and resources. 
Currently, there are a number of industry sectors worldwide that have 
recognized the benefits of effective safety management, including 
aviation and the maritime and pipeline communities.
    The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-432) required 
each Class I railroad to develop and implement a risk reduction 
program. In 2012, we recommended that FRA require that SMS and the 
associated key principles (including top-down ownership and policies, 
analysis of operational incidents and accidents, hazard identification 
and risk management, prevention and mitigation programs, and continuous 
evaluation and improvement programs) be incorporated into railroads' 
risk reduction programs.\6\ FRA issued the Risk Reduction Program (RRP) 
final rule on February 18, 2020, which includes the key principles 
recommended. We have since recommended that the FRA review all 
railroads' RRP plans to ensure effectiveness and safety. Safety 
Recommendation R-12-3 is currently classified as ``Open--Acceptable 
Response.'' However, to date, no RRPs have yet been approved by FRA and 
implemented by the freight railroads. The NS derailments may provide a 
good opportunity for FRA to do so, as the recommendation remains open.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ NTSB Safety Recommendation R-12-3.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Continued Issues in Rail Safety
    Although this investigation is ongoing, we have identified issues 
in several areas where the NTSB has previously made recommendations to 
improve safety.
Rail Tank Car Safety
    Rail tank cars are built to certain DOT or industry 
specifications.\7\ DOT-111 tank cars are non-pressurized tank cars with 
a thinner shell (7/16 in.) than is now required for DOT-117 tank cars 
(9/16 in.). These tank cars can carry both hazardous and non-hazardous 
liquids. DOT-111s are not required to have head shields to protect the 
tank car from an adjacent car in an incident. The top fittings and 
valves are not protected and are vulnerable to being sheared off in an 
incident, leading to a release of contents. These tank cars also do not 
have a pressure relief device sized to protect against rupture in the 
event of a large fire. DOT-111s do have pressure relief valves that 
offer some protection in some fires.\8\

    \8\ Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Fleet Composition of Rail 
Tank Cars Carrying Flammable Liquids: 2022 Report. Washington, DC: DOT. 
Accessed March 20, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act (P.L. 114-
94) phased out legacy DOT-111 specification tank cars for transporting 
Class 3 flammable liquids, such as crude oil, and the cars continue 
phasing out service for certain other commodities, such as ethanol. By 
May 1, 2023, nonjacketed and jacketed DOT-111 tank cars must be phased 
out; nonjacketed CPC-1232 tank cars must be phased out by July 1, 2023; 
and jacketed CPC-1232 tank cars must be removed or retrofitted by May 
1, 2025. Each of those tank cars must be either removed from flammable 
liquids service or retrofitted with prescribed protective features, 
such as a head shield, jacket, and thermal protection. Other flammable 
liquids may not be transported in such tank cars beginning May 1, 2029.
    In the East Palestine derailment, 13 of the 16 DOT-111s 
transporting hazmat that were damaged are not covered under the current 
DOT phaseout schedule. One of the three cars that would be covered by 
the current 2029 deadline breached. The other 13 DOT-111 cars sustained 
damage we've noted in other accident investigations but would not be 
covered under the FAST Act or DOT's final rule.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ 81 FR 53935.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The NTSB has pointed out the inadequacy of DOT-111 tank cars for 
all hazardous materials, including flammable materials, since 1991, and 
we recommended they be replaced or retrofit in 2015.\10\ The NTSB 
supports a shorter timeline to transition away from DOT-111s than what 
is currently in statute and regulation. Additionally, Congress should 
consider transitioning all other DOT-111s out of hazmat service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ Safety Recommendations R-15-16 and -17.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The five derailed railcars carrying vinyl chloride were DOT-105 
specification tank cars, which are used to transport liquified 
compressed gases, poison/toxic inhalation hazard materials, reactive 
materials, and/or corrosive materials requiring additional protection. 
None of these cars were breached in the derailment. However, we are 
currently evaluating the performance of the PRDs and valves.
    When a tank car is exposed to fire conditions and its contents are 
heated, the pressure inside the tank rises. This can lead to loss of 
tank shell strength and eventually a breach. To protect emergency 
responders and the public from the possibility of catastrophic tank 
failure under fire conditions, the pressure inside tank cars must be 
controlled. PRDs are intended to regulate internal pressure by 
releasing material and reclosing after normal conditions are restored. 
This reduces the probability of a breach in the tank shell and limits 
the amount of energy a breach can release if one occurs. Properly 
functioning PRDs thus reduce the potential for catastrophic tank 
failure.
Notification to Emergency Responders
    Emergency responders must have real-time awareness of and 
information on the hazardous materials being transported by rail 
through their communities so that they are well prepared should an 
accident occur. We first made this recommendation 16 years ago.\11\ 
Additionally, 9 years ago we recommended that railroads should help 
communities develop emergency operations and response plans.\12\ The 
FAST Act also addressed this issue in 2015, but limited emergency 
responder awareness of and information on hazardous materials being 
transported by rail to high-hazard flammable trains (HHFTs), defined as 
a single train transporting 20 or more tank cars loaded with a Class 3 
flammable liquid in a continuous block (a unit train) or a single train 
transporting 35 or more tank cars loaded with a Class 3 flammable 
liquid throughout the train consist.\13\ Although PHMSA and the DOT 
have taken some actions, we remain concerned that emergency responders 
are not adequately made aware of hazardous materials traveling through 
their locations, and that current rules do not include a vast number of 
hazardous materials beyond combustible liquids.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ NTSB Safety Recommendation R-07-4.
    \12\ NTSB Safety Recommendation R-14-14. Additional materials 
railroads should help responders plan for include highly hazardous 
gases (flammable, nonflammable, and toxic), other flammable liquids and 
substances, oxidizing substances, toxic substances, and corrosive 
materials.
    \13\ Public Law 114-94, sec. 7302.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The train in the East Palestine derailment was not a HHFT because 
it did not contain a block of 20 or more than 35 total loaded tank cars 
of a Class 3 flammable liquid.\14\ We believe the definition of an HHFT 
should include a broad range of hazardous materials, including 
flammable gases and combustible liquids.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ 49 CFR Sec. 171.8.
    \15\ NTSB comments on PHMSA's notice of proposed rulemaking, 
``Hazardous Materials: Rail Petitions and Recommendations to Improve 
the Safety of Railroad Tank Car Transportation.'' (2014)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We also believe that even one railcar of any hazardous material 
justifies notifying emergency responders, not 20 or more than 35 loaded 
tank cars, which could contain 1 million gallons of hazardous 
materials. Such thresholds present an unreasonable risk to public 
safety as a catastrophic derailment involving even a single tank car 
loaded with hazardous material can cause extensive destruction and loss 
of life. Therefore, we believe that the notification threshold should 
be significantly lower. In addition, the threshold should be based on 
the worst-case consequences of a derailment resulting in fire.
Recorders
    Recorders--data, audio/voice, and video--are essential for 
capturing and storing critical information that can help investigators 
determine the cause of a transportation accident. Inward-and outward-
facing recorders with both image and audio capabilities can increase 
the understanding of the circumstances of an accident, and, ultimately, 
provide greater precision in safety recommendations and subsequent 
safety improvements.
    In the East Palestine accident, the locomotive was equipped with an 
inward-and forward-facing recorder. However, since NS put the 
locomotive immediately back in service following the accident, data was 
overwritten and only provide about 15 minutes of data before and 5 
minutes following the derailment.
    We use recorder data to determine the probable cause of accidents 
and to develop recommendations to help prevent future accidents. For 
example, after the December 18, 2017, derailment of National Railroad 
Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) train 501 in Dupont, Washington, 
investigators used event recorder data to derive the engineer's actions 
prior to the crash.\16\ Because of Amtrak 501's inward-facing video and 
audio, investigators were able to determine that brief conversations 
between the engineer and the conductor during the trip did not distract 
them from their operational duties. This accident has demonstrated the 
value of image and audio data for the accident investigation and 
development of safety recommendations.

    In contrast, during our investigation of the August 12, 2019, 
collision between two CSX trains in Carey, Ohio, our investigators did 
not have important information to assist in understanding what happened 
in this collision due to the lack of inward-facing video and audio 
recorders.\17\ Because the FRA has not required inward-facing cameras 
for freight locomotives, the NTSB was unable to determine the actions 
of the westbound train's crewmembers while operating the train from 
Columbus, Ohio, to Carey, Ohio, the actions of the westbound train 
engineer while operating alone in the locomotive cab, or the events 
leading up to the collision.

    The FAST Act required railroads providing regularly scheduled 
intercity rail passenger or commuter rail passenger transportation to 
the public to install inward-and outward-facing image recording devices 
in all controlling locomotive cabs and cab car operating compartments 
in passenger trains. However, the law did not require freight railroads 
to install such devices. In 2010, we recommended that the FRA require 
the installation, in all controlling locomotive cabs and cab car 
operating compartments, of crash-and fire-protected inward-and outward-
facing audio and image recorders capable of providing recordings to 
verify that train crew actions are in accordance with rules and 
procedures that are essential to safety as well as train conditions. 
The devices should have a minimum 12-hour continuous recording 
capability with recordings that are easily accessible for review, with 
appropriate limitations on public release, for the investigation of 
accidents or for use by management in carrying out efficiency testing 
and systemwide performance monitoring programs.\18\ The recommendation 
to FRA is currently classified as ``Open--Unacceptable Response.''

    In the 13 years since this recommendation was issued, we have 
reiterated it in the six other major railroad investigations:

        freight trains near Two Harbors, Minnesota;

Rail Worker Safety
    Improving Rail Worker Safety is one of the issues highlighted in 
our 2021-2023 Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety 
Improvements.\19\ Improving rail worker safety means making sure that 
roadway workers have the training, equipment, rest, and layers of 
protection they need while working on or around tracks. It means making 
sure that crews operating trains carrying hazardous materials have time 
to escape in case of an accident. It also means reducing the risks of 
derailments and collisions as trains become longer and heavier.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ National Transportation Safety Board. 2021-2023 Most Wanted 
List of Transportation Safety Improvements. Washington, DC: NTSB.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In recent years, we have investigated several railroad and transit 
accidents where workers have been struck and injured or killed while 
conducting routine maintenance or switching operations. Other workers 
are vulnerable when cars carrying hazardous materials are too close to 
those carrying train crew. We have also investigated accidents where 
crew have been killed riding on the sides of trains, in violation of 
rules.
    On December 8, 2021, an employee for National Salvage and Service 
Corporation assigned to work with a NS work gang replacing track was 
killed when the operator of a spike machine reversed direction and 
struck the employee in Reed, Pennsylvania. The employee was marking 
rail to be removed and collected by the NS work gang when he was 
struck.
    On December 13, 2022, NS trainee conductor was killed, and another 
conductor injured, when their locomotive struck a length of steel angle 
iron protruding from a gondola car on a NS freight train that was 
stopped on an adjacent main track in Bessemer, Alabama. The angle iron 
originally welded to the gondola's top-right edge was broken and 
hanging loose. As the locomotive approached the gondola car, it 
collided with the angle iron which then pierced the locomotive's left 
front door window, continued into the operating cab, and struck both 
conductors.
    On March 7, 2023, a NS conductor was killed when the train he was 
riding collided with a dump truck as they simultaneously entered a 
private highway-railroad grade crossing in the Cleveland-Cliffs 
Incorporated steel plant in Cleveland, Ohio. The conductor was riding 
on the end platform of the lead railcar during a shoving movement when 
he was pinned between the railcar and the dump truck during the 
collision.
    These three investigations are currently ongoing and will be part 
of our special investigation of NS' organization and safety culture.
    Although rail worker fatalities have declined overall in recent 
years, we continue to see recurring safety issues in our accident 
investigations that are 100 percent preventable, highlighting the need 
to implement our safety recommendations for better worker 
protections.\20\

NTSB's Mandate and Resources
    The NTSB's authorization expired at the end of last Fiscal Year. As 
you know, we have sent Congress a reauthorization proposal that 
requests resources and hiring flexibility to increase the number of 
investigators in our Rail, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials 
Investigations office, as well as in our other modes.\21\ These 
resources will allow us to hire professionals with the needed skills, 
purchase the equipment necessary for those skilled professionals to do 
their jobs, and invest in staff training and development. Our workforce 
is our greatest asset and is essential to our mission.

of 2023. Washington, DC: NTSB.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The NTSB is required to investigate any railroad accident in which 
there is a fatality or substantial property damage, or that involves a 
passenger train.\22\ We must currently meet this mandate with only 12 
railroad investigators, 3 of whom are eligible for retirement, and 3 
hazardous materials investigators. Those investigators are currently 
working on 28 investigations, and we open about 11 new investigations 
each year. This office is understaffed. In fact, as part of our

Conclusion
    The NTSB was on the ground in East Palestine on the first day 
following the derailment, and we are committed to finding out what 
happened, how it happened, and how to make sure that it never happens 
again.
    The NTSB stands ready to work with the Committee to continue 
improving rail safety. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify 
today. I am happy to answer your questions.

    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Ms. Homendy. Thank you so much. 
Mr. Comstock, welcome. Thank you for being here.

STATEMENT OF DAVID COMSTOCK, CHIEF, OHIO WESTERN RESERVE JOINT 
                         FIRE DISTRICT

    Mr. Comstock. Good morning, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Cruz, distinguished members of the Committee. My name is David 
Comstock and I am the Fire Chief for the Western Reserve Joint 
Fire District, located in Poland, Ohio.
    I am also a member of a National Volunteer Fire Council, a 
nonprofit membership organization that serves as the national 
voice of over 670,000 volunteer firefighters, comprising 65 
percent of the Nation's fire service.
    My department was one of over 50 fire departments that 
responded to the East Palestine derailment. This incident has 
emphasized the need to better train and equip firefighters to 
respond to hazardous material incidents, specifically to 
derailments in rural areas which are mostly served by volunteer 
fire departments that often lack sufficient resources, tax 
base, and manpower.
    The National Fire Protection Association defines an 
operational level of competence for hazmat response as what is 
needed for a firefighter to implement or support actions to 
protect the public from the effects of a hazmat release.
    Alarmingly, the NFPA's needs assessment of the U.S. Fire 
Service showed that only 55 percent of firefighters are 
certified at a hazmat operational level of confidence. For many 
firefighters, hazmat training is difficult to access, 
especially from volunteers who may need to take time off from 
their paying jobs.
    Progress has been made in making hazardous material 
training more available to firefighters through the pipeline 
and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration's hazardous 
material grants.
    Specifically, firefighters are trained through hazardous 
materials emergency preparedness, assistance for local 
emergency response training, hazardous materials structure 
training, community safety, and supplemental public safety 
training grant programs.
    Through a SPST grant and the NBFC is offering 15 in-person 
hazmat train the trainer opportunities across the U.S. at no 
cost to departments. It is important that the NBFC can provide 
this program at no cost to volunteer departments, which often 
lack a tax base to support training.
    Thanks to the FMCSA agreements I mentioned earlier, the 
NBFC and other first responder organizations have been able to 
train tens of thousands of firefighters. The NBFC asked that 
Congress pass legislation to increase funding to these FMCSA 
hazardous material training grant.
    The NBFC is pleased to see that S. 576, Railways Safety Act 
of 2023, includes language that increases support to the alert 
and supplemental training grant programs. The Federal Emergency 
Management agency's assistance to firefighter grants and 
staffing for adequate fire and emergency response grants is 
also critical to fire departments.
    The goal of these grants is to bring all fire departments 
up to a baseline level of readiness. Many departments struggle 
to achieve this baseline. In alarming examples, NFPA data 
showing that 53 percent of fire departments cannot equip every 
firefighter with self-contained breathing apparatus.
    The NBFC request that Congress increase funding to AFG and 
safer grant programs and pass S. 870, Grants and Safety Act, as 
soon as possible to ensure the authorization for these critical 
grants doesn't lapse at the end of this Fiscal Year.
    The NBFC also asks Congress to provide additional support 
to local and regional response coordination initiatives. These 
include hazardous material regional response teams, which 
facilitate regional, public safety communications, and 
coordination on hazmat response, and local emergency planning 
committees to ensure they fulfill their mission of fostering 
dialog amongst hazmat stakeholders within a community to 
prevent and prepare for releases of hazardous chemicals.
    The NBFC further encourages Congress to provide additional 
support to FEMA's local delivery of additional National 
Incident Management System training courses, which provide a 
comprehensive national approach to incident management.
    The NBFC also requests that we, the NFPA, Congress, the 
National Transportation Safety Board, and the Federal Rail 
Administration, work together to enhance the methods for 
emergency hazmat product identification. Firefighters face a 
higher risk of developing cancer compared to the general 
public.
    The NBFC supports several initiatives to combat 
firefighting related cancer exposure, most notably the NBFC and 
the International Association of Fire Chiefs Volunteer and 
Combination Officer Section produced a Lavender written report, 
a Best Practice Guide to reduce toxic exposure, and risk to 
prevent firefighter cancer.
    On behalf of the Nation's volunteer firefighters, I thank 
you for your opportunity to address the Committee regarding the 
hazardous material response needs of the volunteer first 
responders.
    The NBFC looks forward to continuing to work with the 
committee and the stakeholders assembled here today to improve 
the emergency response to hazmat incidents and ensure that 
firefighters are properly trained and equipped to carry out 
this response. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Comstock follows:]

   Prepared Statement of Fire Chief David ``Chip'' Comstock, Member, 
                    National Volunteer Fire Council
    Good morning Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and distinguished 
members of the Committee. My name is Chip Comstock and I have served as 
the fire chief of the Western Reserve Joint Fire District (which I'll 
refer to as the District) for 25 years. My department serves the 
Township and Village of Poland, Ohio, which are suburban/rural 
communities located in southeastern Mahoning County. Mahoning County is 
located approximately 10 miles north of East Palestine.
    The District was first established in 1923 as a volunteer 
department and remains so today with approximately 60 active fire 
suppression and EMS personnel. We respond to approximately 1,900 
incidents each year from three stations and protect over 15,000 people 
in a 21-square-mile primary response area. The District also provides 
automatic mutual aid and mutual aid to two cities, two villages, and 
four townships in Ohio and two townships in Pennsylvania. Both CSX and 
Norfolk Southern Railways transverse the District. The District 
assisted with the emergency response to the East Palestine derailment 
and detonation.
    I have also been a member of the National Volunteer Fire Council 
(NVFC) for over a decade. The NVFC serves as the national voice for 
over 670,000 volunteer firefighters comprising 65 percent of the 
Nation's fire service. Since 1976, the NVFC has been the leading 
nonprofit membership association representing the interests of the 
volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services. The NVFC provides critical 
resources, programs, education, and advocacy to support the interests 
of volunteer first responders across the nation, including hazmat and 
rail safety. I appreciate the opportunity today to discuss the response 
to the East Palestine incident and what we've learned we need so far to 
improve hazmat incident response and rail safety.
The District's Response to East Palestine:
    More than 50 fire departments were called to the scene of the East 
Palestine derailment. My department responded to East Palestine as part 
of a countywide response on February 3, 2023. Following the derailment, 
the East Palestine dispatcher contacted Mahoning County and requested 
all water tenders/tankers that could be provided as well as additional 
engines. We were a part of that broader response.
    Our assignment was to a burning structure immediately adjacent to a 
burning rail car. We were called back to the scene on Monday to 
continue to assist with on scene operations for the detonation. 
Following the East Palestine incident, it became clear that additional 
hazmat incident training needs to be available for first responders, 
along with improved on scene communication and coordination.
    Fortunately, firefighters from my department did not experience any 
apparent immediate health issues, although many other firefighters did. 
Early post-incident baseline medical examinations were performed for my 
department, but many other departments were not as fortunate to receive 
early baseline examinations. The turnout gear and Self Contained 
Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) firefighters exposed to the rail car 
contaminants were taken out of service. Temporary rental replacement 
gear is now being used until the months long process of ordering 
replacement gear is completed. The engine that was closest to the 
burning buildings is also in the process of being examined for any 
signs of deterioration due to the chemical exposure.
Recommendations in the Aftermath of the East Palestine Response:
    The East Palestine derailment has emphasized the need to better 
train and equip first responders to respond to hazardous materials 
incidents, and specifically, to derailments of this nature in rural 
areas, which are often served by volunteer departments that lack the 
resources (equipment, training, and support), tax base, and manpower of 
their suburban and urban counterparts.
    Additionally, first responders' exposure to toxic chemicals while 
responding to East Palestine highlights the need for enhanced methods 
for emergency hazmat product identification and the need to make the 
funding for baseline medical testing and follow-up examinations 
available to all responders to hazmat incidents.
Increase Support for PHMSA Hazardous Materials Grants:
    As the Federal Rail Administration and this Committee have stated, 
the number of hazmat cars involved in derailments has been increasing 
in recent years. In 1986, there were 1,411 hazardous materials cars 
involved in derailments; by 2021, that number had increased by 339 
percent to 6,204. Additionally, according to National Fire Protection 
Association (NFPA) the annual number of fire department calls involving 
hazardous incidents has also increased considerably from 171,500 in 
1986 to 420,000 in 2020. East Palestine and other incidents in the 
transport of hazardous materials have demonstrated the need for local 
fire and emergency services to be prepared for such incidents.
    According to the NFPA's 2020 U.S. Fire Service Needs Assessment, 70 
percent of fire departments provide hazardous materials response and it 
is more common for fire departments to provide this service than 
emergency medical services (EMS). This is even the case in smaller 
departments.
    The NFPA Needs Assessment surveyed departments on four levels of 
professional competence for responders to hazardous materials 
incidents. They were: no certification, awareness, operational, and 
technician. The NFPA defines operational as:

        ``first responders trained at this level must meet the National 
        Fire Protection Association's awareness level training as well 
        as any additional competency designed to allow the responder to 
        implement or support actions to protect nearby persons, the 
        environment, or property from the effects of the release.''

    Of the departments surveyed, only 55 percent of personnel 
performing hazmat duties were certified at an operational level of 
competence. According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the population of East 
Palestine is 4,761. Of departments surveyed that serve populations 
between 2,500-5,000 people, only 53 percent of personnel performing 
hazmat duties were certified at an operational level of competence. 
This level of certification drops to 38 percent in departments that 
serve populations less than 2,500, with 23 percent of personnel having 
no certification at all. This data presents a safety and security risk 
not only to the responders themselves, but also the communities that 
they protect.
    This data is particularly alarming considering that 65 percent of 
the Nation's fire departments serve a population of less than 5,000 
people. The needs of departments serving this population size are of 
particular importance to the NVFC, because 98 percent of departments 
serving populations of less than 2,500 are either all volunteer or 
mostly volunteer and 96 percent of departments serving populations 
between 2,500 and 4,999 are either all or mostly volunteer.
    For many firefighters, hazmat training is difficult to access and/
or cost prohibitive. When it is accessible, it is often very difficult 
for firefighters to attend trainings due to lack of flexibility, time, 
and funding. These pressures are often exacerbated for volunteer 
firefighters because they have to take time off from their paying jobs 
and/or time away from their families to attend training and are often 
not reimbursed for this time.
    In recent years there has been some progress made in making 
hazardous materials training more readily available to firefighters 
through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrations' 
(PHMSA) hazardous materials grants, specifically, through the Hazardous 
Materials Emergency Preparedness (HMEP), Assistance for Local Emergency 
Response Training (ALERT), Hazardous Materials Instructor Training 
(HMIT), Community Safety (CS), and Supplemental Public Sector Training 
(SPST) grant programs.

  <bullet> HMEP Grants: For HMEP grants Governors in each State, or 
        their counterparts within Territories or Tribes, designate an 
        agency to receive the HMEP grant funds. Agencies submit grant 
        applications to PHMSA annually requesting funds for proposed 
        activities. PHMSA reviews and evaluates applications to make 
        certain the proposed activities support the program mission to 
        ensure the safe transportation of hazmat. If approved, PHMSA 
        offers the agency a Notice of Grant Award (NGA) for acceptance 
        and signature. Once executed, the agency may distribute grant 
        funds in accordance with the planned activities identified in 
        the grant application within the State, Territory, or Tribe to 
        Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) and first responder 
        organizations. The HMEP grant program is designed to allow 
        grantees the flexibility to implement training and planning 
        programs that address differing needs for each location based 
        on demographics, emergency response capabilities, commodity 
        flow studies, and hazard analysis. We strongly recommend that 
        there be more of an impetus to see that these funds are 
        directed to training front-line first responders in core 
        Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and/or 
        NFPA response competencies such as Awareness, Operations, 
        Technician, Specialist, and Incident Command, including 
        refresher trainings.

  <bullet> ALERT Grants: The ALERT grant is competitively awarded to 
        non-profit organizations capable of delivering an established 
        curriculum to emergency responders. This grant promotes hazmat 
        response training for volunteer or remote emergency responders. 
        Response activities include the transportation of crude oil, 
        ethanol, and other flammable liquids by rail consistent with 
        NFPA standards.

  <bullet> HMIT Grants: The HMIT grant is competitively awarded to non-
        profit organizations that have expertise in conducting hazmat 
        employee training programs and are capable of reaching a target 
        population of hazmat employees and including them in the 
        training program. Both career and volunteer first responders 
        are ``employees''. This grant funds train-the-trainer program 
        that facilitates the training of hazmat instructors who then 
        conduct training in Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) for 
        hazmat employees.

  <bullet> CS Grants: The CS grant is competitively awarded to non-
        profit organizations. The CS grant enhances the capability of 
        communities to prepare for and respond to hazmat accidents and 
        incidents and supports the training of state and local 
        enforcement personnel who are responsible for enforcing the 
        safe transportation of hazmat.

  <bullet> SPST Grants: The SPST grant is competitively awarded to 
        national non-profit fire service organizations. This grant is a 
        train-the trainer program that facilitates the training of 
        instructors who then conduct training in hazmat response for 
        individuals with a statutory responsibility to respond to 
        hazmat accidents and incidents.

    Through a SPST grant the NVFC is able offer a hazmat train-the-
trainer program: Partners in Training (PIT) Crew. This project will 
help first responders gain the knowledge and skills they need to train 
others in their communities on hazmat safety and response. Through this 
program the NVFC is providing 15 in-person training opportunities 
across the U.S. at no cost to departments.
    Through this program, the NVFC is making hazmat training more 
accessible to departments around the country. The train-the-trainer 
aspect magnifies this program's impact by preparing hazmat trainers to 
go back to their home departments and regions and spread the knowledge 
they have attained. It is very important that the NVFC has the ability 
to provide this program at no cost to volunteer departments because 
many of these department serve rural areas that lack a tax base to 
support funding for basic firefighting equipment like turnout gear and 
SCBAs, let alone hazmat training.
    Thanks to ALERT, CS, and SPST grants, the NVFC and other non-profit 
organizations that serve first responders have been able to provide 
hazmat incident response training to tens of thousands of firefighters. 
As seen in the data above we still have a long way to go to ensure that 
all firefighters who respond to hazardous incidents are properly 
trained to do so. The NVFC asks that Congress pass legislation that 
will increase funding to HMEP, ALERT, HMIT, CS, and SPST grants. The 
NVFC would also urge congress and PHMSA to ensure that HMEP and HMIT 
grant funds reach their intended recipients--the front line first 
responders--Fire, EMS, and Law Enforcement. The NVFC is pleased to see 
that S. 576, Railway Safety Act of 2023 includes language that 
increases support to the ALERT and Supplemental Training grant programs 
and sincerely thanks Senator Brown, Senator Vance, Senator Casey, 
Senator Rubio, Senator Fetterman, and Senator Hawley for their 
leadership.
Provide Funding for Hazardous Materials Regional Response Teams:
    An incident as large as East Palestine requires a regional 
response. In addition to providing additional funds to existing PHMSA 
hazardous materials grants, the NVFC requests that Congress support 
initiatives to fund Hazardous Materials Regional Response Teams to 
facilitate regional public safety communications and coordination on 
hazmat response, region focused training, equipment, and sharing of 
best practices.
Additional Support for LEPCs:
    Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs) provide a forum for 
local stakeholders to work together to identify chemical hazards, 
develop and maintain emergency plans in case of an accidental release, 
and encourage continuous attention to chemical safety, risk reduction, 
and accident prevention in their communities. Stakeholders that 
participate in LEPCs are first responders, state and local elected 
officials, emergency managers, industry representatives, hospital and 
public health officials, and the media. Because of their broad-based 
membership, LEPCs can foster a valuable dialogue within the community 
to prevent and prepare for accidental and terrorist-related releases of 
hazardous chemicals.
    The role of LEPCs is a critical and foundational element in 
providing the hazard, risk, and capability assessments needed by the 
response community. These assessments should be followed by strategic 
planning at the community level to prioritize and fill capability gaps. 
Likewise, these LEPC efforts will require sustained support at the 
national, state, and local levels. The NVFC asks that Congress provide 
additional funds to LEPCs through PHMSA and the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure this sustained support is provided.
Support More Enhanced Methods for Emergency Hazmat Product 
        Identification:
    A major concern in the immediate response to the East Palestine 
derailment was the lack of knowledge of what hazardous materials were 
contained in the derailed train cars. Each car that contained a 
hazardous materials was placarded, but the heat of the fire melted the 
placards identifying the contents of the cars. The NVFC requests that 
we, the NFPA, Congress, Nation Transportation Safety Board, and Federal 
Rail Administration work together to enhance the methods for emergency 
hazmat product identification.
Increase Support for AFG and SAFER Grant Programs:
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Assistance to 
Firefighters Grant (AFG) program and Staffing for Adequate Fire and 
Emergency Response (SAFER) grants are by far the most significant 
sources of assistance that the Federal government provides to local 
fire departments. The goal of the AFG and SAFER programs is to bring 
all of the Nation's fire departments up to a baseline level of 
readiness, which includes the purchase of essential equipment to 
respond to hazmat incidents. This funding is particularly important for 
all-and mostly-volunteer fire departments, which protect 82 percent of 
the Nation's communities and 30 percent of the population.
    As the NFPA data referenced earlier shows, rural areas are almost 
exclusively protected by volunteers. Unfortunately, NFPA Needs 
Assessment studies consistently show that volunteer agencies have 
difficulty affording up-to-date equipment, training, and SCBAs. This is 
primarily for economic reasons. Because fire protection services are 
funded at the local level, the resources available to each department 
are dependent on the local tax base. For smaller communities that can 
mean having to engage in private fundraising and rely on older 
equipment and vehicles in order to maintain operations.
    These pressures are exacerbated by the fact that the number of fire 
department calls increased by 23 percent to more than 36.4 million from 
2010 to 2020, while during this same ten-year period the number of 
volunteer firefighters dropped by 12 percent nationwide. Additionally, 
data from the Congressional Fires Services Institute show that since 
2019, the average cost for turnout gear has increased by approximately 
35-40 percent, while the cost of fire SCBAs has increased around 32 
percent.
    According to the NFPA Need Assessment, more than half of all fire 
departments cannot equip everyone with SCBAs. Departments protecting 
less than 9,999 people have the highest rates of unmet need for SCBA 
equipment.

  <bullet> AFG Grants: AFG grants help meet the firefighting and 
        emergency response needs of fire departments and non-affiliated 
        emergency medical service organizations. AFG funds are used to 
        obtain critically needed equipment, protective gear, emergency 
        vehicles, training, and other resources necessary for 
        protecting the public and emergency personnel from fire and 
        related hazards.

  <bullet> SAFER Grants: SAFER grants directly assist fire departments 
        and volunteer firefighter interest organizations with 
        firefighter retention and recruitment efforts in their 
        communities. SAFER funds provide the resources needed to 
        enhance the local fire departments' abilities to comply with 
        staffing, response, and operational standards.

    NVFC requests that Congress enact legislation that will increase 
funding to AFG and SAFER grant programs. Additionally, the 
authorization for AFG and SAFER grants expires at the end of this 
Fiscal Year and these programs are scheduled to sunset at the end of FY 
2024. The Senate has introduced S. 870, Fire Grants and Safety Act. The 
NVFC strongly supports this important legislation which will extend the 
authorization of AFG and SAFER through FY 2030 and urges Congress pass 
this legislation as soon as possible. The NVFC sincerely thanks Senator 
Peters, Senator Collins, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Carper for 
their leadership on this important legislation.
Encourage Broader Implementation of NIMS:
    Large incidents like East Palestine that require a response from 
multiple jurisdictions and state, local, and Federal agencies emphasize 
the need for communication and coordination among first responders and 
the need to adopt protocols like FEMA's National Incident Management 
System (NIMS). NIMS is a comprehensive, national approach to incident 
management that is applicable at all jurisdictional levels and across 
functional disciplines and the full spectrum of potential incidents, 
hazards, and impacts, regardless of size, location, or complexity.
    NIMS provides stakeholders across the whole community with the 
shared vocabulary, systems, and processes to successfully carry out a 
multi-agency response to emergencies. NIMS also defines operational 
systems that guide how personnel work together during incidents. The 
NVFC encourages Congress to provide additional funding and support to 
FEMA and the U.S. Fire Administration for the local delivery of 
additional NIMS training courses. As mentioned earlier, volunteer first 
responders face unique obstacles when it comes to training due to 
having to juggle the obligations of their full-time careers along with 
their obligations to the fire service.
Fund Post Exposure Baseline and Follow-up Medical Testing on First 
        Responders:
    Firefighters face a 9 percent higher risk of developing cancer and 
a 14 percent higher risk of dying from cancer compared to the general 
public. The NVFC has supported several initiatives to combat the threat 
of firefighting related cancer exposure. Most notably the NVFC 
collaborated with the International Association of Fire Chiefs' 
Volunteer and Combination Officers Section to produce the Lavender 
Ribbon Report, which is a comprehensive best practice guide to reduce 
toxic exposure risks and prevent firefighter cancer.
    The aftermath of East Palestine has emphasized the need for much 
more work to be done to improve the prevention of firefighter cancer 
and other health issues. Those who responded to the East Palestine 
incident from the Western Reserve Joint Fire District received post 
incident baseline health screenings, but many other firefighters who 
responded did not receive these screenings.
    Preventive screenings can identify cancer and other health risks at 
their earliest stages when positive treatment outcomes are more likely. 
However, it remains difficult for individual firefighters to receive 
early screenings as current screening guidance does not account for 
their occupational exposures. Every firefighter who responds to an 
incident where they are exposed to hazardous materials, like in East 
Palestine, should receive baseline and follow-up health screenings.
    These screenings will not only protect firefighters and save 
resources by preempting potential health complications, they will also 
enable researchers to learn more about the impact of hazardous 
exposures on firefighters and the potential conditions they may develop 
as a result of these exposures. We need to take a proactive rather than 
a reactive approach when it comes to firefighter healthcare. The NVFC 
ask that Congress pass initiatives that would fund baseline and follow-
up health screenings for firefighter who have been exposed to hazardous 
materials incidents involving hazardous materials like East Palestine.
Conclusion:
    I thank you for the opportunity to address the Committee regarding 
the hazardous materials response and rail safety needs of volunteer 
first responders. As the community of East Palestine recovers, the NVFC 
looks forward to continuing to work with the Committee and the 
stakeholders assembled here today to ensure incidents like this don't 
occur again. We also look forward to working together to improve the 
emergency response to hazmat incidents and ensure that firefighters are 
properly trained and equipped to carry out this response.

    Chair Cantwell. Thank you very much for being here. And we 
are so sorry that you had to deal with this, but your 
experience is very helpful and us--helping to know how to 
evaluate this moving forward and the resources that you are 
asking for.
    Mr. Whitaker, welcome. We look forward to your testimony.

 STATEMENT OF CLYDE WHITAKER, OHIO STATE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, 
                 SMART--TRANSPORTATION DIVISION

    Mr. Whitaker. Good morning, Chairwoman Cantwell, and 
Ranking Member Cruz, and members of the Committee. Thank you 
for the opportunity to testify. My name is Clyde Whitaker.
    I am an Ohio State Legislative Board Director for Smart 
Transportation, which represents approximately 30,000 railroad 
workers in the crafts of conductor, locomotive engineer, 
yardmaster, and trainperson.
    One of my primary roles is to protect, improve, and assure 
the safety of our members. I would like to begin by saying that 
our hearts, the rail labor break for citizens of East 
Palestine. This derailment did not have to happen and it makes 
it so much more frustrating for us to know that it was very 
predictable.
    And yet our warnings and cries for help over the last 7 
years have fallen on deaf ears and the outcome was exactly as 
we feared. Now the result is a town that doesn't feel safe in 
their own homes, businesses failing to survive, and railroad 
that prioritized its own movement of trains before the people 
of the community, as well as its workers. It truly is a shame 
that operational changes in place prior to that incident are 
still in place today, and the possibility for a similar 
disaster is just as possible.
    My entire railroad career, I have listened to the railroads 
portray a message, an image of safety first, but I have never 
witnessed or experienced that truth one single day on the 
property. For years, I have handled complaints after complaint 
regarding unsafe practices and unsafe environments, and for 
almost every single one, I have been fought every step of the 
way.
    The truth is, ask any railroad worker and they will tell 
you that their carriers are masters of checking the boxes for 
saying the right things without ever doing anything meaningful 
toward improving safety.
    Their only focus is on the operating ratios and bottom 
lines, which is evidenced by the fact that their business 
structures are set up to reward timely movements of freight 
rather than reaching destination safely, as they once were. 
Actions do speak louder than words, and I assure you that what 
you have heard and will hear from the railroads today are 
nothing more than words.
    Their actions are what is experienced by men and women I 
represent, as well as what the people of East Palestine have 
been through. This is the reality of what happens when 
railroads are primarily left to govern and regulate themselves.
    To that point, on July 11, 2022, I filed a complaint with 
the FRA regarding an unsafe practice that was occurring on 
Norfolk Southern. Despite existing operating rules to the 
contrary, and as I was giving instructions to crews, to 
disregard wayside detector failures and to keep their trains 
moving.
    This meant the trains were not being inspected as intended 
and that the crews were not able to ascertain the integrity of 
such trains. This practice remained in place even after East 
Palestine, but these types of issues aren't just relegated to 
wayside detectors. It is a virus that has plagued the industry 
for some time with the inception of precision scheduled 
railroading. Across America, inspections and maintenance is 
being deferred to expedite the movement of trains.
    No longer is identifying defects and unsafe conditions the 
goal of inspections, but rather minimize the time it takes to 
perform them, or the elimination of them altogether. Compound 
this with the fact that the railroads on a determined course to 
grow these trains to astronomical lengths and you have a 
predictable outcome, and that outcome is the event like we have 
seen in East Palestine.
    We need meaningful change and we desperately need people 
like yourselves to reverse these dangerous trends in the 
railroad industry. The Rail Safety Act of 2023 goes a long way 
toward doing just that.
    As we sit here today, the railroads are attempting to 
eliminate the conductor from the cab of a locomotive. They want 
you to believe that technology is capable of replacing the role 
of conductor, but what they won't tell you is technology was 
present in the cab of the locomotive, and when the train 
finally came to a stop this day, this job was done. But unlike 
the technology, the engineer, the conductor, and his trainee 
sprang into action.
    They identified the derailment in the presence of fire. 
They contacted EMS. They applied brakes on the train cars to 
prevent further catastrophic damage. They separated the 
locomotives and got the entire crew to safety, all of which 
technology sat dormant. We cannot afford to be dormant.
    The degradation of safety is very real and the numbers 
prove it. The frequency of derailments is up. The frequency of 
injuries is up. And from a railroaders' perspective, the 
potential for another disaster is as high as it has ever been. 
We cannot allow the railroads to continue to dodge and 
sharpshoot regulations.
    We cannot allow them to be sole owners and creators of the 
data and safety statistics, and we cannot allow them to 
prioritize revenue over profit. Oversight is desperately needed 
before the next big one happens. I thank you for allowing me to 
testify here today, and I look forward to any questions you may 
have.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Whitaker follows:]

Prepared Statement of Clyde Whitaker, Ohio State Legislative Director, 
                     SMART--Transportation Division
    Good morning, Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and Members 
of the Committee. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify.
    My name is Clyde Whitaker, and I am the Ohio State Legislative 
Director for SMART Transportation Division, which represents 
approximately 3,000 railroad workers in the crafts of conductor, 
locomotive engineer, yardmaster, and trainperson. One of my primary 
roles is to protect, improve, and ensure the safety of our members.
    On July 11, 2022, I filed a complaint with the Federal Railroad 
Administration regarding an unsafe practice that was occurring on 
Norfolk Southern (NS). Despite existing operating rules to the 
contrary, NS was giving instructions to crews to disregard wayside 
detector failures and to keep their trains moving. This meant that the 
trains were not being inspected as intended, and that the crews were 
not able to ascertain the integrity of their trains. Unfortunately, my 
complaint could not be acted upon and within months similar sets of 
circumstances have led us to the place we are today, where large-scale 
derailments have endangered multiple communities both in Ohio and 
nation-wide.
    The driving force behind this decision, and many others like it, is 
a business model otherwise known as Precision Scheduled Railroading 
(PSR). PSR has caused the greatest degradation of safety in modern day 
railroading. As we have all seen in East Palestine, this cut-your-way-
to-profit model is not sustainable and it is very, very dangerous. And 
while the NTSB may not be able to identify it by name in their report, 
I assure you, without hesitation, that it is the greatest contributing 
factor, not only in this accident, but in all of the others that have 
occurred before it and since.
    In yards all across America, thorough inspections are being 
sacrificed and needed maintenance is being deferred to expedite the 
movement of trains. NS is not unique in these practices. No longer is 
identifying defects the goal of inspections industry-wide, but rather 
minimizing the time it takes to perform them or the elimination of them 
altogether. Compound this with the fact that the railroads are on a 
determined course to grow these trains to astronomical lengths, and you 
have a predictable outcome. That outcome is East Palestine; or the 
derailment in Sandusky that occurred in October of last year; or the 
derailment that just happened in Springfield. But what's even more 
scary is that the practices, rules, and procedures that were in place 
when these accidents occurred are still in place today. This tells me 
that the frequency of derailments that we are experiencing in this 
country is not going to stop anytime soon, and, in fact, may only end 
up getting worse.
    We need meaningful change, and we desperately need people like 
yourselves to declare an end to PSR. The Rail Safety Act of 2023 goes a 
long way toward doing just that. As we sit here today, the railroads 
are attempting to eliminate the conductor from the cab of the 
locomotive. They want you to believe that technology is capable of 
replacing the role of the conductor and that the conductor would be 
better served in a remote, ground-based role. Nothing can be further 
from the truth. Yes, there was a conductor in the locomotive in all the 
accidents I've mentioned here today, but there was also technology. In 
East Palestine when the train finally came to a stop, the technology 
stopped with it as its job was done. But when the train came to a stop 
for the conductor, the conductor and his trainee immediately sprang 
into action. He urgently began a walking inspection, wherein he was 
quickly able to identify a major accident had occurred, that fire was 
present, and that danger was imminent. In doing so, he relayed 
potential life-saving information to the engineer so that the engineer 
could notify the dispatcher to get emergency services in motion. Then 
the conductor, realizing the presence of fire presented the potential 
for movement of the train--which would have exacerbated the situation 
immensely--set manual brakes on the cars to prevent any unwanted 
movement of the train, and then separated the locomotives from the 
train so that they themselves, including the engineer could get to 
safety. None of that could have happened in a timely fashion with a 
one-person crew.
    I imagine the railroads are going to try and tout their safety 
record in this hearing. They want you to believe that even though 
they're the ones that created the scenario we're currently facing, that 
they somehow are the ones best suited to right the ship. Nothing could 
be further from the truth. According to them, 99% of all hazmat 
shipments make it safely to their destination. Keep in mind that was 
true before East Palestine, and yet it still happened. They are most 
likely going to tell you that injuries are down, but keep in mind that 
they eliminated roughly 30% of the workforce over the last 5 years. And 
they're most likely going to tell you that derailments are down but not 
that they are operating fewer trains.
    It is easy to hide in the numbers. Obviously, if you have less 
people, you're going to have less injuries, and if you have less 
trains, you should theoretically have less derailments. But when you 
look at these incidents on a pro rata basis, you see a completely 
different story.
    In December 2022, when the GAO reported on Norfolk Southern's 
accident rate, it found the Company had hit a 10-year high in 2021 with 
the Company's accident rate at its highest from 2019-2021. In fact, the 
Company's Federal Railroad Administration (``FRA'') train accident rate 
has increased for each of the last four years. Similarly, the nation's 
seven Class 1 freight railroads suffered two derailments for every 
million miles traveled in 2022, compared to the 1.71 derailments per 
million miles in 2013, an increase of 17%. These statistics and the 
business model that is producing them cannot be allowed to continue 
down its current, reckless path.
    The overarching theme of what the AAR and railroad companies are 
going to tell you is that they are beyond your reach. They will hide 
behind the interstate commerce clause and tell you that in the name of 
our nation's economy, they are empowered to run their critical industry 
unfettered by your authority.
    I am here today to tell you that is a bastardization of our United 
States' Constitution. The Commerce Clause was put in place to protect 
the people of the United State of America, not the railroads. But the 
PSR business model they have employed in the last 6 years has not been 
that. Their 3-4 mile trains, skeleton crews, and slap dash approach to 
both maintenance and inspections have not enhanced our economic 
standing in the world. It has led to massive job losses, embargoed 
shippers cut off from rail service, exports not making it to market, 
products not making it to store shelves, and raw materials not making 
it to assembly lines.
    Derailments make the headlines almost every single day in this 
country. It doesn't have to be this way, nor should it. We are the 
greatest nation in the world and the safety of our railroad system 
should reflect, but how can it when the carriers themselves oppose 
every meaningful piece of regulation and/or legislations that comes 
before it.
    What is happening in this nation is not ok, and the Railway Safety 
Act of 2023 is a great beginning to getting us back on track.
    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to testify here today, 
and I look forward to your questions.

    Chair Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Whitaker. Very much 
appreciate you being here and your statement. We will now hear 
from Mr. Shaw. Welcome, Mr. Shaw.

STATEMENT OF ALAN SHAW, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, 
                  NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORPORATION

    Mr. Shaw. Good morning, Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Cruz, and distinguished members of the Committee. I appreciate 
the opportunity to testify before you today.
    My name is Alan Shaw, and I have been President and CEO of 
Norfolk Southern since May 2022. I want to open by stating how 
deeply sorry I am for the impact this derailment has had on the 
citizens of East Palestine and the surrounding communities. I 
have been to East Palestine and the surrounding communities 
many times over the past 6 weeks.
    I have spoken with the community leaders, business owners, 
school officials, clergy, families, and others. They have 
shared their stories and their concerns about the health of 
their families, their businesses, and the future of the 
community they love.
    I am determined to make this right. Norfolk Southern 
continues to make good on its promise to clean this site 
safely, thoroughly, and with urgency. You have my personal 
commitment that we will get the job done and we will help these 
communities thrive.
    At the direction of and in collaboration with the U.S. EPA 
and State and local agencies, we are developing and 
implementing near and longer-term cleanup activities. Air and 
water monitoring have been in place continuously since the 
accident, and to date it has consistently indicated the air is 
safe to breathe and the water is safe to drink.
    We have already invested more than $24 million in East 
Palestine and the surrounding communities. Norfolk Southern 
opened the Family Assistance Center the day after the incident, 
and through it we have provided more than $10 million to more 
than 6,000 families. We have invested over $3 million in 
community relief funds to support the immediate needs of 
Ohioans and Pennsylvanians in the area.
    We have also dedicated over $9 million in funds to 
reimburse and support emergency responders, and health and 
environmental agencies for costs related to the derailment. As 
I have said before, this is just the start. We know that people 
are concerned about long term health impacts from the 
derailment.
    When I appeared before the Senate Committee on Environment 
and Public Works earlier this month, some members of that 
committee asked me to be more specific about our commitment to 
do the right thing.
    Today, I am able to share more about our plans. We are in 
the planning stages of developing a long-term medical 
compensation fund, a property value assurance program, and a 
longer-term water testing program. We look forward to working 
toward a final resolution with relevant stakeholders on the 
details of these plans. If residents have a concern, we want 
them to come talk to us.
    Our website, nsmakingitright.com, provides the latest 
information and details on how to reach us. I thank Chair 
Homendy for her leadership and the NTSB's investigation into 
the derailment, and I pledge to continue to cooperate fully. 
The NTSB's preliminary report found that the Norfolk Southern 
crew was operating the train below the speed limit and in an 
approved manner, yet it is clear from this incident that we can 
always improve.
    So as the NTSB continues its work, we are not waiting to 
act to make the railroads safer. Shortly after the derailment, 
I instructed my team to look at steps we could take to improve 
safety beginning immediately, and we have announced a number of 
initiatives to do just that. These steps are a start, and we 
look forward to working with policymakers and others in the 
industry on this.
    We support legislative efforts that use science and data to 
enhance the safety of the freight rail industry, and the 
Railway Safety Act and the Rail Act both include measures with 
the potential for meaningful improvement, such as funding 
additional training, better advanced notifications, 
accelerating the phaseout of older tank cars, and much more.
    We strive to make our safety culture the best in the 
industry. When I began my tenure as CEO 10 months ago, I spent 
hours in crew rooms all over our 22-state network thanking our 
frontline railroaders and asking for their advice.
    They are proud of the important work they do for this 
country, and we take their safety and the safety of the 
communities we serve seriously. Today, I am proud to represent 
more than 19,700 Norfolk Southern employees who work every day 
to offer a safe and effective means of transporting goods to 
businesses and families across our great country.
    We will continue to invest in the future of Ohio and 
Pennsylvania, and all the States in which we operate, just as 
we have always done. Norfolk Southern is here for the long haul 
and we won't be finished until we make this right. Thank you 
again for the opportunity to appear before you today. I look 
forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Shaw follows:]

Prepared Statement of Alan Shaw, President and Chief Executive Officer, 
                      Norfolk Southern Corporation
    Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and distinguished members 
of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear today to 
discuss the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.
    My name is Alan Shaw, and I have been the President and CEO of 
Norfolk Southern since May 2022.
    I look forward today to sharing information about our progress 
cleaning the derailment site, assisting families whose lives were 
disrupted, and investing in the community. I will also discuss how we 
are making Norfolk Southern and the railroad industry safer through our 
own initiatives, collaboration with others in the industry, and 
engagement with lawmakers and other stakeholders.
    I am deeply sorry for the impact this derailment has had on the 
people in the region, and I am determined to make it right.
    We are making progress every day as we clean the site safely, 
thoroughly, and with urgency. Working now under the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency's Unilateral Administrative Order, we have submitted 
a long-term plan that will guide our comprehensive testing program for 
the community's water, air, and soil. That testing is informed by 
science and regulatory standards. And we will continue to transparently 
share the results of our ongoing testing. Agencies at the state and 
Federal level--including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the 
Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and the Pennsylvania Department 
of Environmental Protection (DEP)--are continually monitoring the air 
and water quality in the impacted region. We are encouraged that they 
have reported to date that both the air and drinking water are safe.
    Financial assistance cannot change what happened, but it is an 
important part of doing the right thing. To date, we have committed to 
reimbursements and investments of more than $24 million in total, 
including by helping more than 5,800 families through our Family 
Assistance Center. This is just a start. We are currently working with 
the relevant stakeholders to establish three new funds to address 
healthcare, property values, and water testing in East Palestine and 
the surrounding communities. We also have launched a community website, 
NSMakingItRight.com, to provide the latest information to residents of 
East Palestine and the surrounding communities.
    Making first responders whole has been a particular area of focus, 
and we have already pledged and paid millions to reimburse local fire 
departments for costs associated with the emergency response and clean-
up. I would like to express my profound admiration for the first 
responders from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia who responded to 
the derailment.
    I want to be clear: this financial assistance is just a down 
payment. I have visited East Palestine and the surrounding area 
frequently since the accident. I've met with community leaders, 
business owners, school officials, clergy, and others to begin to 
identify ways we can invest in the future prosperity of the residents 
in the area and support the long-term needs of its people. We will 
continue to invest in the affected communities for as long as it takes 
to help people in the area to recover and thrive.
    We are also committed to learning from this accident and to working 
with public officials and industry to make railroads even safer. In the 
meantime, we have already launched a series of immediate steps to 
enhance safety, based on the facts in the National Transportation 
Safety Board's (NTSB) preliminary report. We look forward to 
cooperating with the NTSB as it continues its investigation into the 
root cause of the accident as well as its wider investigation.
I. Our Commitment to Remediation and Monitoring
    I've met with residents of the community. I've heard their 
concerns, and I understand their worry. Their feedback has informed our 
approach. Norfolk Southern is working around the clock to remediate the 
remaining issues and monitor for any impact on public health and the 
environment. We continue to work in close coordination with federal, 
state, and local regulators and others to conduct environmental 
monitoring and to develop and carry out near-and longer-term clean-up 
activities. The remediation plan and each step of our longer-term 
efforts will be implemented at the direction of the U.S. EPA pursuant 
to the Agency's Unilateral Administrative Order.
    Norfolk Southern personnel arrived on-scene shortly after the 
accident, and we have been there ever since. We have worked to be 
transparent and cooperative with the various local, state, and Federal 
stakeholders involved from the early hours of Unified Command through 
today. Following the accident, our specialists have remained on-
location, assisted by expert derailment and environmental contractors.
    We are making significant progress. These teams have contained, 
diverted, and treated affected portions of nearby waterways, flushed 
nearly a mile of surface waterways, and are capturing rainwater within 
the contaminated areas for temporary storage and disposal. To date, we 
have recovered and transported more than 7.4 million gallons of 
potentially affected water from the site for disposal at EPA-approved 
facilities.
    We also are working to safely remove affected soil, and our crews 
have removed more than 6,800 tons from the site. We are actively 
removing waste to facilities specifically engineered and permitted to 
safely handle this type of material. Our work will continue until the 
job is done.
    We continue to listen to the experts and cooperate with state, 
federal, and local government agencies. In particular, Norfolk 
Southern, the U.S. EPA, Ohio EPA, and Pennsylvania DEP are conducting 
water, soil, and air monitoring throughout the area surrounding East 
Palestine. The air monitoring to date has shown the air is safe to 
breathe. And the monitoring of the area's public drinking water and 
private water wells by state and local authorities and Norfolk Southern 
shows that the water is safe to drink and there are no harmful levels 
of substances related to the derailment. We are committed to continuing 
this monitoring for as long as necessary.
II. Our Commitment to the Community
    I want the people of East Palestine and the surrounding communities 
to know that Norfolk Southern and I are deeply committed to them. As 
indicated above, we have already made an initial investment of more 
than $24 million. Our financial support so far includes:

  <bullet> More than $9.5 million in support to more than 5,800 
        families through our Family Assistance Center;

  <bullet> A $5 million fund to reimburse local Pennsylvania fire 
        departments for costs associated with the emergency response 
        and clean-up;

  <bullet> More than $3 million in reimbursements and support to the 
        East Palestine Fire Department and other area first responders 
        for fire equipment used in the derailment response;

  <bullet> Almost $1.5 million to Pennsylvania state agencies to cover 
        costs incurred as a result of the derailment;

  <bullet> A $1 million fund available immediately to East Palestine 
        community leaders to identify where donations can do the most 
        good;

  <bullet> Another $1 million fund to support the immediate needs of 
        the East Palestine community, overseen by a Norfolk Southern 
        craft railroader who lives in East Palestine and has been hired 
        to serve as a community liaison, reporting directly to my 
        office;

  <bullet> Another $1 million Community Relief Fund to provide support 
        to Pennsylvania businesses that have experienced losses as a 
        result of the incident, including business expenses Norfolk 
        Southern has reimbursed to date;

  <bullet> $300,000 to the East Palestine City School District to 
        support the district's academics, athletics, extracurricular 
        activities, and long-term contingency planning regarding the 
        impacts of the derailment;

  <bullet> $250,000 donation to The Way Station, an Ohio-based 
        nonprofit delivering aid to the East Palestine community, to 
        help establish a larger, permanent location in the area and 
        hire additional staff, including a social worker;

  <bullet> Funding and coordination of cleaning and air monitoring 
        services for the East Palestine Elementary and High Schools; 
        and

  <bullet> $65,000 to the East Palestine Youth Sports Association to 
        allow children to play in sports leagues for free for the year.

    We are also listening closely to concerns from the community about 
whether there could be long-term impacts from the derailment. Many 
residents are worried about what they will do if health impacts related 
to the derailment are discovered years from now. To date, environmental 
monitoring continues to show the air and drinking water are safe. To 
provide an additional level of assurance, we are committed to a 
solution that addresses long-term health risks through the creation of 
a long-term medical compensation fund.
    We also know residents are worried about their home values. While 
we are working with local leaders on investments to support the 
community's long-term prosperity, we understand these concerns. We are 
committed to working with all relevant stakeholders to provide tailored 
protection for home sellers if their property loses value due to the 
impact of the derailment.
    Finally, we have heard the community's interest in programs that 
protect drinking water over the long term. We are prepared to work with 
stakeholders toward that goal as well. We look forward to working 
toward a final resolution with all relevant stakeholders to finalize 
the details of these programs.
    Finally, we know it is important to keep the community informed. 
NSMakingItRight.com is updated regularly with information about 
remediation, monitoring, financial assistance, and investments in the 
community. Again, this is all a down payment. We are listening to your 
concerns, and we are committed to making this right.
III. Our Focus on Safety
    Rail is one of the safest modes of transporting hazardous 
materials. We recognize, however, that we need to continue working to 
improve railway safety. The morning after the derailment, I spoke to 
NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy and pledged the full cooperation of Norfolk 
Southern in the NTSB's investigation. The NTSB's preliminary report 
released last month reflected that the Norfolk Southern crew was 
operating the train within our protocols and below the speed limit 
established by Federal law. The wayside detectors installed on the 
track to identify overheated axles operated properly, and the crew took 
the appropriate action when they received the alert.
    We will analyze and address the NTSB's investigation results when 
they are available, but we are not waiting to act. We are committed to 
learning from this accident and working with public officials and 
industry to make railroads even safer. We have already launched a 
series of immediate steps to enhance safety, based on the facts in the 
NTSB's preliminary report.
    As an initial step--and focusing on what we can do on our own--we 
are making our network of early-warning sensors stronger. Shortly after 
the derailment, I instructed my team to immediately look at steps we 
can take to improve safety further, and we are taking the following 
actions:

  <bullet> Enhancing the hot bearing detector network;

  <bullet> Piloting next-generation hot bearing detectors;

  <bullet> Deploying more acoustic bearing detectors;

  <bullet> Accelerating our Digital Train Inspection program; and

  <bullet> Improving practices, alongside industry partners, for hot 
        bearing detectors.

    We currently spend more than $1 billion a year on technologies, 
equipment, and infrastructure to support safety, and another $1 billion 
per year on ongoing operations in support of safety. But the safety 
mechanisms in place did not prevent this accident. Every employee at 
Norfolk Southern is focused on learning from this incident and working 
with the entire freight rail industry to make changes.
    We are committed to helping our first responders prepare for 
incidents when they do happen. For years prior to the East Palestine 
derailment, Norfolk Southern funded training for emergency responders. 
In 2015, Norfolk Southern launched ``Operation Awareness & Response'' 
with the goal of strengthening relationships with state and local first 
responders across our network through new training opportunities, and 
full-scale exercises.
    We recently announced that we are establishing a new regional 
training facility in Ohio, which will offer free training to first 
responders in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. The first safety 
classes at this new center began this week at our rail yard in 
Bellevue, Ohio, just west of Cleveland. We have more than 400 first 
responders registered for this and other upcoming trainings, and 
classes are currently full. We will have numerous future training 
opportunities across our 22-state network in 2023. We plan to establish 
a dedicated facility in the future. Every year, Norfolk Southern 
voluntarily trains between four and five thousand first responders 
throughout the states we serve.
    In addressing issues going forward, Norfolk Southern views an 
industry-wide comprehensive approach--one that includes railcar owners, 
car manufacturers, leasing companies, equipment makers, and the 
railroad companies--as essential in helping to improve safety as the 
rail industry continues to provide the logistical infrastructure that 
enables the United States economy to grow. It's going to take all of 
us--and we're eager to help lead that effort.
IV. Enhancing Our Safety Culture
    An essential part of our effort to make Norfolk Southern a safer 
company is to further strengthen our safety culture. To describe how we 
are doing that, I would like to provide some important context on the 
new strategy we announced for Norfolk Southern at the end of last year.
    In the weeks since the derailment there have been a number of 
questions about an industry operating approach called precision 
scheduled railroading (PSR). There are five principles of PSR: operate 
safely, develop people, provide service, control costs, and optimize 
assets. These are sound principles one might find in any industry with 
an operational focus.
    In recent years, however, PSR has become associated with a singular 
focus on cost-cutting to drive a low operating ratio, which is a common 
industry measure for efficiency. It is here that Norfolk Southern has 
approached things differently from others in the industry and charted a 
new course. In a significant departure from the railroad industry's 
recent past, we deliberately moved away from a singular focus on 
operating ratio. Instead, we are taking a more balanced approach to 
service, productivity, and growth.
    As just one example of what our strategy means in practice, instead 
of furloughing workers during periodic economic downturns, we intend to 
use the opportunity to invest in our workforce and provide additional 
training. When we do that, it makes us a more resilient company that is 
better able to serve our customers, and it creates more career 
opportunities for our craft railroaders. We hired craft railroaders 
aggressively throughout 2022 and continue to do so this year.
    Our new strategy goes hand-in-hand with our increased focus on 
culture and employee engagement, with an emphasis on transparency and 
collaboration. I know that, when Norfolk Southern is successful, it is 
because our craft colleagues are getting the job done for our customers 
and the United States economy. I have spent countless hours in the 
field in the 10 months I have served as CEO, thanking our front-line 
railroaders for their service and listening to their ideas on how to 
make Norfolk Southern better.
    We are committed to enhancing quality of life and work 
predictability for our craft employees, who are the key to our success. 
When we completed the recent round of national labor negotiations, with 
a historic and well-deserved 24 percent pay increase, I committed 
immediately to begin negotiations at the local level on quality-of-life 
issues like paid sick leave. We did what we said we were going to do 
and have already reached agreements on paid sick leave with nine of our 
unions.
V. Our Commitment to Industry & Legislative Action
    We support legislative efforts to enhance the safety of the freight 
rail industry. We are committed to working with our fellow industry 
leaders to make the railroad industry a safer place, and we also 
recognize and appreciate the bicameral, bipartisan leadership by 
Members of Congress, including by members of this Committee, in 
proposing new legislation to create a safer rail industry. The Railway 
Safety Act and the RAIL Act both include measures with the potential to 
enhance safety and improve outcomes for our industry, our customers, 
and the communities we serve.
    We support the Railway Safety Act's provisions for more industry-
funded training for first responders, and we are not waiting for 
legislation to move this forward. We have already announced the 
expansion of our existing training programs and the creation of a new 
regional training center in Ohio, which will serve first responders in 
Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The first class was on March 21.
    We support the principle that first responders need accurate real-
time information on the contents of trains moving through their 
communities and instruction on the safe handling of those contents in 
the event of an accident. We intend to take a leading role getting the 
AskRail safety application into the hands of every first responder who 
needs access. In this area specifically, the details of legislation 
matter as policymakers balance safety enhancements with national 
security concerns.
    We support triennial reviews of regulations for rail car 
inspections and standards for freight car safety, because regular 
reviews drive good regulatory policy and outcomes.
    We support the Federal Railroad Administration's (FRA) Confidential 
Close Call Reporting System (C3RS). Norfolk Southern participates in 
the C3RS Working Group that is part of the Department of 
Transportation's Railroad Safety Advisory Committee.
    We support accelerating the phaseout of older tank car models, 
research into advanced tank car design, and additional funding for 
research and development on next-generation early-warning sensor 
technologies.
    There are other aspects of the proposed legislation that we support 
in principle. Establishing performance standards, maintenance 
standards, and alert thresholds for safety sensors is one example. We 
have already committed to work with the industry to develop additional 
data-based best practices in these areas, and we welcome constructive 
discussion with stakeholders to craft effective and practical 
legislation.
    There are also areas in which we believe Congress could go further 
with safety legislation. We encourage even stricter standards for tank 
car design. There are significant opportunities for advanced technology 
to enhance rail safety, and we encourage Congress to consider 
additional research into on-board rail car defect detection technology.
    We support increasing fines and penalties for persons found 
tampering with railroad facilities and safety equipment, such as grade 
crossing warning devices, wayside detectors, or signal boxes. We 
support codifying and enhancing the FRA's confidential close car 
reporting system. And we support new requirements to ensure utility 
installations in railroads rights-of-way are conducted safely.
VI. Conclusion
    Finally, Chairwoman Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of 
the Committee, I want to state again how deeply sorry we are for the 
impact of this derailment on East Palestine and the surrounding 
communities. We are making progress in the recovery and know our work 
is not yet done. On behalf of the more than 19,700 hard-working 
employees of Norfolk Southern, I pledge that we won't be finished until 
we make it right. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you 
today, and I look forward to your questions.

    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Mr. Shaw. We will now turn to 
Mr. Jefferies. And welcome, Mr. Jefferies.

                  STATEMENT OF IAN JEFFERIES,

             PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

               ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN RAILROADS

    Mr. Jefferies. Good morning and thank you for the 
opportunity to be here today. Let me start by extending my 
sympathy to the residents of East Palestine and surrounding 
areas. February's derailment is a stark reminder that as rare 
as one is, a significant rail incident's impact on the affected 
community can be extraordinary.
    And while nothing I say here today can undo the impacts of 
any rail incident, it is important that we have a clear-eyed 
discussion about the state of rail safety and steps that have 
been taken or could be taken.
    As we know, Norfolk Southern is continuing cleanup efforts 
in East Palestine, while the NTSB's meticulous investigation is 
ongoing. While those parties will continue to address matters 
related to that incident, today I will provide a broader 
perspective.
    Let me be clear, railroads work every day to improve safety 
toward an ultimate goal of zero incidents and zero injuries. 
That starts with our employees, whose commitment to moving 
America's freight 24 seven and doing it safely should be 
commended.
    Post-pandemic hiring efforts continue, with our employee 
base currently the highest it has been in over 3 years. And 
because a well-maintained railroad is a safe railroad, the over 
$20 billion in annual investments back into the physical 
network have resulted in the Nation's highest rated 
infrastructure by the American Society of Civil Engineers.
    The result? Rail is by far the safest way to move goods on 
land, especially hazardous materials. Per carload, the hazmat 
accident rate is down 78 percent since 2000, and 2022 saw the 
lowest rate of hazmat incidents in the entire industry's 
history. Additionally, FRA data show class I railroad's 
mainline accident rate in 2022 was at an all-time low, as was 
the employee injury rate.
    But that does little to comfort a community that 
experiences a significant derailment, and that is why we must 
continue to apply lessons learned and take steps to drive the 
industry's accident rate even lower. Every train trip provides 
learning tools for the future. To that end, railroads 
consistently invest in technologies and take action without 
waiting for Government requirements.
    Consider two recent actions. First, following an industry 
wide analysis, railroads are installing approximately 1,000 
additional wayside hotbox detectors on the national network, 
standardizing critical alert thresholds for these systems, and 
analyzing and adopting new industry standards for trending 
analysis protocols to preempt potential problems.
    The vast network of these and other wayside detection 
systems exist today because railroads installed them 
voluntarily, not because of Government intervention. And just 2 
weeks ago, upon learning that a segment of new cars on the 
network could be prone to derailment causing loose wheels sets, 
the industry took immediate action to take them out of service 
until those wheels sets are replaced.
    Myriad tools and methods are used every day to prevent 
incidents. Positive train control is fully implemented in 
helping prevent catastrophic accidents. Automated track 
inspection that sees into the track, as well as machine 
visioning and onboard sensors, all improve safety. Yet 
prevention is just one part of the three-legged safety stool, 
along with mitigation and response.
    On the former, the industry has a well-documented history 
of petitioning for stronger tank car standards. We are also 
committed to working with our partners and Congress to get 
older tank cars off the network.
    On response, first let me recognize Mr. Comstock here today 
and every first responder who tended to the accident in East 
Palestine. These individuals, like all firefighters who respond 
to rail incident, should be commended for their service. To do 
their jobs, though, they need proper training and tools, and 
thus the industry is reinforcing its training programs and 
expanding access to information.
    This year, railroads will train 20,000 first responders in 
communities across the country, while the industry can provide 
another 2,000 first responders with free, in-depth training at 
our world class facility in Colorado.
    This week, we launched a pilot program directly targeting 
emergency communications centers to promote broader access to 
AskRail, which provides first responders real time information 
about the contents of every car on a train and the safe 
handling of those contents in the event of an accident.
    Congress can support this effort by helping increase 
awareness of AskRail in your communities, and we ask for your 
help in getting the word out. In closing, railroads are fully 
committed to safety advancement through our own actions and 
working collaboratively.
    We support data driven policies with demonstrable safety 
benefits, including the goals of legislative provisions before 
this committee and look forward to working together. Thank you 
for your time, and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Jefferies follows:]

  Prepared Statement of Ian Jefferies, President and Chief Executive 
               Officer, Association of American Railroads
Introduction
    On behalf of the members of the Association of American Railroads, 
thank you for the opportunity to discuss rail safety and the 
transportation of hazardous materials by rail. AAR's freight railroad 
members account for the vast majority of railroad mileage, employees, 
and freight traffic in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
    Let me make absolutely clear at the outset: for freight railroads, 
pursuing safe operations is not an option, it's an imperative. 
Railroads know that families deserve to feel safe within their 
communities. That's why railroads are steadfastly committed to 
solutions-oriented steps to prevent accidents from occurring. Data from 
the Federal Railroad Administration confirm that rail safety has 
improved substantially over the years.
    Unfortunately, the recent train accident in East Palestine, Ohio, 
has led some to question railroads' commitment to safe operations and 
their ability to operate safely. Railroads know they have to restore 
confidence and demonstrate that nothing is more important to them than 
the safety of their employees, their customers, and the communities in 
which they operate. Every rail accident is one too many, and railroads' 
ultimate goal is to eliminate accidents altogether.
    Actions speak louder than words, of course, which is why railroads 
will continue to take meaningful actions, as they've been doing for 
many years, to enhance safety. These actions will continue to be driven 
by good-faith, cooperative efforts with policymakers, suppliers, 
customers, and rail employees; sustained private investment in 
infrastructure, equipment, and safety technologies; the modernization 
of operating and maintenance practices; effective employee training; 
and steadfast adherence to pertinent laws and regulations.
    As I will explain below, in the wake of the East Palestine 
accident, railroads have pledged to take additional measures that will 
further enhance the safety of rail operations.
Rail Safety Data Reflects Safety Gains
    Statistics from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) confirm 
that the past decade has been the safest in rail history. A few 
examples:

  <bullet> The overall train accident rate was 28 percent lower in 2022 
        than in 2000.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ FRA data for 2022 are preliminary. Train accident rates are 
usually represented in terms of accidents per million train-miles. A 
million train-miles is roughly equivalent to 300 train-trips across the 
country.

  <bullet> The accident rate for trains traveling on railroad 
        mainlines--that is, outside of rail yards--was 44 percent lower 
        in 2022 than in 2000. For Class I freight railroads, the 
        mainline accident rate was down 49 percent from 2000 and set a 
        new record low in 2022.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Class I freight railroads are those with 2021 revenue of at 
least $944 million. There are currently seven Class I freight 
railroads. Collectively, they account for approximately 95 percent of 
U.S. freight rail revenue.

  <bullet> The overall train derailment rate fell 31 percent from 2000 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        to 2022.

  <bullet> The rate of train accidents caused by track defects fell 55 
        percent from 2000 to 2022 and set a new record low in 2022.

  <bullet> The rate of accidents caused by equipment defects (mainly 
        locomotives and freight cars) fell 21 percent from 2000 to 
        2022.

  <bullet> As discussed further below, based on preliminary data, the 
        hazardous materials accident rate in 2022 was 78 percent lower 
        than in 2000 and set at an all-time record low.

  <bullet> From 2000 through 2022, the employee injury rate was down 49 
        percent.\3\ For Class I railroads, the decline was 63 percent, 
        with 2022 setting a new record low. According to data from the 
        Department of Labor, railroads have lower employee injury rates 
        than most other major industries, including trucking, airlines, 
        agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and construction--even 
        lower than grocery stores.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Rail employee injury rates are usually referred to in terms of 
100 full-time employee equivalents.

    There is more work to do, but FRA's data make clear that railroads 
employees' strong safety culture, paired with the sustained, 
disciplined investments in maintenance and technologies that target the 
primary causes of accidents, have delivered meaningfully improved 
safety.
Railroads Safely Move Large Amounts of Hazardous Materials Every Day
    Most commodities carried by rail pose little or no threat to anyone 
or anything, but some commodities are classified as hazardous. In a 
typical year, U.S. railroads transport approximately 2.2 million 
carloads of hazardous materials. Depending on the year, hazardous 
materials account for 7 percent to 8 percent of rail carloads. Ethanol, 
crude oil, and propane make up the highest volume of hazardous material 
carried by rail, but countless other hazmat products that are 
indispensable to our Nation's economy, health, and standard of living 
are also moved by rail.
    Railroads are the safest mode for transporting hazardous materials. 
Rail hazmat accident rates--accidents that result in hazmat releases as 
a percentage of total hazmat carloads--fell 78 percent from 2000 to 
2022. In 2022, there were just 11 train accidents that involved the 
release of hazardous materials, with just 19 hazmat carloads releasing 
their contents.\4\ According to the Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics, the last fatality caused by hazardous materials transported 
by rail in the United States occurred more than a decade ago. That 
safety record compares very favorably to hazardous materials moved on 
highways.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ An accident involving hazmat can lead to the release of product 
from more than one railcar.
    \5\ https://www.bts.gov/content/hazardous-materials-fatalities-
injuries-accidents-and-property-damage-data

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Today, well over 99.9 percent of rail hazmat shipments reach their 
destination without a release caused by a train accident. The rail 
industry will not rest until it can eliminate the accidents that 
remain. Until that day, the industry will continue to take measures to 
meaningfully boost safety, prepare communities, and make them whole 
following any incident.
    Railroads want all their shipments to travel safely, but they have 
consistently taken concrete steps dedicated specifically to making 
hazmat transportation safer and hazmat accident response and mitigation 
more effective. Examples include:

  <bullet> Railroads, several Federal agencies, and outside experts 
        collaborated several years ago to produce the web-based 
        ``AskRail'' app. AskRail allows emergency responders to input 
        the identification number of a particular rail car and 
        immediately determine the commodity contained in that car, its 
        hazard class, emergency response information associated with 
        the commodity, and other information. Emergency responders in 
        East Palestine used AskRail to quickly obtain information on 
        the railcars involved in that accident.

  <bullet> When an accident involving hazmat occurs, railroads follow 
        strict protocols. They work closely with the Environmental 
        Protection Agency (EPA), the National Transportation Safety 
        Board (NTSB), relevant state and local authorities, and outside 
        experts to contain the situation as quickly as possible; 
        protect the health and safety of nearby residents and the 
        environment; and remediate impacts. A variety of laws and their 
        accompanying regulations give the EPA and other agencies a 
        comprehensive framework to ensure that railroad hazmat spills 
        are properly addressed.

  <bullet> Railroads provide thorough information to emergency response 
        agencies on hazardous materials moving through their cities and 
        towns.\6\ They also equip train dispatchers and crews with 
        information about hazmat on individual trains and contact lists 
        for local emergency responders along a train's route.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ Providing open, unfettered access to the precise location and 
contents of every train could make those carrying hazardous materials a 
target for terrorist attacks, which is why railroads limit this 
information sharing to bona-fide emergency response agencies.

  <bullet> Railroads and several Federal agencies jointly developed the 
        Rail Corridor Risk Management System (RCRMS), a sophisticated 
        statistical routing model that incorporates 27 risk factors 
        (including hazmat volume, trip length, and population density 
        along the route) to aid railroads in identifying the safest and 
        most secure rail routes for transporting high risk hazardous 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        materials.

  <bullet> Railroads help communities develop and evaluate emergency 
        response plans. They also provide training for more than 20,000 
        emergency responders each year through their own efforts and 
        through the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency 
        Response Program (TRANSCAER).

  <bullet> Railroads provide hazmat awareness training to all employees 
        who are involved in hazmat transportation. Rail employees 
        responsible for emergency hazmat response efforts receive far 
        more in-depth training. Railroads also have hazmat response 
        contractors and environmental consultants on call 24/7.

  <bullet> Around half of all hazardous materials, and nearly all TIH 
        materials\7\, are transported in tank cars. All but a tiny 
        fraction of the approximately 437,000 tank cars in the North 
        American rail car fleet are owned by rail customers and leasing 
        companies, not by railroads. Tank cars built today are vastly 
        improved over earlier generations, with higher grade steel, 
        better thermal protection, improved valves and fittings, often 
        thicker tanks, and other improvements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ ``Toxic inhalation hazard'' (TIH) materials--gases or liquids, 
such as chlorine and anhydrous ammonia, that are especially hazardous 
if released into the atmosphere--are a subset of hazardous materials. 
U.S. railroads carry around 65,000 TIH carloads in a typical year.

  <bullet> Railroads work closely with chemical manufacturers in the 
        Chemical Transportation Emergency Center (Chemtrec), a 24/7 
        resource for emergency responders that provides access to 
        chemical product, medical and toxicology experts and assists in 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        the mitigation of hazmat incidents.

  <bullet> Railroads provide services (e.g., lodging, food) to those 
        displaced by rail hazmat accidents and establish assistance 
        centers and claims teams to assess and meet the needs of 
        displaced community members. Railroads also reimburse local, 
        state, and Federal authorities for the costs associated with 
        their response and cleanup efforts.
Renewed Efforts to Prevent Rail Accidents
    One of the keyways railroads have reduced accidents is through 
significant and consistent investments back into their networks. From 
1980 to 2022, freight railroads spent more than $780 billion--of their 
own funds, not government funds--on capital expenditures and 
maintenance expenses related to locomotives, freight cars, tracks, 
bridges, tunnels and other infrastructure and equipment. That's more 
than 40 cents out of every revenue dollar. The vast majority of these 
investments have improved rail safety directly or indirectly. In fact, 
for many of these investments, improving safety is a primary reason the 
investments were made. Massive rail spending back into their networks 
will continue.
    Railroads have also made huge investments in modern safety-
enhancing technology. These include sophisticated detectors along 
tracks that identify defects on passing rail cars; specialized vehicles 
that detect defects in tracks and in the ground underneath tracks; and 
drones that can inspect hard-to-reach areas. Railroads have also fully 
implemented positive train control (PTC) systems that automatically 
stop or slow trains before certain accidents occur.
    On March 8, U.S. Class I railroads collectively announced a new 
initiative to expand the use of technology to improve safety. This 
initiative has five key components.
    First, railroads have long recognized the risk posed by overheated 
wheel bearings. That's why, beginning many years ago, railroads 
voluntarily installed thousands of ``hot bearing detectors'' (HBDs) 
across their networks. HBDs use infrared temperature sensors to monitor 
the temperature of bearing housing as railcars pass by. Railroads have 
also voluntarily installed acoustic bearing detectors along many of 
their tracks. These detectors can identify potential wheel problems 
based on the noise created by bearings that may be starting to fail.
    For more than 30 years, Class I railroads have voluntarily spaced 
HBDs no more than 40 miles apart on key routes. In recent years, 
average HBD spacing has fallen well below 40 miles. On March 8, Class I 
railroads announced plans to install approximately 1,000 new HBDs so 
that the HBD spacing on key routes will be reduced to no more than 15 
miles on routes that do not have acoustic bearing or similar defect-
detection technology.
    Moreover, Class I railroads have agreed to a new industry standard 
that calls for stopping trains and inspecting bearings whenever the 
temperature reading from an HBD exceeds 170 degrees above ambient 
temperature. This new ``critical temperature threshold'' is 
substantially lower than the previous industry norm.
    HBDs have been in use for many years, but only relatively recently 
have software and data processing capabilities evolved enough to allow 
``trend analysis'' of readings from multiple HBDs over time. Class I 
railroads have agreed to engage in a collaborative, fast-tracked effort 
to identify best practices associated with trend analysis to make it 
more effective at proactively detecting potential bearing problems.
    Second, all seven Class I railroads have agreed to join the FRA's 
voluntary ``Confidential Close Call Reporting System (C3RS). Class I 
railroads have long had mechanisms in place for their employees to 
provide confidential feedback on safety issues, but railroads will use 
the C3RS program to supplement their existing programs. Railroads will 
work cooperatively with the FRA and labor representative to improve the 
effectiveness of C3RS.
    Third, in 2023, railroads will train roughly 20,000 first 
responders in local communities across the country on accident 
mitigation. In addition, the industry will facilitate the training of 
2,000 first responders at the Security and Emergency Response Training 
Center (SERTC) facility in Colorado. SERTC's world-renowned program 
offers an immersive experience with full-scale training scenarios that 
prepare first responders for real-world surface transportation 
emergencies. SERTC is a member of the National Domestic Preparedness 
Consortium (NDPC), which fully funds local, state, tribal and 
territorial first responders to attend any of SERTC's DHS/FEMA-
certified courses.
    Fourth, the rail industry is intensifying its efforts to get the 
AskRail app into the hands of first responders. Railroads will 
interface with emergency communication centers to promote broader 
access to the app, rather than relying solely on individual downloads. 
Railroads are also targeting all 50 state fire associations. The 
industry's goal is to double the number of first responders who have 
access to the tool by the end of 2023.
    Fifth, following a recent safety advisory from the NTSB, the AAR's 
Tank Car Committee is accelerating the work of a dedicated task force 
that has been investigating the use of heat-resistant gaskets for tanks 
transporting flammable liquid. The task force, comprised of 
representative from railroads, equipment owners, and tank car 
manufacturers, will expand its scope to consider all fire performance 
improvements to service equipment.
    Since the March 8th announcement, the industry, lead by Norfolk 
Southern, determined that a specific model and series of railcars had 
loose wheels, which could cause a derailment and that these came from a 
series of recently acquired cars from a specific manufacturer. Upon 
inspection of other cars from this series, additional cases of unusual 
wheel movement were found and the industry took immediate action--not 
waiting on the DOT or other regulators--and ordered the remove these 
cars from service until their wheelsets could be replaced. This is a 
prime example of the industry stepping up and taking action whenever a 
critical safety issue is discovered.
Looking Ahead
    Rail is the safest way to move hazardous materials, but railroads 
fully appreciate that public trust in railroads' ability to operate 
safely must be restored through action. Until they achieve their goal 
of zero accidents, railroads will maintain a fierce commitment to 
getting there. Railroads wholeheartedly agree that policymakers have a 
key role to play in this effort, and railroads will continue to work in 
good faith with policymakers at all levels of government to identify 
ways to genuinely improve rail safety performance.
    That said, it is unfortunate that, in the aftermath of the accident 
in East Palestine, some policymakers, pundits, and others have asserted 
that railroads broadly oppose increased safety regulations. This is 
categorically false. Railroads have consistently advocated, and 
continue to advocate, for data-driven solutions that would effectively 
increase the safety of the rail network.
    Some rail efforts have been successful, such the push for the 
Department of Transportation to enhance tank car standards for 
flammable liquids. Other rail efforts, like expanding the use of 
automated track inspection technologies that have proven to be far more 
effective than traditional manual inspections, have been hamstrung by 
the FRA and are impeding the industry's efforts to improve safety.
    Railroads are also disappointed that some are using the East 
Palestine accident to push for policy changes that have little or 
nothing to do with rail safety and, if enacted previously, would not 
have prevented the accident or made railroads safer. Railroads also 
respectfully urge policymakers to remember that laws and regulations, 
however well intended, that place excessive and unnecessary operational 
burdens on railroads would distort competition in the freight 
transportation marketplace and divert freight from railroads to less 
safe alternatives. If this happened, overall transportation safety 
would be reduced, not enhanced.
Conclusion
    Our nation's freight railroads share this committee's and the 
public's urgency in augmenting the safety of all rail transportation. 
Railroads are committed to continuing our work with local, state, and 
Federal officials; their employees; their customers; their supplies; 
and other stakeholders to identify additional safety enhancing steps 
that will make this happen.

    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. We--I am going to defer my first 
round of questioning to let Senator Klobuchar, who has been 
here on the whole morning, and we thank her for her interest in 
all of this. Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you very much. I was, like 
everyone here, horrified by what happened. And actually, when 
you look at the numbers, trains derailed 1,164 times last year, 
up 17 percent in the last decade. 29 of those derailments were 
actually in my state. And in 2022, 817 people across the 
country were killed in rail accidents, 266 in railroad crossing 
collisions. So, clearly, there is reason to go forward 
immediately with Senator Brown and Senator Vance's legislation, 
and to help in Ohio.
    I guess I would start with you, Mr. Shaw. Norfolk 
Southern's accident rate jumped 76 percent between 2013 and 
2022. And could you just briefly explain why, and if you 
support the legislation that our colleagues have proposed?
    Mr. Shaw. Yes, Senator, thank you for that question. We are 
a safe railroad. The number of derailments on Norfolk Southern 
last year was the lowest in the last two decades. We are 
committed to getting better. And so, yes, there are many 
provisions within the Vance-Brown bill for which we give our 
full-throated endorsement.
    Senator Klobuchar. And then do you support the bill?
    Mr. Shaw. I support a number of provisions within the bill, 
Senator, which include the----
    Senator Klobuchar. Which ones don't you support?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, we support the acceleration of the 
phasing of the DT117s, funding first responder hazmat training, 
expanding advanced notification----
    Senator Klobuchar. OK, I will--I will just put it in 
writing. I was just trying to figure out which ones you didn't 
support and why, because I just think it is very important to 
move ahead. They have signaled an interest in working with all 
stakeholders to try to get this done, and I just don't want 
this to be one of these moments where we wait 2 years to pass a 
bill.
    Chief Comstock, thank you for your work. We have--are 
greatly, greatly appreciated of the first responders, 
firefighters, and everything that you did not only in this 
incident, but across the country.
    So, Senator Cramer and I today are introducing a bill, the 
honoring our Fallen Heroes Act to start looking at making sure 
that our firefighters who already have a register going on as 
you know, that a bunch of us worked on, but to making sure that 
this is included in their benefits, the exposure and the 
certain cancers.
    And we think we are going to get a lot of support for this 
bill. Actually, it is specifically targeted, written in a way 
that we think is going to be good. So, could you talk about 
what some key information you wished you had before arriving at 
the scene of the derailment?
    Mr. Comstock. I think in any instance that when responders 
are proceeding to a scene of an emergency, we want to have as 
much information as we can.
    And whether it is a car accident, whether it is a medical 
emergency, house fire, or hazardous materials incident. So, the 
more information and the quicker we can get information, the 
better. There are apps out there that have been discussed, 
AskRail being one, that provide that type of information.
    But I think we could go further by looking at newer 
technology that will put that information that is available in 
AskRail on my phone while I am in route to the emergency. That 
is one instance. But I understand that there is a lot of other 
issues that need to be looked at----
    Senator Klobuchar. And also, to be alerted of what toxic 
chemicals are in there, so you know what you need.
    Mr. Comstock. Everything.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK.
    Mr. Comstock. And the more the better. But I think that the 
fire service needs a seat at that table, with the railroads, in 
developing the technology that is going to help us out.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK, thank you. Railway safety, another 
part of this, of course. Mr. Jefferies, with railway workers 
being exposed to a range of serious risks, what is the industry 
doing to improve worker safety?
    Mr. Jefferies. Well, there are a myriad of regulatory 
requirements around worker safety under the railway safety--
excuse me, under the Federal Railroad Administration. 
Certainly, we comply with all of those.
    I know, Alan, and my other CEOs have made a very concerted 
effort to get out in the field. And a lot of that is hearing 
firsthand, what is working, what is not from the employees in 
the field, because they are the ones who are seeing what is 
going on every day.
    So that firsthand information that feeds up through 
management and through the executives can really drive 
decisionmaking. The important thing is that we do take a 
holistic approach to safety.
    And the evidence we have seen, as I mentioned, 2022 had the 
lowest employee injury rate in our industry's history, but that 
is not zero. So, we have got to continue to look for 
opportunities to further provide safe working conditions.
    Senator Klobuchar. Right. Do you want to add anything to 
that, Ms. Homendy?
    Ms. Homendy. We do have rail workers safety on our most 
wanted list of transportation safety improvements. And one of 
the--actually, we have several recommendations that do not 
support the use by the railroads of train approach warning.
    What that is, is when roadway workers are working on the 
track, they put a watchman out and a train, as a train comes 
along, the watchman is supposed to flag it for those who are 
working on the track and they get off the track.
    We have seen several instances where that hasn't happened 
and they have died, unfortunately. And there are other options. 
For example, using positive train control after establishing an 
established work zone. So, we have recommendations on that.
    Senator Klobuchar. All right. And I am going to follow up 
in writing. My colleagues, I know, all have questions on the 
hazmat training, Mr. Comstock, because I understand it is 
difficult sometimes for firefighters to attend this kind of 
training, and what we can do, and have many other questions. 
So, thank you very much, all of you.
    Chair Cantwell. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you to each of 
the witnesses who are here today. Chief Comstock, please--thank 
you for your service, and please express my gratitude to the 
men and women who are first responders who were there when this 
horrific tragedy occurred.
    And thank you for their courage and the difference that 
each of them makes in the community. Chair Homendy, let me 
thank you also for the professional way in which the NTSB has 
approached this accident. I think you have been a truth teller. 
I think you have managed to avoid politics and focus on the 
substance of what caused this accident and how we can prevent 
it.
    And so, it is not that often that we get to thank a public 
official for doing a good and effective job. I think you 
provided also some helpful suggestions in your testimony that I 
am certain the Committee will look closely at the specific 
suggestions you put forward. As I look at what caused this 
derailment, there are a number of factors, but one factor that 
from the early reports stands out is the hotbox detectors.
    We now know that the train derailed past three hotbox 
detectors prior to the derailment. 30 miles away, the reading 
was 38 degrees above ambient temperature. Then 20 miles away, 
it had risen to 103 degrees above ambient temperature. So, it 
had risen dramatically.
    And then just prior to the derailment, it was 253 degrees 
above ambient temperature, reflecting that the bearing had 
locked and derailment was imminent. Mr. Shaw, why did this 
trend in temperature not trigger an alert earlier to stop the 
train? And in particular, why were you not able to stop the 
train after the second reading had gone from 38 degrees above 
ambient temperature to 103 degrees above ambient temperature?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, thank you for that question. I will note 
that the NTSB report indicated that the crew did nothing wrong, 
and we certainly thank them for that.
    The hot box detectors were working as designed and there 
were no track defects. Since the derailment and the preliminary 
results of the NTSB report, we led the rail industry and the 
rail industry has also implemented--implementation of far more 
hotbox detectors across our network.
    We are adding 200 hot box detectors on our network to 
reduce the spacing between our hot box detectors. Our hot box 
detectors are already spaced amongst the lowest in the 
industry. And I think, Mr. Jefferies had indicated that the 
entire industry was adding about 1,000 hot box detectors.
    Senator Cruz. Mr. Shaw, perhaps you didn't hear my 
question, so let me ask it again. The first hot box measured 38 
degrees above ambient temperature. As I understand, the ambient 
temperature was about 20 degrees, so that was roughly 58 
degrees.
    Ten miles later, the second hot box measured 103 degrees 
above ambient temperature. That is an increase of over 60 
degrees in ten miles. Why did Norfolk Southern not stop the 
train then and examine the bearing to make sure that it didn't 
melt the axle and that you didn't have a derailment? If you 
would stopped then, it would have prevented the derailment.
    So, my question is, why did the second hot box reading not 
trigger action?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, my understanding is that that second 
reading was still below our alarm threshold, which is amongst 
the lowest in the industry. In response to this, the industry 
has agreed to work together to share best practices with 
respect to hot box detectors, trending technology, and 
thresholds.
    Senator Cruz. So, when you and I visited my office 
yesterday, you said your threshold is now 170 degrees above 
ambient temperature. As I understand it, at the time of the 
derailment, your threshold was 200 degrees above ambient 
temperature. So, you are right, 103 was not 200 degrees.
    As you and I discussed, I have spoken with your 
competitors, other class I railroads who have indicated that 
trending technology and algorithms can measure significant 
changes in temperature, and in particular, can flag that when 
it goes from 38 degrees to 103 degrees, you need to stop and 
take a look at it.
    Mr. Jefferies, let me ask you, in terms of how other 
railroads handle it. What is the technology that is available 
to spot this problem before it has gotten so bad that a 
derailment is imminent?
    Mr. Jefferies. Well, thank you for that. And that is a 
spot-on question. And that is one of the three things we are 
focused on as an industry. So, one is the physical deployment 
of approximately 1,000 additional detectors. Two is creating 
the industry standard of 170 degrees as a critical threshold.
    And the third one is really looking at industry best 
practices to examine and potentially adopt new algorithms for 
trending detection so that if there is a dramatic spike in 
temperature, even though it may be below that absolute 
threshold, it is caught.
    And so, we brought the entire industry together, and over 
the next month we will be reporting out, OK, what can we learn 
from each other, and what are the best practices we can adopt, 
and what other steps need to be taken based on the information 
we have and the predictive analytics we can put into place.
    Senator Cruz. And if I could ask one final question---oh, 
Mr. Whitaker. Sure. I didn't see that, but sure, I would 
welcome you.
    Mr. Whitaker. Thanks for acknowledging, Senator Cruz. I 
would like to just make note that trending defect detect 
technology, from being in the cab of a locomotive, when we pass 
a defect detector, it trends to an office like Norfolk Southern 
in Atlanta, Georgia.
    It doesn't convey to the railroad crews, which is a problem 
in this incident, as well as many others, that still continue 
to this day. What we need as a train crew, which they say they 
listen--they haven't been listening for quite a while.
    We need to be notified whenever these trending detectors 
are seeing this car trend hotter, that way we can keep a better 
eye on it or even stop and inspect that railcar.
    Senator Cruz. Sure.
    Mr. Whitaker. But as it stands right now, even after East 
Palestine, it is all about moving the train. That is all PSR 
is. That is all they care about. So, right now, they tell the 
train crew to stop your train, set your brakes in a full-
service application, then release. And hopefully that releases 
whatever the case may be. When the safest cause case should be, 
we stop and go back and inspect. That is what the conductor is 
there for. That is why a two-person crew is essential.
    Senator Cruz. So that is very helpful. So, you are saying, 
if I am hearing you right, that having real time reporting of 
what the sensors are showing for the conductor, the engineer 
would be helpful. Mr. Jefferies, are there technological 
barriers, are there impediments to giving the crew real time 
reporting of what is happening?
    Mr. Jefferies. So, I can't get into the technicalities of 
that, but I will say one thing, we are focused on with any sort 
of regulatory requirement on wayside detectors themselves is 
that we do need to be given the opportunity to evolve our 
technology because continuous onboard detection is the next 
phase of sensors and detection. And so, certainly that is 
something we are interested in, and interested in further 
deploying and further developing.
    Senator Cruz. As we are drafting this legislation, I would 
ask you to please, if there are technological issues we should 
know about, please let us know, because I have to say what Mr. 
Whitaker said there makes a lot of sense to me.
    And if there is a reason it is not yet feasible, we need to 
know about it, because that seems to me a reasonable element 
for legislation. Mr. Whitaker, yes, my time is gone, but yes, 
go ahead, Mr. Whitaker.
    Senator Cruz. I apologize, but I do think it is very 
important to shed some light on this. It is feasible. The 
technology is there. Several days after East Palestinian, we 
almost had a similar incident in Cleveland area on Norfolk 
Southern. The crew, the defect detectors said no defects to the 
crew.
    The train dispatcher came along and said, hey, we have a 
report of a trending defect detector on the train. We need you 
to stop and inspect it. Immediately after that, the chief 
dispatcher, which is the person that controls the whole 
railroad, told them to keep going.
    If it were not for an Eastbound train passing them and 
instructing them, hey, your train is on fire, stop your train, 
and we set that car out--they had a walking speed, this car, of 
five miles. So, the technology is there, they are just raising 
and lowering their thresholds to move freight.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Senator Markey.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Madam Chair. It is clear that 
for too long, the rail industry has been raking in profits and 
putting safety on the sidelines. Mr. Whitaker, do you agree 
that the East Palestine derailment would have been far worse if 
there hadn't been multiple crew members on board?
    Mr. Whitaker. I do you, sir. Thank you for the question. I 
think if the railroads had it their way, down to one person 
crew, and they reduced the conductor position to ground based, 
meaning a person had a pickup truck driving to the site, that 
puts the engineer in danger. It also puts the response time and 
the assessment of the issue in danger.
    Senator Markey. So, if there was only one crew member on 
that train, do you think it could have been far worse?
    Mr. Whitaker. Oh, absolutely.
    Senator Markey. Absolutely. And that is why my Safe Freight 
Act would require trains to have at least two crew members. And 
I am proud that my legislation has been included in the 
bipartisan Rail Safety Act. Mr. Shaw, will you commit to 
supporting legislation requiring at least two person crews on 
all freight trains?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, we will commit to using research and 
technology to ensure the railroad operates safely.
    Senator Markey. Will you commit to a two-person crew on all 
trains?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, we are a data driven organization, and I 
am not aware of any data that links crew size with safety.
    Senator Markey. Do you--do you disagree with Mr. Whitaker 
when he says that it would have been far worse? His testimony 
is loud and clear. It would have been worse if only one person 
as a crew on that train. Do you disagree with him?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I believe that we have operations 
infrastructure on the ground to respond to derailments.
    Senator Markey. I think you are not answering the question. 
It is almost like the last hearing all over again, because I 
think the evidence is very clear that these trains can be 
absolutely safer, but that technology is no replacement for 
human beings. For example, it can't perform the cognitive 
functions of a conductor and can't collect visual cues during 
an emergency.
    Two person crews make our trains safer, and I wish that you 
would commit to that today, because I think it is pretty 
obvious that that is the correct answer. And I just get sick of 
industry executives talking about supporting the principles of 
regulation while they lobby against common sense regulations 
like this one behind the scenes.
    Again, let me move back over to you, Mr. Whitaker. The 
safety issues that plague our Nation's rail system are not a 
mysterious and inexplicable phenomenon. They are a direct 
result of business decisions.
    So, Mr. Whitaker, do you agree that the rail industry, 
including Norfolk Southern, has a business model that 
prioritizes profit over safety?
    Mr. Whitaker. Thank you for the question. Yes, that 
business model is precision scheduled railroading.
    Senator Markey. So those safety issues are not just a 
threat to the communities where rail companies operate, they 
are a threat to rail workers. In the wake of the East Palestine 
disaster, Norfolk Southern failed to provide proper protective 
equipment to the workers who cleaned up the derailment site. 
That is appalling.
    Mr. Whitaker, do you agree that rail workers should have 
the ability to collectively stop work when conditions threaten 
their health and safety consistent with the Federal Railroad 
Safety Act?
    Mr. Whitaker. Thank you for the question. Yes, I do believe 
workers should be able to stop any and all work whenever their 
safety is in danger, except as it stands right now, we would be 
retaliated against.
    Senator Markey. And why would you be retaliated against?
    Mr. Whitaker. Because we don't have protections on that 
level.
    Senator Markey. So, Mr. Shaw, do you agree that rail 
workers should be able to collectively stop work in unsafe and 
unhealthy conditions consistent with the Federal Railroad 
Safety Act?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I absolutely would expect our employees 
to operate in a safe manner. And if they are concerned about 
the safety of their operations, then I would expect them to 
address that.
    Senator Markey. Well, the real workers are saying that your 
company has failed to ensure their health and safety, and they 
fear retribution, that is what Mr. Whitaker is saying, for 
speaking up. Workers must be able to stand in solidarity in 
order to stay healthy and safe. So, your response is just 
unacceptable, Mr. Shaw, today. And that is why I am working on 
legislation to codify this union right, and I urge my 
colleagues to join with me. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Senator Capito, I think. Oh, 
wait--Senator Vance.
    Senator Vance. All right. Thank you. Thank you all for 
being here. Appreciate your time. Let's start with the NTSB 
Chair Homendy. So, you said in The Washington Post that train 
accidents, ``train accidents in general per million train miles 
are going up.'' So, it is trending upwards, accidents. Is that 
true?
    Ms. Homendy. The yard accidents rates are going up. The 
mainline track rates are going down.
    Senator Vance. OK. Has a spill of vinyl chloride occurred 
before due to a freight train derailment?
    Ms. Homendy. I am sorry?
    Senator Vance. Has a spill of vinyl chloride happened due 
just to one of these derailments?
    Ms. Homendy. Yes, sir. Paulsboro.
    Senator Vance. And do you remember the NTSB's 
recommendations at that time for notification of first 
responders?
    Ms. Homendy. Yes, sir.
    Senator Vance. And what was that?
    Ms. Homendy. We had several recommendations, including 
providing real time information to emergency responders, making 
sure that they were adequately trained and provided the 
appropriate gear, and that they were part of emergency planning 
with the locals and the railroads.
    Senator Vance. And how long ago did you make that 
recommendation?
    Ms. Homendy. 2013 was the accident.
    Senator Vance. OK. So, I will point out that 9 years ago we 
made a recommendation from the NTSB that they should provide 
proper notification to first responders. That still hasn't 
happened. That is one of the reasons, by the way, of why we 
have advanced this legislation. I want to go next to--and thank 
you, Chair Homendy. I want to go next to Mr. Shaw.
    Mr. Shaw, I know that you have some disagreements about the 
precise distances necessary for wayside bearing detectors and 
so forth. But I wonder, could you commit to supporting a 
mandatory standard for hot bearing detectors, even if not our 
specific limits, could you submit two to supporting one in 
principle, assuming we can get the limits right in your view?
    Mr. Shaw. Yes, Senator. I absolutely appreciate your 
leadership and Senator Brown's leadership for the Railway 
Safety Act. As we have talked about, there are a number of 
provisions in your bill with which we support, and it does 
include the wayside detectors.
    As you noted earlier, we are not sure what the correct 
spacing is. It could be 10 miles, it could 15, it could be 7, 
and I would support using science and research, and whatever is 
the right number, we would space wayside detectors in that 
manner.
    Senator Vance. Thank you. Would you commit to supporting 
mandatory first responder notification requirement, as we do in 
the bill?
    Mr. Shaw. Yes, sir, I certainly would. I want to take the 
opportunity to thank the first responders from Ohio and West 
Virginia and Pennsylvania who showed the courage and the 
commitment to the community and rushed to the scene.
    And my appreciation for that is we just launched a regional 
first responder training facility in Ohio this week, and we 
have over 400 first responders who are signed up for it, 
including Chief Dresbach and four of his commanders.
    Senator Vance. Great. Thank you, Mr. Shaw. We will go to 
Mr. Whitaker now. So, the railroad industry claims that visual 
inspections are nearly useless when it comes to journal 
bearings. Do you believe this is true?
    Mr. Whitaker. Thank you for the question. And I believe 
visual inspection is one of the most important aspects of 
inspecting a rail car. Also smell as well.
    Senator Vance. Thank you, Mr. Whitaker. Is it true that 
railroads have used human inspectors for the bulk of their 
history and that a key part for a railcar being inspected is a 
general bearing?
    Mr. Whitaker. That is correct.
    Senator Vance. Can you inspect a railcar adequately in 30 
seconds, Mr. Whitaker, or any of your workers?
    Mr. Whitaker. Absolutely not, sir. I would say a railcar 
would take at least 3 minutes or longer, all in the name of 
safety, especially if it is hauling hazardous materials.
    Senator Vance. Yes. I appreciate that, Mr. Whitaker. And I 
want to pick up there and go to Mr. Jefferies here with the 
minute that I have remaining. The railroads have stated in 
regards to their opposition to tougher inspections,'' increased 
time on a task does not necessarily correlate to increased 
safety.''
    And to be fair, I think that is a fair argument to make. 
Mr. Whitaker just said 3 minutes. I don't think we should be 
mandating 20-minute inspections. If I want to make any 
requirement, we institute a reasonable one, so businesses can 
comply. Mr. Jefferies, would you support a 30 second minimum 
and inspection time?
    Mr. Jefferies. I can't tell you what the right time is. I 
can be focused on outcomes and making sure that we are 
addressing issues. And if there is a systemic or if there is a 
series of cases where failures or malfunctioning equipment 
isn't being caught, we need to address that. And whether that 
is because there is not enough time allowed, because there is 
not appropriate training, because of some other factor, we 
absolutely need to address that.
    Senator Vance. I understand that, but I am trying to get a 
specific commitment here. Do you think, and we just heard from 
Mr. Whitaker that he doesn't even think 30 seconds is enough 
time to properly inspect a railway--or excuse me, properly 
inspect a railcar. Do you think 30 seconds is enough to do an 
inspection? Would you support that as a mandatory requirement?
    Mr. Jefferies. Well, certainly not being the technical 
expert, it seems--30 seconds doesn't seem like a long time to 
do an in-depth inspection.
    Senator Vance. OK. I appreciate that, Mr. Jefferies. Well, 
I am out of time, and I guess Acting Chairman Welch, I yield.
    Senator Welch. Thank you, Senator Vance. I think I am next 
here. Mr. Shaw, Ms. Homendy testified that this was a 
preventable accident. Do you agree?
    Mr. Shaw. Yes, thank you for that question. Yes, I do 
agree. And in this industry----
    Senator Welch. Stop. What should have been done to prevent 
it?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, in this industry, we have to look at 
every accident as if it were preventable. And in this case, we 
know that the Norfolk Southern crew did everything they were 
supposed to do, and we thank them for that.
    We know that the wayside detectors were operating as 
designed. And we know that there were no track defects. We know 
that Chair Homendy's work is focused on a wheel bearing of a 
privately owned railcar that no railroad owns.
    And so, improvements in safety are going to require an 
industry wide approach, which includes car owners, car 
builders, customers, and railroads. And Senator, many of those 
components are included in the Vance bill, the Vance, Brown 
bill.
    Senator Welch. I am just thinking about how Misti Allison 
would try to figure out what you just said. I am asking you, 
Norfolk. You are in charge of that train. Am I right or wrong?
    Mr. Shaw. Yes, sir. That is a Norfolk Southern train, and I 
accept responsibility----
    Senator Welch. And then you said privately built car as 
though somehow that exempted you from the responsibility for 
the inspection, the assurance to the community of East 
Palestine that it was a safe car. You are not saying that, are 
you?
    Mr. Shaw. Sir, that was not my intent. My intent was a 
holistic approach----
    Senator Welch. Here is the question, it is your car. You 
are responsible when the train starts to when the train comes 
into the terminal, correct? You can't point fingers at other 
people. It is your responsibility to be the assurer to the 
community of East Palestine that a train that Norfolk Southern 
owns will pass through its community safely. Is that correct?
    Mr. Shaw. Yes, sir, that is my responsibility.
    Senator Welch. OK. So, you said it was preventable. And 
whose responsibility was it to prevent it?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, in response to this derailment----
    Senator Welch. The rail man, not the company?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, in response to this derailment, Norfolk 
Southern has added wayside detectors in and around of our----
    Senator Welch. Let's just get real here. Whose 
responsibility was it to prevent this preventable accident from 
happening?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, we are responsible for safety on our 
network and working within the entire industry to enhance 
safety.
    Senator Welch. OK, let me understand this. You just 
reluctantly acknowledged, a, it is preventable. And b, it was 
your responsibility to prevent it. Am I incorrect?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I am taking responsibility to enhance 
safety throughout the entire industry.
    Senator Welch. OK. This sounds like a lobbyist response. I 
am taking responsibility. It is like before executives come in 
here, they go to charm school, and they are told to take 
responsibility without taking responsibility. Are you saying 
that it was the responsibility of Norfolk Southern, the company 
you lead, to prevent--to have prevented this accident you 
acknowledged was preventable?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I think about safety each and every day. 
And every day since February 3, I have asked my team what we 
can do----
    Senator Welch. I only have a little more time. Let me ask 
this last question. And I understand that the business plan of 
Norfolk Southern includes $7.5 billion stock buyback that is 
ongoing.
    Do you believe it would be appropriate to suspend the 
buyback program until all of the assurance that you are making 
to this committee and also to the people of East Palestine 
about, ``making this right,'' that that stock buyback program 
should be suspended until you have accomplished what you have 
assured us and what you have assured the people of East 
Palestine that you would do?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, we think about safety every day. We 
spend $1 billion a year in capital on safety, and we have 
ongoing expenses of about $1 billion a year in safety. And as a 
result, over time, derailments are down. Hazardous material 
releases are down. And injuries are down. We can always get 
better----
    Senator Welch. So, you won't answer my question about 
suspending the buyback program?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, stock buybacks never come at the expense 
of safety.
    Senator Welch. Yes, yes. I take that is that you will 
continue with your plan on the buyback. My time has expired. 
The Chair recognizes Senator Thune.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First of all, I want 
to offer my deepest sympathies to the residents of East 
Palestine, as well as express my gratitude for the first 
responders, NTSB investigators, and other officials who arrived 
and have remained on scene since the derailment. Railroads 
remain one of the safest ways of transport, all types of 
freight, including hazardous materials.
    However, the derailment in East Palestine serves as a stern 
reminder of the importance of this committee's vigilance in 
ensuring that agencies and railroads faithfully implement and 
enforce requirements set in place by Congress.
    The strongly bipartisan FAST Act, which was signed into law 
in December 2015, included an expansive hazardous materials 
title, much of it directly responsive to the tragic derailment 
in Lac-Megantic and others like it.
    This title set forth new stringent requirements for the 
operation of high hazard flammable trains and a schedule for 
complete replacement and retrofit of all tank cars carrying 
class 3 flammable liquids, both meant to reduce the impacts of 
future derailments.
    Unfortunately, other rail safety requirements from the FAST 
Act are still pending on the regulatory agenda, something that 
this committee needs to work to correct. I hope the discussion 
today remains focused on solutions directly responsive to what 
we know about the underlying causes of this derailment and 
avoids talk of imposing restrictive requirements that decrease 
the efficiency of rail operations without proven data driven 
benefits to safety.
    Chair Homendy, first of all, I want to thank you and your 
team for NTSB's leadership during the response and ongoing 
investigation of this unfortunate accident.
    In response to a requirement from the Rail Safety 
Improvement Act of 2008, the FRA finalized the risk reduction 
program rulemaking in 2020 and subsequently approved the plan 
submitted by all class I railroads.
    Could you describe why a safety management system like the 
Risk Reduction Program is so important to managing risk and 
improving safety?
    Ms. Homendy. It is critically important and we recommend it 
in all modes of transportation that operators are proactively 
identifying risks and addressing them before tragedies occur. 
And then as well having a just safety culture so that employees 
are emboldened to speak up when safety concerns arise.
    Senator Thune. Mr. Jefferies, Mr. Shaw, could you describe 
the implementation of the Risk Reduction Program by railroads, 
specifically how it complements existing rail safety 
regulations?
    Mr. Jefferies. Thank you, Senator. As you mentioned, all 
seven class I's have RRPs in place that have now been approved 
by the FRA. And I think the basis of them is that each 
railroad, because of the unique operating characteristics of 
that railroad, takes a risk-based approach to addressing 
potential issues on its railroad.
    It allows the opportunity to test out ways to address that, 
and rinse, repeat, and adjust as time goes by versus a more 
command and control, one size fits all. So, we are very early 
in the stage. I think there is an opportunity there to create a 
flexible system that allows for a much more nimble response to 
risk.
    But that story is yet to be told. But I personally think 
there is opportunity there, and I look forward to the railroads 
moving their programs forward.
    Senator Thune. Mr. Comstock, Section 7302 of the FAST Act 
required the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration, or what we refer to as PHMSA, to finalize a 
rule requiring railroads to provide real time emergency 
response information to first responders on trains carrying 
hazardous materials.
    Unfortunately, that last requirement has languished since 
PHMSA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in 2017, 
despite an update a deadline of December 2022 in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
    So, Chief, it seems to me that this type of information 
would have been extremely helpful to the first responders in 
East Palestine. Would you agree?
    Mr. Comstock. Yes, absolutely.
    Senator Thune. And Chair, your testimony mentioned that 
NTSB has several open recommendations to PHMSA related to 
emergency response notification. It seems to me that the agency 
has simply failed to prioritize this rule. Have they provided 
NTSB with a better answer as to why this has been delayed?
    Ms. Homendy. I don't have their response on why that was 
delayed, but I am happy to provide it for the record.
    Senator Thune. That would be great if you could. It seems 
to me at least that is a fundamental--one of the issues, I 
think, that has come out of this, that would have made Mr. 
Comstock's and hopefully something that could have been used to 
avoid and mitigate the damage from this terrible derailment. My 
time has expired----
    Ms. Homendy. Can I add one thing?
    Senator Thune. Yes, yes.
    Ms. Homendy. Just to emphasize what the Chief said, 
operations level training for firefighters. There are different 
levels of training. Most firefighters receive awareness level 
training, which is not appropriate for firefighters. At a 
minimum, they should have operations level training, which is a 
standard, and so just for consideration.
    Senator Thune. OK, very good. Thank you. I will take that 
into consideration.
    Chair Cantwell. Senator Peters.

                STATEMENT OF HON. GARY PETERS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN

    Senator Peters. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I just want to 
start off by thanking all of our panelists for being here 
today. I share the Surface Transportation subcommittee of this 
full committee, and I also want to thank Senator Brown and 
Senator Vance for their leadership on working to improve safety 
of our rail systems. My first question, though, is for you, Mr. 
Shaw.
    And Mr. Shaw, by the way, thank you for your willingness to 
testify here today. Your presence before two different 
committees in Congress this month should certainly underline 
how seriously this body takes not only this incident, but also 
on how important it is for us to enhance rail safety all across 
the industry.
    Over the past few months, Michiganders have seen multiple 
class I railroad derailments in our State, leading to railcars 
hanging off the side of a bridge in the City of Detroit, days 
long passenger rail delays, and near-miss of hazmat incidents. 
Michiganders are watching what is happening in East Palestine 
and are rightly demanding that we do everything in our power to 
prevent it from happening again.
    And I am certainly committed to do that, and I appreciate 
that you have also stated your commitment to safety in your 
testimony here today and in our conversation that we had 
earlier as well. Unfortunately, though, I received data 
yesterday that indicates that Norfolk Southern is not yet 
living up to that commitment.
    A document that I received, which I have right here before 
me, a document I received shows data from Norfolk Southern's 
own internal servers that there are dozens of railcars 
operating on trains, some of which are heading into my state of 
Michigan, that have gone over 5,000 miles without a class I 
brake inspection.
    That is thousands of miles above what the Federal Railroad 
Administration regulations require. Moreover, the documents 
show that over 100 cars have gone over 10,000 miles, and in one 
case, 90,000 miles without a mechanical inspection. And this is 
the data just from two trains.
    So, I suspect we will have data from other trains that we 
look at. So, Mr. Shaw, I would like to know, does Norfolk 
Southern have an internal standard as to how many miles before 
a train needs a full mechanical inspection, and how can you 
account for why your company appears to be running trains right 
now that have not been sufficiently inspected?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, thank you for that question. I am not 
aware of that data. I can assure you that our policies are 
there to promote safety of our train operations and we do not 
allow unsafe railcars to operate.
    Senator Peters. Well, I will be happy to provide what we 
have here, and we appreciate your comments after the hearing. 
One of the explanations that I have heard for inspection issues 
that has been at least raised to me by railroad inspectors is 
that there have been workforce reductions that have reduced the 
frequency and the quality of those inspections. So, does 
Norfolk Southern plan to hire more inspectors to fill this gap 
and to make sure that trains are traveling safely?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I have got a deep appreciation and 
respect for my craft colleagues. And ever since I became CEO in 
the middle of last year, we have been on a hiring spree. We 
hired a near record number of employees last year, and our 
pipeline of conductor trainees is amongst the highest in our 
history right now. And several weeks ago, I reached out to the 
heads of our largest unions and asked them for their assistance 
in helping Norfolk Southern enhance our safety culture.
    Senator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Shaw. Chief Comstock, thank 
you for your leadership and testimony today. In your testimony, 
you called out the importance of passing legislation that I 
have to continue funding for the assistance the Fire 
Firefighters Grant Program and the staffing for adequate Fire 
and Emergency Response Grant Program to ensure that our local 
fire departments have the equipment that they need, the 
training they need, and the personnel to respond to a major 
hazmat incident.
    As you know, I am--I have authored that legislation. It 
will hopefully come before the Senate as early as next week, 
the Fire Grants and Safety Act to increase that funding. Could 
you please discuss how important it is for this legislation to 
pass and how these grants, if they were to expire, would be 
detrimental to small communities like yours and make it really 
nearly impossible to respond to disasters like what we saw in 
East Palestine?
    Mr. Comstock. You are absolutely correct. From the fire 
service perspective, I can't think of any grants that are more 
important than those. From my own department, it has permitted 
us to get radios, to get SCBA, to put a generator in the 
station that we can put the doors up when the electricity goes 
off. Fire departments, particularly small ones, rely on those 
grants every year. They are critical. And without those grants, 
we could not do our jobs.
    Senator Peters. Thank you for your answer. Thank you, Madam 
Chair.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Peters. Senator Capito.

            STATEMENT OF HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    Senator Capito. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you all for 
being here today. Mr. Shaw, thank you for coming to our EPW 
hearing 2 weeks ago. Appreciate that and appreciate everybody 
being here today.
    Mr. Shaw, a question I have on the ordering of your cars. 
It is my understanding that this was 149 railcar train, that on 
the 23rd car was carrying plastic pellets, according to the 
NTSB report, that lit up like a match. And then--and it had 
that overbearing, wheel bearing--I mean the overheating wheel 
bearing.
    And then five cars away were four cars of vinyl chloride. I 
guess, first of all, I would ask if that is correct? And then I 
know that high hazardous flammable trains have more safety 
regulations. Why would this not have been characterized as a 
high hazard flammable train if it had this hazardous materials 
as part of the 149-car train?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, thank you for your question. I am not 
familiar with the entire makeup of the train. I know that a 
highly hazardous train is defined by a certain number of highly 
hazardous cars in it, or it is a certain number of cars in a 
block.
    Senator Capito. Ms. Hamode--Ms. Homendy, sorry. Maybe you 
can help me with that question.
    Ms. Homendy. Yes. The definition of a high hazard flammable 
train involves Class III flammable service, flammable liquids 
only, and 20 carloads in a continuous block, which would be a 
unit train, or 35 carloads of Class III flammable liquids in a 
mixed freight train. That was not what was on this train.
    There were some that were flammable liquids of Class III 
defined flammable liquids, but this train was not a high hazard 
flammable.
    Senator Capito. Right, it wasn't a high hazard train, but 
it had high hazardous materials--obviously very flammable that 
just lit up the sky. So,----
    Ms. Homendy. That is right.
    Senator Capito. Is that something that you would consider 
that should be looked at as a safety improvement?
    Ms. Homendy. Yes, Senator. We think that these thresholds 
of the 20 and 35 should be eliminated. And we think a broader 
array of hazmat should be in the definition of high hazard 
flammable train.
    Senator Capito. Yes. It sounds like that. Let me ask about 
the tracks. We had a derailment in Cabin Creek a couple years 
ago where the track, it got cold and I think then it got--and 
then it melted. And anyway, the track, it derailed there with 
some hazardous materials.
    How are we doing on track safety, and how or what kind of 
improvements might be in the future, if we look to this bill 
that Senator Vance and Brown have put together? Is this 
something we should look at? I know timber ties are what we are 
most still using. Is that the best materials to use? Are you 
looking at that at the NTSB or--?
    Ms. Homendy. Yes. And track defects remain the second 
biggest cause of train accidents outside of grade crossing 
accidents. But human factors is number one. Train defects is 
the number two----
    Senator Capito. Rail defects--rail defects----
    Ms. Homendy. I am sorry, track defects.
    Senator Capito. Track, track----
    Ms. Homendy. Sorry about that. Track defects. And there is 
technology, but we also think that personnel are critical as 
well and that technology should supplement, not supplant.
    Senator Capito. Mr. Jefferies, did you want to address that 
question?
    Mr. Jefferies. Yes, thank you. Track cause being the second 
leading cause. On main lines, we did have the lowest number of 
incidents, rate of incidents in 2022, but we are not at zero.
    And it is important. Chair Homendy referenced technology 
that can be deployed. Autonomous track inspection tools can 
one, provide a significantly more intense and sensitive type of 
inspection that is really 360 degree around the rail, through 
the rail to identify anomalies before they become risks.
    And that could be attached to the back or the front of a 
train for continuous inspection. And that is not dehumanizing 
the network. That is using technology to supplement in a much 
more effective way the naked eye inspections that occur today.
    And so, we believe we should be encouraging and enhancing 
and allowing additional pilot programs to expand that 
technology to take on and get the second leading cause of 
derailments even lower.
    Senator Capito. Let me ask a question about the 
communications. I am a bit confused here listening to the 
testimony. When it showed that things were beginning to 
overheat, it passed through the 10 miles and 10 miles, does 
that information come directly to the engineer at the time, Mr. 
Whitaker--and I think, I believe it is Mr. Whitaker, yes.
    And why couldn't we do that? In this day and age, we have 
instantaneous communications. Why is that not happening? Mr. 
Whitaker, can you clarify that on this particular accident, and 
yes, I would like to hear your thoughts on that.
    Mr. Whitaker. Thank you for the question. So, technically, 
there are two different types of defect detectors. One is a 
standard that gives an audible to the train crew over a radio. 
It will tell you the defect or no defects. The----
    Senator Capito. So, would that be like an automated voice? 
Stop, stop warning, warning or something----
    Mr. Whitaker. That is correct. It sounds an alarm and it 
repeats various, depends on the railroad, two to three times.
    Senator Capito. OK.
    Mr. Whitaker. But the trending defect detector technology 
is like an add on to that stall detector. We are not notified 
if a wheel is trending hot on the train. That goes to a 
location, like a headquarters building, a wayside defect 
detector helpdesk.
    They monitor that car. That is the big issue. They need to 
convey that information to the train crews because we get a no 
defect alert, and so we are just going down the track.
    Senator Capito. Right, right. So, it seems to me that would 
be some huge--would be a huge improvement if instantaneous 
communication would go directly to the engineers. And the last 
question I have is--I have no--they say never ask the question 
you don't know the answer to, but I have no idea what the 
answer to this. Would a different braking system on that train 
have made any difference? Mr. Shaw, I will let you answer that 
one.
    Mr. Shaw. Chair Homendy was very clear that the use of ECP 
brakes would not have changed the result of this derailment.
    Senator Capito. Does anybody disagree with that on the 
panel? Yes, Chair.
    Ms. Homendy. So, I had said it wouldn't have prevented the 
derailment, which is true. Car number 23, it still would have 
derailed, the fire would have ensued, and likely would have 
still had some action on the vinyl chloride tank cars. In this 
case, it was event and burn. However, it could keep some of the 
cars on the train, on the tracks. But FRA is doing modeling on 
that. It would probably be a couple of cars.
    Senator Capito. So, we could have some more information on 
that as the investigation moves forward.
    Ms. Homendy. Right, right.
    Senator Capito. Thank you all very much.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Senator Duckworth.

              STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY DUCKWORTH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking 
Member Cruz for holding today's hearing. Illinois sits at the 
center of our Nation's freight rail network. All seven class I 
railroads run through our state, including Norfolk Southern, as 
they all converge near Chicago.
    The Chicago region's freight rail network is enormous. We 
have 3,865 miles of rail, nearly 1,400 of which is shared by 
passenger trains. We see 1,300 trains a day moving through the 
Chicago area, which is one of the most densely populated areas 
in the country.
    To say that rail safety is important to our State would be 
an understatement. Yet over the past decade, there have been at 
least 272 hazardous material incidents involving trains in 70 
different Illinois communities.
    Last year, we were tied for the third highest total of 
hazardous material incidents in the Nation. The bottom line is 
that what happened in East Palestine could have just easily 
happened in Illinois.
    And among the causes of rail accidents are blocked rail 
crossings, especially among trains that are carrying hazardous 
materials. To address this issue, our State passed a State law 
in 1999 to try to limit blocked rail crossings.
    However, the law was unfortunately overturned by--in 2008 
by a State Supreme Court decision due to a Federal preemption. 
Ms. Homendy, the bipartisan Railway Safety Act would require 
the U.S. Department of Transportation to issue new regulations 
to help prevent trains carrying hazardous materials from 
blocking crossings due to railroad delays.
    Can you explain how that would improve safety in a freight 
rail hub like Illinois?
    Ms. Homendy. Senator, the NTSB has not weighed in on the 
blocked crossing issue. We don't have a recommendation on that. 
So, it is not something we have looked at.
    Senator Duckworth. You don't have an opinion on what a 
train with hazardous materials in it blocking a rail crossing--
--
    Ms. Homendy. I think it can be a safety issue, certainly 
for first responder access to areas in communities. And having 
high hazardous materials could be an issue as well.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Over my objection, as well as 
that of Senator Durbin and others among the Illinois 
Congressional delegation, the Surface Transportation Board 
recently approved a merger of Canadian Pacific and Kansas City 
Southern.
    This merger will likely result in more and longer freight 
trains through the Chicago area, particularly the Northwest 
suburbs.
    Ms. Homendy, without asking you to comment on the recently 
approved CPM, KCS merger, can you explain the safety risks that 
could arise if a rail company injected more and longer freight 
trains, some of which may be carrying hazardous materials into 
an already crowded rail corridor like Chicago, with such a 
densely populated area?
    Ms. Homendy. Yes. I will say for the East Palestine train, 
that one was not a particularly long train, in our opinion at 
the board. The one in Springfield was a very long train. It was 
a 2.55-mile train. You have workers who will have to maybe go 
back and inspect, stop and inspect an axle. And if you are 
walking back 2.5 miles, that is a lot----
    Senator Duckworth. With the equipment----
    Ms. Homendy.--on the crew with the equipment, and potential 
safety issues, as well as higher gross tonnage on the train, 
which is a big safety hazard.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. In 2021, the Federal Railroad 
Administration recommended penalties for 7,300 regulatory 
safety violations it found after inspecting railroads, 
hazardous materials shippers, and railcar lessors. Of those, 
3,400 were assessed civil penalties for a total of $12.3 
million.
    This is an average of $3,600 for each assessed violation. 
That same year, Norfolk Southern's net income was approximately 
$3 billion. Ms. Homendy, do you believe that the current level 
of civil penalties is an effective deterrent? And do you think 
Congress should consider raising them?
    Ms. Homendy. The NTSB doesn't have a position on civil 
penalties. I will say that most civil penalties, unfortunately, 
are negotiated pretty, pretty low. They will be assessed to a 
civil penalty, and then there is a conference portion where 
they will settle their penalties on pennies for a dollar.
    Senator Duckworth. Do you think pennies for a dollar is 
effective deterrent for a multibillion-dollar company like 
Norfolk Southern?
    Ms. Homendy. I do not.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. I yield back, Madam Chair.
    Chair Cantwell. Senator Budd--I am sorry, Senator Schmitt.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC SCHMITT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI

    Senator Schmitt. Thank you, Madam Chair. You know, East 
Palestine is a town that outside of East Palestine and folks in 
Ohio, people across the country probably hadn't heard of before 
this terrible tragedy. And there are a lot of towns like East 
Palestine.
    I know here in Missouri where I am from, Garden City, 
Bolton, Sikeston, Bridgeton, Missouri, where I am from, a real 
blue-collar neighborhood. These are towns that aren't filled 
with corporate titans or elites.
    They are working men and women who go to church on Sunday, 
try to get home for dinner, take their kids to practice, try to 
play by the rules, and all of those towns matter. East 
Palestine matters. And instead of showing up in towns like 
this, and specifically East Palestine, this Administration 
demonstrated that they didn't matter. Joe Biden still hasn't 
showed up to East Palestine.
    He has been to Ukraine, but not East Palestine. Pete 
Buttigieg took 3 weeks for him to show up. And I think so much 
of this, in addition to the things that can be improved, is a 
lack of attention from this Administration that the people of 
this town, for whatever reason to them, weren't worthy of an 
appearance.
    Of letting them know that we are going to support them. And 
so, I think that one of the reasons, in addition to the 
obviously, the toxic chemical spill, that this has become such 
a big issue, is it is demonstrative. It shows that this 
Administration is completely out of touch with what I will 
refer to as flyover country, places like Missouri, places like 
Ohio.
    They should matter to the Biden Administration. And what is 
worse than all of this, I think, is that this accident was 
foreseeable, avoidable, preventable.
    And so, Mr. Shaw, I want to ask you, is it true that 
Norfolk Southern's accident rate has nearly doubled in the last 
10 years, and at least 20 of those derailments since 2015 have 
involved chemical releases. Is that true?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, thank you for your question. East 
Palestine does matter. I have been there a number of times and 
I have visited with the community leaders. I have been in the 
homes. People have invited me to their business. I have been in 
the schools. And I have committed the full support of Norfolk 
Southern.
    Senator Schmitt. I hear you, you have said that, and I have 
limited time. But my question to you was, has the accident rate 
doubled in the last decade?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I am not aware of that. I will be happy 
to provide you with that info. I know that from 2021 to 2022, 
many of our FRA, most of our FRA safety stats improved. We will 
continue to get better. We are going to learn from this 
accident. And that is my commitment is, I will lead Norfolk 
Southern and the industry the better safety practices.
    Senator Schmitt. So, I would hope so. And you know, I think 
understanding, and we are happy to educate you on those 
statistics that we have at our ready about how accidents rate, 
because there are a lot of folks who live close to railroad 
tracks.
    I do, and there is a lot of folks wondering what exactly is 
going to be done to make sure this doesn't happen again, in 
addition to the things that need to happen to address the 
concerns of East Palestine.
    And I did want to, with the remaining time that I have--
Chair Homendy, as you know, in the aftermath of this incident, 
many in the media and in this Administration were quick to 
blame the previous Administration, President Trump, for, you 
know, not moving forward or rolling back regulations.
    However, those arguments have been dismissed by including 
the USA Today and even The Washington Post, noting that none of 
the regulatory changes made during the Trump Administration at 
this point can be cited as contributing to the incident?
    Can you clarify to the Committee today, I know you have 
made statements about this, just to clarify that, whether the 
regulatory rollback that took place under the Trump 
Administration was responsible for this tragic incident.
    Ms. Homendy. I am not familiar with the--all of the 
regulations and actions taken on those regulations from that 
Administration. What I will say is for--my comments were with 
respect to electronically controlled nomadic braking. And there 
were a lot of comments about how that would have prevented this 
derailment. That is not accurate.
    Senator Schmitt. Right. That was specifically cited by Pete 
Buttigieg, who, by the way, is not here, again, I point out. I 
have many questions for Pete Buttigieg, and maybe he is taking 
more personal time.
    But this is--now we are a couple few months into this 
Congress with a lot of serious issues involving the Department 
of Transportation, including this and he just has refused to 
appear. And I think that you were very clear publicly saying 
that that rule would not have impacted this at all. Is that 
correct?
    Ms. Homendy. It would not have prevented the derailment--
yes.
    Senator Schmitt. And Madam Chair, I will yield back the 
rest of my time, but I do want to mention the obvious, as I 
just did, that Secretary Buttigieg is not here. He has yet to 
appear before this committee.
    And I think it is incredibly disrespectful not just to this 
committee, but the American people that he refuses--continues 
to hide from these disasters that have happened under his 
watch.
    Chair Cantwell. Senator Rosen--Senator Rosen.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. [Technical problems]--thank Senators Brown 
and Vance for working together in a bipartisan way to ensure 
that a tragedy like East Palestine derailment never happens 
again. And also, we have to think about preventing future 
accidents, how we can be proactive.
    So, in addition to transporting hazardous waste, we also 
transport nuclear waste by rail. And the events in East 
Palestine should be a wake-up call for all Americans that it is 
time to address how we transport hazardous materials in this 
country.
    For Nevadans, the transportation of hazardous waste to our 
State by rail is something we have been fighting since the 
1980s. For over 30 years, we have opposed the Yucca Mountain 
Nuclear Waste Disposal Project, in part because it would 
require transporting 9,500 rail casks of hazardous radioactive 
waste in 2,800 trains and over 2,600 trucks from across the 
country to Nevada.
    This is a major transportation safety crisis waiting to 
happen, putting major metropolitan areas in 44 states, their 
railways, and millions of Americans at risk. We already have an 
aging rail system, and consistent shipments of heavy casks of 
nuclear waste will cause wear and tear in our railroads and 
could lead to the kind of disaster we saw in Ohio or worse.
    And so, Chair Homendy, can you talk about some of the 
dangers of transporting this kind of waste, nuclear waste could 
pose to our nation?
    And even though I, along with all the Nevada delegation, 
are committed to ensuring that Yucca Mountain never moves 
forward to become a reality, I still want to ask you if you are 
prepared to address nuclear waste spills that could happen as a 
result of shipping waste on aging rail lines through American 
cities to places like Yucca Mountain?
    Ms. Homendy. Well, I will say I do believe that there are 
some more protective measures for moving spent nuclear fuel. 
However, there isn't positive train control on, say, that last 
mile for Nevada. And I will also mention it would be disastrous 
if something did occur. On our resources, we are pretty 
strained.
    The NTSB has 12 rail investigators and we have 4 pipeline 
and hazardous materials safety investigators. We need to 
increase our investigator levels, but that requires additional 
resources, which we have asked Congress and the President's 
budget would accomplish our request of $145 million for 2024.
    Senator Rosen. Well, when it comes to safety, we should be 
investing in that. And I want to carry this a little bit 
further, because can you talk to us--you said that the positive 
rail control systems, they are not in Nevada.
    So, we hope that would--tell us if that would be 
beneficial. And can you also tell us, are the trains carrying 
nuclear waste, were they currently--do they have their wheel 
bearings checked regularly and are they--what kind of regular 
checks are you doing to be proactive, as we may be transporting 
some of this additional hazardous waste across the country?
    Ms. Homendy. They would be checked regularly, but I would 
have to defer to Mr. Jefferies on the exact requirements for 
those train inspections.
    Mr. Jefferies. The Federal Government has established 
strict standards for transport of spent nuclear fuel and has 
determined that the railroads are the safest mechanism for 
doing so.
    I know my team would be happy to sit down with you and your 
team to talk about the specifics of the requirements there, but 
it is something that we would take with the utmost of 
seriousness, the responsibility that the Government has 
delegated to our industry to move those cars with the highest 
level of safety.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I look forward to talking about 
that because I want to be sure that we are being stringent 
enough. And I want to move to another topic very important to 
Nevada, is reliable freight rail for our tourism economy.
    Because Nevada, we are the Nation's leader in tourism and 
hospitality service. It is a sector that relies heavily on 
freight rail to bring in goods from out of State partners to 
support our industry.
    And the Interstate 15 corridor, which runs from California 
to Nevada, it is crowded. It makes it difficult for trucks to 
move efficiently and it makes reliable freight rail service 
along the corridor all that more important. So, Mr. Jefferies, 
how do you think Congress can support a more reliable freight 
system that moves goods quickly but still promotes safety as 
its core priority?
    Mr. Jefferies. Well, thank you for that. We are a service 
provider at the end of the day, and if we are not providing 
good, reliable service, then we are not doing our jobs. And I 
think the pandemic and the associated supply chain challenges 
really illustrated that. The railroads have been making 
significant progress on the service front.
    And as Mr. Shaw mentioned and I mentioned in my opening, 
significant hiring efforts continue. We are at our highest 
level of employees that we have been in over 3 years. And 
really, it is about taking things to the next step.
    We have seen the Amazonification of the world. Folks want 
to know exactly where their things are, exactly when they are 
going to get there, exactly when the pepperoni is going on the 
pizza that they have ordered--when that is going to be 
delivered.
    And so, railroads need to work to provide increased 
visibility into where their shipments are to their customers, 
increase predictability, and those efforts are underway, and 
there is some exciting things on the horizon. Thank you.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I yield back, Madam Chair.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Senator Fischer.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Madam Chairman. The East 
Palestine train derailment has increased our public awareness 
of rail safety concerns, especially for trains that are moving 
through very rural, small communities like those in my home 
State of Nebraska. This committee takes rail safety very 
seriously.
    Modern technologies can enhance railroad safety, especially 
in how railcars and tracks are inspected. Mr. Jefferies, can 
you explain how a two-pronged inspection system using visual 
and automated track inspections can improve rail safety?
    Mr. Jefferies. Thank you for that and thank you for your 
efforts on rail safety. You are exactly right, a two-pronged 
approach to track inspections is the appropriate path forward. 
So, as we have discussed, autonomous track inspection tools 
allow for not only a continuous inspection of track as a train 
goes over it, but at a much higher level of sensitivity, at a 
much higher level of effectiveness.
    Has been found to be 90 percent more effective in 
identifying flaws in the track before they become serious 
risks. And several pilot programs have been in place with some 
of our railroads at the FRA.
    Unfortunately, literally had to sue the FRA to expand those 
pilot programs and recently won in court the ability to do 
that. It is a shame that it took that level of effort for a 
proven safety technology.
    But it is a two-pronged approach. ATI doesn't catch 
everything and it doesn't do every job that a human inspector 
does, so we absolutely still need the human inspection 
capabilities. And hopefully our inspectors are also spending 
more time addressing found anomalies than using the naked eye 
walk in the tracks.
    And again, there is a place for both and it is a 
complimentary approach that I think will result in a much 
higher level of safety, which should be the ultimate goal for 
everybody.
    Senator Fischer. Yes, you know, that is the ultimate goal. 
That is what we are trying to get at here. So, what is impeding 
the use of those automated technologies throughout the whole 
rail network?
    Mr. Jefferies. Right. Well, we are going to take things 
step by step as we deploy this technology for one, but two, we 
need a--we need a regulatory environment, we need a regulator 
that promotes innovation, promotes technology, promotes pilot 
programs, identify new ways of doing things----
    Senator Fischer. So, you don't have to go to court to sue 
them.
    Mr. Jefferies.--that allows you to build a data set. So, 
you don't have to go to court. And let's have the opportunity 
to experiment with things. Some technologies may not work out. 
Others may prove to have dramatic safety benefits. Let's build 
the data sets that then we can objectively analyze, in 
partnership with the regulator, to advance safety.
    Senator Fischer. OK. Thank you. Mr. Shaw, as you are aware, 
the current law dictates common carrier obligations that 
railroads must abide by. Specifically, railroads must transport 
any freight under reasonable terms, including hazardous 
materials.
    Mr. Shaw, can you explain how the common carrier obligation 
impacts the way that your railroad transports hazardous 
material in coordination with shippers?
    Mr. Shaw. Yes. Thank you for that question, Senator. You 
know, rail remains one of the safest forms of handling 
hazardous materials. We do have a common carrier obligation to 
handle product.
    We work very closely with our customers, with our fellow 
railroaders, and with elected officials, and with the 
regulatory body to handle that in the safest manner possible. I 
will note that in 2022, our derailments were the fewest that 
they have been in the last two decades.
    Senator Fischer. What obligation do shippers have, if any, 
on maintaining their railcars that transport these hazardous 
materials?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, as you know, there are many components 
of the Vance, Brown bill that we fully support. And the rail 
industry has been advocating and pushing for stronger tank car 
standards for about the last 8 years, is my understanding, and 
that is included in the bill.
    Senator Fischer. OK. Thank you very much. I just have a 
couple of short questions here, Mr. Jefferies, for you.
    When I talk to my constituents in Nebraska, one of the 
items I hear about frequently is community notification. Folks 
just want to know what dangerous things could possibly be 
moving through their towns and cities while still maintaining 
the security that is needed, that that information is 
controlled in a way, because we all know that there are a lot 
of people out there that would like to cause mischief.
    That would be disastrous. In the FAST Act, which I helped 
to author, it added notice requirements that we did it in a way 
that provided first responders the information they needed, 
again, ensuring that the local actors wouldn't have access to 
that. Those rulemakings haven't been completed, is my 
understanding.
    Do freight railroads agree that appropriate community 
notification is necessary? And what part do they play in 
ensuring that communities do have that information?
    Mr. Jefferies. It is absolutely necessary and we 100 
percent agree with that assessment. And you are right, the rule 
was supposed to be done, I think, a year after the FAST Act, 
and so it is 7 years overdue. We didn't wait around. We 
developed our own mechanism to get information into first 
responders' hands. But we want--we need help building 
awareness.
    We just sent letters out to every firefighter association 
in each state trying to build awareness. We are shifting toward 
a--versus a responder by responder sign up process to an 
emergency communication center model, because to Senator 
Vance's point earlier, if you are in a rural area, you don't 
necessarily have cell service.
    But there is a requirement that you always have radio 
service, to my knowledge, with the emergency communication 
center. So, the emergency communication center has that access. 
The first responder can quickly get that from there.
    But we have got more work to do and look forward to working 
with Congress for further ways to get that information into 
those hands who need it.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chair Cantwell. Senator Lujan.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member 
Cruz for this important hearing. And I want to begin by 
recognizing Senator Brown and Senator Vance for coming together 
and responding so quickly and appreciate their staff and the 
work that they are doing.
    I also want to thank Ms. Allison for being part of that 
panel today. I think, all too often the impact to a family or 
to a person are left out. And just want to say thank you for 
helping the country, those of us here in the Senate better 
understand what the family has gone through. And it just 
reminds me that it shouldn't take a tragedy like this for there 
to be action. I appreciate everyone coming together now. It is 
the right thing to do.
    But why didn't we do it before? There are incidents all 
across the country where there are derailments. There have been 
conversations about reductions in workforce. You have less 
people looking at something, there is going to be a problem 
that is not going to be identified until after something 
horrific happens.
    We all know the challenges, and one of my frustrations 
since I have been here in the Senate and the House is you go 
through these efforts and we fight for rules, and we thank each 
other, and we recognize each other for that work, and then it 
goes to be implemented. And then all the folks who didn't want 
the legislation, get another crack at this, and then they mess 
it up over, where there is a rulemaking or an implementation.
    And then there is a bunch of filings, which I am one of 
those folks that reads filings--they create a bunch of 
loopholes. But then there are some interviews that come after 
that and, oh, no, we well, we wanted all this stuff done.
    I certainly hope there is a lesson here and on this one, 
that with all these filings, every word is watched, every 
statement is watched, and that loopholes are not being 
advocated for by the groups that have been hired to represent 
companies or represent interests, only to allow for something 
like this to happen again.
    I hope we are mindful to that. Now, a week ago, a train 
derailed in a small community in Arizona, in Mojave. And just 
hours before, as you can imagine, that these trains that, you 
know, go through small town after small town, it was in New 
Mexico.
    And my question here is around first responders as well, 
because when this happened, the initial reports that went to 
law enforcement was that there was a concern, a high concern of 
hazardous materials being carried on that train.
    It was corn syrup. So, while I appreciate information was 
shared, that doesn't sound to me like first responders are 
being looked after when they are getting to an incident like 
this. There needs to be a better way of sharing accurate and 
timely information.
    I appreciate the questions of my colleague Ms. Fischer as 
well in this particular area, but I am hopeful more can be done 
there. And that is where--Madam Chair, how can the process be 
improved to ensure that once a derailment happens, the first 
responders quickly receive the information they need to 
appropriately respond?
    Ms. Homendy. They need an advance notification. I do 
appreciate what the railroads have done with the AskRail app. 
The problem is when you have a derailment and train cars are 
bunched up, when you are pulling up a consist from the AskRail 
app, it goes by car in order.
    If you are looking at a derailment with cars all over the 
place, again, bunched up, you are not going to know what is in 
what car. So, that is not helpful. But the first responders 
need----
    Senator Lujan. Let me pause you there. Can that be fixed?
    Ms. Homendy. I will have to get back to you on that.
    Senator Lujan. If that is a problem, before we have an 
incident--we know it exists today, and if that is broken in the 
system, let's fix it.
    Ms. Homendy. Advance notification for the first responder 
community is key because they need to be prepared. They need to 
be adequately trained. They need the right gear. And they need 
to have emergency response planning done in coordination with 
the railroads so that they can be prepared in case something 
happens.
    Senator Lujan. I certainly agree with that. But I want to 
bring attention to the challenge that you identified, and I 
appreciate you identifying it. But if that system is in place, 
but there is no communication because cars are close to one 
another, but you know what is in there, I just hope that that 
is something that can be fixed because someone knows what is in 
there, and I will leave it at that.
    Mr. Whitaker, first, thank you for your testimony and your 
work representing Ohio's rail workforce. You stated in your 
testimony that since 2015, class I railroads have cut over 30 
percent of their workforce, and I mentioned that in my opening. 
Mr. Whitaker, yes or no, would expanding the workforce have a 
concrete impact on improving outcomes when it comes to safety?
    Mr. Whitaker. Thank you for the question. Yes, it would. 
Adding to the workforce would definitely strengthen 
inspections. We would be able to reduce fatigue on people as 
well, the train crews.
    Senator Lujan. Let me center on what you just said on 
fatigue. Would paid leave help? If people are getting worn out 
and tired and things of that nature as well, and you want fresh 
eyes so we don't see mistakes, would that help?
    Mr. Whitaker. Absolutely. Right now, we have people that go 
to work sick with the flu, COVID, whatever the case may be, and 
they are afraid to take time off because if they mark off sick, 
they get reprimanded.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. My time has expired. I 
certainly appreciate this hearing. There is so many questions I 
have. I will submit the rest into the record. But to everyone 
that is helping the families, thank you for what you are doing. 
Please, no loopholes. Filings, rulemakings, we can all do 
better at that, and I certainly hope that is something that we 
can embrace. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Madam Chairman. And I want to 
thank you all for being here for the hearing today. And I know 
that everyone is hard at work trying to help the people of East 
Palestine.
    I so appreciated the Governor's remarks at the outset, and 
I know that my colleague, Senator Vance, has really worked hard 
to bring some attention to this community. Chief Comstock, I 
want to come to you.
    It is my understanding that the AAR, in partnership with 
emergency management agencies in Sumner County, Tennessee, 
piloted the addition of AskRail data to their emergency 
management dispatching system. And following the derailment 
there in East Palestine, firefighters were on the ground for 90 
minutes but could not access the AskRail app to get information 
about what substances were on board the train.
    Ms. Homendy did an interview in which she said that none of 
the first responders actually had the app on their devices at 
all. So, can you give me a little bit more information about 
how the AskRail app may have been used, and whether first 
responders are making effective use of the app? And what are 
the requirements around using that app?
    Mr. Comstock. First of all, thank you for the question. 
With respect to requirements to use the app, I am not aware of 
any. As to the effective use of the app, I asked my own 
department members as to how many are using that app presently.
    I will tell you I have that on my phone, but I found that 
50 percent of the firefighters had that app, much higher 
percentage with respect to our department's officers. I know 
one of the complicating factors at East Palestine was the fact 
that the rail cars were off the track. They were bunched up in 
a ladder style formation.
    Keep in mind, it was night. You had burning cars and smoke, 
so it was--and some of the placards had burned off. It was--and 
you have to try to use that at somewhat of a safe distance. So, 
it can be difficult. I think it is a good app, but it can be 
used more. We need to have better education that goes hand in 
hand with the training that we have discussed and advocated 
for. I also would add this with respect to technology.
    There are apps that I have on my phone that when a car 
flips, the OnStar information or others will be relayed to the 
app. One example is I am responding, slash RapidSOS that 
gathers technology, sends it to my dispatcher.
    My dispatcher gets it to me on my phone. So, enroute to a 
motor vehicle accident, I know if the car has flipped three 
times, the airbag has gone out, and that it has information 
about that car, whether it is, you know, electric car, things 
that I have to worry about. So, I should be able to get that 
information about trains, I think.
    Senator Blackburn. Well, Mr. Jefferies, let me come to you. 
What is your understanding for how the app was used or was not 
accessed during the incident?
    Mr. Jefferies. So, based on what I have read, I believe it 
was accessed, but I don't have details by who and how. To be 
clear, there is absolutely--it is free to all first responders. 
And to date, we have taken a responder-by-responder approach, 
which there are a lot of first responders in this country and 
having 35,000 with the app is absolutely not sufficient, not 
where we need to be.
    That is why we are shifting to an emergency communication 
center approach. Also, knowing that, as I understand it, first 
responders will always have access to the emergency 
communication center, and so that is a central repository that 
has that information. Responders individually can still 
download the app, but we are wide open to looking at ways and 
working with Congress and others in the first responder 
community to further penetrate that population to have--get it 
into as many people's hands as possible.
    Senator Blackburn. So, you would say the app is not 
working?
    Mr. Jefferies. I think the app works very well, designed 
what it is to do. It is making sure that everybody who--we get 
it in as many people's hands as possible, and going responder 
by responder, is a slow, meticulous way to achieving that.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. All right. Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chair Cantwell. Yes. Senator Hickenlooper.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you. Let me ask a question, Mr. 
Jefferies. The rail sector plays a crucial role in transporting 
goods through our nation--throughout our Nation. I want to talk 
about a specific rail project in the West.
    It is reportedly seeking a $2 billion private activity bond 
from DOT, and that would be a taxpayer funded subsidy for a 
project that has raised a number of concerns among community 
leaders in Colorado, and its costs have gone up significantly.
    This type of DOT bond, has traditionally been an issue for 
projects with a clear public transportation benefit. Are you 
aware of any examples of DOT private activity bonds issued 
primarily for transportation of commodities for private sale?
    Mr. Jefferies. Senator, I am not aware of any. I would not 
say that that means there absolutely haven't been any, but I am 
certainly not aware of any.
    Senator Hickenlooper. OK. Well, if you could follow up on 
that, that would be--that would be great. And Chairwoman 
Homendy, you have gone over in some detail the high hazard 
flammable train definition, and the train carrying 20 more tank 
cars of Class III, or 35 tank cars.
    I guess one question I would be curious about is, what 
other risk factors, such as proximity to natural resources, 
should be considered when providing notice of a high hazard 
flammable train?
    Ms. Homendy. Well, I think that should be considered for a 
high hazard flammable train. Also, just to clarify for the 
record, and I know this is your time, none of the responders 
had access to the app and they didn't have the information for 
quite a long time on what was on the train.
    With that said, Senator, for this one, I do believe that 
environmentally sensitive areas and sensitive waterways should 
be considered for--especially for routing of trains and for 
protections.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you. I appreciate that and 
agree. Chief Comstock, thank you and all your first responder 
colleagues for your dedication and public service. The images 
that we saw from East Palestine were horrific, not just the 
environmental destruction, but I mean, the homes, community, 
the lives destructed.
    But the statistic I was shown says that hazardous material 
cars involved in derailments have increased 339 percent from 
1986 to 2021. Can you discuss the need for all fire departments 
serving rural communities to have access to training, to safely 
respond to hazardous material incidents such as this? Could 
more resources be provided by the Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration to increase safety training and 
response capacity for fire departments?
    Mr. Comstock. Yes, in particularly we have talked about the 
hands-on training and there are a lot of firefighters who, as I 
said, can't take time off work. So, we need to not only have 
the good hands on, which I think that the railway industry is 
looking at trying to create, but we also need to find ways to 
deliver that to where the firefighters work every day.
    There are a lot of departments, particular in these areas, 
that don't have those resources. So, we need to be creative and 
find ways to get to those departments in rural areas, and that 
is whether it is going to be through the use of technology or 
through more home delivery programs like the NDFC is operating. 
That is what we are going to have to do. But we need to devote 
more resources.
    Senator Hickenlooper. And what role should rail companies 
play in ensuring communities have adequate resources to plan 
for but also to respond to rail disasters?
    Mr. Comstock. They are going to have to play a major part, 
and it is going to have to be a partnership with everybody, you 
know, who has an interest in this issue. And we need to work 
with the railways, they need to work with us. And I think that 
is going to be a continued improved result as a result of this 
hearing and the derailment.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. Thank you, Chief. And 
Chairwoman Homendy, do you agree with that response in terms of 
the participation of the railroads as well?
    Ms. Homendy. Absolutely. We have had recommendations that 
are still open on ensuring that the railroads participate in 
local emergency response planning and helping provide 
resources, including appropriate training.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you very much. Thank all 
of you for your testimony. I yield back to the Chair.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. Senator Warnock.

              STATEMENT OF HON. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA

    Senator Warnock. Thank you, Chair Cantwell. Norfolk 
Southern is headquartered in Atlanta, and it runs an extensive 
operation in Georgia that includes 1,700 miles of track, 600 
bridges, 2,700 railway highway grade crossings, and a number of 
rail yards and transfer facilities in cities across the entire 
state, a multimodal state.
    That is a lot of Norfolk Southern rail in Georgia, and I 
can't help but see the accident in East Palestine and wonder 
what would have happened had we instead of watching this in 
Ohio, witnessing this, or experiencing it in Georgia. Mr. Shaw, 
can you give me and the people of Georgia confidence that we 
won't see an accident like this in Georgia?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, thank you for the question. I am 
terribly sorry for the derailment in East Palestine, and we are 
working every day to make Norfolk Southern and the rail 
industry safer.
    We have seen the preliminary results from the NTSB 
investigation, and we have made a number of enhancements to our 
own safety program in response. We have worked with industry to 
enhance safety and put in more safety features. And there are 
many aspects of the Vance-Brown bill that we fully support to 
enhance rail safety.
    We are a safe railroad. The number of derailments on 
Norfolk Southern was the lowest last year that has been in the 
last two decades. Senator Warnock, I am fully committed to 
enhancing safety for Norfolk Southern and for the entire 
industry.
    Senator Warnock. And that is good to hear and the work that 
you want to do. Could you speak more specifically, what more 
needs to be done, in your view, to protect our citizens and our 
neighbors from accidents like this?
    Mr. Shaw. Thank you, Senator. We have announced that we 
enhanced--are enhancing our hot bearing detector network. We 
are adding over we are adding 200 hot bearing detectors to our 
network. We are piloting next generation hot bearing detectors. 
We are working with the industry on best practices for safety.
    We are deploying more acoustic bearing detectors across our 
network, and we are installing a digital inspection--a digital 
inspection portal that we are piloting with Georgia Tech 
outside of East Palestine to inspect passing trains and catch 
things that the human eye cannot catch.
    We will continue to invest in safety. We spend over $1 
billion a year in capital on safety and over $1 billion a year 
in ongoing operating expenses.
    Senator Warnock. Is there anything that you didn't have in 
place during this accident, and know, hindsight is 20/20, that 
you wish you had had in place?
    Mr. Shaw. You know, what I can point you to is some of the 
steps that we are taking now based on the preliminary results 
of the NTSB investigation, and I certainly look forward to 
fully cooperating with the NTSB throughout the full 
investigation and look forward to their results.
    Senator Warnock. So, I have to tell you that I move across 
the state and you and I have had a chance to talk, and we will 
keep that communication line open. But I have to tell you that 
as I move across the state and I talk to Norfolk Southern 
workers, I am hearing from rail workers that policies around 
their working conditions are creating safety issues and may 
have contributed to this accident. Do you believe your 
company's worker policies contributed to this in any way?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, our policies are there to promote the 
safety of train operations. I, too, have been fully engaged 
with our valuable craft colleagues. My first day as CEO, I went 
out into the field, I walked into the crew room, and I engaged 
with our employees and I have thanked them for their service to 
Norfolk Southern, their service to our customers, and their 
service to the United States.
    And since I became CEO, Senator, we have been on a hiring 
spree and we now have 1,500 more employees than we did this 
time last year.
    Senator Warnock. So how are you working with those 
employees and labor on any changes that you are considering? 
And what have you learned from the accident that might result 
in changes to your worker policies?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I am committed to improving the safety 
culture at Norfolk Southern and throughout the industry, and I 
have reached out to the heads of our two largest labor unions 
and asked them for their assistance and their input on how we 
can advance safety at Norfolk Southern.
    Senator Warnock. Great. Thank you so much and I look 
forward to working with you, and with labor, and all of your 
colleagues to do everything we can to make sure everything is 
being done to ensure the safe operation of our Nation's rail 
infrastructure.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you, Senator Warnock. It has been an 
interesting hearing for sure. A lot of information, but I would 
like to get some clarity because we do want to move legislation 
in this area.
    I do want to start with some information, though. My state 
is definitely seen--you know, there is a debate here about are 
we seeing an increase in derailments. My State definitely in--
and it is great that we had a witness who was actually a 
marketing expert because Ms. Alison said you can always take 
numbers and make them mean different things.
    So, I am just letting you know this is a 10-year window. In 
my state, we have definitely seen an increase in derailments. 
And because we carry so much oil, it is always an issue for us 
in these communities.
    It goes through every area. So, I wanted to start with you, 
Ms. Homendy, as it relates to legislation, I originally 
introduced in 2015 saying let's get rid of DOT-111s. And now in 
the infrastructure bill, we got a 2029 date. This legislation 
says let's do it by 2025. Do you agree that that is the right--
--
    Ms. Homendy. Yes. We, the NTSB agrees that we should move 
up the date and eliminate the DOT-111s from hazmat service, not 
just from Class III flammable liquid service, but all hazmat 
service. In this train, we had 16 DOT-111s carrying hazmat. 
Only three of them, though, would be covered under that final 
rule in the FAST Act.
    Chair Cantwell. OK. The rest of the witnesses agree.
    Mr. Jefferies. 100 percent. We filed jointly with shippers 
in 2011 to upgrade 111s, and following the 2014 rule, came to 
Congress because there was a 20-car loophole, there wasn't 
thermal protection, there weren't top fittings protection. So, 
we are 100 percent on board. It has got to be done in a way 
that the manufacturers can achieve----
    Chair Cantwell. I am asking you whether you support the 
legislation to move the date to 2025.
    Mr. Jefferies. I support moving it forward as feasibly as 
possible.
    Chair Cantwell. 2025.
    Mr. Jefferies. Whatever the manufacturers can make happen.
    Chair Cantwell. Mr. Shaw.
    Mr. Shaw. Yes, we support the component of the Vance, Brown 
bill for accelerating safer tanker standards.
    Chair Cantwell. OK. Let's turn to other issues, if we 
could, on your investments. One of the things I want to ask you 
about, Mr. Shaw, is you have been talking about how you have 
had less derailments, but I am pretty sure we have seen an 
increase in accidents. We think a 14 percent. And so, this 
issue is about the number of accidents.
    Ms. Homendy was talking about this video issue of the 
DuPont accident. And so, it doesn't matter, you know, issues 
are issues. And at the same time period as this increase, 14 
percent, we also have--you stated earlier that you invested $1 
billion in safety last year. That was at the EPW hearing.
    However, data from your company provided to the Surface 
Transportation Board says you have cut network investments by 
30 percent in just 5 years and at the same time accident rates 
increase by 60 percent.
    Meanwhile, the company made a record $4.2 billion in 
profits. So, this is a discussion about, are we putting the 
right resources into the network? Are we putting the right 
resources, in your opinion?
    Mr. Shaw. Yes, Senator, we are. We are investing over $1 
billion a year in safety improvements. Our capital budget over 
the last couple of years overall has increased about 30 
percent. We are hiring at a record clip.
    Chair Cantwell. But this chart shows that you have had a 
40--this is your own information from the Service 
Transformation Board, a 25 percent decrease in infrastructure 
investment and a 22 percent decrease in the number of 
employees.
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, when I became CEO of Norfolk Southern in 
May of last year, we went on an aggressive hiring spree and 
that continues to this day. And I will note that last year the 
number of derailments on Norfolk Southern was the lowest in the 
last two decades.
    Chair Cantwell. I don't--I think that Ms. Allison made it 
quite clear the damaging impact of these accidents and lasting 
impacts on our children. No, you can't look at that stat, you 
are saying, and feel comfort.
    She can't put her kids to bed at night and feel comfortable 
about that. So, what we have to do is figure out, are we 
shortchanging infrastructure investment? This is an issue 
across the board, in aviation, in transportation, here at the 
rail. We are not going to take profits over safety investments.
    We are going to require--now, I don't even think that's 
good business. But here we are going to make sure that those 
investments are made across the board for safety. So, I want to 
get to this issue as it relates to the workforce. You know, 
particularly this issue of what role they play in the 
inspection process.
    Do you think that your--the current system works or do you 
think we need more enhancements there in workforce? The Brown-
Vance bill obviously increases the workforce. Some of the 
testimony by Mr. Whitaker would say that we need more on the 
workforce side.
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, with respect to the Brown, Vance bill, 
we certainly support the provision that requires FRA audits of 
railroad compliance with railcar safety inspection programs. We 
also fully support the concept of a triennial review of railcar 
safety standards.
    Chair Cantwell. Triennial review. What does that mean?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, my understanding is there is a provision 
in the bill that allows for updates every 3 years.
    Chair Cantwell. OK, OK. So, you are saying--OK. If we could 
look at this chart here that on March 17th, we asked you to 
send us information about standards here, and you stated that 
Norfolk Southern does not have policies that mandate a minimum 
or maximum amount of time needed for the inspection of a 
railcar.
    And yet this information shows that it is part of this 
document for railcar inspection that you are saying to your 
employees that the cycle time for a 50-car cut is at point 5 
minutes per car with one inspection. So, that is saying you 
have to inspect one side of that car within 30 seconds. Mr. 
Whitaker, do you know about this?
    Mr. Whitaker. I am aware of this issue here. I know there 
is 90 points per side of a rail car that need to be inspected. 
Conductors, we know how to inspect most of those, but a 
mechanical force person always attribute--they have the 
doctorate degree and they need to take their time.
    And we should not be putting time--safety on a timeline 
here when inspecting rail cars. We are going through 
communities with hazardous materials and very unforgiving 
equipment.
    Chair Cantwell. I agree safety should not be on a timeline. 
So, Mr. Shaw, what is going on here? I think you don't support 
the Brown bill as it relates to a requirement of more people 
than just the conductor on a railcar.
    But this is just an example of how I think the system is 
being short changed. And while the information age gives us all 
sorts of ideas about efficiency, we can't take that to the 
extreme when you end up cutting safety.
    And the safety standards, we have to have minimum safety 
standards, we have to have modernization of safety technology, 
and we have to have the minimum amount of people to do the job.
    So that's what's going to be required across every sector 
of transportation. And this committee is going to make sure 
that we get there because we can't--because we are not going to 
let people just keep, you know, putting money in the bank and 
thinking that you can shortchange safety.
    We can't shortchange Ms. Allison and we can't shortchange 
East Palestine. So, what are your thoughts about at least 
getting rid of this, getting rid of this notion that it is 30 
seconds?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I am not familiar with a minimum or a 
maximum railcar inspection duration. We do support evidence-
based approach to enhance safety and improve outcomes for the 
industry, for our customers, and the communities we serve.
    Chair Cantwell. Well, maybe you can find somebody in your 
organization to get you this document. But it is clearly your 
document and it is clearly what is being implemented. And I 
don't think it is the standard that we want and I don't think 
it is a safe idea.
    Now, I would like to go to this larger issue, which we 
might be able to get some agreement on. Mr. Comstock, in the 
underlying bill is requirement for training of local 
firefighting teams on dealing with this kind of material. Is 
this enough? Is there enough in there, or do we need to put 
something in here about equipment? I asked the first panel 
about this.
    Mr. Comstock. I think it goes hand in hand. I mean, I think 
we have to have training, but I think we have to have 
specialized equipment, whether it is for monitoring or suits. 
And I also raised in my initial submittal that we need a second 
set of turnout gear.
    And the best example for everyday firefighting is we have 
one set of turnout gear. And when I have to wash that, I am out 
of service. In this railcar instance, I had three firefighters 
who were exposed, I had--their gear is contaminated. I can't 
use it. It takes 6 months to get replacement gear.
    That means I have three firefighters who are out of service 
for 6 months who can't respond to auto accidents or to 
structure fires. I was able to find one spare set of gear, and 
on two I had to rent some.
    So, we have throughout this country, we are lucky and many 
departments have good one set of gear. The departments that 
have money have two sets so you can wash one. And so, that is 
just an everyday use that we need.
    And then when it comes to equipment on a hazmat incident, 
the specialized suits, which can cost $15,000 or more, or the 
specialized monitoring equipment, it is unrealistic for the 
Federal Government to provide that to every department. But we 
do need to look at a regional approach so we can call in those 
teams that can supplement what we are trying to do.
    Chair Cantwell. So, we need to do more than what we have in 
the bill.
    Mr. Comstock. Yes, yes----
    Chair Cantwell. I know this already from my work in 2015. 
Trust me, I already know this because I have talked to lots of 
firefighters across the State of Washington. And believe me, 
rail goes everywhere in our State. So, Mr. Shaw, are you 
willing to support what is in the underlying bill, or are you 
willing to do more than in the underlying bill to make sure 
local firefighting teams have the equipment they need?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, we absolutely support what is in the 
underlying bill, and we are willing to do more to support 
firefighters. We just opened up a regional training facility in 
Ohio for first responders.
    Chair Cantwell. Yes, I am thinking something a little 
different. I think, you know, this committee has dealt with the 
oil spill trust fund. Senator Stevens did great work on that. 
It literally is about having the resources upfront in a timely 
manner to have in a community. And the challenge here is going 
to be to figure out how to do that and where to do that.
    But I think if we are going to continue to move product 
like this and have this level of risk, we can't just leave it 
up to volunteer firefighters to be on the front line. So, I do 
think we have to think about what is a way to put resources 
into the local community. So, I appreciate the fact that you 
are willing to consider that. Mr. Jefferies, you want to 
comment?
    Mr. Jefferies. I was going to say, 100 percent agree and 
would love to work with the Committee on how we best approach 
that.
    Chair Cantwell. Great. Great. Like that. OK, Ms. Homendy, 
did you have a comment about that?
    Ms. Homendy. A great place to look is PHMSA's Hazardous 
Materials Emergency Preparedness Program, which is about $28.3 
million annually and has been there--like that for years. It 
needs to increase. It is paid for by fees from the shippers and 
the transporters of hazmat.
    Chair Cantwell. OK. So, good. We get some consensus there. 
OK, and what about in general the--what we covered. One thing I 
actually, isn't in their bill--I don't think the video that you 
brought up earlier is in there.
    But you are saying, Ms. Homendy, that there should be some 
video communication. You are saying that there is missing video 
from this accident. Is that what you are saying? I don't know 
what--OK, you are just saying you don't have video.
    That it wasn't required, but there was video, but we don't 
have it because the engine moved on and went somewhere else and 
was videotaped over?
    Ms. Homendy. Yes.
    Chair Cantwell. OK. And in the DuPont accident, you were 
mentioning how valuable that was. Why was it valuable in the 
DuPont accident?
    Ms. Homendy. Very valuable. First, we--some assumed early 
on, not us, that there was distraction in the locomotive cab, 
and we could see in the video that that did not occur. We also 
could see that there was some hesitation by the engineer around 
the controls. It was a new locomotive. And we determined, 
through the investigation, including looking at the video, that 
they weren't provided adequate training, the train crew.
    Chair Cantwell. OK.
    Ms. Homendy. So right now, the requirement is on--the 
requirement and law is on Amtrak and the commuter railroads, 
not on the class I freight railroads. And we would advocate for 
that.
    Chair Cantwell. Mr. Whitaker.
    Mr. Whitaker. I would just like to piggyback on what the 
Chair is saying. In regards to training, these class I 
railroads have reduced their training programs down to bare 
minimum. When I heard on the railroad 2,000, I had 26 weeks to 
train. Nowadays it is 6 weeks or less on these class I 
railroads.
    We are hauling 200 plus car trains and hazardous materials. 
And that is not right. You are putting too much pressure on 
employees right now with inadequate training. And I am sure 
these numbers--I would be curious to see what the retention 
rate is. I know Mr. Shaw brags about how much they have hired 
people.
    What is the retention rate of people sticking around? I am 
an advocate for a two-person crew, obviously, but if I am not 
hearing the CEO of my company tell me I am going to have a job, 
I am going to be looking somewhere else.
    Chair Cantwell. Mr. Whitaker, what standards should we be 
looking at given that we have had this transformation into 
longer trains? I don't think we have we have heard this 
intermittently through the Committee, but this is a sea change.
    Mr. Whitaker. Right. So, to Ms. Homendy's point about how 
much technology is on a locomotive. As an engineer by craft, I 
am looking at four computer screens. I am busy. I don't even 
have time to look out the window of my locomotive half the 
time.
    I am depending on the conductor over there to be my eyes 
and ears and keep me in check. Enhanced training for that 
conductor would greatly assist the locomotive engineer, 
greatly. And I think in the railroad industry as a whole, we 
have lost a lot of our expertise over the years because we have 
people that have zero railroad experience running our 
railroads.
    We could be so much more efficient and do so much better if 
railroad management would just listen to labor. We could move 
trains without incident. We can make things more safe. But they 
just got to listen.
    Chair Cantwell. What would we have done in this instance, 
do you think, given that we were talking about a wheel bearing?
    Mr. Whitaker. What I feel should have been done with the 
trending defect is sector technology, and this is something 
going back to last year that I have sounded the whistle on. We 
need to eliminate trending defect detector, keeping that 
information to ourselves in our headquarters. OK, let's just 
take the chance, let's move this train on down the line. That 
is what they are doing. What should happen----
    Chair Cantwell. Wait, wait, you are saying that they knew 
that this train had a weak spot, is that what you are saying?
    Mr. Whitaker. Absolutely.
    Chair Cantwell. You are saying they knew the train had a 
weak spot?
    Mr. Whitaker. If their trending defect detector, according 
to the NTSB report that I have read, they have seen this car 
trend hotter and hotter over the course of three detectors, I 
believe, that information is going to somebody at Norfolk 
Southern and they are not conveying that information to the 
railroad crews.
    Chair Cantwell. Mr. Shaw, did someone at Norfolk Southern 
have that information?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, my understanding from the NTSB report is 
once they try and hit the third detector, which showed that we 
hit the threshold, then the crew acted appropriately. However, 
they--the part had already failed.
    Chair Cantwell: Why did you keep putting the car on is the 
question? I think Mr. Whitaker is saying you should have had a 
signal--listen, this is definitely where this--this is where I 
am going. I don't know, I will have to ask Senator Cruz and my 
other colleagues where they are going, but I am telling you 
right now, we are going to use transparency and technology, and 
make sure that people are getting that information as fast as 
possible.
    We are going to use NTSB to help us hold the FAA 
accountable, and we are going to help them, as they are today, 
hold this accountable. We have to look at safety trends. We 
have to look at what is coming at us because they are telling 
us in advance.
    That is what technology can do, tell us in advance where 
there is a problem. But we can't ignore that because we want to 
make some more money. We have to go and say, we are going to 
make the investment and we are going to make sure everybody has 
the information. And that is how we keep on top of safety. Ms. 
Homendy.
    Ms. Homendy. I would just add, so in Atlanta, Norfolk 
Southern has an advanced train control desk. And what they saw 
there at the second wayside defect detector was a noncritical 
alert. It wasn't a critical alarm because the threshold at the 
time was 103 plus about 10 degrees from underneath the train 
above ambient.
    And so, they got a critical alarm at the last one, but by 
that time, the train was in the process of derailing because 
there is a little bit of a delay. The crew will get 
information, but in--at the train control desk, the entire 
train needs to move past that wayside detector before the train 
control desk has that information. With that said, they are 
also at the same time dealing with other trains that may have 
warm or hot bearings.
    Chair Cantwell: So, you are saying, I don't--Mr. Whitaker, 
what are you saying, that before this, knowing that the 
information was there, something should have happened on these 
cars and somebody, if you would have had the information and 
the workforce would have had the information, they would have 
asked for some further inspection. Is that what you are saying?
    Mr. Whitaker. That is what I am saying. When you are on a 
train and you are passing over a road defect detector, if that 
detector senses a wheel bearing hits a threshold, we hear a 
beep alarm. That tells me as a locomotive engineer, all right, 
I am not going to apply the train brakes on the train because I 
don't know what is wrong with them. I will go--we will go on to 
what is called dynamic braking, which slows the locomotive down 
and slows the train down.
    So, I am going to come to a safe stop. And once I clear 
that detector, it is going to tell me what is wrong. But in 
this case, if I see my tire pressure on my car losing air, I 
will go pull over and stop and check that out, right. If I own 
a railroad and I see a wheel heating up, I am going to call--I 
am going to protect my investment and I am going to call that 
train crew. Hey, I know you are not meeting the threshold here, 
but maybe you guys need to stop and go back and check this out. 
It could be something, a handbrake applied on a car or a stuck 
brake.
    Something that could be addressed right then and there. So, 
once it starts trending, we need to stop and check it out. No 
matter if we don't even hit that threshold, let's take the 
safest course of action.
    Chair Cantwell. Thank you. All right, Senator Cruz, thank 
you. Do you have a follow up for a second round? Sorry, I kind 
of took my first and second round together. But I think we are 
nearing the end. For our witnesses, you have been very patient 
and thank you for putting--we have been here for much--long 
time here, so we appreciate it.
    Senator Cruz. Well, thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you 
to the witnesses. This has been, I think, a productive hearing, 
a useful hearing. Mr. Jefferies, I want to start with this. 
Listen, I think everyone here is concerned about enhancing 
safety standards to minimize the risk of derailments.
    And I think there is bipartisan interest in moving rail 
safety legislation. I think we are going to be successful in 
doing that. At the same time, we want to enhance safety, we 
want to protect the interests of consumers.
    And I will say there are portions of the Brown bill as 
currently drafted that concern me, in particular giving 
significantly more authority to the Department of 
Transportation. This Department of Transportation, their 
policies created a supply chain crisis in the last 2 years that 
drove up costs and increased scarcity for consumers all across 
the country. And the Biden Administration has also demonstrated 
a deep animus to energy.
    And I would certainly be concerned about giving Secretary 
Buttigieg the authority to make it significantly more difficult 
to transport energy in the United States and to drive up costs 
for consumers.
    Now, in your judgment, Mr. Jefferies, what are the 
provisions in the current draft of the bill that concern you? 
And in particular, what could be the negative consequences for 
consumers of Secretary Buttigieg having too much authority to 
drive up costs?
    Mr. Jefferies. Well, thank you for that, and I very much 
appreciate the question. Contrary to statements that have been 
made, the AAR has not taken a position on this bill.
    Frankly, I think there is a feasible path forward on almost 
every provision in there. Now, your definition of feasible and 
mine may not be the same, but I think there is an opportunity 
to work together to try to get the yes. I think, you know, the 
provision you are asking about is one that would apply, I 
think, upwards of 12 new rulemakings around any train that is 
moving at least one car of hazmat.
    Over 40 percent of trains move with at least one car of 
hazmat. Now, that could be a flammable gas. It could also be 
asphalt. And in my view, I am not sure applying those same 
levels of restrictions for flammable gases and asphalt makes a 
lot of sense because of the overarching impacts it can have on 
the network overall, the impacts it can have on energy 
shippers, the impacts it can have on Ag shippers, the impacts 
it can have on intermodal premium shippers, similar to UPS.
    Now, does that mean that nothing should be done? Absolutely 
not. I think there is a logical case to be made for a parallel 
requirement for trains carrying flammable gases as we currently 
have for flammable liquids.
    But it is about taking a risk-based approach that doesn't 
treat the entire class of commodities the same, but really 
focuses on what is truly a higher risk train versus one that 
perceives little risk. So, there is a path forward there, and I 
think we just need to target what we are actually focused on 
here.
    Senator Cruz. Well, thank you. That is helpful. And we will 
certainly commit to working with you to try to find a solution 
that enhances safety while at the same time protecting the 
interests of consumers. Mr. Shaw, you and I talked yesterday, 
and you described that Norfolk Southern was a proponent of 
venting and burning the vinyl chloride from all five tanks.
    At least one of the tanks was significantly injured. There 
has been disagreement as to whether the other four tanks were 
compromised or not. Will you commit to providing this committee 
with any and all information you have as to the condition of 
all five of those tank cars?
    Mr. Shaw. Yes, we will be transparent with the Committee 
about our understanding of the conditions on the ground. My 
goal during the entire process was to provide unified command 
and the incident commander with the best information that we 
had.
    And at that point, there was concern that these four cars 
had been in a pool of fire and that the pressure relief valve 
had failed, and there was concern about the pressure on the 
cars.
    Senator Cruz. In terms of the decision to vent and burn the 
vinyl chloride, which is what caused the massive plume of smoke 
and the rather extraordinary sight of an American city 
essentially on fire, among the decisionmakers that were engaged 
in that process, did anyone disagree with the recommendation to 
vent and burn the vinyl chloride from all five tank cars?
    Mr. Shaw. Sir, my understanding is unified command was 
aligned around that decision, and that decision was based 
solely on the safety of that community.
    Senator Cruz. Ms. Homendy, what are the alternatives to 
venting and burning, and what are the risks involved in the 
venting and burning procedure?
    Ms. Homendy. Part of FRA guidance is--on venting and 
burning is to look at the alternatives. One is a controlled 
venting through the valves. In this case, they were melted. So, 
that was not an option. You could do hot tapping, which is 
essentially cutting a hole in the tank car and draining the 
liquid, essentially trans loading it into another railcar. 
There are risks to that. And then there is the vent and burn.
    Senator Cruz. Mr. Shaw, Ms. Homendy testified earlier today 
that the locomotive that was involved in this derailment was 
immediately or almost immediately put into service on another 
train, and so the video was not available for examination.
    Did that happen and why? I have to admit, hearing that, 
both Senator Cantwell and I looked at each other and thought 
that was a really bizarre thing to hear. So, is that true, and 
if so, why?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, my understanding is that 15 minutes of 
video are available, time before, during, and immediately after 
the derailment. My understanding is we followed protocols.
    Senator Cruz. Mr. Shaw, I asked you to answer the question 
I asked. Is it true the locomotive was very shortly thereafter 
put into service and the result was significant portions of the 
video were missing?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, at some point after, and it sounds like 
it was shortly after was put on, sir. I don't have the details. 
I am happy to follow up.
    Senator Cruz. All right. Well, let me just say, any time 
there is a locomotive involved in a serious derailment, it is 
lunacy that that video is not preserved and that locomotive is 
put into alternative service.
    So that, I feel confident we could get unanimity on this 
committee on that. Let me ask also, there is a lot of 
discussion about command central having the wayside detectors 
and the conductor and the engineer not having information on 
this particular tank car, has Norfolk Southern examined whether 
it had triggered previous wayside detectors either on this 
train or in other circumstances?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I believe that is part of the NTSB 
investigation.
    Senator Cruz. Has Norfolk Southern examined that? Did you 
know if it had triggered previous wayside detectors?
    Mr. Shaw. I am not aware that it did.
    Senator Cruz. Ms. Homendy, do you have any information on 
this, or do we have some confidence that we will be able to get 
the answer to that at some point?
    Ms. Homendy. I will provide you that answer. What we do 
have is that it had not reached the critical threshold that is 
set by Norfolk Southern until that third one.
    Senator Cruz. Yes, I am certainly interested not just in 
the critical threshold, but the trending analysis, and the 
shift that is less than the critical threshold but could well 
indicate a problem before the derailment.
    Ms. Homendy. We are also interested in that as well.
    Senator Cruz. OK, final question. Mr. Shaw, I am sure you 
heard Ms. Allison's testimony, which was powerful. She raised a 
very simple question about moms that are concerned about their 
kids.
    She described her 7-year-old who was afraid for his own 
health and safety. What is your answer to her and other moms 
who are afraid for their health and safety in this community?
    And who, as she described, may not be able to move, may not 
be able to sell their house because their home prices have 
dropped. What is your answer tonight? What should she tell her 
child, her 7-year-old child tonight? And what should other moms 
in that circumstance tell their kids tonight?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I am terribly sorry for the impact that 
this has had on my community, and I know that it has been 
traumatic. I was there during the vinyl burn and I saw this 
plume and I know what it looked like.
    There is ongoing testing by the EPA, the Ohio EPA, and the 
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. They all 
show that the air is safe and the water is safe to breathe. 
There are millions of data points. There is still enormous 
concern within the community about three long term issues.
    One is long term health care, one is about property 
valuations, as you noted, and one is ongoing water monitoring. 
And so, Norfolk Southern is working with relevant stakeholders, 
which include State and local authorities, on setting up funds 
to cover all three of those.
    Senator Cruz. How many families were impacted?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, there are 4,700 approximately folks in 
East Palestine, and there are some who are impacted in western 
Pennsylvania as well.
    Senator Cruz. So, you had said earlier in your testimony 
that you have spent to date, if I got the number right, $24 
million. You also noted 6,000 families altogether. Doing a 
quick math, that is about $4,000 per family. Do you agree with 
Ms. Allison's testimony that home prices have dropped 
significantly? And if there is a mom scared for her kids, that 
she right now doesn't have any great options?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, I understand your point. Our 
contributions to date are just the start, and what we are 
offering through the Family Assistance Center is that for folks 
who want to relocate, we will pay for the relocation fees. Our 
family assistance center since the day after the derailment.
    Senator Cruz. So, I want to understand you correctly, you 
are saying if a family in East Palestine wants to move, that 
Norfolk Southern will pay the cost of their moving, and will 
you also make them whole if they try to sell their house and 
they can get substantially less for it than they could have 
before this derailment?
    Mr. Shaw. Senator, what I am saying is that if they want to 
leave their house for a while, we will pay for those relocation 
fees. And we are establishing--working with relevant 
stakeholders in a long-term fund for the property valuable 
assurance.
    Senator Cruz. So, you will put them up in a motel or hotel 
temporarily, but you are not assisting with moving them? I just 
want to understand what you are doing right now.
    Mr. Shaw. Right now, we are putting them up in a hotel and 
paying for food and clothing if needed. And we are also working 
with relevant stakeholders on our long-term fund for property 
valuation.
    Senator Cruz. Well, let me say this, Mr. Shaw, you have 
said multiple times you want to make it right. Let me encourage 
you, make it right is a real commitment and this committee 
expects Norfolk Southern to do exactly that. These people and 
these families matter.
    Chair Cantwell. Well, thank you, Senator Cruz. That 
concludes our hearing. I thank all the witnesses for 
participating today. I ask unanimous consent that these letters 
from the East Palestine residents regarding the impact of 
derailment be entered into the record. And without objection, 
it will be so ordered.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    Thank you for the opportunity to submit testimony on the 
environmental and public health threats from the Norfolk Southern train 
derailment and chemical release. My name is Hilary Flint and I am a 
resident of Enon Valley, Pennsylvania--the tiny town with less than 300 
people that borders East Palestine, Ohio.
    My great grandparents purchased this land and I am now the fourth 
generation in my family to call Enon Valley home. My grandparents, 
Louise Svihra (Benetti) and Robert Svihra, worked hard to achieve the 
American dream--they started a family, owned a home and land, opened 
many successful small businesses and became pillars of the community. 
My father, Jarett Svihra, has continued their legacy by growing those 
companies and purchasing land to develop throughout Western 
Pennsylvania. Yet I fear that there will be no legacy left for me, or 
my siblings, to continue.
    Since the ``controlled'' explosion, we have been told that it is 
safe to be in our home. To drink our water. To plant in our soil. Yet 
my lived experience tells a different story. You see, I have a history 
of autoimmune disease, chronic illness and kidney cancer. This means 
that I am often more affected by my environment. Stories like mine have 
been ignored, unheard and undermined throughout this crisis.
    You tell me that my water is safe. Yet when I wash my hands, I get 
red rashes. When I shower, my toes turn purple. When I wash my face, my 
eyes are itchy. You tell me that my air is safe. Yet I have migraines. 
I'm congested. I'm tired, dizzy and weak. You tell me that all tests 
show that I am safe. Yet the smell in my home is so pungent that it 
travels with me wherever I go--clinging to my skin, my hair and my 
clothes.
    You tell me that since my home is more than 1 mile away, I do not 
qualify for resources. You tell me that if I want independent testing 
done on my property, that I will have to pay that expense. You tell me 
that if I want to get rid of the smell, that I must clean every 
surface--inside and out, wash every item of clothing and change every 
filter in my home. You tell me that if I have medical concerns, that I 
must go to a clinic that is unable to do tests, give a diagnosis or 
even write a prescription. You tell me that because Norfolk Southern 
continued to put corporate greed before public safety, that I am 
responsible for their actions.
    Let me tell YOU something.
    We, the people, have had enough. Appalachian communities are tired 
of being physically, mentally and financially burdened for the benefit 
of everyone but its residents. This blue collar area will no longer be 
ignored, silenced or dismissed.
    We, the people, expect real change. Suspend all Norfolk Southern 
operations. Demand their leadership team be fired and held criminally 
liable for their actions. Make them compensate each and every family 
within a 30 mile radius of the derailment so that residents can do 
whatever they need to do to feel safe.
    We, the people, are watching. My grandmother. My father. My 
siblings. Myself. The people that have lived in these communities for 
generations, the people that fought hard to achieve the American dream, 
the people that have defended this country with their vote, their word 
and sometimes their life. We are all waiting to see what you do to end 
this American nightmare.
                                              Hilary Flint.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    My house in Darlington Twp. was covered by the black smoke, after 
they detonated the rail cars.
    Now we aren't sure how this will affect our health, our water, and 
soil. We are afraid to even have a garden!
    We want Norfolk Southern to offer buy us out of our houses, so we 
can move to a safer area.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I live inH0hollow road.
    My son Dylan has bronchoopulmonary dysplasia do to premature birth. 
He is now 16 years old. He has had two treatment of steroids since the 
controlled release and continues to use his inhaler. We moved out of 
our home for over 2 weeks because of his breathing issues. My biggest 
concern is his health and safety. Am I risking further lung damage 
keeping him in our home?? No one can answer these questions. Trust me 
I've reached out to doctors, state NS. No one can tell me. What would 
you do if this was your child? I've watched my child struggling to 
breath more than once. We don't have all the answers now, isn't going 
to work if the damaged is done to his lungs before we have the answers.
    Is my water safe now or in the future? What is coming out of my 
ground? Is that going to cause issues for him down the road?
    At this time he still leaves our home on the weekends just to keep 
him our of the environment. During the week I no choice because of 
school.
    Home is your safe area. Not for us anymore. Will I ever fill safe 
in my home again?? I sure hope I can.
    I believe someone has these answers. You can not tell me if your 
having trouble breathing, burning nose and throat, sore in my nose, 
headaces, rashes on your skin your safe. How could you feel safe? Would 
you feel safe?
    Everything in our world has been turned up side down. My husband 
passed away suddenly of a heart attack. My son unfortunately was the 
one to find him. He did everything he could for his dad.
    I've worked hard to rebuild a life for us in our home. Our family 
home. Were we can find some peace and happiness. Maybe some can 
understand what a struggle this can be with loosing a husband, father. 
That is gone now because I don't know if I am safe in my home.
    No we are not in the one mile circle but our lives have been deeply 
effected.

Hon. Maria Cantwell,
Chairperson, Commerce Committee,

Washington, DC.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I live in Western Pennsylvania and the East Palestine Derailment 
has directly affected us in ways more indirect, but just as detrimental 
to our communities. The possible environmental fallout of contamination 
like dioxins have us on edge. The blatant conflicts of interests in 
regards to who is responsible for the testing, and who is hired to do 
the testing, to who takes responsibility for the testing.
    We would like to know how we can have comprehensive unbiased 
testing done to ensure we are safe just the same as East Palestine does 
as well.
    Water contamination from this incident was detected in the Gulf of 
Mexico. If another disaster spill occurs dams must be immediately be 
put in place across the affected streams to keep contamination from 
spreading like this one did. The thought of another disaster still 
hangs like an albatross on our necks. This albatross hangs while the 
legislatures mull changes, to an industry and its lobbyists long 
opposed to change.
    These are a few of our concerns. The possible fallout of 
contamination from the controlled burn and the other materials involved 
has me physically sick. The worst of which are Dioxins. Dioxins are 
well known in the annals of environmental contamination leading to the 
creation of many ``superfund sites'' as well as the complete 
dissolution of a Missouri town called Times Beach. The dissolution of a 
neighborhood in Suburban Buffalo New York. Perhaps you may have heard 
of it. It was called ``Love Canal'', and Vietnam veterans seek 
settlements from Veterans Affairs because of dioxin exposure in Vietnam 
stemming from Agent Orange.
    Anytime a chlorinated substance is burned it creates Dioxins. 
Dioxins have the capability to be the worst toxic contaminant. Even 
worse than nuclear fallout from a reactor meltdown such as Chernobyl or 
Fukishima. Dioxins are toxic at one part per billion. Dioxins can take 
100s of years to break down in the environment when not exposed to 
sunlight. They do not dissolve in water, but attach to particulates 
which float in water spreading misery and death. Dioxins cause cancers 
diabetes, heart disease and many other life threatening, life altering 
diseases. The controlled burn of vinyl chloride created a toxic plume 
of dioxin laden smoke.
    The plume was modeled by NOAA at Pittsburgh International Airport 
showing coverage of parts of Eastern Ohio, Pennsylvania, almost all of 
New York, all of Vermont, part of New Hampshire. It also showed 
coverage of portions of Ontario, Quebec, and New Newfoundland Canada. 
Possibly creating an international incident. The water contamination 
reaching the Gulf of Mexico is another facet of this disaster. The 
scope of this disaster will take generations and many lives to see the 
effects.
    We need testing of our soil, but testing is a costly endeavor. We 
want it paid for by Norfolk Southern to make sure our soil is safe. Our 
farmers are starting to plant, and we want to start preparing our 
gardens. We do not know if our soil is safe to plant in. Please send us 
aid to ensure of our safety.
    Personally, I would like to see it be made illegal to intentionally 
burn any chlorinated compound. Firefighters often get dioxin exposure 
from burning houses as many modern homes use Polyvinyl chlorine (PVC) 
exclusively for their plumbing. Unless it is in an incinerator of 2,000 
degrees Fahrenheit. Only by incinerating Dioxins and chlorinated 
compounds can they be totally destroyed. I would also like to see any 
chlorinated compounds that can burn to be phased out in favor of more 
environmentally friendly alternatives.
    CERCLA itself needs amended as well. The fact that the E.P.A. 
allowed a laboratory called Tetra to conduct air sampling when Tetra is 
currently under investigation by the Department of Justice for using 
biased under-reporting for the Department of the Navy. This is 
indicative of more grey areas that must be immediately addressed.
    The fact that the investment firm ``Blackrock'' who is the second 
highest share holder in Norfolk Southern is a large shareholder in 
Tetra is another problem. This is called a conflict of interest. CERCLA 
must be reworked to say, ``no investigative laboratory or firm can be 
used that is currently under investigation, or which has any connection 
to the company against whom CERCLA is being invoked as the responsible 
party due to any incident where CERCLA is invoked''.
    Neutral Third Party testing must become law, immediately. Purdue 
University, Big Pine Consultants of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon, and 
other smaller laboratories are conducting their own tests, and they are 
conflicting with the official government test results. These private 
institutions are using more sensitive equipment that are able to find 
much smaller amounts of contamination. Contamination that still pose 
health risks at the levels they are finding, but that the government's 
own tests cannot detect. This proves why neutral third parties should 
always do the testing from now on in any incident per CERCLA.
    The derailment is a symptom of a system long overdue for stricter 
laws. While I support the railroad industry. Safety should always be 
the top priority. The 4 R's Act of 1970 and the Staggers Railroad act 
of 1977 allowed for large scale deregulation of the U.S. Railroad 
Industry. In many ways they helped to save railroading in the U.S. by 
this deregulating, but in so doing laid the ground work for the willful 
negligence that precipitated this disaster.
    Many older Americans remember the ``caboose'' on all freight 
trains, but after the passage of the two aforementioned pieces of 
deregulation legislation the caboose was relegated to only certain 
hazardous freight trains. Due to how the laws were written the 
Hazardous materials that were released from the derailment did not 
constitute a hazardous train requiring the use of a caboose. Why were 
cabooses used? They were used originally to help with braking the train 
as well as for the railroad crews to watch for ``hot boxes'' also known 
as overheating wheels which led to many derailments in the past, and 
which caused this disaster. The Caboose necessitated trains not be 
longer than the line of sight for train crews. Had cabooses not been 
allowed to be relegated to extreme circumstances this disaster could 
likely have been avoided. I would like to see the caboose return as a 
``Safetyboose''. I would like to see the modern caboose fitted with 
state of the art equipment used to detect problems and qualified train 
crews to man them. We cannot allow the railroads to use remote 
personnel. I would like these modern cabooses to include a ``kill 
switch'' that will immediately start braking the train, to stop it if 
the crew detect any sort of problem without requiring the consultation 
of remote dispatchers, or the engineer in the lead locomotive. I would 
like to see implemented an immediate introduction of dynamic braking to 
coincide with the re-introduction of the ``safetyboose''.
    Dynamic Braking is one piece of safety that I realize is in the 
news. It was on the table. Unfortunately, our infamous lobbyists had 
congress stop pursuing its implementation citing costs. I am sad to 
report the environmental and human suffering this incident has created 
and will do so for generations costs far more than a dying fiat 
currency could ever hope to save.
    Any lobbyist who lobbied Congress to not implement any safety 
mechanism should immediately be fired and not be allowed to work in 
Washington D.C. again. P.S.R. or Precision Scheduled Railroading is 
another co-conspirator in this disaster that must be immediately end. 
This little acronym, while not known prior to this disaster, is now 
under scrutiny. While PSR allowed NS to increase profits from $2 to $3 
billion, this co-conspirator allowed NS to cut safety checks, cut 
workers, and lengthen trains to a point never before seen in American 
History, and look at what it created.
    Congress needs to pass a law that a train cannot be so long as to 
be out of the line of sight of a train crew. Now of-course on the great 
plains where tracks are straight and flat. Regions where trains can 
most certainly be longer exist. However, in the mountains, valleys, and 
hills of Appalachia and the Rockies this is not the case. Now if the 
``safetyboose'' is implemented, and there can be more than one used in 
a lengthy train, I do not see where this could not be done.
    This derailment maybe the worst environmental disaster not just in 
the United States but the world. We must do everything we can to ensure 
it never happens again.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I live less than 1 mile from the derailment site. This train 
derailment should have NEVER happened. Norfolk Southern has put a lot 
of stress on families and the community. We need continued testing for 
soil, water, and especially medical for years to come. Norfolk Southern 
should pay for this, they are the ones that cut cost on safety. Now I 
have to worry about the safety of my kids and grandkids. I have lived 
in Unity and East Palestine my whole life. East Palestine is a nice 
community Norfolk Southern should not take that away from us

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    Hi My Name is Austin Druckenbrod I was involved in the East 
Palestine train derailment crisis not from living their but because my 
employer NVR located at          Which is a Fortune 500 company put all 
of their Employees into danger when they had us working before the 
Evacuation zone was lifted for the 1-2 mile radius Governor DeWine 
issued.
    Employees were asking to call off and with the housing market 
crisis being as bad as it is and all the employees they were laying off 
at the time they told us if we called off over the train derailment we 
would be pointed and out of a job because the state of Pennsylvania 
according to them never issued a mandatory evac and the Ohio evac 
didn't apply to the grounds of Pennsylvania when nvr is 1.1 miles from 
ground zero in east Palestine maybe even closer we can see the 
remediation site from the tracks from the company so it's close enough 
and when I called osha and the cops they told us Ohio had no 
jurisdiction over pa when NVR was located within the evacuation zone 
from Governor DeWines statement of 1-2 miles but somehow that doesn't 
apply to Pennsylvania I don't understand how a state can get out of 
being within the evac zone.
    I called off work on Monday for my own safety I had a personal day 
thank god so I wouldn't get pointed and than Tuesday February 7th we 
got a text message stating they were shut down I had to return to work 
on weds the 8th prior to going to work on Wednesday Tuesday night I 
drove out to nvr to figure out how I would get to work as the national 
guard had all roadways closed to get to nvr so I had to drive through 
road closures to get to my job that night Tuesday the 7th when I got 
out of my car to examine the environment I could smell the worst of 
smells I could still see smoke from wherever they were still burning 
stuff on Tuesday February 7th their was a haze fog like substance 
hovering over the ground from the rain or whatever it was drove home 
instantly had symptoms of many types which are documented at Saint 
Elizabeth hospital in boardman Ohio.
    I was wrote off from work for symptom management that Norfolk 
southern never paid me for because they said I wasn't within the evac 
zone but then cut me a check for the days the roads were closed and 
said this is the best we can do and didn't even offer to pay my medical 
bills as they said we do not have any information on how to handle 
medical and to top it all off I'm 24 years old I've worked hard my 
whole life to get where I'm at and now I don't even feel safe at my job 
or work because of the catastrophe that has happened and I'm in fear of 
my life as I already have medical problems and with my job being so 
close to ground zero I have a fear of getting cancer and it's not fair.
    I may have to change my whole life job career housing situation 
because of a train accident that could have been prevented if safety 
was the priority I wanted to retire at that company that was my new 
dream and now it's gone because of Norfolk southern.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I live in East Palestine,3/4 mile from the derailment. I have 
existing chronic health issues and extreme difficulty in detoxifying. 
As a result, I have what are known as ''paradoxical'' reactions even to 
vitamins and supplements. This is due to a metaboic disorder and to 
advance heart failure. So no, I'm not a hysterically-inclined person 
that reacts to about everything. However, I do have extreme reactions 
to many things, particularly chemicals.
    So yes, I have had a number of aggravated symptoms since the 
derailment and toxic fires. Among them have been throat & lung 
irritation and occasional burning sensations . . . an extreme 
production of mucous . . . and exhaustion. Prior to the event, I would 
have to make a few rest stops when walking to town. After the even, I 
know have to stop several times.
    My concerns are the common concerns of my entire community . . . a 
thorough clean-up, ongoing testing of air-water & soil . . . paid-for 
medical testing . . . proper compensation for losses incurred and for 
potential medical treatment.
    However, according to my own calls, contacts and research.. we 
already have some definite problems in most of these areas. Dr.Beier 
form Pittsburgh is an authority on vinyl chloride. He lab studies have 
shown liver cancers, etc. at levels lower than now considered ''safe.'' 
Meanwhile, she has needed further funding to do testing here.
    And, speaking of vinyl chloride a virologist contracted by Norfolk 
Southern informed me that vinyl chloride ''metabolizes'' quickly . . . 
so, blood detection can pose problems. Well, many of us couldn't afford 
proper testing there . . . and, NS is yet to step up to bat with that 
one. So, over a month and a half post derail . . . we'll not likely 
have helpful readings there.
    I expand on that subject because we have definite serious issues 
with both medical and environmental testing. All of this testing needs 
to be done ''independently'' and not via a NS or EPA contractor. And, 
beyond the testing . . . any and all lab work also needs to be 
independent and not set at higher ''safe'' levels. Today, many EPA and 
other testing is still not done at the levels recommended by the CDC, 
etc. And again, NS needs to pay for proper medical testing ''NOW''. 
otherwise, the blood-urine and tissue samples of certain toxic 
chemicals won't accurately reflect toxic impact and potential harm.
    More recently, the citizens here have shown even more concern about 
Dioxins. The rail clean-up and it's delays. as well as the upcoming 
growing season for farmers and gardeners further emphasizes that 
concern. Any animal testing to date has been reported as ''safe'' Well, 
that's good to hear and is likely true. for it takes time for dioxins 
to ''bio-accumulate'' in living tissues. Therefore, and given the 
extreme toxicity of dioxines even in minute amounts. proper ongoing 
testing of soils and animals will be absolutely essential.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I'm writing on Concerning the Toxic Train Derailment that shattered 
life as we know it in East Palestine, Ohio on February 3, 2023.
    We were relaxing after a long day, when we heard constant sirens 
going by our house. We looked outside to see if we could tell where 
they are going. From our front porch on                 . you could see 
giant flames and so much smoke. We could tell something major was 
happening so my son and I got into the car to go drive by and have a 
look. We could not get across town to see where the fire was coming 
from because a train was blocking every railroad crossing and town and 
stopped there. We drove to the overhead bridge at the other end of town 
to get across. When we got to the other side of town. It was like an 
Apocalyptic event.
    Smoke was everywhere. Police were already going door to doors 
evacuating the residents that lived closest to the fire. It was 
enormous. A train had derailed and caught fire.
    It was pure Chaos. As my son and I dove by, we heard something 
exploding and could feel the heat of the fire on our faces. We drove to 
my parents home 3 blocks South of the train tracks. From there you 
could really see how big the fire was. The flames were hundreds of feet 
high. The people in town were all coming out to watch and see what was 
going on. Soon the police started setting up roadblocks. I received a 
call from my neighbor saying we were being evacuated on our street. So 
my son and I made out back across town to our house and sure enough the 
police were going door to door telling us to leave. It was very scary 
and we did not realize how dangerous it was. We packed our animals and 
all we could grab in 10 minutes and took off not knowing where to go.
    I called my Ex Mother In law and she took us in at 11:45 pm.
    It has been 45 days now, and we have not returned home.
    Release of the Chemicals that were still burning on the train a few 
days later. This resulted in thousands of gallons of highly hazardous 
chemicals being burned off into the air less than one half mile from My 
home and my parents home where I was born and raised my whole life. The 
evacuation this time was mandatory if you were in a one mile radius of 
the derailment. So everyone left.
    The days after the release were full of anxiety, fear, uncertainty, 
anger.
    How could this Happen? How could this happen to us? Our little 
town.
    Know one knew what was going on. What was safe. What was even on 
the train. When we would be allowed back to our homes. If our homes 
would be safe to live in. The National Guard was called in to help. 
Media started covering the story.
    After 1 day the evacuation order was lifted and people returned to 
town only to discover the terrible chemical stench that now lingers 
permanently. People started to notice chemicals in the water. Other 
people started noticing symptoms.
    Headaches, sore throat, eyes, cough, dizziness, bloody noses, 
rashes. Animals were reportedly dying.
    We were told it was safe to return. But it obviously was not safe.
    We were given No Instructions whatsoever on what to do to clean our 
homes. If they even could be cleaned. Whether or not to throw away 
Plastics or Food. Or clean our walls and floors. Did all of the smoke 
and chemicals get in? No answers..
    Was our air even safe to be breathing? Or our water safe to use? 
Are there harmful dioxins on our lawns now? Are our children safe? Will 
we all need constant medical testing now? Why did the have to happen? 
Still No Answers. . .
    The town has suffered enough. Please help.
    We don't want anything special. We just want our lives back. We 
want our kids to be safe walking to school. We want our homes to be 
safe. We want our water tested and our soil and air. We want our health 
screened. Our home values guaranteed. Or relocation for families that 
no longer want to live there.
    This has taken a Major Psychological toll on the residents of East 
Palestine, myself included. Norfolk Southern needs to be held 
accountable.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    We moved to East Palestine in August. We moved into my fiance's 
home that he has lived his whole life. His grandfather passed away so 
his parents moved in with his grandma who needs full time care because 
of dementia. They have slowly been moving their belongings that have 
been there for 40+ years into his grandmothers. My fiance moved out a 
little over 5 years ago for the first time ever because we met and were 
having a baby.
    Fast forward we (fiance, 4yr old daughter, 13m daughter, and I) 
moved into his home that still had majority of stuff there. We have 
been working very hard to organize and make this our forever home. We 
were doing to rent 2 own. He was so excited to have his children grow 
up in the exact house that he had; show them his toys as a kid, etc. We 
have put a lot of work into the home because I wanted to live in a more 
modern home. There was an issue every time it would rain, the basement 
would flood. Now that I've seen all the dead fish/animals dying i'm 
worried the chemicals have entered through the basement.
    The night of the derailment I heard a noise and yelled down and 
asked them what that was, I had the music on and couldn't tell where it 
was coming from and then he ran up to get me and told me what happened. 
He ran outside and called his family and we could see tons of cars 
trying to escape town. We got an alert on our phone saying to leave if 
you're in one mile of a location (which we were) we grabbed a couple 
items and went to new Waterford to his parents house.
    We wrapped the girls faces up with masks and scarves as much as we 
could. We grabbed very little compared to what we have here now. I work 
from home and grabbed all the paperwork incase I couldn't go back.
    On Saturday the 4th I went home and cleaned and all that until 
Sunday afternoon. When I arrived Saturday night the smell was very 
strong. I couldn't smell anything the next day but everyone who came 
into town said they could. So I think I became used to the smell and 
didn't notice as much. They closed school for a week and then claimed 
it was cleaned top to bottom and school would be open. I was terrified 
on what to do, but my fiance said she was going.
    It seemed like everyday there was news that it was worse than what 
they were making it out to be. Both girls had rashes, violently puking, 
i had a migraine, one of my girls ended up having periorbital 
cellulitis in her eyes and we have all been sick since with a common 
cold i'm guessing but for me it has lasted this whole time.
    We just grocery shopped on the 1st and spent almost 300, so all of 
that was then thrown out. We have been back for a few minutes grabbing 
items and went to abundant life to collect our ``inconvenience check'' 
and the man told me that we were not home by ``choice'' and since we 
haven't had our air tested they could no longer help us.
    I haven't worked at all since we left and my fiance worked maybe 2-
3 times. He can't leave the sight of our girls or they get scared and 
scream and cry. We already tried calling to get our air tested. The 
people had no clue where the mile was and no one said they would come 
test.
    After abundant life we called the number to get our air tested, 
left voice-mails, received one phone call back to get info (same info 
we left on a voice-mail) and never received a call back. We tried 
calling again and couldn't get through. There was a new number so we 
called it and told them we've been trying and the lady said the number 
was down and to keep trying, which we have. 43 days later. . .still not 
a phone call back.
    We have changed our furnace filter a few times(keeping the old 
ones) got an air purifier and a dehumidifier. So that's been plugged in 
over a week now.
    We're just at a loss.
    I have seen people on Facebook say they're still getting help from 
abundant life but we haven't went back because we can't get anyone to 
check on our air. His grandma is so confused as to who we are, she 
doesn't think this is her house, and it's very sad and uncomfortable 
and not something my kids should be dealing with.
    Everyday we keep saying we're going back but we never do-i would 
never forgive myself if something happened to my children because we 
brought them home. If they would've been straightforward and honest 
with us from the beginning than i wouldn't be as scared. But I feel 
like they minimized the situation and said there's nothing to worry 
about once they lifted the evacuation and everyone's air is fine.
    Until a different company does testing and says that they lied. I'm 
at a loss on what to do and i'm terrified.
    Not only my little family, but i feel bad for his parents taking 
over paying their money on the their own bills, while the value of 
their house had decreased significantly and i don't want to bail on 
them and back out of our word. I wish they would just demolish the 
houses within a certain area and rebuild everything brand new. They're 
worth so much, I'm sure a new park and all they've done to ``help'' 
will be nice for someone, but my family isn't benefiting from it. We've 
been stuck in a basement with two kids that want to go home. My 4 yr 
old has turned 5 and we couldn't have a party. I have a video of her 
crying because she wants to go home. It's not fair to anyone. We just 
want life back. We are running out of funds, thank God it was tax 
season, but that money is gone now too..

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    My name is Diana Holzer and have lived in East Palestine, Ohio my 
entire life. My husband Anthony and I have been married for 52 years.
    We have two grown children who are begging us to leave East 
Palestine. . .ever since the train derailed and contaminated our 
village.
    I am also a Registered Nurse and very concerned about the lack of 
cooperation among the NS Railroad, the state and Federal governments, 
the politicians and health and environmental organizations.
    I cannot believe there is no one who has the power to have the 
contaminated soil removed immediately.
    I would love to offer a serious invitation to all of you, in power, 
to pack a bag and come and stay in our village until this mess is 
cleaned up.
    Norfolk Southern is first to blame but it appears that GOVERNMENT 
has NO power to force a business to clean up our disaster that is 
destroying a town. How about shutting the railroad down?
    I would like to suggest a PERFECT PLACE TO STORE THE CONTAMINATED 
SOIL . . . THAT PLACE WOULD BE ALL ALONG THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE 
RAILROAD TRACKS THAT RUN THRU EAST PALESTINE. BLOCKING THE TRACKS, 
LEGALLY, RIGHT, WOULD CERTAINLY GET BOTH GOVERNMENT AND RAILROAD 
OFFICIALS ABLE TO FIND A PLAN TO HELP US. YOUR CONCERN IS LOSS OF MONEY 
. . . SAME CONCERN FOR EAST PALESTINE, IN ADDITION TO DESTROYING OUR 
FUTURES BY FORCING U.S. TO LIVE IN A NOW CONTAMINATED TOWN.
    Why does it take a Senate hearing to do the right thing?
    What would you all want done if this were your town . . . or YOUR 
CHILDREN . . . OR GRANDCHILDREN.
    I know you have the power.
    Moving the contaminated soil is just one issue . . .
    Restoring our town, restoring our property values . . . praying to 
our God that no one . . . not one person, suffers any health effects 
from the negligence of the Railroad.
    Please . . . please do the right thing. DO NOT MAKE THIS A 
POLITICAL GAME. . .YOU WERE ELECTED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED 
STATES.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I am so disappointed in our representatives. I would have never 
believed the damage one person can do Allen Shaw and the overall 
protection he has been given by our government. We have been lied to 
poisoned by chemicals they won't even admit was aboard these trains.
    First I believe Allen Shaw should be arrested. Second I think the 
hauling of any chemical should be on board is chemical engineers not 
just folks picking up and dropping off isn't OSHA in this anywhere or 
are they being paid off like EPA is. We deserve to know what exactly 
was in these cars so we know what our life expectancy is and health 
concerns.
    I lived in Aliquippa PA was driving for Lyft and Uber. Burning in 
my throat my lungs and migraines as well as other symptoms. I packed 
what I could get in my car and fled the area to Texas. Because of this 
tragedy I am homeless and trying to get energy enough to work. I am 
devastated and not the only one.
    How dare our representatives have so little care for human life 
that they would not protect us in any way or even come to our aid once 
it happened or now.
    I have covered this situation doing everything I can to inform 
others since this has a major cover up involved. I share on my Tictoc 
Cynthia.Burton. I am a advocate for others and will stand for others 
and myself till my last breath.
    How dare you think for one second you have the right to do this to 
us our environment and generations to come, shame on all of our 
representatives and Allen Shaw. Thank you.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I was ready to go to bed about 9:00 on Friday night when I looked 
out my dining room window and saw a huge fire. It looked so close 
because of the size of it but I didn't know what could cause such a 
tremendous amount of flames. I went out on my porch thinking if I could 
smell the fumes then it was very close. But I didn't smell any odors. I 
went inside and video taped long enough to send the video to my sons in 
Columbus.
    I don't do social media so I contacted a friend that told me what 
had happened. I stayed in my house watching the fire and turned on the 
10:00 news. Once I heard what happened, I quickly called my other son 
closer to the fire than myself. I pleaded with them to evacuate, which 
they did do once they were told by responders.
    We all left town until we were told to come back.
    I have had a tremendous amount of anxiety over all of this. I have 
suffered PTSD. I am on a Beta Blocker for anxiety and have been seeking 
mental health services. I have left town every weekend so far, but 2. I 
was afraid to leave those two weeks because I was getting dizzy spells 
and suffered a fainting spell.
    I am hopeful to sell my house in the spring to summer, but would 
feel more secure and safe to go outside in a different place than East 
Palestine. I can't get past my insecurities and don't feel safe in my 
house. I am within the mile radius of this wreck.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I live 4 miles from the train derailment. I own 80 acres of farm 
land that has been in my family for 4 generations and my wish is to 
pass it on to my sons and my grandchildren. I don't know now if the 
soil is safe for farming, will the crops grow and be safe to use. I 
wish I could get on going soil testing but haven't had a single test 
yet. Is the water safe to use, we are on a well.
    I took care of my Dad for 4 years, When he died I was hoping to 
built a house on the property, right now we live in a 50 year old 
mobile home. I'm wondering if I should build somewhere else now but if 
I do what would I do with my farm. I just want to know we are healthy 
and our home is safe.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    Feb. 3rd, 2023 . . . It was just another Friday night . . . or so I 
thought . . . I was sitting on the couch with my cat on my lap, 
watching tv, when the local news came on with the headline story, which 
was a train derailment in East Palestine, OH. There wasn't a lot of 
information about it that night, but on Saturday more information came 
in and it wasn't good ..I felt really sorry for the townspeople and the 
emergency responders but I didn't realize just How much it was going to 
affect me because I was 6.4 miles away in South Beaver Twp., 
Darlington, PA.
    On Sunday morning (Feb. 5th) I woke up and instantly knew something 
was wrong. There was a STRONG smell of chlorine in my bedroom. I have a 
bucket of chlorine pool tablets stored in my garage at the other end of 
my house but they are securely stored in a bucket with a tightly closed 
lid. My eyes were sore and stuck shut, my nose and throat were sore.As 
the day passed I developed a headache and a dry cough.
    On Monday morning Feb. 6th there were constant phone calls from my 
adult children and my friends warning me of the impending detonation of 
one of the toxic cars . They were begging me to leave my home and take 
my cat with me because they feared for our safety. I left home at 
3:45pm with my cat. When I reached my friend's house in Freedom, PA I 
found out that the plan was to detonate all 5 cars, not just the one. 
On television I saw radar tracking the giant black cloud and it looked 
like it was spreading toward my home.
    I returned home the next morning at 10:30am to discover a strange 
chemical odor in my garage and my house.My headaches returned and so 
did my dry cough. I also developed a patch of red itchy dry skin on my 
left forearm.The headaches are on and off to this day as well as 
hoarseness.
    I changed my hvac filter on Dec. 30th, 2022 and it is only supposed 
to be changed every 3 months. I was told to change my hvac filter on 
Feb. 19th by my son. He told me to change it once a week I change it 
every 2 weeks and that is Very expensive to do! On Feb. 23rd my son 
installed a Pur water filter on my kitchen sink. He started coughing 
and choking when he entered my garage. He said that my house still 
smelled like chemicals.
    On Feb. 24th I called my pcp for a checkup. On Saturday Feb. 25th 
my next door neighbor had to evacuate because she was diagnosed with 
chemical exposure. I went to my pcp on March 1st for my checkup. He 
ordered a chest xray and blood tests for toxins. I now have to pay $20 
for the xray.
    On March 5th I noticed a rusty residue on my pool cover. I have 
owned a pool since 1996 and NEVER have seen anything like that on my 
pool before! I Wish I could send pictures of it with this testimony.
    On March 6th I changed my hvac filter once again and went for my 
xray, blood and urine test.One test result was positive for a UTI and I 
have Never had one of those before. I am awaiting final results of the 
other tests.
    I sent pictures of my pool cover to the PA AG's office, to the EPA, 
the DEP, and to the Dept. of Agriculture. They are Very interested and 
are in contact with me. They are only Starting to test wells and soil 
in the 2 mile range for now. But the DEP rep has told me to call him 
back in 2 weeks if he doesn't contact me by then.
    On March 14th the section director of the Environmental Crimes unit 
of the PA AG's office came to my house to personally discuss how the 
derailment has affected me. I now have to pay for a well test and a 
pool cover water test. I also purchased 2 ice/water filters for my 
refridgerator and 4 More hvac filters on March 17th. A $150 expense I 
didn't really need..
    My daughter visited me today (March 18th) and she developed a runny 
nose, a cough and tightness in her chest . She has asthma and said that 
it was like a small asthma attack. My late husband and I built this 
house in 1989 and we raised our children here with good well water that 
was drinkable and clean fresh air. I honestly don't know if I will be 
able to even have a Normal summer with friends and family gatherings 
around my pool, and it makes me so sad.

future. We have seen too many incidents where innocent people are hurt 
by corporations and businesses who ignore safety regulations and make 
ignorant, reckless decisions regarding our environment.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    We need medical testing now. If everything is all good why are we 
still experiencing, headaches, sore throats, sinus problems? I don't 
and won't drink the water! We have not seen honesty from day one. 
Supporting the school and throwing money around to the village 
officials is not helping the citizens. From the politicians to the EPA, 
I feel we get nothing but lies. Thats not helping!!!Soil testing is 
only being done in common areas. I don't live at the park or near the 
school. We are strictly in residential area.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    Until the derailment in east Palestine on February 3, I was running 
a very successful Airbnb business on my 8 acre mini horse farm for the 
past 6 years.
    I offered several options to experience farm life, such as a little 
cabin, a room in my barn, a camp spot or the entire lower half of my 
home.
    People came from all over to my place to experience the country 
lifestyle, fresh air, organic gardening, and my breakfast with farm 
fresh eggs.
    I offered Horseback Riding, treats for people to feed and interact 
with horses and sessions in an infrared, sauna.
    I partnered with Snail Club to offer guests a free picture of 
themselves at the farm sent to their home to remember their trip.
    I took pride in the details of building my business to share my 
lifestyle with others and earn a living at the same time.
    It was also an asset to the community, as I would direct people 
into town to the local shops and restaurants.
    Very few people have booked my place since the accident. Everyone 
who booked into the summer have canceled.
    Everyone in the community has been affected differently but in some 
devastating way. The long-term effects of our soil and water that's a 
whole other issues of concern. It'll be a long time before our little 
community rebounds from such a disaster.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I feel very fortunate, other than the immediate displacement during 
the derailment I have experienced no health issues. My concern is for 
longer term monitoring and maybe an established baseline for all 
residents in the immediate area. What recourse would we have in ten 
years if we sustain injury then stemming from this incident, a long 
term health monitoring system I believe will help.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I am very concerned for the safety of my family and our health. I 
have a child afraid to be at home, ``I catch everything (they said) . . 
. I am going to get cancer and die from this.''
    My husband and I work in education. We have four kids. I love our 
little home and this town. I do see the good things being done, 
however, right now we have urgent things we should have access too.
    We need free blood test immediately, that test for specifics to 
this derailment, not just basic blood work. We need more and different 
ways to test the air, water and soil, that are cohesive to what the 
universities (and others) are using to get the real picture.
    I feel people should be allowed to relocate for a year (not just 
lodging) with all expenses paid until we can get a real picture.
    More needs to be done for the home owners, we cannot afford to pay 
three to four times our mortgage elsewhere. It's not just property 
value, it's the cost associated with having to live elsewhere. We are 
making health decisions based on our own personal finances.
    Our monthly expenses have gone up, and personal cost to homeowners, 
renters and business owners. It's more than just being reimbursed. 
Let's put people first and do the right thing now.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    The train derailment has upended our lives, dealing with constant 
headaches, sinus issues, nose bleeds, and an all around general feeling 
of ``not feeling well''.
    We live outside the town of East Palestine, with in 3 miles of the 
wreck site. It's crazy to think the ``experts'' say the only area that 
this wreck has effected is 1 mile. We have been asked to get blood 
samples and urine, but no one in our medical community knows what tests 
to order nor what to look for. (even though we have provided the 
chemical list to them).
    We have a well and some ground on our property that we don't know 
if they are safe for our animals or children. Even the local well 
companies have not been able to confirm what tests to complete.
    I also am a small business owner. I have seen my local/daily work 
slow to a crawl since all the activity in East Palestine. Its extremely 
difficult to reassure my family that its going to be ok, simply because 
I don't know that answer.
    Every step we have taken to ensure we are safe and healthy has led 
us to a dead end.
    I have watched the hearings with the Alan Shaw and he has done 
nothing to reassure our whole community will be made ``right''. I feel 
we have been left in the dark to fend for ourselves.
    As a business owner, property owner, father, and head of my 
household. . . . It would be nice to have reassurances that Norfolk 
will actually do what is right for all our communities. This accident 
would of never happened if the company operating the train would of 
done the maintenance and inspections necessary for a safe operating 
transportation vehicle.
    I am an United States Airmen by trade. I have seen what can happen 
to an airline who disregards safety. There have been cases where a 
mechanic has been put in jail for not doing their job correctly. 
Railroads haul millions of pounds of cargo and subject millions of 
citizens to that cargo. There should be no difference in the safety 
protocols. Period!

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    Since the derailment, I have been having a great deal of difficulty 
sleeping and am very jumpy when I hear sounds. I live 18 miles from the 
derailment. Having seen the video from both the Freshmark and Butch 
Bliss security cameras, I am constantly afraid when I hear a train 
whistle thinking that this time it will be us. I am also concerned that 
I should not buy any produce or meat from local growers.
    I am closely following Salem's water readings. I attended the first 
presentation by Erin Brokovich where I had to stand outside for two 
hours before being allowed into the auditorium. I have had a sore 
throat and feel quite tired ever since that.
    Something must be done to be certain this does not happen again. 
Sebring, Salem, Leetonia and Columbiana could easily have been ground 
zero for this derailment. Are we next? Will we still be affected????

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    My name is Brandi Foster, my family and I are lifelong residents of 
East Palestine. We are located 3 miles north of the derailment site. At 
3 miles we absolutely have felt the effects of the derailment and toxic 
chemicals.
    Upon returning home after the burn we had soot and ash over our 
home, vehicles and ponds. Our furnace filters were covered with black 
soot. We have experienced headaches more often than we ever have, I 
myself had chemical pink eye within days of returning home. My son has 
daily headaches and eye watering, this has never been an issue prior to 
the derailment.
    We absolutely need increased rail safety. It is heartbreaking that 
our little village was the site of this catastrophe but truth is this 
could have and can happen anywhere. We must improve safety 
requirements. We must put people over profit.
    As I said we are at 3 miles which means Norfolk Southern has deemed 
us ineligible for relocation reimbursements. Only allowing inside city 
limits to temporarily relocate. We are East Palestine residents. This 
is our community. This has turned all of our lives upside down.
    We all know the toxic chemicals did not know to stop at 1 mile or 
to stay inside city limits. When the odor is bad in town we know. We 
can smell it at 3 miles away.
    We need to know that we all matter! Every. Single. One. Of. Us. Not 
only to Norfolk Southern but to our Federal government!
    As property owners we need options to leave if that's what we 
choose to do. As of now we are forced to choose between the safety of 
our families and financial ruin. Money. . .if we walk away from our 
homes we loose all we have worked for. To find homes in other areas the 
cost is more than most of us can afford. If we stay we are putting our 
families at risk of this prolonged exposure.
    We need to feel we are getting true answers. Due to the delayed 
response from our government and not the whole story from Norfolk 
Southern we do not have faith that we are safe. We don't know who to 
believe, only our gut instincts to go on and mine says if it doesn't 
smell right it isn't safe.
    We are all East Palestine residents no matter where we are from the 
site and the fact that Norfolk Southern was allowed to deem who and 
what zone could relocate is keeping most of us feeling like hostages.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I am a concerned parent and resident of East Palestine. My son and 
I chose this town as our forever home about 5 years ago. We have loved 
every minute of living here until February 3rd 2023. Then our lives 
were flipped upside down. My stress and anxiety levels have 
skyrocketed, my son is afraid to play outside at times, and I worry 
about our health every time my son and I walk into the schools each 
day. My friends and family from Michigan pressure me often to pack up 
and move out of East Palestine.
    Before the derailment I couldn't imagine raising my son somewhere 
else. It completely breaks my heart that our small community has been 
impacted like this, due to something that could have been prevented. It 
now crosses my mind more than ever that we may eventually have to leave 
this village.
    I had so many future plans for us that required us to live, work 
and go to school here in EP. Those futures plans are now in jeopardy of 
being cancelled. We made our lives here, planted our roots here, 
established my framily here (friends that are our family), and am an 
active member of our community.
    I want our lives back, I want to know for certain that living here 
in East Palestine is safe for us, I don't want to leave.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    My family and I live on East Martin Street, less than 2 blocks from 
where the derailment happened. I witnessed the actual explosion when 
the derailment happened. It was unlike anything that I have ever seen. 
We also watched from our front porch the train cars catching fire, one 
by one. I've never seen flames move that quickly.
    The derailment happened at 9:30 pm, by 11:30 pm we were being told 
by law enforcement in cruisers using their loud speakers and then law 
enforcement walking on foot, that we had to evacuate. We were fortunate 
enough to be able to stay with family until the evacuation was lifted.
    On Tuesday, February 15th we went back home. Our neighborhood 
smelled terrible. My husbands place of employment is also right beside 
the tracks. He is having some health problems from being in the area 
all day. He now has chemical bronchitis which he has to use an inhaler 
for.
    Changes need to be made on how this chemical is transported. It 
should not be allowed to travel through places where people live. The 
speed at which the railroad had those tracks replaced and the train 
running was just a slap in the face to everyone that lives in East 
Palestine.
    Profit over safety--they should be ashamed.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    I don't think the railways should be hauling hazardous waste 
through towns in the first place. Then to find out they had plenty of 
desolate areas where they could have stopped, knowing there was a 
problem, is a problem with me. I have a compromised immune system and 
we've been told they found benzene in our outdoor spigot. We have to 
shower elsewhere. This is a big inconvenience. I have a deep chesty 
cough that will not go away and have had many headaches. I think that 
instead of sending $331M to Ethiopia, the funds should have been spent 
in our own country not just on the oil spill but what about our 
veterans. This government sucks.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    My name is Jenna Harris. My family and I live approximately 4.5 
miles away from ground zero. We had our well water tested on February 
23rd, 2023. On March 14, 2023 the Columbiana County Health District 
called to let me know that they had detected a chemical in our well 
called bis-2 ethylhexyl phthalate. They also said that it was within 
levels that they felt it was safe. Upon receiving the results, levels 
of benzene were also found.
    I personally went to the Norfolk Southern Family Assistance Center 
on March 16, 2023 to show them the results and to ask how they would be 
helping my family. They told me not to drink our water and they had 
bottled water for me to take home. Also, they said if someone from 
Stantech did not call to discuss the results by Sunday to call back. I 
called Monday because nobody called me to discuss results. I got hung 
up on twice by the Norfolk Southern phone representative.
    Stantech then called me that afternoon and said our well was clean 
and results were good. I explained I had results from the county health 
district and the results were not good. Stantech representative was 
shocked. He said he would call back to schedule another round of well 
test samples. I called and spoke with another Norfolk Southern 
representative this morning March 21, 2023, explained the situation to 
him. I am still waiting to hear back from him.
    I am deeply concerned for my family and our health, both acute and 
long term due to the chemical exposure in our water and air. We need 
help. Thank you.

Dear Chair Cantwell:

    My name is Ashley Murphy and I am a lifelong resident of East 
Palestine. I grew up in East Palestine going to preschool at the 
Methodist Church, going through school in the East Palestine school 
district and graduating in the class of 2006. When I was picking what 
college I wanted to go to, I picked on that was close enough for me to 
be able to still live in East Palestine and commute. Many 18 year olds 
are waiting for the day they get the opportunity to leave their 
hometown and adventure somewhere new, but not me. I have always wanted 
to stay and live in my hometown and eventually raise a family here. 
East Palestine is a place with amazing people who really care about the 
town and have been working hard to build it up to its glory again. 
There is so much history that this town holds and will continue to 
make.
    Not only am I a lifetime resident of East Palestine, I am also a 
teacher at East Palestine Elementary School and the East Palestine High 
School girls and boy's tennis coach. Ever Since I went to college to 
become a teacher, I have always wanted to work at the school that I 
went to. It was my time at East Palestine Elementary School that made 
me what to become a teacher. When I had to opportunity to become the 
high school tennis coach I was happy to be part of my school again. At 
the time, I was not teaching in the school district but by goal was to 
one day have to opportunity to become a teacher in the district.
    This school year, I was able to earn a position in the school 
district as an intervention specialist working in the elementary 
school. So this year is my first year teaching and my third year as 
girls and boy's tennis coach in the district. I have been working hard 
to grow the tennis program here and I went from having 8 players to 13 
this season!
    For years, I have been working hard to finally reach my goals of 
owning my own house, my professional goals and in coaching to have it 
possibly taking away because a train company wanted to save money and 
not do proper safety checks or because the government of the country I 
live in don't want to have stricter railroad guidelines?
    The night of February 3rd, 2023 is a night that changed many lives 
forever. The feelings that I felt that night and the days after are 
ones that no one should ever feel in their lifetime. Going from having 
dinner with friends talking about our week to the next second running 
out of the restaurant to wondering if you were going to be able to get 
home and what was going to happen to your town. I will never forget 
seeing the fire from state route 14 and thinking that this could not be 
real. Then driving down marking into town and when I hit the first red 
light at North West Ave which is near my house, the feeling of your 
heart falling into your stomach because all you see is a tanker car 
siting stopped at the main railroad crossing and just realizing how bad 
this could be.
    Thankfully, I had a place to go to be safe while the firefighters 
were doing their job but I don't think anyone from town could sleep 
that night. Hearing sirens all night, jumping at every little sound you 
heard or waking up suddenly wondering if our town and houses would be 
there in the morning.
    No one should have to feel scared or worry about the town that they 
live in, the house that you own and live in or that your possessions 
that you cherish will be there when you wake up. To make things worse, 
we wake up and our town and houses are still there but then we find out 
that toxic chemicals and oil were dumped into our ground. Then to top 
it all off, we were evacuated for the chemical release to happen to put 
chemicals and dioxins into the air and soil.
    I understand that accidents and natural disasters happen, but when 
something like this happens because things were over looked by a 
company that obviously cares about money in their own pockets rather 
than the people of the towns that their trains are going through. If a 
company does not even care about its own workers that help make their 
company successful, why would they care about anyone else?
    Norfolk Southern has made a HUGE mistake and we were the unlucky 
town who got caught in this mistake but we WILL NOT and CAN NOT let 
them get away with this. All we can do at this point is fight for what 
needs to be done with our town to make sure that it is safe for us and 
our families for years and years to come.
    East Palestine deserves to thrive and grow as it was before the 
derailment happened, it does not deserve to disappear. It makes me 
angry that Norfolk Southern CEO would not show his face to the people 
of this town until weeks later and only on TV. Every single person that 
has been affected deserves an apology face to face from him!
    We all know that Norfolk Southern are going to do everything in 
their power to save as much money as they can and in the end the people 
of East Palestine are going to be the ones hung out to dry.
    Norfolk Southern CEO and the other high ranked people don't care 
about what we have to deal with daily now.
    They get to go home every night and not have to worry about if 
their family is safe or if they will be safe five or ten years down the 
road.
    They don't have to worry about losing property value on a house 
that you worked hard to get, put money into to fix it the way you 
wanted and to look nice and put your hard working money each month 
into.
    They don't have to worry about those toxic chemicals and oil 
getting into your wells and contaminating your water.
    They don't have to worry about if it will be safe to take a bath or 
brush your teeth with the water one day.
    They don't have to watch an air purifier throughout the day to see 
if the air is clean.
    They don't have to worry about getting medical tests done years to 
come to see if this accident has affected your future.
    Nothing will be able to take that fear of the unknown away and 
living daily with worry is tiring. Norfolk Southern CEO gets to go home 
with no worry about safety of his life or his future. Instead, he 
approves plans of just coving up contaminated dirt so he can get his 
trains running like we wouldn't notice. This just proves that he never 
really cared about East Palestine or the People in the town.
    In the CNN town hall meeting when he was asked about the plan to 
cover up the dirt to put the track down, he stated that it was the 
company's environmental person who came up with it and approved it. . . 
. . . . I never went to college for science but isn't it common sense 
that if chemicals and oil get dumped all of the contaminated soil would 
have to be removed or it would still be there?
    They keep stating that they are helping . . . . . . are they 
passing out money and making it look like they care? Yes. But, not once 
have I heard how they are going to be helping me get my property loss 
back to a house that I now and will ALWAYS own!
    On top of the fear of safety and my health, I have to worry about 
keeping my job as a teacher in the school district. Norfolk Southern 
needs to take all of the necessary and extra measures to make the 
people of East Palestine feel safe to stay and live her to make sure 
that the school can survive. This is my 9th year teaching and I finally 
got a teaching position in a school district that I want to retire 
form. I absolutely love my job, co-workers and all of the students. I 
love the facts that I can teach and coach all for the same school that 
I graduated from. My dream has come true!
    Then the derailment happened.
    Many people with and without kids are still questioning the safety 
of the town still to this day. If they do not take ALL necessary steps 
to make it safe, how are we supposed to keep this town alive along with 
our schools? No teacher in the district should have to worry about 
losing their job as a result of this derailment and Norfolk Southern 
greed for money over safety. Once you find your dream school district 
to work in, you shouldn't have to worry about losing it over something 
that wasn't in your control. This school district should not have to 
worry about losing students or sports games being forfeiting because of 
Norfolk Southern mistake. We have already suffered enough, the students 
and teaches should not have to suffer more!
    Norfolk Southern needs to be held 100 percent responsible and to be 
held accountable to make the necessary changes and testing for years 
and years to come. They need to pay for medical testing now and in the 
future. I think that it is ridiculous that were told that we needed to 
get testing done but it would be going to cost thousands of dollars 
that we did not know if we would be reimbursed for. Then, to find out 
that if you did want to spend the money to get done, you were told that 
they are not allowed to conduct those tests anymore. I think that it is 
very fishy that Quest Diagnostic did that testing prior to all of this 
and when the testing results would hurt Norfolk Southern, all of a 
sudden they don't do it. Then when you look at who has stock in Quest 
Diagnostic you see that it is the same people who have stock in Norfolk 
Southern. . . . . . NOT A SURPRISE!!!!
    The United States government needs to stand up for THE PEOPLE of 
the United States and NOT big money companies. People should be more 
important than money and companies.
    Norfolk Southern should have to continue to test the air and soil 
quality for years to come. They should have been doing soil testing way 
before March. They should have to put in underground filtration systems 
to make sure that the toxic chemicals and oils stay out of our water 
supply in the City of East Palestine and the wells in Unity and Negley. 
They need to continue this for 5-15 years down the road. Norfolk 
Southern make the mistake and now they need to make sure it right even 
if it takes 20 years.
    The government also needs to look at improving rail safety. The 
people of East Palestine are stuck in this situation and have to fight 
everyday but we can also fight to make sure that this does not happen 
again! The people of East Palestine are grateful that this did not 
happen seconds before because this whole situation would have been so 
much worse!
    Trains go though and past so many towns in America, the 
restrictions and safety measures need to be stricter. Trains should be 
a fun and enjoyable things for adults and children. First of all, 
Trains go way to fast through towns like East Palestine. There are 
multiple times that I have sat at the railroad crossing and with the 
train speeding by and seeing the carrier boxes shacking. There were 
many times I thought about what would happen if the carrier boxes did 
tip over but never really figured it would really happen. To drive a 
car in downtown East Palestine, the speed limit is 25 mph. If cars can 
only go 25mph, why do trains carrying toxic chemicals and other 
materials get to go any faster?
    Secondly, the train company to have some kind of system to 
communicate what are on the trains that go through the towns so first 
responders know what they are fighting if this happens again. The East 
Palestine and all of the other fire departments risked their lives not 
knowing what was in the train cars.
    Third, safety checks and maintenance checks needs to be sticker. 
This should never have happened if good maintenance was done. Trains 
should be checked multiple times to make sure it is safe. Norfolk 
Southern needs to put safety as number one priority or shut the company 
down. If restaurants do not keep their kitchen up to code, they get 
shut down but the train companies can do what they want and break all 
the rules but nothing gets changed? Why is it that everyone in America 
has to follow laws and rules but Norfolk Southern doesn't?
    To the United States Government, please stand up for the people of 
East Palestine and the people of the United States! Do not allow big 
money companies like Norfolk Southern put our lives in jeopardy in 
order to put money in their pockets!
    Make them do what is right for the people of East Palestine.
    Make them put in underground water filters to make sure our water 
is safe.
    Make them pay for medical testing and medical bill if our health is 
affected.
    Make them listen and follow stricter safety rules and maintenance.
    Make new train regulations and lower speed for trains through 
towns.
    Please make something good come from this horrible mess that has 
already affected so many lives and will continue to affect for year to 
come.

RE: Hearing on Improving Rail Safety in Response to the East Palestine 
            Derailment

Dear Chairwoman Cantwell and Ranking Member Cruz:

    On behalf of the American Chemistry Council, I would like to thank 
the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation for 
holding this hearing on Improving Rail Safety in Response to the East 
Palestine Derailment. The tragic events related to the derailment and 
the impacts on the community of East Palestine, Ohio have 
understandably raised questions and concerns that this hearing can help 
to address.
    ACC shares the Committee's goal to advance transportation safety 
and protect public health and the environment. We also share the 
Committee's gratitude to the emergency responders, government 
officials, and rail workers for their tireless efforts responding to 
this incident.
    ACC represents the leading companies in the business of chemistry. 
Our members apply the science of chemistry to provide innovative 
products and services that make people's lives better, healthier, and 
safer. As a $517 billion enterprise, the business of chemistry is a key 
element in the Nation's economy and a major user of the U.S. freight 
transportation system. ACC and its members are committed to the safe 
transportation of hazardous materials throughout the supply chain. As 
part of Responsible Care, the chemical industry's world-class 
environmental, health, safety and security performance initiative, our 
members have invested billions of dollars in training, technology, and 
packaging safety.
    Chemicals are essential for growing food, protecting the safety of 
our water and food supply, producing energy, and making life-saving 
medicines and equipment. From farms to factories, more than 25 percent 
of the U.S. economy and 4.2 million jobs depend on chemistry. The 
nature and properties of chemicals, including hazardous materials, are 
typically the very thing that makes them useful. For many critical 
uses, there are no suitable substitutes that can provide the same 
measure of performance. We ship chemicals because the country needs 
chemicals to support virtually every aspect of daily life.
    Railroads are vital to the safe transportation of our products. As 
stated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), rail is recognized 
as the safest land-based mode to move large quantities of chemicals 
over long distances. Mainline rail accidents are down 44 percent since 
2000, and rail accident rates involving hazardous materials have 
declined by 78 percent over the same period. But the East Palestine 
incident is a strong reminder that more work is needed to improve 
safety. We should carefully examine the factors that contributed to 
this derailment and other rail incidents and review the emergency 
response procedures so we can learn from them.
    Safety is a shared responsibility between railroads, shippers, and 
equipment suppliers, along with the Federal government. ACC supports a 
multi-layered approach to hazardous material transportation safety. 
This includes a range of measures: first, to further reduce derailments 
and other accidents; second, to minimize the risk of a rail accident 
resulting in the release of hazardous material; and third, to 
strengthen emergency response and mitigate the impacts of any hazardous 
material incident that does occur.
    ACC supports the legislative intent of the Railway Safety Act of 
2023 (S. 576) and other proposals to further improve the safety of the 
Nation's rail network, reduce hazardous material risks, and enhance 
emergency response capabilities. ACC welcomes the opportunity to work 
with the Committee as it further develops and refines rail safety 
legislation.
    The following sections highlight specific priorities that ACC 
supports so that chemicals and other hazardous materials can be 
transported from where they are produced to where they are needed--
safely and without incident.
Establishing Federal Standards for Railcar Defect Detectors
    The rail industry and Federal regulators have long recognized the 
risks posed by defective wheel bearings. Railroads have voluntarily 
installed wayside defect detectors and have committed to do more. 
Following the East Palestine derailment, increasing and improving the 
use of these technologies should be a top priority.
    ACC supports the development of Federal regulations for railcar 
defect detectors. Such regulations should address the frequency and 
placement of detectors, standardized criteria for triggering an alert 
of a potential failure, and appropriate actions to be taken by the rail 
crew upon receiving an alert. Requirements should be developed through 
a Federal rulemaking process, be risk-and performance-based, and allow 
for continued technological progress and advancement.
Improving Tank Car Performance
    Chemical shippers own or lease the rail cars used to ship their 
products, including tank cars equipped with special safety features to 
help prevent the release of hazardous materials in the event of a rail 
accident. Tank car performance is critical to the safe transportation 
of these materials. Shippers have made significant investments in 
recent years to upgrade their fleets and will continue to do so.
    Shippers and tank car owners are in the process of upgrading tank 
cars used to transport Class 3 flammable liquids, replacing cars built 
to earlier DOT standards (DOT-111 cars) with cars built to newer 
standards (DOT-117 cars). Current law mandates a commodity-specific 
phaseout schedule based on risk-based priorities and railcar production 
capacity. For Packing Group II and III flammable liquids other than 
unrefined petroleum products and ethanol, the current phase out 
deadline is May 1, 2029.
    ACC supports an earlier phaseout deadline. However, we believe that 
a proposed 2025 deadline is simply not feasible based on the rail 
equipment industry's capacity to manufacture new cars and retrofit 
existing cars to meet DOT-117 standards. This could undermine the 
ability to supply critical materials used to produce food, fuels, 
pharmaceuticals, and construction materials.
    Congress established the current 2029 deadline after extensive 
collaboration with industry partners and a review of all relevant data. 
ACC supports a similar process to establish a new deadline based on 
current data.
Supporting Emergency Responders
    It is critical that emergency responders have the information, 
training, and resources they need to respond to a rail incident, 
particularly one involving hazardous materials.
    Chemical shippers comply with a multitude of Federal regulations, 
including Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration 
(PHMSA) rules for shipping and communicating about hazardous materials. 
In addition, ACC members support communities and local emergency 
responders through the CHEMTREC and TRANSCAER programs that provide 
resources and training to respond to hazardous material transportation 
incidents. This includes immediate critical response information about 
chemicals and hazardous materials.
    Following the East Palestine derailment, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine 
raised concerns that state officials were not provided specific 
information about the hazardous materials transported by rail through 
the state. In fact, most trains carrying hazardous materials do not 
meet the statutory definition of a high-hazard flammable train (49 CFR 
171.8) and, therefore, do not trigger Federal requirements for 
railroads to report specified information about these shipments to 
State agencies (49 CFR 174.312).
    ACC supports expanding information sharing requirements to a 
broader range of hazardous material rail shipments. DOT should develop 
risk-based criteria for additional hazardous material shipments that 
would be subject to the information reporting requirements currently 
applicable only to high-hazard flammable trains.
    In addition, ACC supports fully funding PHMSA's Hazardous Materials 
Grants Program. The grant program is funded by hazardous material 
registration fees paid by both shippers and transportation carriers and 
supports emergency response planning and training activities. However, 
the current fee structure currently raises only approximately $23.6 
million while the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 
increased the authorized level of the program to $46.8 million.
    ACC supports Congressional action to replace the current $3,000 
statutory fee limit with a two-tiered limit of $500 for small 
businesses and $5,000 for large businesses. This approach would provide 
flexibility to nearly double the funding emergency response training 
programs while preventing a disproportionate impact on small 
businesses.
Conclusion
    ACC supports a comprehensive and data-driven approach to advance 
the safe transportation of hazardous materials by rail. Safety is a 
shared responsibility, and shippers, rail carriers, equipment 
suppliers, and the Federal government have made progress by working 
together.
    But we can, and must, do more. ACC welcomes the opportunity to 
collaborate with policymakers and our transportation partners to apply 
the lessons learned from the East Palestine derailment so the products 
of our industry can be delivered safely and without incident.
            Sincerely,
                                                Chris Jahn,
                                                 President and CEO.

RE: Improving Rail Safety in Response to the East Palestine Derailment

Dear Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Cruz:

    The derailment of a Norfolk Southern freight rail train on February 
3rd, 2023, was and continues to be, devasting to the community of East 
Palestine, Ohio. This derailment has understandably raised questions 
and concerns about rail safety. This tragic derailment has rightly led 
to bi-partisan calls to address the root causes and contributing 
factors that led to this accident to ensure no community faces such a 
preventable disaster again.
    American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) is a trade 
association representing the United States refining, petrochemical and 
midstream energy infrastructure industries. AFPM members make the fuels 
and petrochemicals that make modern life possible and keep America 
moving. To produce these essential goods and bring them to market, AFPM 
members depend on safe and efficient rail transportation to move their 
feedstocks and products to and from refineries and petrochemical 
facilities. More than two and half million carloads of fuel and 
petrochemical feedstocks and products--including crude oil, natural gas 
liquids, refined products, petrochemicals and plastics--move by rail 
every year. AFPM members prioritize the safety of our people, 
communities and products above everything else, and that includes the 
safety of our products in transit. As freight rail shippers, we have 
made significant investments to support and improve the safety and 
efficiency of the rail transportation system.\1\

afpm-members-do-keep-rail-shipments-safe]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Rail safety is a shared responsibility that includes railroads, 
rail shippers, emergency responders and the regulatory agencies 
responsible for oversight. The primary goal of rail safety policy is to 
reduce or eliminate the risk of a derailment from occurring in the 
first place. In the absence of preventing a derailment, effective rail 
safety policies should also aim to mitigate the consequences of a 
derailment and aid in the emergency response for a derailment.
    AFPM appreciates the time and attention your Committee is devoting 
to the issue of rail safety in the wake of the East Palestine 
derailment. We share the Committee's goals of advancing transportation 
safety and protecting human health and the environment. While AFPM 
supports the legislative intent of the Railway Safety Act of 2023 and 
other similar proposals that seek to improve rail safety, it is 
critical that Congress be guided by facts and data when developing 
legislation that can impact a wide range of stakeholders and consumers 
alike. The best, most effective rail safety policy to protect families, 
communities and the environment will require a solid grounding in facts 
and data. Thus, in advancing additional rail safety policies, Congress 
should focus on the specific causes and contributing factors of the 
East Palestine, Ohio, derailment and other rail safety events rather 
than advancing unrelated measures that could end up stifling rail 
transportation and leaving root causes unaddressed.
    AFPM believes it is important to let the National Transportation 
Safety Board (NTSB) complete its investigation before rushing to 
judgement and implementing policies that may not effectively address 
the causes and contributing factors for this derailment and that could 
hamper the rail network. While NTSB is not expected to release its' 
final report on the incident for many months, NTSB's preliminary 
reporting should be viewed as an initial policy roadmap to improve rail 
safety.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ See ``Norfolk Southern Railway Train Derailment with Subsequent 
Hazardous Material Release and Fires'' Preliminary Report RRD23MR005, 
issued February 23, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AFPM believes the following policies and principles, would most 
effectively improve rail safety and begin to address the specific 
failure points that led to the catastrophic derailment in East 
Palestine.
Increasing and Improving the Use of Wayside Detection to Prevent 
        Derailments
    Wayside detectors are a valuable diagnostic tool for the rail 
industry. These detectors collect real-time information on the health 
of passing rail cars and transmit the data back to railroad personnel 
who can use this information to identify potential rail safety issues 
and intervene to mitigate them before they escalate to the point where 
derailment or other incidents could occur.
    Currently, the frequency and placements of wayside detectors is not 
regulated by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). In 
addition, there are no official protocols governing when certain 
wayside detector readings should require specific action from a train 
crew--such as additional inspections, reductions in train speed or even 
full emergency stops to visually inspect cars. The requirements and 
thresholds for when a railroad dispatch center would notify the rail 
crew operating a train of a safety alert, are set by the individual 
railroads and vary across the industry. In the absence of any uniform 
DOT standards, this is left to the discretion of each railroad's 
internal policies.
    The NTSB has already indicated that wayside detectors are a primary 
focus of their preliminary derailment investigation. Installing more 
wayside detectors across freight rail routes that frequently transport 
hazardous materials would improve the quality and frequency of real-
time data transmissions and could also enhance safety warning systems 
by helping to identify potential problems earlier and at more regular 
intervals, enabling more immediate response measures, and hopefully the 
prevention of rail incidents.
    AFPM believes more wayside detectors, and clear protocols for how 
wayside readings ought to be responded to, would enhance safety warning 
systems, and help prevent incidents from occurring. AFPM supports 
establishing requirements for the installation, maintenance, and 
placement of wayside defect detectors and guidance from DOT over how 
railroads must respond to specific wayside detector readings and 
communicate that information to railroad operators.
Providing Emergency Responders with Resources to Effectively Respond to 
        Derailments
    It is critical that emergency responders have the training, 
resources, and information, they need to respond to train derailments, 
particularly those involving hazardous materials. DOT's Pipeline and 
Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) implements a 
Hazardous Materials Grant Program that offers six funding streams aimed 
at improving emergency response to hazardous materials incidents. These 
grant programs are funded by hazardous material registration fees paid 
by both rail shippers and railroads. Although the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58) increased the authorized level of 
the program to $46.8 million, the current fee structure raises only 
approximately $23.6 million. AFPM supports efforts to fully fund these 
programs, including provisions to increase railroads' commitments to 
this program as detailed in S.576--the Railway Safety Act of 2023.
    First responders should have the real-time emergency response 
information they need to respond to any rail incident both quickly and 
safely. Congress and NTSB agree on this point. The Fixing America's 
Surface Transportation Act of 2015 (FAST Act (P.L. 114-94)) contained a 
provision that required DOT to issue a rulemaking to ensure the 
availability of robust real-time emergency response information.\3\ 
NTSB has issued DOT a safety recommendation for DOT to require ``that 
railroads immediately provide to emergency responders accurate, real-
time information regarding the identity and location of all hazardous 
materials on a train.'' \4\ DOT started this regulatory process in 2017 
with an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, but there has been no 
follow through in the form of an actual proposal despite the 
congressional mandate.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ The FAST Act includes the Hazardous Materials Transportation 
Safety Improvement Act of 2015 (sections 7001-7311), which instructs 
the U.S. DOT to issue regulations that would require Class I railroads 
to generate accurate, real-time, and electronic train consist 
information and provide that information to first responders, emergency 
response officials, and law enforcement personnel that are involved in 
the response of an accident involving the rail transportation of 
hazardous materials. (See Pub. L. 114-94.)
    \4\ See NTSB Safety Recommendation R-07-004 and -005.
    \5\ See 82 Fed. Reg. 6451, Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 
``Hazardous Materials: FAST Act Requirements for Real-Time Train 
Consist Information by Rail'' published January 19, 2017.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AFPM supports the completion of this DOT rulemaking process but 
urges careful consideration of changes that would vastly and 
indiscriminately expand the scope of information reporting. Vastly 
increasing proactive notifications for all hazardous material shipments 
by rail could only serve to overload and burden emergency responders 
rather than support emergency response. In addition, unfiltered 
broadcasting of train manifest information could compromise the 
security of hazardous materials rail shipments.
Improving Pressure Reliefs Valves to Mitigate the Impacts of 
        Derailments
    Expediting the current phase out of the tank car fleet, as the 
Railway Safety Act of 2023 proposes, would not have prevented the East 
Palestine derailment. This policy change would pose significant burdens 
on shippers and consumers and threaten refiners, petrochemical 
manufacturers and ultimately consumers. While railroads are quick to 
point to tank car specifications as their preferred risk reduction 
method, it is clear derailment prevention would have a greater impact 
on improving rail safety and should be the priority.
    AFPM members prioritize the safety of our people, communities, and 
products above everything else, and that includes the safety of our 
products in transit. As rail shippers, we control the tank cars we own 
and lease up to the point when we offer the railcars into 
transportation and the railroad assumes control. AFPM members' tank 
cars are highly regulated and subject to extensive inspection 
requirements. We depend on the railroads to operate trains safely, 
maintain tracks and conduct pre-trip inspections of their trains and 
rail cars loaded onto the tracks.
    AFPM members and other shippers voluntarily began the transition to 
new state of the art ``DOT-117'' tank cars well before it was required 
and will continue to transition our tank car fleets in accordance with 
DOT's tiered schedule. The DOT schedule is risk-based, and safety 
driven and was informed by extensive analyses, including consideration 
of tank car shop capacity. In the FAST Act, Congress considered all 
stakeholder input and data analysis and updated and confirmed the 
categories and schedule for DOT's risk-based phase out of rail cars. 
Further, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics annually reports on 
the progress of the fleet upgrade and tank car shop capacity.\6\ To 
date, shippers have replaced nearly 100,000 tank cars with new or 
retrofitted cars.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ See US DOT, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Fleet 
Composition of Rail Tank Cars Carrying Class 3 Flammable Liquids: 2022 
Report published September 29, 2022.
    \7\ These investments by rail shippers have resulted in significant 
rail safety improvements. Since 2013 the U.S. flammable liquid fleet 
has realized a 74 percent reduction in Conditional Probability of 
Release, a common measure of tank car puncture resistance, for crude 
oil, and a 60 percent reduction for ethanol. Tank Car Resource Center--
Progress
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Proposals that expedite the DOT schedule do not adequately consider 
market realities of tank car shop capacity and supply chain constraints 
and do not address the root causes associated with the East Palestine 
derailment. AFPM members are reporting more than a one-year wait for 
new car orders and retrofits due to constraints in rail shop capacity. 
Expediting the timeline without assurance of shop capacity could result 
in a deficit of tank cars for Class 3 Packaging Groups II and III 
materials moved by rail such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, naphtha, 
methanol, petroleum lubes, heating oil, xylene, styrene, petroleum 
distillates, octanes, etc. A rail car shortage brought about by 
accelerated, unachievable tank car phase out schedules could severely 
impact the operations of refiners and petrochemical manufacturers and 
potentially contribute to an increase in the price of fuels and other 
related goods that consumers and our economy need. A premature phase 
out could also shift shipments of these materials from rail to highway 
transportation, further straining a market already short on truck 
drivers and move hazardous materials to a transportation mode with a 
higher statistical probability of incidents resulting in release.
    Alternatively, a more targeted and risk-based approach to improve 
tank car safety would address the valve housings that both PHMSA, 
through a safety advisory, and NTSB, in their March 2, 2023, 
Investigative Update, identified.\8\ While it is important for NTSB to 
conclude their investigation into the East Palestine derailment prior 
to jumping to any conclusions about what caused the incident, the 
NTSB's March 2, 2023, Investigative Update indicated that the aluminum 
covers over tank car pressure valves melted or were consumed during the 
fire after the East Palestine derailment and that melted aluminum was 
observed around the valves inside the protective housing. Following the 
NTSB's Investigative Update, PHMSA safety advisory encouraged all 
hazardous materials tank car owners and offerors to survey their fleets 
for any tank cars currently equipped with aluminum protective housings 
and to consider replacing this equipment with carbon steel housings. 
AFPM supports making this effort mandatory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ See US DOT, PHMSA ``Safety Advisory Notice for Tank Cars 
Equipped with Aluminum Manway Protective Housing Covers'' published 
March 2, 2023 and NTSB Investigative Update published March 2, 2023.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Increasing Competition to Enhance Overall Rail Safety
    It remains clear that more rail competition would enhance safety, 
as shippers would be empowered with options to switch freight rail 
carriers if they face persistent safety and service concerns from their 
current freight rail providers. Rail shippers count on the railroads to 
operate trains, maintain safe tracks, conduct pre-shipment inspections, 
and deliver essential materials on time and safely. AFPM members 
continue to be extremely vocal and critical of the precision scheduled 
railroading (PSR) operating model that is widely used by railroads. PSR 
cost-cutting and Class 1 consolidation have compromised rail service, 
led to significant reductions in the rail workforce, drops in the 
frequency of service, systemic delays, condensed training schedules, 
and the deployment of much longer trains. When developing future rail 
safety initiatives, we urge policymakers must review and determine if 
PSR-related cuts to employment levels, operational overhead and 
operational practices could potentially have safety impacts.
    Almost 80 percent of the Nation's shippers, including most AFPM 
members, are captive to just one railroad. They essentially have no 
ability to shop for better service. Captive shippers cannot choose 
another railroad if they do not like the railroad's operating 
practices. Reciprocal switching would bolster competition and allow 
shippers to negotiate fair terms in indemnity, liability, and 
insurance; including terms associated with safely shipping cargos. When 
there is no choice in rail carrier it becomes a ``take it or leave it'' 
proposition with no room for shippers to push for better safety 
practices in relation to shipping cargos. AFPM supports consideration 
and review of how PSR has impacted rail safety.
Conclusion
    AFPM thanks the Committee for its time and consideration of all 
stakeholder viewpoints on this important effort to improve rail safety. 
AFPM emphasizes the need for maintaining a safe and efficient rail 
network for the energy and petrochemical industries and the U.S. 
economy. AFPM shares Congress's desire to prevent an event like what 
happened in East Palestine from ever happening again. We urge Congress, 
and this Committee to be guided by the facts and data and pursue 
policies that prioritize eliminating derailments. In the absence of 
preventing a derailment altogether, effective rail safety policies 
should also aim to mitigate the consequences of a derailment and aid in 
the emergency response.
    AFPM and our members appreciate your consideration of our 
perspective and priorities to bolster rail safety.
            Sincerely,
                                           Robert Benedict,
                        Vice President, Petrochemicals & Midstream,
                           American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers.

Prepared Statement of American Association for Laboratory Accreditation 
                                 (A2LA)
    The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) is 
deeply saddened by the rail tragedy that occurred in Palestine, OH on 
February 2, 2023. We hope that conditions continue to improve for the 
citizens of Palestine and the surrounding communities and environment.
    We are concerned with the magnitude of this specific incident and 
the trend of train derailments occurring across the Nation.
    The proposed Railway Safety Act of 2023 would rely on inspections 
as a tool to identify equipment and infrastructure failures. We are 
concerned that the proposed act focuses on time as an essential 
component but not on the quality of the inspection. By requiring high 
quality, objective inspections conducted by accredited, independent, 
third-party inspectors, the Railway Safety Act may be strengthened. 
This arrangement will facilitate inspections that are objective and 
technically robust. Current practice is to rely on railway owner 
inspectors which may not provide the objectiveness necessary to assure 
an effective inspection.
    ISO/IEC 17020 provides the standards for the operation of 
inspections. The requirements define and document the performance and 
the competencies needed for all personnel involved in inspection 
activities. They also address equipment needs, recordkeeping, 
inspection procedures, audits and management reviews, impartiality, and 
corrective and preventive actions.
    Accreditation is an objective process that determines the technical 
competence and impartiality of organizations conducting testing and 
inspections. When an organization is accredited, it has demonstrated 
that a prescribed level of technical competence has been achieved. 
Accreditation of inspectors means increasing the confidence in data 
produced, eliminating redundant reviews, providing a means of 
qualifying contractors, building greater public trust, and redirecting 
government resources to enforcement and oversight. We recommend that 
the legislation mandate that inspection bodies be ISO/IEC 17020 
accredited by an International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation 
(ILAC)-recognized accreditation body.
    Established in 1978, A2LA provides independent, world-class 
accreditation programs that inspire confidence in the quality and 
security of services and acceptance of results from our accredited 
organizations. A2LA, a nonprofit accreditation body with over 4000 
actively accredited organizations, supports a broad array of industries 
including food and agricultural testing, environmental, pharmaceutical, 
aerospace, mining, telecommunications, defense, clinical, consumer 
products, construction, electrical and automotive.
    A2LA appreciates the opportunity to provide a statement to the U.S. 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for this 
hearing and for the consideration of these remarks. We welcome the 
opportunity to work with you to establish legislation that can help 
assure the safety of all Americans and protection of the environment, 
all while providing the safe delivery of passengers and goods.

 Prepared Statement of Chuck Baker, President, American Short Line and 
                 Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA)
Introduction
    As president of the American Short Line and Regional Railroad 
Association (ASLRRA), the trade association representing the Nation's 
600 small business Class II and III freight railroads, commonly known 
as short line railroads or short lines, I submit this testimony for 
inclusion in the record of this committee's hearing.
The short line freight rail industry
    We are America's first and last mile freight rail service. Short 
line railroads are neither household names nor mentioned frequently in 
major media outlets, but they are critical movers in the Nation's 
economy, and they have an outsized impact on the communities they 
serve. These small business entities in total operate nearly 47,500 
route miles, or about a third of the total freight rail network system. 
Short line railroads can be found in 48 states; some are just a few 
miles long, while some run for hundreds of miles.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Short line railroads handle one in five rail cars moving annually, 
mostly at origin or destination, providing service to over 10,000 
customers everywhere from rural America to dense urban centers. These 
railroads are a critical link in the country's supply chain. Our 
members serve and support nearly every industry, and they are 
particularly vital for the energy, agriculture, minerals, chemical, and 
manufacturing sectors. Short lines are also well-known for their 
ability to provide custom, tailored, friendly white-glove service to a 
variety of shippers. Short lines make the extra effort to ensure that 
rail service for any shipment size is an efficient, reasonably priced 
option for shippers along their route.
    We are small businesses with a big impact. ASLRRA's freight 
railroad members are tied to 478,000 jobs nationwide, $26.1 billion in 
labor income and $56.2 billion in economic value-add--providing a 
service that 10,000 businesses nationwide rely upon to get goods and 
products to market daily.\1\ Short lines are nearly all small, 
entrepreneurial businesses, with most employing fewer than 30 people, 
running an average of 79 total route miles, and earning an average of 
$7.7 million or less in revenue per year. At the local level, the 
availability of rail service provided by short lines is sometimes the 
tipping point for manufacturers and shippers deciding to locate in the 
area, driving new, well-paying jobs particularly in rural and small-
town America.

Short Line Railroad Industry, prepared by PWC for ASLRRA (2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We live and work in the communities we serve. Short lines are 
owned, managed and staffed by individuals who are integral to the 
fabric of their local communities. When they're not moving goods and 
freight, short line personnel are at the local grocery store, at the 
PTA meeting, on the ballfield, and in their houses of worship. Because 
short lines are small business owners, and they live and work in the 
communities they serve, safety is more than a good business decision--
it is a steadfast personal obligation.
    We have an impressive safety story to tell. According to Federal 
Railroad Administration (FRA) data, train accident and hazardous 
material accident rates are down 42 percent and 71 percent, 
respectively, since 2000. One indication of short lines' performance is 
ASLRRA's annual Jake Safety Award program honoring railroads that have 
had better than industry-average injury frequency rates for person-
hours worked. Since 2000, an increasing number of short lines have 
received the ``Jake with Distinction'' designation, indicating zero 
reportable injuries for the calendar year--that was 344 short lines in 
2021. In addition to our awards program, ASLRRA provides an exhaustive 
offering of programs and training for short line railroad members.
    And our environmental record is strong. The rail industry is a 
sustainable, environmentally friendly mode of transportation. U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency data show freight railroads account for 
only 0.6 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and only 2.1 
percent of transportation-related sources (e.g., trucking, air, etc.). 
Moving freight by rail reduces highway congestion and lowers idling 
emissions and fossil fuel consumption by 75 percent versus trucks. 
Short lines are committed to doing their part, seeking ways to reduce 
their environmental impact with the implementation of technology and 
operating practices that reduce emissions. By contrast, regulatory 
proposals that overshoot the mark would shift freight from rail to 
truck and harm the environment.
What Rail Safety Discussions Must Recognize in the Wake of the East 
        Palestine Incident
    Since the February 3, 2023 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train 
in East Palestine, Ohio, a vigorous national discussion has begun about 
railway safety. ASLRRA and its members are eager to participate in this 
dialogue. Many policy ideas have been suggested, and small business 
short line freight railroads do not oppose proposals that make what is 
already an extraordinarily safe mode of freight transportation even 
safer in a realistically implementable manner.
    Against this national conversation, however, there have been 
discussions of Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), accusations that 
railroads put ``profits over people,'' assertions about reductions in 
the workforce, paid sick leave for employees, blocked crossings and 
long trains. While the relevance of those issues to rail safety is 
questionable, it is unquestionable that those discussions have 
essentially nothing to do with short lines--they concern business 
decisions and practices that have no relevance to short line railroads' 
economic or operating model and culture. Accordingly, as rail safety is 
discussed in Congress and amongst other policy makers, it is important 
to remember the following with relation to short lines:
    Hazmat safety incidents are incredibly rare on short line 
railroads. Efforts to address concerns over the movement of hazardous 
materials on freight rail miss the mark if they include short line 
railroads without taking into account short lines' unique operations. 
Short lines, as one could expect, move relatively short lengths: the 
average length of haul for Class II and III railroads (together) is 
38.5 miles--not hundreds or thousands of miles. Along these routes, 
short lines typically operate trains at speeds slow enough that in the 
event of an already rare derailment, a tank car is extraordinarily 
unlikely to be punctured and cause the release of hazardous materials.

  <bullet> According to FRA data, from 2019 to 2022, the freight rail 
        industry experienced 51 derailments with a hazardous material 
        release, and only four of those occurred on a short line 
        railroad. Of the 86 cars carrying hazardous materials that were 
        in the consist of derailed trains and experienced a release, 
        only four cars were on a short line.

  <bullet> From 2019 to 2022, short line railroads have run an average 
        of approximately 122 million train miles per year. Over that 
        four-year period, derailments have declined from 298 to 254, 
        derailments involving hazardous material cars have declined 
        from 64 to 43, and as noted above, only four derailed cars 
        released hazardous materials in those four years.

    We are committed to getting these numbers--derailments and 
derailments with releases of hazardous materials--to zero and to keep 
it there, but this overall safety context is important to understand 
before enacting potentially counterproductive regulations.
    Short lines are small businesses with limited resources. Short line 
railroads are small enterprises, and efforts to regulate problems in 
the rail space can impose outsized new burdens and demands on these 
railroads. It is crucial that any new safety requirements be directly 
relevant to their operations and realistic for a small business to 
implement. Policymakers should be precise in crafting measures so as to 
avoid instituting unnecessary, disproportionately burdensome demands on 
small business enterprises. A longstanding body of law, including the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement and Fairness Act (SBREFA), requires that agencies exercise 
utmost care and discretion in evaluating how regulations they 
promulgate affect small businesses. Congress should heed the wisdom of 
these measures in crafting updates to the current regulatory framework. 
Many small business railroads are not able to comply with costly ``one 
size fits all'' requirements that may make sense for other, larger 
entities, and Congress' ignoring this fact could inflict extreme duress 
and economic harm on a critical sector of the freight rail industry--
without providing any safety benefit.
    The rail industry is already highly regulated. It is a false choice 
to suggest that the rail industry must now face regulations or continue 
to operate outside any safety regimen. The rail industry is already 
highly regulated and was one of the first industries to experience 
Federal oversight nearly 150 years ago. The true choice is whether 
Congress will advance smart, sensible policies that make the network 
safer or impose stark new measures unsupported by science that actually 
introduce new risks onto the freight network. The current regulatory 
framework consists of the following:

    The Federal Railroad Administration, the Pipelines and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration and the Transportation Security 
Administration are also already taking action on a host of new 
regulatory measures. The chief rail safety oversight agency, the FRA, 
is in the midst of a broad campaign of regulatory activity. These 
efforts include the following:

  <bullet> Emergency Escape Breathing Apparatus (Supplementary NPRM 
        announced by FRA on March 8, 2023);

  <bullet> Amendments to Locomotive and Passenger Equipment Safety 
        Standards (NPRM scheduled for 2023);

  <bullet> Railroad Noise Emission Compliance (NPRM scheduled for 
        August 2023);

  <bullet> Train Crew Staffing (NPRM issued July 2022; Final rule 
        scheduled for 2024);

  <bullet> Dispatcher Certification (NPRM scheduled for 2023);

  <bullet> Signal Employee Certification (NPRM scheduled for 2023);

  <bullet> Miscellaneous Amendments to Federal Glazing Standards (NPRM 
        published April 2022);

  <bullet> Amendments to the Freight Car Safety and Reflectorization 
        Standards (NPRM published July 2022); and

  <bullet> Training, Qualification, and Oversight for Safety-Related 
        Railroad Employees (NPRM published October 2022).

    FRA is also engaged in extensive activity through its Rail Safety 
Advisory Committee (RSAC) to explore future regulations, which includes 
efforts on track safety standards, roadway worker protection, use of 
electronic devices, Confidential Close Call Reporting (C3RS), practices 
to maximize alertness and reduce fatigue, critical incident stress 
plans/Part 272 amendments, and wayside detectors (which is expected to 
be announced at an upcoming March 27, 2023 RSAC meeting).
    FRA's sister agency in the hazardous materials space, the Pipelines 
and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), is also busy and 
engaged in the following rulemakings:

  <bullet> FAST Act Requirements for Real-Time Train Consist 
        Information by Rail (ANPRM issued January 2017, NPRM scheduled 
        for 2023);

  <bullet> Hazardous Materials: Advancing Safety of Highway, Rail, and 
        Vessel Transportation (NPRM scheduled for 2023); and

  <bullet> Hazardous Materials: Improving the Safety of Transporting 
        Liquefied Natural Gas (NPRM scheduled for 2023).

    Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration, which has 
jurisdiction over railroads on security matters, is currently working 
on rulemakings covering short lines related to the Vetting of Certain 
Surface Transportation Employees (NPRM scheduled for 2023) and Cyber 
Risk Management (ANPRM issued in 2022 and NPRM scheduled for 2023).
    From within this list of existing regulatory activity, several 
items have nonetheless been re-proposed as legislative initiatives in 
recent weeks, including proposals on mandatory crew size and C3RS. We 
urge policymakers to avoid adding a layer of redundancy with proposals 
that are already underway and are being reviewed and considered through 
the administrative process.
    New policies should advance only if they focus on safety problems 
that truly warrant further action. ASLRRA supports efforts to address 
recognized safety hazards presented by the incident in East Palestine. 
But many ideas that have been brought forward or recycled in recent 
weeks have no relationship to the February 3 derailment, like requiring 
railroads to hire additional personnel when no hazard has been 
identified that would be mitigated through the hiring of those 
personnel. Support for mandating crew size for the first time in the 
195-year history of railroading is untethered to any actual safety data 
or solid scientific statistics that show how hiring requirements 
improve safety, and it is out of step with domestic short line 
experience, passenger and commuter rail experience, and international 
experience.
    Finally, new policies should do no harm. ASLRRA urges policymakers 
to avoid exacerbating problems in the wake of East Palestine. Hiring 
mandates that force small business railroads to put scant funds toward 
adding unnecessary personnel means they must divert resources from 
actual safety upgrades, such as track upgrades. Exorbitant fines 
detached from reasonable deterrence needs can put small business 
railroads into bankruptcy. Many ill-advised proposals like these are 
now on the table, and their implementation will mean more heavy freight 
and hazardous materials will end up moving on the highway, which is 
more detrimental to our environment, more dangerous to motorists, more 
likely to gum up the supply chain, and undeniably proven to inflict 
more damage America's already worn-out roads.
Sensible Policy Proposals Responsive to Actual Safety Concerns
    Ensure the NTSB's findings inform any policymaking. As part of this 
hearing, this panel is taking testimony from the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is uniquely tasked with 
leading investigative activities and will present in the months to come 
what we expect will be a thorough assessment of its findings, likely 
including what could have caused and prevented the February 3 
derailment. Advancing major policies without having a robust discussion 
on that report would be premature.
    Include Class 2 flammable gases within the definition of High-
Hazard Flammable Trains (HHFTs). It would be reasonable to include 
within the definition of HHFTs certain trains carrying a combination of 
loaded Class 3 flammable liquids and Class 2 flammable gases. It would 
be problematic, however, to include within the definition of HHFTs any 
train carrying even a single car of any type of hazardous material--
this would encompass a huge percentage of all trains moving, stretch 
the definition of ``high hazard'' beyond reason, and set the stage for 
overly burdensome restrictions for no safety benefit.
    Require hot box detectors for certain trains. It may be reasonable 
to create a requirement for hot box detectors or other wayside 
detectors or on-board sensors within the current HHFT regulatory 
framework (e.g., requiring detectors on routes routinely hosting trains 
that are also traveling in excess of 30 mph) or on certain key routes 
carrying substantial amounts of hazardous materials over certain 
speeds. It would be problematic, however, to require new wayside fault 
detectors like hotbox detectors on any route carrying any train 
carrying any hazardous materials at even low speeds, as hundreds of 
short line railroads would be required to install the expensive devices 
but would achieve no new safety benefit and mitigate no meaningful 
risk. This would be existentially threatening for some short lines, for 
no safety benefit.
    Phase out older tank cars. It may be reasonable and responsive to 
East Palestine to expedite the FAST Act-mandated phasing out of certain 
older tank cars.
    Support the Confidential Close Call Reporting System (C3RS). It may 
be reasonable to require some sort of rulemaking on the C3RS framework, 
and indeed, as noted above, there is already an RSAC effort underway on 
the topic. A C3RS mandate is unnecessary, however, as all of the 
largest railroads are now already in the program. The program should 
remain voluntary. A rulemaking to develop the program could still be 
beneficial, for example, so that proper parameters could be instituted 
to preclude employees from using the program to evade proper 
discipline.
    Avoid punitive fine increases for short lines. While it may be 
politically attractive to update maximum fine levels, we can state that 
as far as short lines are concerned, they have established a long 
record of being good corporate citizens who are more than willing to 
cooperate with regulators and focus on safety and community relations--
there is no call to threaten them with dramatically increased fines. 
Updates to fines should only reflect inflation and must account for the 
significantly negative effect a large fine could have on a small 
railroad.
    Increase funding for research and development at FRA and PHMSA and 
increase funding for certain inspection activities at FRA. It may be 
reasonable to increase resources for FRA for certain safety-advancing 
activities. For short lines, the most significant source of derailments 
is simply problematic track infrastructure, so inspection activities 
such as track geometry cars are at least responsive to a realistic 
safety risk.
    Direct USDOT and FRA to target CRISI funds for freight rail safety. 
The Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements Program 
(CRISI) has been instrumental in repairing, updating and rebuilding 
aging and outdated rail facilities--especially for short line freight 
railroads. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 
significantly increased the funds available for CRISI. As Congress 
begins to consider priorities for Fiscal Year 2024 spending measures, 
Congress should fully fund this program with annual appropriations at 
the full authorized level of $1,000,000,000 per year, and resources 
should be targeted toward freight rail safety needs--not toward 
passenger rail expansion efforts, which are largely unrelated to 
freight rail safety and are better addressed through other well-funded 
programs in IIJA. Again, for short lines, track, roadbed and structures 
challenges (rail, joint bars, track geometry, switches, roadbed, etc.) 
are the most common cause of derailments, so investments to help short 
lines rehabilitate that track are the most effective safety actions 
available.
    Provide resources for short lines to join the AskRail program. 
AskRail is a safety app made available by the Class I railroads through 
the Association of American Railroad's technology subsidiary, Railinc. 
The undertaking provides real-time information to first responders 
regarding the contents of railcars. Some short line railroads lack the 
resources and technical systems to join the program but would welcome 
resources to participate, recognizing, of course, that short line 
railroads present little hazardous material safety threat as is.
    Provide resources for efforts like RailPulse. RailPulse is an 
undertaking designed primarily to give freight railroads and rail 
shippers visibility into the real-time location of railcars, which 
would help improve supply chain visibility and performance. The 
RailPulse roadmap also involves installing a variety of other asset 
health sensors onto railcars beyond GPS, such as accelerometers and 
door status monitoring. This program could be expanded to include 
thermal, acoustic, visual and vibration sensors to monitor car 
components, such as for integrity of wheels and axles, possibly 
providing a dramatically improved method of constant monitoring of the 
safety of railcars. A policy statement and support for a significant 
funding infusion could provide key momentum to expand RailPulse.
    Provide increased resources for the Short Line Safety Institute 
(SLSI). FRA has been funding this effort annually at $2,500,000 per 
year for several years now through its research and development budget. 
Congress recommends to FRA that it do so through appropriations report 
language each year. The core service SLSI delivers is safety culture 
assessments. SLSI has now completed 121 safety culture assessments and 
touched over 12,000 railroaders. SLSI conducts leadership development 
training as well. SLSI has also successfully applied for PHMSA grants 
to expand its offerings to include Hazardous Materials Instructor 
Training (HMIT) and Assistance to Local Emergency Response Training 
(ALERT). SLSI is also the entity that facilitates short line 
participation in C3RS. With increased funding, SLSI could expand its 
offerings and capabilities in various ways:

  <bullet> New safety trains. SLSI has rented an older ``safety train'' 
        to conduct some hands-on field training. The train consists of 
        three or four rail cars, but SLSI does not own the cars. With 
        additional resources, SLSI could acquire its own trains and 
        expand its service to railroaders and emergency responders.

  <bullet> New mobile training facilities. SLSI is leasing a mobile 
        trailer specifically designed for hazardous materials 
        training--both classroom and hands-on. Additional funding would 
        allow for more facilities to be available to reach more 
        railroads and first responders across the country.

  <bullet> Support C3RS. With more resources, SLSI could provide more 
        analysis and reporting for those railroads participating in the 
        C3RS effort, especially as that number increases.

  <bullet> Launch a community standard of care training program. SLSI 
        could begin what would be considered a ``community standard of 
        care'' training program that would instruct short lines on how 
        to interact and care for a community should a safety incident 
        occur.
Conclusion
    ASLRRA appreciates the committee's close attention to the items we 
have noted in our statement, and we welcome future opportunities to 
work together on these matters.

    Prepared Statement of Tony Cardwell, President, Brotherhood of 
                Maintenance of Way Employes Division/IBT
    1. I am the President of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way 
Employes Division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (BMWED/
IBT).
    2. BMWED represents Employees working in the craft or class of 
Maintenance of Way Employee, employed by most of the freight railroads 
in the United States, including Norfolk Southern Railway (NSR) and the 
other Class I railroads, Amtrak, and major commuter railroads as well 
as some regional and short line railroads.
    3. BMWED represents the NSR Maintenance of Way Employees that 
performed derailment clean-up and the related track reconstruction/
restoration work at the East Palestine derailment site to restore NRS's 
rail services.
    4. Within days of the February 3, 2023 derailment at East 
Palestine, I received numerous phone calls from the NSR Maintenance of 
Way Employees who reported concerns about their health and safety due 
to the potential exposure to toxic chemicals, including vinyl chloride, 
while working at the East Palestine derailment site performing clean-up 
or track reconstruction/restoration work. I committed to contacting NSR 
officials about the safety of the working conditions at the derailment 
site.
    5. When I contacted NSR officials and expressed the NSR Maintenance 
of Way Employees concerns about their potential exposure to hazardous 
chemicals while working at the derailment site the NSR officials stated 
that none of the BMWED-represented Maintenance of Way Employees were 
assigned to work at the East Palestine derailment site. NSR also stated 
that the Employees did not assist in the clean up and performance of 
track reconstruction/restoration work following the derailment. NSR's 
statement was perplexing given the numerous calls I had received from 
the Members stating they had worked at the derailment site or that they 
would be working at the derailment site. I made several different phone 
calls with various BMWED representatives to determine if NSR did not 
actually assign any of its Maintenance of Way Employees to perform work 
at the East Palestine derailment site.
    Ultimately, BMWED conducted a Zoom conference on February 22, 2023 
\1\ with several NSR Employees. Contrary to what NSR officials told me, 
these NSR Maintenance of Way Employees stated they worked at the East 
Palestine derailment site. These Employees also described the types of 
work that they performed, that there was indeed strong chemical smells 
and fumes at the worksite, that there was black smoke at the worksite 
that often came into the areas where they were working, that there were 
chemical residues (iridescent sludge) on different surfaces and track 
materials where they were working, and that they were not offered 
personal protective equipment (PPE) that are designed for more safely 
performing work in and around hazardous chemicals, such as full-face 
hazardous chemical respirators, hazardous material suits, rubber 
overboots and rubber gloves, but that outside contractor workers and 
emergency medical services workers were wearing such PPE while working 
at the derailment site.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ There was also a Zoom conference with the Members on March 2, 
2023 and the NSR Employees continued to confirm that they were indeed 
working at the derailment site, performing the work of cleaning up and 
track restoration and reconstruction work. Some Members noted that they 
were required to work in location(s) in immediate proximity and even 
past the ``blue building'', which was later determined to be the area 
where the chemicals had been spilled and where there was a controlled 
burn of the vinyl chloride.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Additionally, several of these Members reported experiencing 
multiple health symptoms since working at the East Palestine Derailment 
site, including nausea, diarrhea, migraines, shortness of breath, skin 
irritation and irritation of the eyes. In fact, I recently received a 
report that a NSR Maintenance of Way Worker that worked at the 
derailment site and who reported experiencing numerous symptoms while 
working at the derailment site, and continues to experience shortness 
of breath, sought medical care to ``establish a baseline'' of their 
health for the purpose of monitoring any potential long-term impacts on 
their health from potential exposure to hazardous chemicals at the 
derailment site. This Employee stated that he worked at the East 
Palestine derailment site for nearly four (4) days without being 
advised of any dangers of being exposed to hazardous chemicals or the 
necessity for wearing personal protective equipment. It came as no 
surprise that this Employee was unfortunately diagnosed with chemical 
exposure and dyspnea (shortness of breath, inability to fully fill 
one's lungs). This Employee is scheduled to have an additional 
examination performed by a pulmonary doctor that specializes in 
chemical exposures. My hope is that this Employee was misdiagnosed and 
that he does not have any long-term impacts on his health. However, 
given that over one million gallons of hazardous materials and 
substances were released because of the East Palestine derailment, and 
given that the NS Maintenance of Way Employees did indeed work at the 
East Palestine derailment site where these chemicals were released, I 
anticipate additional concerning diagnoses for this Employee and 
others.
    Following the February 22, 2023, Zoom conference with the NSR 
Maintenance of Way Employees, I contacted NSR about the safety of the 
Employees' working conditions. During my conversation with NSR at this 
time, I demanded an in-person meeting in the immediate future to 
discuss the safety of the Employees at the derailment site. NSR 
initially stated that they would not have time to meet for at least one 
(1) week to discuss this issue. It took me telling NSR that the 
Employees have serious concerns for their health and safety, that 
working at the derailment site posed a serious, imminent danger to 
these
    Employees and that we would withdraw services (i.e., engage in a 
safety strike) if NS did not address these issues. NS answered several 
questions and concerns at that moment, guaranteed the Employees' safety 
to work at the jobsite and ultimately agreed to meet in person on 
Monday, February 27, 2023, at their corporate headquarters in Atlanta.
    When we met in person on February 27, 2023, I and American Rail 
System Federation General Chairman Jonathan Long, raised several 
questions and concerns of the Members about their potential exposure to 
chemicals at the derailment site. NSR officials insisted that the 
Employees were safe. NSR also stated that CTEH (the outside 
environmental contractor NSR used at the derailment site) had authority 
and was responsible for making determination about safety of the work 
location and any PPE the Employees may have needed to work safely at 
the derailment site. We asked NSR if they had any formal procedures or 
protocols for ``checking into and out'' of the derailment site given 
the hazardous chemicals and NSR again stated that CTEH was authorized 
and responsible for such. We also asked if NSR if they had any sort of 
``markers'' or ``barriers', such as caution tape or fencing, for 
identifying any hazardous areas that were/may be unsafe for the 
Employees to work due to the spilled chemicals. NSR stated that the 
``barrier'' was a blue building but that no Employees were ever 
required to work near or past such ``barrier''. NSR's response was 
essentially that the Workers were never near hazardous chemicals and 
that there was no PPE for such because CTEH made such determination. 
This is rather nonsensical, especially given the reports from the 
Employees that there were near hazardous chemicals, the volume of 
chemicals that were spilled and burned at that location, and the 
evidence that shows CTEH employees had specialized PPE on the jobsite. 
The Union believes that given the chaos at the time of the derailment, 
the dearth of information about the situation, the frantic efforts to 
control the spill, and the drive to restore service quickly, NSR should 
have erred on the side of safety for its workers. A responsible company 
that cared about its employees would have provided them with the most 
protective PPE possible, looking out for the possibility that a worst-
case scenario might come to pass. Instead, as with so many other 
things, NSR just assumed that the best case scenario would ensue, and 
it sent our Members into work at the site in their regular work clothes 
as if this was an ordinary derailment with no toxic chemicals released.
    6. Railroad Workers are a rare group of people. They take pride in 
the work they perform, and many especially pride themselves on their 
``grit'' and ``toughness'' to endure the extreme challenges that 
railroading imposes upon them. But these NS Employees, took exception 
to the safety of their working conditions at East Palestine, and they 
now have concerns for their long-term health and fear of losing their 
employment for coming forward. These Employees must have their long-
term health protected by NSR, NSR CEO Alan Shaw must publicly make such 
commitment and be held to such. NSR must also be held responsible for 
ensuring the immediate and long-term health and well-being of these 
Employees and their families. Additionally, these employees must be 
protected from retaliation by NSR in response to their reporting their 
safety and health concerns, and in response to the Union reporting 
their safety and health concerns. Mr. Shaw must also make a public 
commitment not to retaliate against these employees because of their 
actions and the actions of their Union.
    7. NSR must commit to improving the safety of its workplace, 
through serious investment in adequate staffing, serious investment in 
its track structure and rolling stock/operating equipment in an amount 
that exceeds their investments in their shareholders and executives' 
stock-buy backs and dividends. NSR, as well as all other Class I 
railroads, must abandon its reckless cost-cutting business model that 
has resulted in obscene profits for Wall Street Hedge Fund activist 
``value extraction'' investors, rail executives and shareholders, in 
the face of numerous senseless accidents and seriously diminished rail 
services and at the expense of the railroads' customers, the American 
public, the Workers and their families.
            Respectfully,
                                          Tony D. Cardwell,
                                                         President.
                                                                 BMWED.
                                 ______
                                 
 Prepared Statement of Jonathan Long, General Chairman, American Rail 
  System Federation of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes 
                              Division/IBT
    1. I am the General Chairman of the American Rail System Federation 
of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division of the 
International Brotherhood of Teamsters (BMWED/IBT).
    2. BMWED represents employees working in the craft or class of 
Maintenance of Way Employee employed by most of the freight railroads 
in the United States, including Norfolk Southern Railway (NSR) and the 
other Class I railroads, Amtrak, and major commuter railroads, and some 
regional and short line railroads.
    3. As General Chairman of the ARSF, I represent the NSR Maintenance 
of Way Employees that performed derailment clean-up and the related 
track reconstruction/restoration work at the East Palestine derailment 
site to restore NSR's rail services.
    4. Following the derailment, I received multiple phone calls from 
the NSR Maintenance of Way Employees that were working and that had 
worked at the East Palestine derailment site performing clean-up or 
track reconstruction/restoration work. These Employees reported 
concerns about the safety of their working conditions at the derailment 
site due to the hazardous chemicals, including vinyl chloride, that 
were being burned or that had spilled onto the ground. I committed to 
contacting NSR officials about the safety of the working conditions at 
the derailment site. When I contact NSR about the Maintenance of Way 
Employees' safety while working at the derailment site, the NSR 
official stated that I had his word that no Employees would be put in 
harm's way. Despite this commitment, I continued to receive inquiries 
from Members that were working at the derailment site and who were very 
seriously concerned about their safety. After several internal 
discussions with multiple BMWED-representatives, it was determined that 
a Zoom conference call with the NSR Maintenance of Way Employees was 
necessary to ascertain precisely what had transpired and what was 
taking place at East Palestine.
    5. BMWED conducted two (2) Zoom conferences with several of the 
BMWED-represented NSR Employees that worked at the East Palestine 
derailment site. The first Zoom conference was held on February 22, 
2023, and the second Zoom conference was held on March 2, 2023. The NSR 
Employees confirmed during these Zoom conferences that they were 
assigned to work at the derailment, and they described their 
experiences working at the derailment, all of which indicated that 
their conditions were unsafe. Their experiences of working at the 
derailment site are shocking to say the least. Several of the Employees 
stated that they were involved in the performance of removing damaged 
track, performing grading work, installing new track panels, surfacing 
and regulating ballast for the purpose of providing a safe roadbed and 
track surface for the trains to travel safely on once the tracks were 
temporarily rebuilt, fueling equipment that was used to perform such 
work, etc. Multiple Employees reported they were near the area of the 
``controlled burn'' of the vinyl chloride, and that there was obnoxious 
smelling black smoke at the work site. All the NSR Employees reported 
that they were not offered any personal protective equipment, such as 
full face hazardous chemical respirators (i.e., respirators that cover 
the eyes, mouth and nose with canisters that are rated for toxic 
fumes),, hazmat suits, rubber overboots, rubber gloves, etc. designed 
for working more safely around hazardous materials while working at the 
derailment site. Several of the NSR Employees reported the outside 
contractor employees, and emergency medical service (EMS) workers wore 
such PPE, including full-face hazardous chemical respirators, hazmat 
suits, rubber overboots and rubber gloves while working at the 
derailment site. Many of the NSR Employees, did report that NSR 
displayed a small supply of N95 particulate respirators and some half-
mask particulate respirators and told the Employees that they could 
wear them if they wanted to. But these respirators are not made for 
protecting the Workers from exposure to toxic fumes but are instead 
meant to prevent particles such as dust from being inhaled. Workers 
also reported not being provided a means for washing their hands so 
that they could eat with clean hands during quick meal breaks at or 
near the derailment site. Multiple NSR Employees reported working in or 
very close to an ``iridescent sludge'' that had a very strong, 
obnoxious gaseous odor. These Employees also reported that the 
iridescent sludge saturated their work boots, clothing, and gloves, and 
that they had to dispose of such items because they were ruined by such 
saturation and exposure.
    After not being provided hazmat personal protective equipment or a 
means for washing their hands, many of the Workers reported 
experiencing multiple health symptoms since working at the derailment. 
These symptoms included migraines, shortness of breath, skin 
irritation, irritation of the eyes, nausea, and diarrhea. Several of 
the Workers reported that they continued to experience these symptoms 
for multiple weeks following the derailment; several are still 
receiving breathing therapy. Additionally, all the Workers reported 
their concerns about how the exposure to the chemicals at the 
derailment would impact their long-term health.
    6. BMWED solicited a list of questions to NSR officials regarding 
the Members' exposure to these chemicals and had follow-up 
conversations with NS officials. I submitted those questions on 
February 24, 2023. NSR did not answer the questions submitted to it as 
of March 21, 2023, and the information NSR officials provided 
conflicted with the reports received from the Workers. BMWED eventually 
received information from the Membership that high-ranking NSR 
officials would be conducting a meeting with those Maintenance of Way 
Employees that worked at the East Palestine Derailment as well as their 
hazardous material contractor, CTEH. I as well as BMWED representatives 
Heath Vezza and Reese Saulter attended this meeting and during such, 
NSR officials and CTEH representatives stated that the Employees were 
not exposed to any hazardous chemicals while working at the derailment 
site. These officials and representatives went on to state that the 
vinyl chloride evaporated and was not in the ground where they worked, 
or that the air quality was safe where the Employees were when the 
vinyl chloride was burned.
    Ultimately, these representatives stated that the Employees were 
exposed to no dangers or hazards from the vinyl chloride that was 
spilled from the tank cars into the ground where the Employees worked 
or in the air during the ``controlled burn''. Some of the Employees 
asked why the residents of East Palestine were evacuated from the town 
during the controlled burn if they were not in danger.
    7. Although NSR and CTEH claimed the Employees were not exposed to 
toxic gasses, our Members reported smelling gasses at the site. We also 
don't know how NSR and CTEH can be so certain that there was no 
exposure when numerous toxic chemicals were spilled at the site and 
mixed together. Also, while vinyl chloride may evaporate when exposed 
to the air, our Members were disturbing the ground where they worked, 
some were assigned to remove inches of chemical drenched roadbed/soil 
and after they did, liquid at the site pooled up in puddles or 
``sludge'' on the ground after the ballast (rocks) and soil above was 
removed. We also received reports that CTEH employees were holding some 
sort of air sampling device supposedly to protect our Members when they 
were working, but the CTEH employee(s) was apparently not paying 
attention and it was noticed that the device was registering in the 
``red'' where our Members were working, and they were then told to 
leave where they were working immediately. So if there was no danger to 
our Members, why were residents told to evacuate? Residents may have 
been exposed to fumes in the ambient air, but our members were working 
at the site, walking through puddles and mud contaminated with 
chemicals. If it was hazardous for residents to be in the general area 
of the spill, wasn't it dangerous for NSR employees to be working at 
the spill site? And if there was no danger to the Maintenance of Way 
Employees, why were other workers at the site given substantial PPE, 
industrial respirators and hazmat gear? But here is the ultimate 
question--given the chaos at the time, the short time frame and frantic 
efforts to control the spill, shouldn't NSR have erred on the side of 
safety for its Workers? Perhaps the vinyl chloride evaporated by the 
time our members arrived on the scene, but perhaps not. Perhaps the 
chemicals mixing together in unpredictable ways and amounts did not 
cause greater danger than if it was a single chemical or the chemicals 
were kept apart. Perhaps having the ground so soaked with chemicals 
that more liquid pooled up when a top layer of roadbed/soil was removed 
did not create new exposure after the chemicals initially evaporated. 
But wouldn't a responsible company that cared about its Employees have 
provided them with the best PPE in case all those perhaps' did not turn 
out to be so? Instead NSR cavalierly sent our members into work at the 
site in their regular work clothes as if this was an ordinary 
derailment with no toxic chemicals. Even if NSR is ultimately shown to 
be correct in what it assumed, it could not have known for sure; 
instead, it played toxic gas Russian Roulette with its Maintenance of 
Way Workers.
    8. BMWED has received statements from its Members who were present 
and worked at the East Palestine derailment site. The intention was for 
these Employee statements to be shared with the Committee, but the 
Employees have since requested that their statements not be shared, 
even with their identities and certain details redacted, due to grave 
fears of retaliation by NSR, which I will address such in further 
detail below.
    9. Given what happened, I wrote to the of Mayor of the City of East 
Palestine, Mr. Trent Conaway, Governor of the State of Ohio, Mr. Mike 
DeWine, U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Pete Buttigieg and 
Administrator to the Federal Railroad Administration, Mr. Amit Bose, to 
describe the misfeasance of NSR with respect to its Employees. Copies 
of those letters are attached to this statement. The Members' concern 
for fear of retaliation were validated, because shortly following the 
General Chairman's letter to NSR, the General Chairman received reports 
from Members that a high-ranking official from NSR had told all NSR 
Division Engineers and Track Supervisors that if ``the Union wanted a 
war, we will give them a war'', and further told these management 
personnel to ``treat the East Palestine Workers like gold'' when it 
came to their concerns about the safety of their working conditions but 
to perform audits on the NSR Maintenance of Way Employees and ``handle 
it accordingly''. The implication was that managers were to go hunting 
through records and closely reviewing employee actions to look for 
potential violations that would not ordinarily be sought out in order 
to effect retribution on them because of the efforts of their union to 
protect their welfare. I was also advised that this same high-ranking 
NSR official told these management personnel that they are not to speak 
to any of the BMWED's ARSF Union representatives as they have 
historically done for resolving disputes on the property and that only 
NSR Labor Relations personnel could have such discussions. 
Additionally, during this NSR call, the names of the ARSF Union 
representatives were announced so that every manager knew their names 
and to avoid engaging with them accordingly. These instructions were 
allegedly given to the NSR management personnel via a conference call 
on March 3, 2023.
    10. There is no question that NSR Maintenance of Way Employees 
worked at or near the East Palestine derailment site. There is also no 
question that these Employees were not provided PPE equivalent to the 
PPE worn by the outside contractor workers and EMS workers that were at 
the derailment site. There is no doubt that there were toxic chemicals 
present in the environment when these Employees worked tirelessly to 
help clean up the derailment site and restore the track structure at 
East Palestine--NSR's derailment resulted in ``. . .over one million 
gallons of hazardous materials, hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, 
and/or other harmful pollutants into Ohio's air, streams, rivers, soil, 
and groundwater. . .'' right where these NSR Employees worked. These 
Employees now fear for their long-term health after working at the 
derailment site and they fear for their livelihood for raising concerns 
about the safety of their working conditions. All NSR Maintenance of 
Way Employees that performed work at the East Palestine derailment site 
must be protected from retaliation. NSR CEO Alan Shaw must publicly 
make such commitment and be held to such. NSR must also be held 
responsible for ensuring the immediate and long-term health and well-
being of these Employees and their families. NSR must commit to 
improving the safety of its workplace, through serious investment in 
adequate staffing, serious investment in its track structure and 
rolling stock/operating equipment in an amount that exceeds their 
investments in their shareholders and executives' stock-buy backs and 
dividends. Therefore, NSR must abandon its reckless cost-cutting 
business model that has resulted in obscene profits for Wall Street 
Hedge Fund activist ``value extraction'' investors, rail executives and 
shareholders, in the face of numerous senseless accidents and seriously 
diminished rail services and at the expense of the railroads' 
customers, the American public, the Workers and their families.
            Respectfully,
                                                J. B. Long,
                                                  General Chairman,
                                                                  ARSF.
                                 ______
                                 
             Prepared Statement of National Safety Council
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz and members of the Committee, 
the National Safety Council (NSC) appreciates the opportunity to submit 
these comments to improve railroad workplace safety. NSC was founded by 
the business community to improve workplace safety over 100 years ago. 
We continue to support safe and healthy workplaces, consulting with 
hundreds of workplaces each year--including high hazard workplaces--and 
we are honored to share our learnings with the Committee here today.
    NSC is America's leading nonprofit safety advocate and has been for 
more than 100 years. As a mission-based organization, we work to 
eliminate the leading causes of preventable death and injury, focusing 
our efforts on the workplace and roadway. We create a culture of safety 
to keep people safer at work and beyond so they can live their fullest 
lives. Our more than 13,000 member companies represent employees at 
nearly 41,000 U.S. worksites.
    Despite differences among business operations, there are key 
factors that are common among safety programs. NSC believes that 
optimum safety performance requires strong Safety Management Systems 
(SMS) and an organizational culture that prioritizes high safety 
standards, incident prevention and preparedness. Of course, continual 
improvement and learning must be fully integrated into any safety 
program.
    America's rail operators, like other industries with similar risk 
profiles, need to have strong safety and health programs that address:

  <bullet> Personal safety--employees and teams

  <bullet> Contractor safety--critical partners in safe operations and 
        maintenance

  <bullet> System safety--assets, infrastructure, operating systems, 
        maintenance

  <bullet> Public safety--customers, communities and the general public

    Key factors of successful programs include the following concepts:

  1.  Management commitment

  2.  Employee involvement

  3.  Training

  4.  Hazard/risk identification

  5.  Hazard control

    There are learnings to be gained from organizations that implement 
safety and health systems well. NSC believes that the U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission Normative Framework, 10 Traits for a Healthy 
Safety Culture, is time-proven methodology for evaluating culture and 
has wide applicability to a number of industries.\1\ The components of 
this framework include:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/safety-culture.html

   1.  Leadership Safety Values and Actions--Leaders demonstrate a 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        commitment to safety in their decisions and behavior.

   2.  Personal Accountability--All individuals take personal 
        responsibility for safety.

   3.  Decision-Making--Decisions that support or affect safety are 
        systematic, rigorous and thorough.

   4.  Questioning Attitude--Individuals avoid complacency and 
        continuously challenge existing conditions and activities to 
        identify discrepancies that might result in error or 
        inappropriate actions.

   5.  Environment for Raising Concerns--A safety conscious work 
        environment (SCWE) is maintained where personnel feel free to 
        raise safety concerns without fear of retaliation, 
        intimidation, harassment or discrimination.

   6.  Respectful Work Environment--Trust and respect permeate the 
        organization.

   7.  Work Processes--The process of planning and controlling work 
        activities is implemented so that safety is maintained.

   8.  Effective Safety Communication--Communications maintain a focus 
        on safety.

   9.  Organizational Learning--Opportunities to learn about ways to 
        ensure safety are sought out and implemented.

  10.  Problem Identification and Resolution--Issues potentially 
        impacting safety are promptly identified, fully evaluated, and 
        promptly addressed and corrected commensurate with their 
        significance.
    There is always an opportunity to improve safety to protect all 
stakeholders. Every worker deserves to return home in the same way he 
or she went to work. NSC welcomes an opportunity to work with the 
Committee on these issues and build upon efforts started in the Rail 
Safety Improvement Act.\2\

   Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                        Hon. Jennifer L. Homendy
    NTSB Resources. In 2016, a Union Pacific train derailed just 600 
feet from the Columbia River in Mosier, Oregon, which borders 
Washington state. A total of sixteen cars derailed, spilling 47,000 
gallons of crude oil. It subsequently caught fire, forced roughly 100 
people to evacuate, and required over 500 response personnel. However, 
the NTSB chose not to investigate the Mosier train derailment ``due to 
limited resources.''
    Question. Does the NTSB have the resources it needs to carry out 
its critical safety mission?
    Answer. To continue as the world's preeminent safety agency and to 
keep pace with the technological advancements seen in all modes of 
transportation, the NTSB needs additional resources.
    As you know, we are a small agency relative to our Federal 
partners, in terms of the size of our budget and our workforce, but our 
impact is profound. Our small, mission-driven staff are currently 
working on an outsized number of investigations. We need more staff to 
conduct more safety investigations and complete them more quickly. At 
the moment, our staffing levels, workload, and needs are as follows:

  <bullet> Office of Aviation Safety: 113 staff working on 1,194 
        domestic and 132 foreign investigations; 150 staff are needed

  <bullet> Office of Railroad, Pipeline, and Hazardous Materials 
        Investigations: 34 staff working on 30 investigations; 56 staff 
        are needed

  <bullet> Office of Highway Safety: 32 staff working on 21 
        investigations; 53 staff are needed

  <bullet> Office of Marine Safety: 18 staff working on 49 
        investigations; 38 staff are needed

  <bullet> Office of Research and Engineering: 53 staff supporting 340 
        investigations and working on 6 safety research reports; 63 
        staff are needed

    The objective of each investigation is to uncover safety challenges 
and identify trends to prevent a future tragedy from occurring. Between 
January 1, 2020, and April 11, 2023, we have issued 371 new 
recommendations and closed 473. Of those closed, 355 (75 percent) were 
closed acceptably, meaning that the recipient took action to implement 
the safety recommendation.
    Despite the tremendous growth in transportation over the last two 
decades, the size of our agency has stayed virtually the same--
approximately 400 staff members. Our workforce is our greatest asset 
and is essential to our mission. We need additional resources to hire 
the skilled professionals noted above, hire operational staff to 
support them, purchase the equipment necessary for staff to do their 
jobs, and invest in crucial staff training and development. When I 
became Chair in August 2021, we had 399 staff members. This year, we 
have undertaken 62 hiring actions and aim to end the year with 435 
people on board. This is being accomplished with the $129.3 million 
provided by Congress for Fiscal Year (FY) 2023. We need at least $145 
million in FY 2024, with incremental increases to $185 million in FY 
2028, to reach full staffing of 515 by 2028. We need Congress's 
continued support for the NTSB's mission and resources.
                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Gary Peters to 
                        Hon. Jennifer L. Homendy
    Question 1. Chair Homendy in your testimony you mentioned the need 
to reauthorize the NTSB and for sending the details of your request to 
my subcommittee. In your reauthorization request, you asked for 
additional staffing capacity over the next 5 years. Can you describe 
how additional staffing capacity would improve NTSB's ability to 
investigate safety incidents, including whether it could shorten 
timelines for investigation completion or improve investigative 
techniques?
    Answer. The NTSB's workforce is our greatest asset. We need robust, 
diverse, and well-trained staff to keep pace with the technological 
advancements seen in all modes of transportation. For this, the NTSB 
needs additional resources. There is no question that additional staff 
would improve the NTSB's ability to investigate safety incidents and 
shorten the time it takes to complete our investigations.
    The integrity of our investigations is vital to maintaining public 
confidence. The NTSB has recently faced several issues, however, that 
affect the timeliness of our reports, including government shutdowns, a 
global pandemic, and parallel criminal investigations. We are actively 
pursuing ways to expedite our processes while keeping in mind the time 
required to complete thorough and accurate investigations. Our Office 
of Aviation Safety is leading the agency effort and has several 
initiatives underway. Our focus has been on process improvements, 
eliminating the investigation backlog, and adding resources where most 
needed. For example, at its peak in January 2022, our aviation backlog 
included 442 open cases over 2 years old. Today, we have fewer than 40. 
We are using a data-driven approach to evaluate each step of an 
investigation to identify efficiencies and process improvements, and we 
have already improved the timeliness and consistency of our 
investigation reports as a result of this new approach. We are also 
using this approach to better monitor, track, and measure progress, 
holding employees accountable for their performance, and to identify 
the need for adjustments if projects are delayed.
    Additionally, we have identified staffing shortages as a reason 
that some reports take longer to produce than we would like. The 
reduction in workforce due to retirements and budget constraints means 
that there are simply fewer people to accomplish increasing workloads. 
This retirement trend is only projected to increase over the next 
several years; therefore, as an interim measure to meet the immediate 
need, we have hired retired investigators as reemployed annuitants to 
provide writing and final report processing support for certain 
investigations. We have also streamlined our hiring process to expedite 
filling vacancies, to the extent we are able under current budgetary 
constraints. For example, in the Office of Aviation Safety, these 
efforts have led to the onboarding of six staff this year, and we have 
ten positions in the interview and selection phase.
    Support of our reauthorization proposal would allow the NTSB to 
hire more staff to meet the expanded need for transportation 
investigations, including those related to emerging issue areas. Funds 
will also allow us to focus investigations on our aging infrastructure 
and to reinforce our current recommendations.

    Question 2. Chair Homendy, your testimony mentions open NTSB 
recommendations regarding notification of first responders when 
hazardous materials travel through a community like East Palestine--or 
Michigan towns that have seen near-misses in recent months. A few 
questions related to this recommendation:

    A. Can you expand on what NTSB sees as the threshold for sufficient 
notification that would allow swift response and risk mitigation?
    Answer. The NTSB believes that just one railcar of any hazardous 
material justifies notifying emergency responders of hazardous 
materials transiting their communities. A single tank car loaded with 
hazardous material can cause extensive destruction and loss of life. If 
a derailment does occur, emergency responders are the next line of 
defense to minimize loss of life, injury, and damage to the environment 
and to property. It is critical that emergency responders receive 
critical hazardous materials information. In fact, the NTSB recommended 
in 2014 that the Department of Transportation require railroads 
transporting hazardous materials through communities provide emergency 
responders and local and state emergency planning committees with real-
time or advanced notification in order to facilitate a quick response 
(R-14-14). Having awareness and timely access to information will 
prepare emergency responders to protect themselves and their 
communities.
    Communities are granted commodity flow information by completing a 
request found in the Association of American Railroad's (AAR's) 
Circular OT-55.\1\ However, this is not real-time, but annualized 
information, and many communities are unaware of its availability. 
Further, most emergency responders have awareness-level training, which 
is sufficient for railroad operating personnel; however, emergency 
responders need operations-level training, such as that outlined in the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Standard 1910.120.\2\

    \2\ OSHA 1910.120--Hazardous waste operations and emergency 
response

    B. What types of mechanisms could be employed for this type of 
notification and how could we ensure security of these transmissions to 
ensure this information does not fall into the wrong hands?
    Answer. As you know, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation 
(FAST) Act directed the Department of Transportation (DOT) to require 
Class I railroads transporting any hazardous materials to generate 
real-time electronic train consist and emergency response information 
and provide it to state and local first responders in the event of an 
incident.\3\ This rulemaking has languished since January 2017.\4\

    \3\ P.L. 114-94, Sec. 7302
    \4\ Federal Register:: Hazardous Materials: FAST Act Requirements 
for Real-Time Train Consist Information by Rail
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The FAST Act also directed that each state emergency response 
commission be given advance notification regarding high-hazard 
flammable trains (HHFTs) passing through their communities.\5\ The DOT 
completed this rule in February 2019.\6\ As you know, the train in East 
Palestine was not an HHFT, however, and the first responders had no 
awareness it was traveling through their community.

    \6\ Federal Register: Hazardous Materials: Oil Spill Response Plans 
and Information Sharing for High-Hazard Flammable Trains (FAST Act)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As a voluntary measure, the railroad industry in 2014 launched the 
AskRail app through which railroads can provide electronic notification 
of the contents of train consists to authorized qualified users who 
have completed industry-sponsored training for emergency responders. 
However, it is not clear that all emergency responders have the AskRail 
app available and are trained on how to use it. In East Palestine, none 
of the East Palestine Fire Department personnel had the app on their 
devices.
    The AskRail user guide states that the app displays the last known 
information about railroad equipment contents. This information is 
expected to be current and correct; however, it may not be due to 
various data quality impediments or delays in data transmission. The 
AAR recommends that emergency responders use AskRail temporarily for 
safety isolation, evacuation, and assessment from a distance while 
securing the proper shipping paper from the railroad or train crew. 
According to the guide, the sequencing of the cars in the application 
may not match the sequencing of the cars on the paper consist, which is 
the compliance document and takes precedence in any discrepancy. 
Further, after a derailment, the sequence of cars in the consist and in 
the app does not match due to the railcars bunching up. Therefore, the 
AskRail app is not an absolute replacement for accurate hazardous 
materials shipping papers carried on-board the locomotive.
    The AAR United States Hazardous Materials Instructions for Rail 
instructs train crews to immediately share any requested information 
from the shipping documents with emergency response personnel, provide 
an extra copy of the train consist when available, and immediately 
share a copy of the emergency response information provided with the 
shipment.\7\ These current instructions and Federal regulations fall 
short of requiring rail carriers to seek out emergency responders to 
provide them timely information about a train consist following a 
hazardous materials release incident.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section VIII. Emergency Response (Jan. 20, 2022), paragraph 4(a)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We acknowledge the security issues associated with these 
notifications to ensure this information does not fall into the wrong 
hands. The NTSB is focused on safety and accident investigation and 
does not have the expertise to comment on how to best ensure the 
security of these notifications. We would look to other Federal 
agencies with the required expertise, such as in the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency (CISA), to develop and issue appropriate standards and 
procedures. For security reasons, only emergency communication centers, 
emergency first responders, and other authorized persons, as determined 
by the North American Class 1 Railroads, can download and use the 
restricted features of the AskRail app.

    C. Has NTSB considered partnering with DHS or CISA on making 
specific recommendations to address these parts of the recommendation?
    Answer. No. However, if we determine in an investigation that DHS 
or the CISA could take an action to prevent a noncriminal act/accident, 
we will not hesitate to make a recommendation to either agency. 
Further, we may also add DHS or the CISA as parties to an investigation 
where there were cybersecurity issues.
    However, the NTSB does not investigate criminal activity. If our 
investigation reveals that a transportation event was caused by 
criminal activity, we are obligated to turn the investigation over to 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other appropriate law 
enforcement organization. We believe it is likely that any 
investigation involving DHS or the CISA would likely be a criminal 
investigation.

    Question 3. Chair Homendy, in your testimony you discussed NTSB's 
recommendation that the Federal Railroad Administration review 
railroads' Risk Reduction Programs to ensure that they include 
sufficient planning for prevention and mitigation and that they reflect 
companies' commitment to continuous evaluation and improvement. Has the 
Federal Railroad Administration given NTSB a reason for not following 
through with this recommendation? Do you believe it could be related to 
a lack of capacity?
    Answer. Our last update from the Federal Railroad Administration 
(FRA) was in September 2021 when the FRA said it had drafted the 
recommended guidance on risk reduction programs and was reviewing and 
clearing it for public release. We have not received any further 
information, and we are currently awaiting a copy of their guidance for 
our review.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                             David Comstock
    Emergency Response. Over 75 percent of fire departments in the 
State of Washington are volunteer or mostly volunteer-run. Only 14 
percent of fire departments in the state have a specialized hazardous 
materials team that could best respond to hazmat spills. There are 
currently six Federal hazardous materials safety grants at DOT, but 
none that fund equipment. To properly prepare for and respond to 
hazardous materials incidents, communities need access to the right 
training and equipment.

    Question 1. Mr. Comstock, did your department have the resources it 
needed to respond to the East Palestine derailment?
    Answer. My department did not possess the necessary specialized 
equipment to deal with a hazardous materials incident like East 
Palestine. Though hazardous materials rail incidents can occur near any 
jurisdiction that is located near a rail line where these materials are 
transported, many departments in these jurisdictions do not possess 
specialized hazmat equipment. This is often due to fire departments 
within these jurisdictions having very limited funding that in many 
cases don't even cover enough funding to provide basic firefighting 
equipment to all personnel.
    Additionally due to the intensity of the East Palestine incident, 
turnout gear and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) used at the 
incident were destroyed. I must now rent replacement turnout gear 
because I don't have enough back-up gear for my firefighters during the 
months long process of ordering new gear.
    My department also relies on a county level hazmat response team 
for technical support. Our county's team did not have all of the 
monitoring meters it needed at the East Palestine incident. These 
meters cost $60,000 each.

    Question 2. Are current Federal grant programs adequate for 
providing communities like yours with hazardous materials response 
equipment?
    Answer. The DoT's grant programs are excellent at providing hazmat 
response training and the National Volunteer Fire Council strongly 
recommends additional funding for these programs. The Federal Emergency 
Management Agency's (FEMA) Assistance to Firefighting Grant (AFG) 
program is the best existing grant program for firefighting equipment, 
but this program receives many more requests than it can fulfill.
    The fire service would benefit from a new grant program to provide 
hazardous materials response equipment. Additional funding for regional 
hazmat teams consistent with NFPA standards would also be helpful. This 
is provided neither of these additional funding sources take away from 
the funds available for hazmat training, AFG, or Staffing for Adequate 
Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants.

  Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn to 
                             David Comstock
    To Chief Comstock: I know product identification on train cars is 
paramount to first responders' safety. In situations like we saw in 
Ohio, fast and accurate identification of hazardous materials is 
necessary to make sure we don't put first responders at risk.
    Question. How can Congress work with industry and first responders 
to enhance methods for emergency hazmat product identification?
    Answer. The most effective way to improve emergency hazmat rail 
product identification is to ensure that all firefighters that provide 
hazmat incident response are trained at an operational level of 
competence. A big step toward accomplishing this goal would be to 
provide additional funding to Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administrations' (PHMSA) hazardous materials training grants. 
Specifically to Hazardous Materials Emergency Preparedness (HMEP), 
Assistance for Local Emergency Response Training (ALERT), Hazardous 
Materials Instructor Training (HMIT), Community Safety (CS) program, 
and Supplemental Public Sector Training (SPST).
    Additionally, Congress can take steps to foster dialog between 
industry and first responders to ensure perspectives are exchanged to 
identify the best ways to distribute needed hazardous materials 
transportation information to first responders. I also believe that 
Congress should support the recommendations made by the National 
Transportation Safety Board regarding the notification of first 
responders. See page 8 of Chair Homendy's testimony for this hearing.

    Safety Investments. According to data Norfolk Southern provided to 
the Surface Transportation Board, investments the company have made in 
its network decreased by about 30 percent from 2017 to 2021. During 
that same time accident rates increased by 60 percent.

    Question. How much does Norfolk Southern plan on investing in its 
network this year?
    Answer. At Norfolk Southern, safety is our top priority, and we 
have long been committed to operating a safe railroad. We have a 
multipronged approach to safety that includes capital investments to 
reduce the number and severity of accidents. We invest over $1 billion 
every year in technologies, equipment, and infrastructure to enhance 
the safety of our rail operations. These include safety-focused items, 
such as rails, ties, ballasts, bridges, culverts, vehicles, and 
maintenance of way equipment. We spend an additional $1 billion every 
year on ongoing operations in support of safety.

                               Alan Shaw
    The Bipartisan Railway Safety Act of 2023: This bill takes a number 
of key steps to improve rail safety protocols, such as enhancing safety 
procedures for trains carrying hazardous materials, establishing 
requirements for wayside defect detectors, creating a permanent 
requirement for railroads to operate with at least two-person crews, 
increasing fines for wrongdoing committed by rail carriers, and more.

    Question 1. Please identify the provisions in Senator Brown and 
Vance's Railway Safety Act of 2023 which you do not support, and 
clarify the reasons why.
    Answer. We support legislative efforts to enhance the safety of the 
freight rail industry. We are committed to working with our fellow 
industry leaders, and we also recognize and appreciate the bicameral, 
bipartisan leadership by Members of Congress in proposing new 
legislation to create a safer rail industry. The Railway Safety Act 
includes measures with the potential to enhance safety and improve 
outcomes for our industry, our customers, and the communities we serve.
    We support the Railway Safety Act's provisions for more industry-
funded training for first responders, and we are not waiting for 
legislation to move this forward. We have already announced the 
expansion of our existing training programs and the creation of a new 
regional training center in Ohio, to serve first responders in Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.
    We support the principle that first responders need accurate real-
time information on the contents of trains moving through their 
communities and instruction on the safe handling of those contents in 
the event of an accident. We intend to take a leading role in getting 
the AskRail safety application into the hands of every first responder 
who needs access. In this area specifically, the details of legislation 
matter as policymakers balance safety and national security concerns.
    We support triennial reviews of regulations for rail car 
inspections and standards for freight car safety because regular 
reviews drive good regulatory policy and outcomes.
    We support the Federal Railroad Administration's (``FRA'') 
Confidential Close Call Reporting System (``C3RS''). Norfolk Southern 
participates in the C3RS Working Group, which is part of the Department 
of Transportation's Railroad Safety Advisory Committee.
    We support accelerating the phaseout of older tank car models, 
research into advanced tank car design, and additional funding for 
research and development of next-generation, early-warning sensor 
technologies.
    There are also areas in which we believe Congress could go further 
with safety legislation. We encourage even stricter standards for tank 
car design. There are significant opportunities for advanced technology 
to enhance rail safety, and we encourage Congress to consider 
additional research into on-board rail car defect detection technology.
    We support increasing fines and penalties for persons found 
tampering with railroad facilities and safety equipment, such as grade 
crossing warning devices, wayside detectors, or signal boxes. We 
support codifying and enhancing the FRA's C3RS. And we support new 
requirements to ensure utility installations in railroads' rights-of-
way are conducted safely.
    We also look forward to constructive discussions with stakeholders 
regarding other provisions of the proposed legislation, as our goal is 
to help craft effective, data-driven, practical legislation that 
improves the Nation's rail system and rail safety.

    Question 1. Mr. Shaw, my office has subsequently shared the 
document with you that I referenced in the hearing on March 22, 2023 
that appeared to show Norfolk Southern trains running rail cars past 
the FRA-imposed limit for a brake inspection. Can you provide an 
explanation for these apparent violations? Has Norfolk Southern 
investigated this issue and what steps have you taken to ensure there 
is not habitual overrun of FRA brake inspection standards?
    Answer. The document in question is a report from an internal 
commercial-facing tool called the Commodity Train Management System 
(``CTMS''). This system provides some information about equipment that 
serves coal, grain, and other commodities customers. CTMS is not the 
system of record for brake tests or mechanical inspections, and it no 
longer displays interval mileage and brake mechanical inspection data. 
We have consulted the relevant system of record and confirmed that the 
train in question received a brake test in compliance with applicable 
Federal regulations.

    Question 2. The document I entered into the hearing record appeared 
to show NS cars traveling tens of thousands of miles without a full 
mechanical inspection. Does Norfolk Southern have an internal standard 
for how many miles a car should travel before receiving a full 
mechanical inspection?
    Answer. We do not allow unsafe trains to operate. Norfolk Southern 
requires railcar inspections in compliance with applicable Federal 
regulations. As relevant to this question, Norfolk Southern requires 
that cycle unit trains receive a mechanical inspection by qualified 
personnel at appropriate intervals.

    Question 3. Your testimony mentioned that Norfolk Southern 
``aggressively hired'' in 2022. According to the GAO and witness 
testimonies, Class I rail companies have cut their workforces by as 
much as 30 percent over the past decade. Is there an internal hiring 
goal that Norfolk Southern is committed to meeting with new hiring? Can 
you share with the committee how many new roles are inspection-related 
positions that will increase the company's self-inspection capacity?
    Answer. We know that our employees in the field are key to our 
success. To that end, we hired craft railroaders throughout 2022 and 
continue to do so this year. We've invested in our Train and Engine 
workforce and maintained a robust pipeline of trainees, including more 
than 930 conductor trainees in the first quarter of 2023. And in 
December 2022, Norfolk Southern was the first in the industry to 
announce a move away from a focus on reducing operating ratio--a common 
industry measure of efficiency. As part of our December announcement, 
we made clear that we are going to make reliable and resilient service 
our goal. That means investing more in services, running a safe 
railroad, and moving away from the practice of furloughing workers 
during a downturn. Instead, we'll use the opportunity to invest in 
additional training for our people. That makes us a better railroad, 
improves service for our customers, and improves the quality of life 
for our frontline railroaders.
    Hiring target goals are affected by a number of factors throughout 
the year and are therefore fluid and dynamic. Norfolk Southern recently 
provided the Surface Transportation Board with revised labor force 
targets for May 2023. These revised targets projected a companywide 
total of 18,624 employees by May 2023, including 7,613 Full-time 
Employees (``FTEs'') in Train and Engine, 4,166 FTEs in Maintenance of 
Way, and 2,472 FTEs in Maintenance of Equipment and Stores.
    When Norfolk Southern is successful, it is because our frontline 
railroaders are getting the job done. For context, optimized train 
routes and newly adopted technologies that assist inspectors have 
increased the efficiency of on-arrival and pre-departure inspections. 
We agree on the importance of ensuring thorough inspections, and we 
understand the most successful inspections are carried out through a 
process that utilizes both technology and human resources. We note that 
inspection frequency has generally remained consistent, and Norfolk 
Southern has remained committed to complying with federally mandated 
mechanical inspection obligations.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Baldwin to 
                               Alan Shaw
    Mr. Shaw, I have serious concerns about the safety record of 
Norfolk Southern, particularly as the number of safety incidents at the 
company has risen 76 percent in the last decade and the National 
Transportation Safety Board felt it necessary to open a special 
investigation into the company's safety culture.
    I have long believed that a fully staffed, highly qualified, and 
well-trained workforce is vital to the safety and success of rail 
carriers throughout the country.

    Question 1. To that end, how many carmen are currently working for 
Norfolk Southern? And how does that level compare with a decade ago in 
2013, prior to the company implementing precision scheduled 
railroading? Finally, what steps are you taking to properly invest in 
your workforce?
    Answer. Safety is our top priority at Norfolk Southern. We are 
committed to ensuring the safety of communities that live by our 
railroads and the safety of our employees. We invest over $1 billion 
every year on technologies, equipment, and infrastructure to support 
safety, and another $1 billion per year in ongoing operations in 
support of safety. We have a multipronged approach to safety that 
includes capital investments to reduce the number and severity of 
accidents.
    Norfolk Southern publicly reports the number of ``Maintenance of 
Equipment and Stores'' employees, which includes carmen and a wide 
range of other roles. In 2022, there were approximately 2,420 
Maintenance of Equipment and Stores employees at Norfolk Southern. We 
know that our employees in the field are key to our success. In 
December 2022, Norfolk Southern was the first in the industry to 
announce a move away from a focus on reducing operating ratio--a common 
industry measure of efficiency. As part of our December announcement, 
we made clear that we are going to make reliable and resilient service 
our goal. That means investing more in services, running a safe 
railroad, and moving away from the practice of furloughing workers 
during a downturn. Instead, we'll use the opportunity to improve 
training for our people. That makes us a better railroad, improves 
service for our customers, and improves the quality of life for our 
frontline railroaders.
    Mr. Shaw, I have received reports from BMWED, the Union that 
represents Norfolk Southern Maintenance of Way workers, that its 
members were sent out to clear muck and debris from the tracks in East 
Palestine and to restore the tracks so Norfolk Southern could resume 
operations.
    While many of them have since asked that their statements not be 
shared for fear of retaliation, the reports suggested that there were 
dozens of employees on and around the tracks, including when residents 
were told to evacuate and the controlled burn was conducted. 
Concerningly, the reports also said Norfolk Southern did not provide 
those employees with full face chemical respirators, other industrial 
grade respirators that protect workers from chemical gasses, eye 
protections, rubber gloves, rubber boots, or hazmat overalls. The track 
workers have since reported experiencing headaches, nose bleeds, skin 
irritations, and difficulty breathing.
    In light of these reports:

    Question 2. Were the maintenance of way employees assigned to help 
clear the track and right of way given full face chemical respirators, 
or other industrial grade respirators that protect workers from 
chemical gasses, eye protection, rubber gloves, rubber boots or hazmat 
overalls?
    Answer. We are fully committed to keeping our employees safe as 
they work to clean up and restore the community of East Palestine, just 
like we're fully committed to keeping the community safe. Immediately 
following the incident, we worked closely with contractors who 
specialize in this type of clean-up. The first Norfolk Southern 
employees on the scene were supervisors, not unionized workers. Only 
after the contractors cleared the site for work did we call in our 
craft colleagues to assist with the clean-up. Our contractors advised 
us on conditions, including what sort of protective equipment we needed 
and constantly monitored the air to make sure it was safe to work.
    We provided our workers with personal protective equipment 
(``PPE''), including safety glasses, hardhats, reflective vests, and 
hearing protection, as well as N95 respirators. Air monitoring 
conducted immediately after the derailment by Norfolk Southern and our 
expert consultants--which was shared with first responders--indicated 
that the chemical levels in areas delineated for Norfolk Southern 
activities were below what would have required chemical protective PPE 
or respirators. Our expert contractors who responded to the derailment 
provided PPE to their own personnel.

    Question 3. Are you aware that a high-level Norfolk Southern 
manager, in conversation with other managers, suggested that letters 
sent by BMWED to Secretary Buttigieg and Governor DeWine raising safety 
concerns were ``BMWED going to war'' with Norfolk Southern, while also 
suggesting that individual employees' records should be scrutinized for 
potential opportunities for retaliation?
    Answer. We have robust, ongoing dialogues with our unions, and we 
value the relationships we have with them. We are not aware of such a 
comment. Norfolk Southern prohibits retaliation against whistleblowers.

    Question 4. Will you commit that Norfolk Southern will not 
retaliate against individual workers because their union raised safety 
concerns with Federal and state officials?
    Answer. We do not penalize or retaliate against our employees when 
their unions raise safety concerns, whether that is within the company 
or to Federal and state officials.

   Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to 
                               Alan Shaw
    On March 8, 2023, the FRA announced that it will be conducting a 
60-day assessment of Norfolk Southern (NS), related to the derailments 
and other NS safety-related incidents. The FRA noted that it would 
specifically assess various operational elements, including dispatcher 
training and the training and qualification programs available to all 
railroad employees, including engineer and conductor training and 
certification.

    Question 1. Taking into account that the FRA recently investigated 
NS's Conductor Certification Program in 2021 and found it to be non-
compliant, what steps has NS taken to improve its training and 
qualification programs to ensure that staff are all properly trained to 
avoid further derailments and rail accidents and what new steps will it 
take given the recent East Palestine derailment?
    Answer. We are working with the FRA to ensure our program continues 
to comply with applicable regulations. With regard to the East 
Palestine incident, the NTSB preliminary report indicated the rail crew 
operated the train below the track speed limit and handled the train in 
an approved manner. Once the rail crew was alerted by the wayside 
detector, they immediately began to stop the train. During the NTSB 
press conference held on February 23, 2023, Chair Homendy said, ``[w]e 
have no evidence that the crew did anything wrong.''
    As a general matter, and consistent with Federal regulations, 
conductors must complete Norfolk Southern's conductor training program, 
which includes approximately four months of classroom and on-the-job 
training. The FRA audits compliance with these regulations. In 
performing these audits, FRA representatives spend time at our training 
center in McDonough, Georgia, and in the field with our Conductor 
Trainees, supervisors, and craft employees.
    Norfolk Southern is committed to investing in our people, our 
infrastructure, and in new technology and systems to make our 
operations safe for our employees and the communities we serve. We are 
also committed to doing our part to help maintain the freight railroad 
network as one of the safest and environmentally sustainable modes of 
surface transportation in the nation. We are collaborating with our 
employees and their labor representatives to request input in 
continuing to improve safety. We have held safety stand-down briefings 
across our network and throughout the organization to emphasize our 
commitment to safety. We are continually looking for ways to improve 
our strong safety culture and welcome feedback from the FRA. We intend 
to implement measures that are proven to increase operational safety, 
including enhancements to the safety and response training provided to 
Norfolk Southern employees.
    In the course of their regular oversight duties, the FRA is 
currently reviewing the conductor training programs for Class I 
Railroads, including Norfolk Southern's. We are also cooperating with 
the FRA as it conducts a full safety culture audit. As part of the 
audit, the FRA has attended Norfolk Southern training across all crafts 
to observe the company's messaging around safety, which will allow 
Norfolk Southern and the FRA to openly exchange ideas to continue to 
improve our programs. We also agreed to join the FRA's C3RS. Norfolk 
Southern is cooperating with the NTSB's special investigation of its 
organization and safety culture. We are resolved to work with 
lawmakers, the NTSB, the FRA, and other stakeholders to improve railway 
safety and learn from this derailment.
    All Norfolk Southern field supervisors and craft employees receive 
hazardous materials training, including training on the procedures in 
Norfolk Southern's emergency response plan, which is loaded on all 
company-provided devices. All field supervisors and craft employees 
also receive safety sensitive training, which includes topics such as 
railroad security, improvised explosive devices, and threats to the 
railroad.

      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                               Alan Shaw
    Question 1. During the hearing, you indicated that Norfolk Southern 
was working on a fund to compensate homeowners in the surrounding area 
of East Palestine whose property values had been affected by the 
February 3 derailment.
    a. Has such a fund been established yet?
    Answer. We are listening closely to concerns from the community 
about whether there could be long-term impacts from the derailment. We 
know residents are worried about their home values. We are working with 
local leaders on investments to support the community's long-term 
prosperity. We are currently working towards a final resolution with 
Attorney General Yost and relevant stakeholders to establish three new 
funds to address healthcare, property values, and water protection in 
East Palestine and the surrounding communities. However, these are 
complicated issues that will likely take time to resolve in a 
comprehensive fashion. The details of these programs are being 
developed, and we look forward to sharing additional information about 
them in the future.

    b. If such a fund has already been established, please provide 
details regarding the claim process and the compensation available. If 
not, please explain the remaining tasks and the expected date that 
claims can be made.
    Answer. Although the fund is not yet in place, Norfolk Southern is 
covering costs for any resident who has chosen to relocate, either 
temporarily or permanently. As of May 1, 2023, Norfolk Southern has 
paid nearly $4 million providing relocation assistance.

    Question 2. Responding to a major hazardous materials incident can 
impose substantial costs on first responders, and the delay in repaying 
those expenses can lower the readiness of those organizations in the 
aftermath of such an incident.
a. Has Norfolk Southern or its insurer reimbursed the expenses of all 
        first responders to the East Palestine derailment?
    Answer. Norfolk Southern has profound admiration for first 
responders, and we are committed to making first responders whole for 
costs associated with the emergency response in East Palestine. We have 
paid over $5.3 million in reimbursements and support to first-responder 
organizations in East Palestine and the surrounding communities to 
replace equipment used in the derailment response.
    Additionally, we have pledged additional funds for first responders 
and taken a number of steps to ensure that local communities are 
equipped to respond to train-related incidents. Norfolk Southern 
maintains a robust network of emergency response contractors who can 
respond to an incident in any of the twenty-two states where we 
operate. Our emergency response contractors include hazmat specialists 
who are licensed and qualified to respond to incidents involving the 
release or potential release of hazardous materials. Further, these 
contractors are geographically situated such that they can be on-site, 
often with their own emergency response equipment, shortly after an 
accident.

    b. If not, please indicate what payments have been made to date and 
explain the reasons for the ongoing delays regarding any remaining 
reimbursements.
    Answer. As of May 3, 2023, only two of the sixty-seven first-
responder organizations that have submitted claims for reimbursement 
have yet to receive payment because their claims are still being 
processed or require additional information. Certain claims from three 
other organizations have been paid in part, pending calculation of the 
total expense or delivery of back-ordered equipment. All other claims 
have been paid in full.
                                 ______
                                 
     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to 
                             Ian Jefferies
    Question. Mr. Jefferies, your testimony and a recent announcement 
from the Association of American Railroads describe an effort to 
install new wayside hot bearing detectors to reduce spacing on major 
routes to 15 miles. Your testimony also mentioned that the previous 
average had been every 40 miles, but had fallen below that number in 
recent years. Do you have an estimate for what the average spacing is 
nationwide currently? What sort of considerations are made in 
determining a spacing threshold for these wayside detectors? In your 
testimony, you describe the use of data analytics to improve early 
detection of faulty bearing and other rail equipment. Where and how is 
this analysis being deployed, and how does it improve the use of these 
detectors?
    Answer. Freight railroads have long recognized the risk posed by 
hot bearings and have voluntarily installed thousands of hot bearing 
detectors (HBDs) throughout their networks. To drive toward a future 
with zero incidents and injuries and ensure what happened in East 
Palestine never happens again, all Class I railroads have agreed to go 
even further and are immediately installing additional HBDs across 
their key routes, with the goal of achieving an average spacing of 15 
miles, except if the route is equipped with acoustic bearing detectors 
or other similar technology which can ascertain potential problems from 
the noise created by bearings that are starting to fail. In that case, 
HBD spacing will not exceed 20 miles. As a result of this commitment, 
railroads will deploy approximately 1,000 new HBDs.
    The appropriate spacing between HBDs is not a one-sized-fits-all 
approach. Generally speaking, the spacing threshold is designed to 
ensure that coverage is sufficient to provide the necessary level of 
protection. Numerous variables regarding the route are considered, 
including whether the routes is near sensitive waterways or other 
ecological sites or includes timber or other bridges identified by the 
railroad, areas where residential neighborhoods are close to mainline 
track, and other heavy industrial areas or interchange locations that 
generate large carload traffic. Additionally, numerous operational 
factors are taken into account, including the nature and density of the 
traffic, speed restrictions, and utility or maintenance access.
    The Class I railroads have also established a new industry standard 
and other policies related to HBDs. This includes stopping trains and 
inspecting bearings whenever the temperature reading from a HBD exceeds 
170+ above ambient temperature. Inoperative HBDs on key routes will 
also generate critical incident tickets and be prioritized for dispatch 
and repair without undue delay.
    Furthermore, while HBDs have been in use for a long time, 
relatively recent software and data processing advances now allow 
railroads to employ detectors that communicate their readings back to 
their internal networks and to engage in ``trend analysis'' of readings 
from multiple HBDs over time. Analysis of trending data has led to the 
ability to proactively identify bearings that have not yet exceeded 
absolute temperature thresholds but, based on findings of HBD-trending 
data, may become problematic and need to be addressed. Class I 
railroads employ a variety of approaches when analyzing this data and 
are now working collaboratively to identify best practices associated 
with trend analysis to make their programs even more effective at 
proactively detecting potential bearing problems.
    These efforts are reflective of an industry-wide commitment to 
develop complex technologies to ensure safer, more reliable operations 
in the field. For example, freight railroads, in conjunction with AAR 
and its wholly-owned technology subsidiary, Railinc, have established 
the Asset Health Strategic Initiative which includes technology 
products that monitoring the entire railcar life cycle and allow 
railroads and car owners to share information about potential defects 
found by detectors.
    Future railroad efforts to harness technology to improve operations 
and drive safety innovation will be most effective if safety policy is 
well grounded in evidence-based, scientific understanding. Railroads 
respectfully urge policymakers to not ``lock in'' existing technologies 
and processes so that new innovations and technologies that could 
improve safety and efficiency are not stifled. Achieving maximum safety 
benefits requires regulatory flexibility that does not hinder 
innovation, allows railroads to find what works best, and encourages 
railroads to keep investing in those technologies.
