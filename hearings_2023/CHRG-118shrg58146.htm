                         TUESDAY, JUNE 13, 2023

                               U.S. Senate,
           Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion,   
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:26 p.m., in 
room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Jacky Rosen, 
Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Rosen [presiding], Klobuchar, Sinema, 
Hickenlooper, Welch, and Budd.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. [Technical problems]--Senator Budd to the 
Subcommittee and thank him for--[technical problems]--there we 
go. Thank you for agreeing to work with me in a bipartisan way 
to address the critical issues that are so important to our 
workers, our businesses, and our families, not just in both of 
our states, but tourism across the country and, of course, 
around the world.
    And I really look forward to a productive partnership. I 
would also like to thank Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Cruz 
for their leadership and for supporting the work of this 
crucial subcommittee. And so, today's hearing will examine 
Federal implementation of bipartisan travel and tourism 
legislation--the legislation that we enacted during the last 
Congress. Specifically, the Subcommittee will discuss the 
progress in implementing my historic bipartisan Omnibus Travel 
and Tourism Act.
    We like to call it the Tour Bus. It will also look at the 
impact of funding for Brand USA that we have included in the 
March 2022 Government funding package. And it will examine the 
Department of Transportation's implementation of travel and 
tourism policies included in the bipartisan infrastructure law, 
including my bipartisan Tourism Act, among other topics. Last 
Congress, we saw unprecedented action in tourism related 
legislation, led in part thanks to the bipartisan work of this 
subcommittee.
    And today, I look forward to hearing about how the 
Administration is implementing this legislation and fulfilling 
new requirements to enhance the travel and tourism industry, 
particularly through the landmark Omnibus Travel and Tourism 
Act, which I was proud to lead with Senator Wicker. The last 
hearing the Subcommittee held analyzed the Department of 
Commerce then newly published National Travel and Tourism 
Strategy.
    Today, we will also review the progress in implementing the 
strategy, which was released almost exactly a year ago this 
week. The success of all these efforts is critical to the U.S. 
economy, particularly the economy in my state of Nevada. My 
state is a world class destination that relies heavily on 
tourism, and as we know, this industry was devastated by the 
pandemic.
    Since then, and thanks to our efforts, our tourism industry 
began to bounce back last year to near pre-pandemic levels. The 
economic impacts of Nevada's tourism industry are driven by 
visitors spending on hotel rooms, dining, shopping, local 
transportation, live entertainment, and more.
    And that spending directly supports jobs, wages, and 
economic activity, and it ripples through our entire economy in 
the state of Nevada. This means economic activity for small 
businesses and entrepreneurs that rely on visitors coming to 
our state. It is why I have been pleased to see that what we 
are doing to strengthen this industry is working.
    In 2022, visitor spending hit an all-time high of nearly 
$45 billion, exceeding pre-pandemic levels. Total spending by 
visitors during 2022 outpaced the previous year by about 24 
percent, and it outpaced the 2019 total by about 21 percent. 
And 2023 has been a success story so far as well.
    We are seeing a mix of headliners and marquee special 
events coming to my great state of Nevada, from NASCAR to 
Taylor Swift, to the NCAA tournament, college basketball games. 
And all of that paired with robust convention in the month of 
March that included CONEXPO-CON/AGG, our trade show, which is--
happens to be North America's largest construction trade show 
with over 140,000 attendees.
    Want to brag some more in Nevada, because Nevada is also 
becoming a global center of sports. We are hosting the Super 
Bowl next year. We are the proud home of the WNBA champs, the 
Las Vegas Aces. And tonight, our Golden Knights have the chance 
to bring home the Stanley Cup. And I am just going to put this 
out there, go, Knights, go. I have to do it.
    Anyway, this November will also see Nevada host the Formula 
One Las Vegas Grand Prix, the largest international sporting 
event ever to take place in our state. And such--as such, it is 
my responsibility in this subcommittee to ensure the bipartisan 
tourism and travel legislation we passed last Congress is being 
implemented and supporting workers and the industry as we 
intended.
    However, the full recovery of international travel, 
particularly from Asia, continues to challenge the industry in 
Nevada and across the country. The International Trade 
Administration's National Travel and Tourism Office forecast 
the total volume of international visitation to the U.S. to 
increase to nearly 63 million visitors in 2023. It is up 21 
percent from 2022, but still below 80 percent of the 2019 pre-
pandemic visitation level.
    So, we need to find our ways to bring back those 
international travelers, and I look forward to discussing how 
some of the legislation from last Congress is supporting the 
recovery of international travel and what additional barriers 
remain.
    So, testifying today, we have Brian Beall, Acting Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Travel and Tourism, and Director of the 
National Travel and Tourism Office at the Department of 
Commerce. Welcome. We have Carol Annie Petsonk. Am I saying 
that right? Petsonk, very good. Assistant Secretary for 
Aviation and International Affairs at the U.S. Department of 
Transportation. Welcome. And Christopher Thompson, President 
and CEO of Brand USA. Welcome. Thank you all for being here.
    I look forward to hearing from each of you, and hearing 
your experiences and your expertise as we review the 
implementation of tourism policies enacted last Congress. And 
now, I am going to turn it over to Ranking Member Budd for his 
opening statement, and then I will introduce our first witness. 
Senator Budd.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED BUDD, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Budd. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, everyone, 
for being here and for the panelists. I am excited to be 
kicking off our first tourism, trade, and export promotion 
hearing of the year, as well as my first hearing as the Ranking 
Member alongside our Chair, Jacky Rosen.
    When I first came to the Senate, she told me this would be 
a wonderful subcommittee to be part of. Not only did I know 
that, but it would be a wonderful one to lead as well. So, 
thank you for convening this hearing on the oversight and 
implementation of travel and tourism.
    I am honored to serve as the Ranking Member of this 
subcommittee, and I am honored to be advancing policies that 
bolster our Nation's travel industry and its economic impact. 
The travel and tourism sector is a vital component of the 
American economy, supporting millions of jobs and contributing 
significantly to the local, State, and national economies.
    The COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges to 
all industries, but none were so uniquely impacted like the 
countless tourism businesses and travel reliant communities 
across our great nation. As we continue in our recovery, it is 
crucial that we consider the long-term strategies to strengthen 
and revitalize this critical sector and make it more 
competitive globally.
    Last Congress, several pieces of bipartisan travel and 
tourism specific legislation were signed into law, and it is 
essential that we exercise effective oversight to ensure 
efficient and proper implementation of these provisions, 
especially those before the Department of Transportation.
    The Tourism Act directs the DOT to update the National 
Travel and Tourism Infrastructure Strategic Plan, taking into 
account the specific needs of regions, including my home state 
of North Carolina. North Carolina boasts a rich cultural 
heritage, breathtaking landscapes, and vibrant communities that 
attract visitors from around the world. Ensuring that our 
state's unique tourism assets are fully considered in the 
strategic plan will benefit both North Carolina and the broader 
travel industry.
    Moreover, we must seize the opportunity to leverage 
technology to enhance the travel experience and promote 
efficiency. Investing in modernized and secure infrastructure, 
including advanced airports and reliable broadband connectivity 
will enable travelers to explore our Nation seamlessly, while 
creating jobs and economic growth.
    I hope the Subcommittee also looks at potential chokepoints 
within the travel landscape like excessive tourism visa wait 
times and backlogged passport processing. By collaborating 
across party lines and harnessing the potential of our unique 
destinations and vibrant tourism economy, we can ensure that 
the United States remains a premier travel and tourism 
destination.
    Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Senator Budd, and welcome again 
to the Subcommittee. I would like to introduce our first 
witness now, Brian Beall, who serves as the Acting Deputy 
Secretary for Travel and Tourism and the Director of the 
National Travel and Tourism Office.
    In these positions, Mr. Beall leads a team working to 
enhance the international competitiveness of the U.S. travel 
and tourism industry and maintain America's status as a top 
destination for international visitors. Mr. Beall, thank you 
for being here, and I recognize you for your opening statement.

       STATEMENT OF BRIAN BEALL, ACTING DEPUTY ASSISTANT

         SECRETARY FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM AND DIRECTOR,

              NATIONAL TRAVEL AND TOURISM OFFICE,

                  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

    Mr. Beall. Chair Rosen, Ranking Member Budd, and members of 
the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to update you 
on the state of the U.S. travel and tourism industry, progress 
on the National Travel and Tourism Strategy, and implementation 
of the Visit America Act. And thank you for your leadership on 
travel and tourism issues. Travel and tourism is an engine of 
prosperity for Americans and communities across the United 
States.
    All 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories 
all benefit directly or indirectly from domestic travel and 
international visitation, and the United States has long been a 
top destination for global travelers. The pandemic related 
declines in the travel and tourism industry were unprecedented.
    While the industry has weathered many natural disasters and 
unforeseen events that curtailed travel in the past, never has 
the sector lost so much economic output virtually overnight. 
U.S. travel and tourism exports declined by 65 percent, and 4.3 
million travel and tourism jobs were lost from 2019 to 2020.
    Fortunately, traveling tourism is on a path to recovery, as 
the world moves beyond the pandemic, economies rebound, and 
more people are traveling. Businesses are working hard to 
recapture lost markets, and the United States remains a top 
aspirational destination for prospective international 
travelers, thanks in part to the ongoing efforts of Brand USA.
    In 2021, total U.S. travel and tourism output increased to 
$1.7 trillion, and the number of jobs supported by travel and 
tourism increased to 7.4 million. After major pandemic related 
travel restrictions between the United States and other 
countries ended in November 2021, international visitation to 
the United States more than doubled to over 50 million in 2022 
and spending by international travelers in the United States 
rose to more than $164 billion.
    The travel and tourism industry provides jobs with good 
wages and benefits, consistent with President Biden's bottom 
up, middle out approach to the economy. But much work remains 
to be done to fully recover and build a resilient travel and 
tourism industry, and that includes creating and sustaining 
even more good paying jobs.
    This was the goal when the Federal Government came together 
through the Interagency Tourism Policy Council, led by 
Commerce, to develop the 2022 National Travel and Tourism 
Strategy, to bring a whole of Government approach to increasing 
American jobs and growing the economy through travel, tourism, 
and outdoor recreation, and to support a more robust and 
sustainable industry moving forward.
    The Strategy establishes a 5-year goal of attracting 90 
million visitors who are estimated to spend $279 billion 
annually. The work of the Strategy is organized around four 
pillars. First, promoting the United States as a travel 
destination. Two, facilitating travel to and within the United 
States.
    Three, ensuring diverse, inclusive, and accessible tourism 
experiences. And four, fostering resilient and sustainable 
travel and tourism. As we mark the one-year anniversary of the 
Strategy, we are on track to reach the overarching visitation 
and spending goal by 2027. Commerce continues to coordinate the 
whole of Government approach through the Tourism Policy Council 
to advance progress under the Strategy's four pillars.
    As examples, to promote the United States as a destination, 
Commerce is leading an initiative with the Department of State 
at U.S. missions and top international visitor markets to 
coordinate local U.S. Government efforts to promote travel to 
the United States. To facilitate travel to and within the 
United States, State has made progress in reducing visa 
interview wait times at U.S. embassies and consulates around 
the world as travel demand has surged.
    To ensure diverse, inclusive, and accessible tourism 
experiences, Federal agencies are working together to expand 
and improve access for travelers with disabilities and to 
communicate more clearly to travelers what accessibility 
resources are available. To foster resilient and sustainable 
travel and tourism, Federal agencies are working to educate 
stakeholders on how to strengthen resilience to climate change 
and extreme weather events.
    On June 7, the Tourism Policy Council convenes to further 
focus efforts on advancing work under the Strategy in year two. 
Private sector recommendations from the U.S. Travel and Tourism 
Advisory Board will continue to help guide the Tourism Policy 
Council's efforts and support the private and public sectors 
working together to increase the value and volume of travel and 
tourism as outlined in the Strategy.
    Finally, Commerce thanks the Subcommittee for its role in 
the enactment of the Visit America Act. Commerce is committed 
to implementing the Act's provisions as swiftly as possible.
    However, Commerce will need additional appropriations from 
Congress to ensure the successful implementation. Accordingly, 
the President's 2024 budget included nearly $3.5 million for 
Commerce's International Trade Administration to support the 
creation of a new travel and tourism business unit, which will 
be overseen by the Assistant Secretary for Travel and Tourism 
established in the Act.
    The budget request also includes $1.5 million for the 
Bureau of Economic Analysis to meet expanded research 
activities enumerated in the Act. In summary, Commerce really 
appreciates the opportunity to update the Subcommittee on the 
state of the U.S. Travel and Tourism industry, and to provide 
an overview of progress made to achieve the goals of the 
Strategy.
    Through continued public, private sector collaboration, we 
will expand opportunities from travelers from around the world 
to meet the people and visit the places that make the United 
States a truly unrivaled destination. Thank you for having me 
here today, and I look forward to your questions. Thank you.

 Prepared Statement of Brian Beall, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary 
   for Travel and Tourism and Director, National Travel and Tourism 
                  Office, U.S. Department of Commerce
    Chair Rosen, Ranking Member Budd, and members of the Subcommittee,

(FY) 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Commerce is committed to 
implementing the Act's provisions as swiftly as possible. However, 
Commerce will need additional appropriations from Congress to ensure 
the successful implementation of the Act.
    Accordingly, the President's 2024 Budget included nearly $3.5 
million in funding for Commerce's International Trade Administration to 
support the creation of a new Travel and Tourism business unit, which 
would be overseen by the Assistant Secretary for Travel and Tourism 
established in the Act. The Budget Request also includes $1.5 million 
for Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis to meet expanded research 
activities enumerated in the Act.
    In summary, Commerce appreciates the opportunity to update the 
Subcommittee on the state of the U.S. travel and tourism industry and 
to provide an overview of progress made to achieve the goals of the 
National Strategy. Through continued public-private sector 
collaboration, we will expand opportunities for travelers from around 
the world to meet the people and visit the places that make the United 
States a truly unrivaled destination.
    Thank you for having me here today. I look forward to answering 
your questions.

    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Mr. Beall. Testifying next is 
Annie Petsonk, who serves at the U.S. Department of 
Transportation as Assistant Secretary for Aviation and 
International Affairs.
    Ms. Petsonk is a recognized expert on international 
aviation and has previously served in the Office of the U.S. 
Trade Representative in the Executive Office of the President, 
and the Department of Justice, and at the United Nations. Ms. 
Petsonk, thank you for being here, and I recognize you for your 
opening remarks.

           STATEMENT OF CAROL A. (``ANNIE'') PETSONK,

           ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION FOR

              AVIATION AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS,

               U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

    Ms. Petsonk. Thank you, Chair Rosen, Ranking Member Budd, 
members of the Subcommittee, for inviting me here today to talk 
about the Department of Transportation's support of travel and 
tourism infrastructure, and about our progress on the National 
Travel and Tourism Infrastructure Strategic Plan. Thank you 
also for your support of U.S. travel and tourism.
    My name is Annie Petsonk. I am Assistant Secretary for 
Aviation and International Affairs at the Department of 
Transportation. In addition to travel and tourism, my office 
carries a broad portfolio of responsibilities, including the 
economic regulatory aspects of domestic and international 
aviation, the Department's engagement in international 
transportation and trade, and a range of other international 
cooperation and facilitation issues.
    The bipartisan infrastructure law makes historic 
investments in our Nation's infrastructure and competitiveness, 
with meaningful benefits for travel and tourism infrastructure 
across all 50 states, U.S. territories, and tribal communities. 
Across the country, we have already begun improvement on 3,700 
bridges and almost 70,000 miles of roads and highways, and we 
have funded over a thousand zero emissions busses and awarded 
over $233 million in grants to improve and modernize vital 
intercity passenger rail across the country.
    The Federal Aviation Administration has also announced 
nearly $2 billion in funding under the bipartisan 
infrastructure law that will go to 175 airports across the 
country to improve terminals of all sizes, expand capacity, and 
provide greater accessibility. Travel and tourism are on a path 
to recovery.
    Memorial Day weekend saw the highest volume of air 
passenger travel since any time before COVID, and cancellations 
remained under 1 percent. We are also seeing increases in 
highway, bus, and train travel over the last year, as well as a 
50 percent increase in cruise bookings over 2022.
    We fully recognize that some segments of the U.S. travel 
market have already recovered from the pandemic, while other 
market segments, such as business travel and international 
inbound travel, have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. I 
come from a small town in Pennsylvania, Altoona, Pennsylvania, 
and our major tourist attractions in my hometown, from the 
world famous horseshoe curve on the railroad, to our beautiful 
mountains and rivers, almost as beautiful as Western North 
Carolina, not quite, form a vital part of the warp and weft of 
our local economy.
    I have had the good fortune to spend magical time in the 
national parks and spectacular settings in each of the states 
represented on this subcommittee. Including a great week in Las 
Vegas when my brother was singing in the World Barbershop 
Harmony Society Championships, which I--they are really fun. I 
heartily recommend.
    So, I know from my personal experience the importance of 
tourism in connecting communities and driving thriving 
economies. That is why I am grateful for the opportunity to 
play a role in implementing aspects of the bipartisan 
infrastructure law that will help grow tourism in the United 
States.
    The Department is a member of the Tourism Policy Council 
that the Department of Commerce leads, charged with the whole 
of Government effort to ensure that the national interest in 
travel and tourism is fully considered in Federal 
decisionmaking.
    Through our participation in the Tourism Policy Council, we 
supported the Department of Commerce's development of the 2022 
National Travel and Tourism Strategy, and I would particularly 
like to thank you, Chair Rosen, for your leadership on travel 
and tourism related provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure 
law, including Section 25018, which requires the Department to 
update the National Travel and Tourism Infrastructure Strategic 
Plan.
    Earlier this year, we established a department wide travel 
and tourism steering committee. We also appointed the Director 
of the Office of International Transportation and Trade in my 
office, a senior executive on my team, as the Department's 
Chief Travel and Tourism Officer.
    Her office is working closely with the Travel and Tourism 
Steering Committee on the drafting of the National Travel and 
Tourism Infrastructure Strategic Plan. Earlier this month, on 
June 2nd, we also published a request for comment, seeking to 
gather input on a variety of matters, including data to inform 
this strategic plan. Our goal is to complete the new plan as 
expeditiously as possible this year.
    My office is also responsible, as I mentioned, for the 
economic side of aviation policy. And our efforts there are 
aimed at facilitating the substantial economic contributions 
that civil aviation makes to the U.S. economy, including for 
tourism. We also supervise the Essential Air Service Program 
and Small Community Air Service Development Program.
    These programs help connect smaller and rural communities 
to the national air transportation system. Internationally, my 
office is the primary arm of the Department of Transportation 
for developing international aviation policy and implementing 
the U.S. Open Skies policy.
    We have over 130 Open Skies partners around the world, and 
in the last few months, we have added Mongolia, Angola, and 
Moldova to that number. The Department of Transportation looks 
forward to continuing to work with the Subcommittee to ensure 
that America's travel and tourism sectors remain vibrant and 
valued. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.

    of Transportation for Aviation and International Affairs, U.S. 
                      Department of Transportation

    The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law or BIL, makes historic 
investments in our Nation's infrastructure and competitiveness, with 
meaningful benefits for travel and tourism infrastructure across all 50 
states, U.S. territories, and tribal communities. Across the country, 
we have already begun improvement on 3,700 bridges and almost 70,000

emission buses and awarded over $233 million in grants to improve and 
modernize vital intercity passenger rail service across the country. 
The FAA has also announced nearly $2 billion in BIL funding that will 
go to 175 airports across the country to improve terminals of all 
sizes, expand capacity, and provide greater accessibility.
    Fortunately, travel and tourism are on a path to recovery. Memorial 
Day weekend saw the highest volume of air passenger travel since any 
time before COVID, and cancellations remained under one-percent. We are 
also seeing increases in highway, bus, and train travel over last year 
as well as a 50 percent increase in cruise bookings over 2022. We fully 
recognize that some segments of the U.S. travel market have already 
recovered from the recent pandemic, while other market segments, such 
as business and international inbound travel, have not yet returned to 
pre-pandemic levels.
    I come from a small town, Altoona, Pennsylvania, whose major 
tourist attractions, from the railroad's world-famous Horseshoe Curve 
to our beautiful mountains and rivers, form a vital part of the warp 
and weft of our local economy. I have had the good fortune to spend

    My office is also responsible for the economic side of aviation 
policy--both domestically and internationally. Our efforts are aimed at 
facilitating the substantial economic contributions that civil aviation 
makes to the U.S. economy, including for tourism.
    Domestically, the Essential Air Service Program and Small Community 
Air Service Development Program help connect smaller and rural 
communities in the United States to the national air transportation

opportunities through their hub airport or airports, have access to 
medical care and educational opportunities, and visit family and 
friends.
    Internationally, my office is the primary arm within the Department 
of Transportation for the development of international aviation policy 
and implementation of the U.S. Open Skies policy in order to promote 
competition and create options for travelers, airlines, working people, 
and shippers while advancing strong labor standards here and abroad. We 
have over 130 Open Skies partners around the word and, in the last few 
months, have added Mongolia, Angola and Moldova to that number.
    The Department of Transportation looks forward to continuing to 
work with the Subcommittee to ensure that America's travel and tourism 
sectors remain vibrant and valued. Thank you for the opportunity to 
speak with you today.

    Senator Rosen. Thank you. And thank you for mentioning our 
states. Every single state in this Nation has someplace 
beautiful and wonderful to travel to, and we want to make sure 
that they can get there.
    And so, testifying next for the second time before this 
subcommittee is Mr. Christopher Thompson. Welcome. He is 
President and CEO for Brand USA, the Nation's public, private 
partnership dedicated to increasing international visitation to 
the United States through marketing and promotional efforts.
    Mr. Thompson has over 30 years of experience in the travel 
and tourism industry, and under his leadership, Brand USA has 
nearly tripled its partnership network and more than doubled 
its partner contribution program offering. Mr. Thompson, you 
are recognized for your opening remarks.

STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER L. THOMPSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, BRAND 
                              USA

    Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Chairwoman Rosen, 
Ranking Member Budd, members of the Subcommittee, thank you for 
holding this important hearing on oversight and implementation 
of travel and tourism legislation.
    I appreciate being here to testify on behalf of Brand USA, 
as you said, a destination marketing organization for the 
United States. As you also said, I last testified before this 
subcommittee in May 2021 during the height of the pandemic. At 
that hearing, I spoke to the devastating effect COVID-19 had on 
communities, on businesses, and employees that rely on tourism 
dollars, especially those spent by international visitors.
    I also testified to the debilitating impact the pandemic 
had on Brand USA's funding model, which is made up of 
contributions from non-Federal sources, like State tourism 
offices and travel brands, and matched by funds from ESTA fees 
paid by visa waiver travelers during the prior Fiscal Year.
    In July 2021, the Restore Brand USA Act was introduced with 
bipartisan support in both chambers of Congress. The text of 
that bill was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act 
of 2022, became law, and for that, I thank you for your 
leadership and your support. This extraordinary funding 
continues to allow Brand USA to maintain our business 
operations, rebuild our global infrastructure, and lead a 
concerted recovery effort to welcome the world back to the 
United States.
    The recovery of the U.S. travel and tourism industries' 
lucrative international segment is on a solid upward 
trajectory. According to preliminary estimates from the 
National Travel and Tourism Office, the USA welcomed 51.8 
million visitors in 2022, which is a 134 percent increase over 
2021, and total international arrivals to the USA that year 
reached 65 percent of 2019 levels.
    Tourism economics predicts that total--the total number of 
international arrivals to the United States will reach 81 
percent of 2019 levels this year, and we should surpass 2019 
figures by the end of 2025, with some markets like Canada, 
India, and the UK exceeding 2019 numbers next year.
    While we plan to hasten the return to pre-pandemic levels 
in traditional source markets and forge new paths for our 
industry and new markets, we need to get to those levels of 
recovery and set our course for a longer term future. My 
optimism is fed by my 40 years, I need to update my bio, in 
destination marketing, as well as our proprietary market 
intelligence, which shows consumer likelihood to travel to the 
United States in the next 12 months at equal or greater than 
levels in 2019.
    But while these statistics and forecasts are encouraging, 
there is much work to be done to keep the USA top of mind and 
create a sense of urgency for consumers to visit the USA now. 
To move consumers more quickly from aspiration to action, Brand 
USA recently launched a new campaign in ten key markets.
    The campaign showcases how the USA delivers on the promise 
that whoever you want to be and whatever experience you long 
for, the United States is where you can find it. We also 
created opportunities that allow communities throughout the 
country to connect directly with overseas travelers and 
distribution channels.
    These efforts are particularly helpful to those 
destinations that otherwise lack the resources to maintain an 
ongoing international presence. In just one example, next month 
I will lead the last of five sales missions this year.
    This upcoming mission to Japan and South Korea features 
several dozen participants from major gateways to Asia, like 
Chicago, Las Vegas, Seattle, as well as cities in states like 
Memphis, Minnesota, Texas, and Wyoming. Finally, package travel 
remains a critical distribution channel globally, and we 
maintain boots on the ground in 20 markets to ensure that the 
travel trade has the resources to drive new visitation not only 
to, but through and beyond our gateways.
    I am barely able to scratch the surface of all Brand USA's 
current marketing efforts. Today I am submitting on the record 
our annual report for Fiscal Year 2022, and our Fiscal Year 
2023 Objectives and Business Plan. While I am optimistic, 
international inbound travel is on track for complete recovery, 
I am also acutely aware of the significant headwinds and--that 
have potential to stifle this growth.
    Some obstacles like global inflation, a strong dollar, the 
geopolitical uncertainty can be--can only be overcome with 
time. Other barriers like limited air capacity or long wait 
times for first time visa applicant interviews require more 
urgent solutions. Global competition to attract travelers is 
fierce, and Government and industry must work together to make 
travel to the United States a lot easier.
    As the international travel and tourism sector regains its 
footing, we will surpass pre-pandemic levels of visitation and 
spending, and lay the groundwork for the long term future of 
our industry, we will aspire collectively toward the goals of 
the National Travel and Tourism Strategy, and we will drive new 
opportunity and vitality in communities throughout this great 
nation.
    Thank you, and I appreciate the opportunity to testify with 
you today, and I look forward to answering any questions that 
you might have about the public, private partnership we have 
together. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Thompson follows:]

   Prepared Statement of Christopher L. Thompson, President and CEO, 
                               Brand USA
    Chairwoman Rosen, Ranking Member Budd, and Members of The 
Subcommittee:

    Thank you for holding this important hearing on oversight and 
implementation of travel and tourism legislation, and I appreciate the 
opportunity to testify on behalf of Brand USA, the destination 
marketing organization for the United States.
    I last testified before this Subcommittee in May 2021 during the 
height of the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, international inbound 
tourism to the United States was largely at a standstill, our borders 
were closed to would-be travelers from our largest and most lucrative 
source markets, and there was no clear indication when the USA would 
reopen for business--or what restrictions would be imposed on visitors 
when it did.
    At that hearing, I testified to the devastating effect COVID-19 had 
on communities, businesses, and employees that rely on tourism dollars, 
especially those spent by international visitors. I also testified to 
the debilitating impact the pandemic had on Brand USA's funding model, 
which is made up of contributions from non-federal sources like state 
tourism offices and travel brands, and matching funds from ESTA fees 
paid by visa waiver travelers during the prior Fiscal Year.
    In July 2021, the ``Restoring Brand USA Act'' was introduced with 
bipartisan support in both chambers. The bill made available $250 
million in extraordinary funding to buttress Brand USA's finances with 
funds drawn from ESTA collections between 2010 and 2020 that exceeded 
the maximum $100 million available to Brand USA in each of those years. 
The text of that bill was included in the ``Consolidated Appropriations 
Act of 2022'' and became law.
    This dedicated funding continues to allow Brand USA to maintain 
business operations, rebuild our global infrastructure, and lead a 
concerted recovery effort to welcome the world back to the United 
States.
    The recovery of the U.S. travel and tourism industry's lucrative 
international segment is on a solid upward trajectory. In 2022, most 
source markets saw growth in travel that was double the rates of 2021, 
with total international arrivals to the USA reaching 65 percent of 
2019 levels and long-haul travel 60 percent. According to preliminary 
estimates from the National Travel and Tourism Office, the USA welcomed 
51.8 million visitors in 2022, a 134 percent increase from 2021.
    Tourism Economics predicts the total number of international 
arrivals to the United States will reach 81 percent of 2019 levels this 
year and we should surpass 2019 figures by the end of 2025, with some 
markets like Canada, India, and the United Kingdom exceeding 2019 
numbers as soon as next year. We plan to hasten the return to pre-
pandemic levels in traditional source markets and forge new paths for 
our industry in new markets to get beyond recovery and set a course for 
the longer-term future. My optimism is fed by my 40 years in 
destination marketing, as well as our proprietary market intelligence, 
which shows consumer likelihood to travel to the United States in the 
next twelve months is equal to or greater than 2019 responses.
    But while these statistics and forecasts are encouraging, there is 
much work to be done to keep the USA top of mind and create a sense of 
urgency for consumers to visit the USA now.
    To move consumers more quickly from aspiration to action, Brand USA 
recently launched a new campaign in ten key global markets. The 
campaign showcases how the USA delivers on the promise that whoever you 
want to be and whatever experience you long for, the United States is 
where you can find it. To capture attention and convert into travel 
booking, we serve up content that features both iconic and lesser-known 
destinations and attractions, from the best places to taste local 
cuisine to stepping into the song lyrics or movie locations that first 
inspired a visit.
    We also create platforms and programs to allow communities 
throughout the country to connect directly with overseas travelers and 
distribution channels. These efforts are particularly helpful to those 
destinations that otherwise lack the resources or bandwidth to maintain 
an ongoing international presence. In just one example, next month I 
will be leading our fifth of five sales missions this year. This 
upcoming mission to Japan and Korea features several dozen 
participants, from major gateways to Asia like Chicago, Las Vegas, and 
Seattle, as well as cities and states like Memphis, Minnesota, Texas, 
and Wyoming.
    Finally, packaged travel remains a critical distribution channel 
globally, and we maintain boots on the ground in 20 markets to ensure 
the travel trade has the resources and connections to drive new 
visitation to the USA. In addition to time-tested strategies like 
travel agent training and familiarization tours, we have delved fully 
into developing itineraries that tour operators can offer directly to 
their customers. Our ``Road Trips USA'' program features dozens of 
itineraries anchored where the planes land and visiting a plethora of 
places beyond the gateways-including many lesser-known destinations and 
experiences that are not always tied into global distribution networks. 
This year we are working with over 65 major global tour operators to 
promote these itineraries.
    Again, I'd note that none of our ongoing marketing initiatives 
could be as quickly deployed, widespread, or robust without the 
leadership of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board, this 
Subcommittee, and our champions from both parties in both chambers who 
support the work we've done over the past twelve years and supported 
the ``Restoring Brand USA Act.''
    I'm barely able to scratch the surface of all of Brand USA's 
current marketing efforts today. I am submitting our Annual Report for 
FY 2022 and our FY 2023 Objectives and Business Plan for the record. 
[Reports can be found at: https://www.

    While I'm optimistic international inbound travel is on track 
towards complete recovery within the next two years, I am also acutely 
aware of the significant headwinds which have the potential to stifle 
this growth.
    Some obstacles like global inflation, a strong dollar, and 
geopolitical uncertainty can only be overcome with time. Other barriers 
include limited air service capacity, especially in Asia. Policy issues 
like long wait times for first-time visa applicant interviews or the 
COVID-19 vaccine requirement that was just rescinded a month ago 
require more challenging solutions. Global competition to attract 
travelers is fierce and government and industry must work together to 
make travel to the United States easier.
    Over the next few years, large-scale international events and 
celebrations of our own national history will give the USA an even 
greater opportunity to shine on the world stage. America's 
semiquincentennial, the 100th anniversary of Route 66, and FIFA World 
Cup will take place across the United States in 2026, with high 
potential to host Expo 2027 in Bloomington, Minnesota, and the Olympic 
games in Los Angeles in 2028. Brand USA is committed to working with 
our partners across the travel and tourism industry, government, and 
others to promote these iconic events--but until then, we must continue 
to work collaboratively to realize the economic benefits that come from 
meetings and conventions, business travel, the family vacation, and 
even solo adventures.
    As the travel and tourism sector regains its footing, we will 
surpass pre-pandemic levels of visitation and spending and lay the 
groundwork for the long-term future of our industry. We will aspire 
collectively for the goals of the National Travel and Tourism Strategy, 
and we will drive new opportunity and vitality in communities 
throughout our great country.

    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Mr. Thompson. Well, we are just 
going to jump right into it. And I am going to recognize myself 
for 5 minutes, and then we will recognize Senator Budd.
    So we are going to obviously jump right into the strategic 
plan because the Infrastructure Investment Jobs Act that we 
signed into law in 2021 did include my bipartisan Tourism Act, 
which requires the U.S. Department of Transportation, as you 
have been speaking to, to update its National Travel and 
Tourism Infrastructure Strategic Plan, and develop an immediate 
term and a long term strategy for DOT and other agencies to use 
infrastructure to support the travel that the tourism industry 
needs in the wake of the pandemic, which we know decimated 
travel and tourism jobs all across this country.
    The law requires a strategic plan to be updated within 180 
days of enactment of the law. It has been nearly 600 days since 
the IIJA was signed into law and more than a year since the 
Department of Commerce released its National Travel and Tourism 
Strategy, and we haven't seen an updated National Travel and 
Tourism Infrastructure Strategic Plan from DOT.
    On September 27 of last year, several of my colleagues 
joined me in sending a letter to Secretary Buttigieg asking the 
Department to comply with the law and fulfill the requirement 
to update the strategic plan.
    But nearly 9 months later, the plan hasn't been updated. So 
Assistant Secretary Petsonk, when is DOT going to update the 
National Travel and Tourism Infrastructure Strategic Plan--that 
is a long mouthful, we need to get an acronym for that--and why 
hasn't it done so yet? And how can we help the Department 
comply with this requirement as mandated by law?
    Ms. Petsonk. Thank you, Senator Rosen. And I just want to 
emphasize that we fully agree that travel and tourism are key 
to our Nation's economy, and they are key to our work at the 
Department of Transportation. Immediately after the enactment 
of the IIJA, the Department focused very intensively on 
establishing a sound process for selecting projects and 
delivering the historic funding for infrastructure that will 
improve the efficiency and safety of our Nation's 
transportation system and improve the experience of travelers.
    As the GAO report pointed out, there are 26 different 
programs that either directly ask applicants to indicate how 
the program will--how their project will support travel and 
tourism, or that overall support travel and tourism, and that 
is $73 billion, according to the GAO report, that is in 
entrained there.
    So, we were focused on getting our systems together as 
quickly as possible for selecting projects and delivering on 
that funding. We also worked closely with the Department of 
Commerce, including the National Tourism Strategy and the whole 
of Government approach that the Department of Commerce has put 
forward.
    My office earlier this year assumed responsibility for 
developing the National Travel and Tourism Infrastructure 
Strategic Plan. We worked very quickly to form a steering 
committee within the Department to collaborate and generate 
expert advice.
    And we felt that we needed more information on what data 
sources are available to inform the development of the 
infrastructure strategic plan, and that is why we published the 
request for comments, the notice to interested public and 
private sector groups and individuals to help us get more 
information about the data that is available and other 
information that could inform the plan. So that process is 
underway.
    We are committed to keeping a close touch with you and 
other committee members as we work to complete that plan this 
year.
    Senator Rosen. So, you have an anticipated completion date 
by the end of this year?
    Ms. Petsonk. Yes.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. In the minute or so I have left 
before I turn it over, can you talk about, as you contemplate 
the strategy, some of the ways the Department plans to support 
tourism essential congested highways? We have them all across 
this country. It is like my I-15 in Nevada, which happens to be 
the only major connection between Southern California and Las 
Vegas. And so, can you speak a little bit about what you are 
doing for highways?
    Ms. Petsonk. Sure. And I can refer you to our Federal 
Highways Administration for more detail. But looking just at I-
15 between Nevada and California, Caltrans has approved an 
expansion to allow traffic to move on the shoulder.
    That project is moving forward. The Nevada side of that 
project has already been completed, and we estimate that by 
middle of next year that project will be completed on the 
California side. We understand it is very congested, 
particularly on Sundays and Mondays.
    Senator Rosen. Yes. Thank you. Senator Budd.
    Senator Budd. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Beall, I would 
just want to confirm the pronunciation of your name.
    Mr. Beall. Yes, it is Beall.
    Senator Budd. Beall, great. Thank you. Mr. Beall, according 
to the U.S. Travel Association, first time visitors from large 
countries like India and Brazil, they have had wait times, as I 
understand it, and I hear a lot of this in our State offices, 
but they have wait times on average for a visa interview, 400 
days.
    You know, that is a sign that something is not working 
right. These are long times. These long times are becoming a 
factor for potential tourists when choosing a vacation 
destination. So, are we losing out to other countries with 
quicker visa turnaround times?
    Mr. Beall. Thank you, Ranking Member Budd, for your 
question. The Commerce Department certainly recognizes the 
importance of being able to access visas for travel to the 
United States as we continue to look to recover the travel and 
tourism industry.
    We are focused on looking at how we can facilitate travel 
to and within the United States through the National Travel and 
Tourism Strategy, and we are working very closely with our 
colleagues at the Department of State and the Department of 
Homeland Security. I would defer to them for more specifics on 
the activities they are engaged in to address visa interview 
wait times around the world.
    But I do know they are making progress, and there has just 
been such a huge demand for visas overseas, in India, as you 
did mention. But I just want to underscore that we are working 
very closely with the Department of State and Homeland Security 
through the National Travel and Tourism Strategy.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. Mr. Thompson, in May, the Biden 
Administration lifted the vaccine requirement and the last of 
the COVID era travel restrictions. How did the Federal 
Government's COVID restriction impact international inbound 
travel and our ability to attract international visitors, 
particularly in relation to other countries that didn't have 
their COVID restrictions last that long? Thank you.
    Mr. Thompson. Senator, certainly, as we went into and were 
in the middle of and coming out of the pandemic, there were a 
lot of barriers to being able to restore international travel. 
And that was the last one. When it was still in place, it did 
cause some hesitation and probably a lack of travel to the 
United States.
    And certainly, since then, the demand of international, 
particularly transient leisure travel, has been greater than 
probably in the history of the country. This has never been a 
demand issue. It has always been about the inability for people 
to travel. So, we are confident that we are going to get back 
to levels that, as it relates to transient leisure, quicker 
than most of the forecasts.
    You know, as we discussed, Asia is a little still 
challenged right now. And until we get a return of Asia, 
particularly China, we won't have full recovery. But on all the 
major markets, other than that, we are seeing some pretty 
significant recovery. And we were very thankful that that final 
vaccine requirement was relaxed.
    Senator Budd. So now that the restrictions have been 
lifted, how does Brand USA plan to use the emergency funding 
that they received in Fiscal Year 2022 in the omnibus to 
restore U.S. inbound travel market to pre-COVID levels?
    Mr. Thompson. Well, I will tell you, this funding has 
allowed us to get back to market quicker than we would have 
been able in our own means. Our funding source, as I stated 
earlier, was compromised.
    When we weren't--when the world was not traveling, then 
people weren't applying for visa waiver travel and therefore 
the funding source was cut down, cut back. So, I will tell you 
that we are back to market.
    As I said in my testimony, we just launched a ten market 
consumer campaign in greater levels than we have ever done in 
our entire history, and that would not have been possible 
without the additional funding that we received from Department 
of Commerce.
    So, our message about the diversity of geography 
experiences and people delivering those experiences, and the 
unique nature of any experience you might be able to have 
somewhere else in the world that you can only have here in the 
U.S., is the story that we are now telling in very compelling 
ways.
    And I would say in the absence of the funding that was 
provided, we would not be able to do what we are doing right 
now.
    Senator Budd. Thank you.
    Mr. Thompson. Yes, sir.
    Senator Budd. Mr. Petsonk, in my remaining time, and 
perhaps we could go back to a little later if you need, in your 
testimony, you mentioned the 2022 National Travel and Tourism 
Strategy. That Strategy discusses facilitating travel to the 
U.S. as a key goal to attract 90 million international visitors 
annually by 2027.
    Are there proposals you are aware of to make passing 
through airports more efficient while still maintaining 
required levels of security in order to facilitate more travel? 
And is there a role for new technologies to play here?
    Ms. Petsonk. Thank you for your question, Senator Budd. We 
are very much aware of the issue that you have raised, and we 
are working with the Department of Commerce, also with the 
Department of Homeland Security and the State Department on 
those issues, and we will continue to work in that whole of 
Government approach.
    Senator Budd. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. Are you ready, Senator Klobuchar? 
I am going to----
    Senator Klobuchar. I am just so ready.
    Senator Rosen. I am telling you, there is nobody that knows 
tourism more than a Senator whose state has more than 10,000 
likes. Amy Klobuchar, Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. All right. Well, thank you very much. 
And thank you both for your leadership. I have been proud to, 
for years, before with Senator Blunt, lead a number of the 
bills regarding Brand USA. So, thank you.
    So, I want to start out with something that maybe not all 
my colleagues know, and that is that Minnesota is the U.S. bid 
for the World Expo for 2027. It would be the first time that 
the U.S. got the World's Fair in decades and decades, and we 
are pretty excited about how it is going. There is going to be 
a vote. It is bipartisan supported in our State with 
Congressman Emmer and myself and many others.
    So, we are--first of all, I wondered if you could talk, Mr. 
Beall, about how an Expo can bolster not just Minnesota, but 
the national economy, as Secretary Raimondo went to Dubai for 
the last World's Fair.
    Mr. Beall. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar, for the question. 
The Department of Commerce certainly recognizes the incredible 
opportunity of large scale events, like you are just 
mentioning, present for the United States.
    Great for the local communities, and also great for the 
other communities that visitors may travel to while they are in 
the United States for a large scale event. And at the 
Department of Commerce, we are happy to be working closely with 
the White House, with the Department of State, and the 
Department of Homeland Security to support bids by communities 
for large scale events, and also to support communities that 
have already been selected for large scale events.
    And this is also a focus in the National Travel and Tourism 
Strategy. So, we are also working closely through the Tourism 
Policy Council to advance areas that we can to support large 
scale events in the future.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. And we were at the bid under 
President Trump as well, and came close, but this is the moment 
for 2027, so we are pretty excited about it, as the forecasts 
are for 14 million visitors over 90 days.
    Mr. Thompson, you actually, in your written testimony, 
highlighted the high potential for the Expo. Why is Brand USA 
so well-suited to promote these types of events with all the 
international visitors that we will see?
    Mr. Thompson. Well, thank you for that question, Senator. 
And thank you for your ongoing support historically for all 
things traveling and tourism, and certainly everything 
shepherding Brand USA in and through three reauths, and the 
extraordinary funding. So, thank you very much.
    You know, we are really excited about the potential for 
Expo in Minnesota. Those types of events are clearly in the 
hands of the city and the state that are bidding on it.
    Senator Klobuchar. Right----
    Mr. Thompson. What we see as the opportunity that puts us 
on the world stage and gives us a chance to amplify and 
leverage the marketing opportunities that we already have that 
are very strong and compelling and use that event as an 
opportunity to do that. And welcome the world to the U.S., 
which will be to the benefit of the event and certainly to the 
state, and everything in the region and otherwise.
    Senator Klobuchar. Right. And as you know, it is a health 
care theme. And we have Mayo Clinic and so many other great 
businesses that are involved in this. And it would be located, 
just for the interest of the people at this hearing, right next 
to the Mall of America.
    So, talking about Brand USA and travel promotion, Brand 
USA, as we all know, promotes international tourism. 
Historically Brand USA, which is not paid for with taxpayer 
money--it is the visa fees on foreign visitors and then it is 
also private matching, private funds. Historically, it has 
generated $56 billion to our economy since we passed it in 
2013.
    Support over 40,000 jobs each year. Since we are finally 
not tying our hands behind our backs and are advertising our 
country, just like other countries advertise for tourism here, 
inbound international travel has historically been the Nation's 
third largest industry export, generating $239 billion in 2019. 
How has restoring Brand USA help to support our national 
economy? Go ahead.
    Mr. Thompson. Yes. Well, Senator, thank you for that. 
Certainly, as we stated in the written testimony and then the 
oral testimony, our funding source was compromised, and we were 
unable to do what we would normally do.
    And then certainly during COVID, the borders were shut, so 
we had to really scale back to virtually nothing. Since then, 
we have taken the funding that was given to us through the 
Restoring Brand USA Act and deployed it, as I said earlier, in 
ways that we would not have been able to do left to our normal 
means.
    There are certainly some things that we are still dealing 
with as it relates to headwinds around the world, the 
transitioning into the endemic phase of COVID, connectivity, 
war in Ukraine, inflation, currency, and of course, workforce 
challenges. But in many of the markets, we are looking for a 
speedy recovery.
    And as I said earlier, until China recovers, until Asia 
recovers, we won't really get a full recovery, but we are 
looking for many markets to exceed actually pre-pandemic levels 
as early as next year.
    Senator Klobuchar. Oh, that is exciting. Those are your 
projections, I guess. Mr. Beall, I know that Senator Budd asked 
about this, but I am pretty obsessed with visa interview wait 
times as well.
    And could you talk about how can we better move this along? 
I missed his questions, which I am sure were good, on this 
subject, but I mostly want to put in a pitch that we have to 
move.
    I am going to see Secretary Blinken at our Expo event 
coming up this week for other Ambassadors and the like, so 
could you just talk about what we should be doing differently?
    Mr. Beall. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar, for the question. 
The Department of Commerce, as I had mentioned to Ranking 
Member Budd, obviously recognizes the importance of the visa 
process as we facilitate additional travel to and within the 
United States. And I would defer to my colleagues at the 
Department of State for more specifics on what they are doing 
to address the visa challenges.
    I do know that they have seen just strong demand, as we all 
know, as travelers have been looking for future travel to the 
United States and they are looking to address challenges that 
remain.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. The last thing I want to ask is--oh, 
really? OK. All right, thank you. Ms. Petsonk, we need to level 
the playing field for American airline companies and workers. 
Senator Marshall and I carry the Fair and Open Skies Act, which 
we have an amendment to the FAA on, to give U.S. DOT additional 
tools to make sure that foreign airlines looking to serve the 
U.S. are operating under the same set of rules as American 
businesses.
    In your testimony, you note that your office at U.S. DOT 
leads on the implementation of the U.S. Open Skies policy. Can 
you briefly speak to how these Open Skies agreements can help 
promote safety competition and American jobs?
    Ms. Petsonk. Yes. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. We have 
Open Skies agreements in place with over 130 foreign partners, 
and those agreements cover more than 70 percent of 
international departures from the United States.
    The agreements promote increased travel and trade, they 
lead to the creation of high quality jobs, and they facilitate 
economic growth. For example, one study by Brookings estimated 
that Open Skies agreements yield about $4 billion a year in 
economic gains.
    They accomplish this by opening global networks and 
expanding opportunities for cooperative arrangements between 
airlines, as well as committing Governments to high standards 
of safety and security.
    My office negotiates and enforces these agreements, 
ensuring a level playing field on which U.S. airlines and 
workers can exercise rights provided under those agreements. We 
are committed to working with all of our stakeholders, 
including our labor stakeholders, to implement these agreements 
in ways that continue to grow good jobs in the U.S. aviation 
sector.
    Senator Klobuchar. All right, thank you. And thank you to 
both of you for--I once had this subcommittee. I love it. So, 
it is great. All right. Thank you.
    Senator Rosen. It is a great subcommittee. Thank you, 
Senator Klobuchar.
    [Technical problems]--establishing the Office of the new 
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism, because 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 signed into law on 
December 29th of last year, included my Omnibus Travel and 
Tourism Act, which did create the position of Assistant 
Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism.
    The new position is the first tourism dedicated Assistant 
Secretary in the United States, and among other matters, will 
be responsible for setting annual visitation goals, creating a 
whole of Government strategy to ensure the visitation goals are 
met, and establishing interagency coordination like you have 
been speaking about to support U.S. tourism.
    So, Mr. Beall, can you update us on the establishment of 
this new position at the Department of Commerce? Perhaps walk 
us through the Department's plan for setting up the new office, 
how the new reporting structure will work, and the funding, 
like you mentioned earlier in your testimony, that would be 
needed for the Assistant Secretary, for the office, and the 
support staff, to support this very important industry.
    Mr. Beall. Thank you, Chair Rosen, for the question. And 
thank you to Congress for supporting the travel and tourism 
industry and adding this senior position at the Department of 
Commerce.
    As I mentioned in my testimony, the Department of Commerce 
did include in the President's Fiscal Year 2024 budget a 
request for $3.5 million in additional funding for the office 
of the Assistant Secretary that will support the Assistant 
Secretary for Travel and Tourism. And the Act mandates that the 
Assistant Secretary report to the Undersecretary for 
International Trade.
    So once the funding is received, Commerce will move forward 
with establishing the office, and the other underlying 
components that will support the office going forward. In the 
meantime, we will continue to stay focused on implementing the 
National Travel and Tourism Strategy and working toward our 
goal, and also convening the Travel and Tourism Advisory Board 
for private sector feedback and doing what we can to help the 
travel and tourism industry recover from the pandemic.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I thought--I know that Senator 
Welch was coming back, so I have been watching the door for 
him, but I am going to, since I have two other great members 
who have fabulous outdoor, we all have fabulous outdoor tourism 
in our states, I want to just ask a question about outdoor 
tourism because the Department of Commerce National Strategy 
discusses collaborating with the outdoor recreation industry 
and leveraging geotourism, supporting both tourism and 
sustainability.
    Outdoor tourism is a major part of Nevada's economy, 
particularly in our rural communities and in the Northern part 
of our state. For example, we have 15 million annual visitors 
to Lake Tahoe, and they have long been the driving force of the 
region's $5.1 billion economy.
    However, in recent years, Lake Tahoe has faced challenges 
of pollution, traffic, shortage of affordable housing for its 
tourism workforce. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is 
working on a plan to address these issues that will center 
local communities, equip local agencies to be effective 
stewards of the land, and welcome the millions of visitors who 
arrive to experience the beautiful public lands of the basin.
    So again, Mr. Beall, the Department of Commerce--is the 
Department of Commerce working with communities to promote 
healthy, sustainable outdoor tourism that invests in our local 
economies, often rural economies, that attracts increased 
visitors while remaining good stewards of the environment, and 
if so, how?
    Mr. Beall. Thank you, Chair Rosen, for the question. The 
Department of Commerce certainly recognizes the incredible 
natural resources and outdoor recreation activities that make 
the United States such an amazing destination. And this is a 
priority within the Travel and Tourism Strategy.
    And we do work very closely with our Federal land and water 
partners as we aim to ensure inclusive, diverse, and accessible 
travel and tourism experiences, and also foster sustainable and 
resilient travel and tourism going forward.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I see that Senator Hickenlooper 
is here, so I am going to pass it over to you, if you are 
ready, Senator.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. I am ready. And thank you all for 
taking time out of your busy lives to be here. You know, I read 
something this past weekend which I hadn't been aware of, and 
that was read through President Kennedy, John Kennedy's Office 
of Outdoor Recreation that he was fully intending and work 
toward setting up and create frameworks for. And I think that 
as we think about an office of outdoor recreation now and what 
it might look like, it seemed very instructive to look at.
    Obviously, outdoor recreation plays a huge role in 
Colorado's economy, so much so that while I was Governor, we 
set up an Office of Outdoor Recreation, and I think that pretty 
much everyone, even people that had nothing to do with outdoor 
recreation, felt supportive of that. We have expanded now.
    I think there are 15 other states that have offices of 
outdoor recreation, and there is, again, renewed talk of an 
office of outdoor recreation, as you guys all know. So, 
doctor--Mr. Beall, with such a close connection between all the 
beautiful places in our country that you help promote for 
tourism and travel, and the recreation industry, the outdoor 
recreation industry that encourages and embraces people as they 
explore and connect with these places, were we to have an 
Office of Outdoor Recreation, is that something you think would 
be useful? Would you be, you know, commit to working with it 
and trying to make it a success?
    Mr. Beall. Thank you, Senator Hickenlooper, for your 
question. And I would like to just give a quick note to my 
colleague at Brand USA for all the great work they have done in 
showcasing the many natural lands and waters across our 
country.
    And of course, as you did say, United States has an 
incredible array of outdoor recreation activities. Colorado has 
amazing, and I am fortunate to, of course, been able to 
experience many of them in summer and in winter.
    But if Congress were to establish a new Office of Outdoor 
Recreation, Commerce would closely work with that office like 
we do with other offices and agencies through the Tourism 
Policy Council and coordinate our whole of Government approach 
in travel and tourism to include that Office of Outdoor 
Recreation.
    However, I do want to note that if such an office were to 
be created, it would be helpful if Commerce--Congress were to 
include funding with the office also.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Maybe the right place for that office 
would be in the Commerce Department as well. Also, many of our 
Federal lands are located in lands--many of our ski resorts are 
located on lands, far service lands and others that--they pay 
user fees to the U.S. Forest Service.
    And I think it is somewhere approaching $40 million a year 
now annually. And so, to offset the increased cost of by ski 
resorts, Colorado's national forests have been seeking other 
ways of financial support and looking at ways to reinvest in 
the long-term maintenance needs of the forests as well.
    So, we co-sponsored the Ski Hill Resources for Economic 
Development, also known as SHRED. I don't come up with the 
acronyms. The SHRED Act to support our outdoor recreation 
communities--push some of that money back into that natural 
infrastructure.
    Can you discuss a little bit about how the 2022 National 
Travel and Tourism Strategy supports the needs of outdoor 
recreation?
    Mr. Beall. Thank you, Senator. Absolutely. The Department 
of Commerce works very closely, through the Tourism Policy 
Council with the Federal lands and waters agencies, to advance 
priorities related to this initiative, recognizing that there 
is a diverse array of opportunities for international visitors 
to experience these people and places across the United States.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes. We are aware of that and we 
appreciate it. Ms. Sonk--?
    Ms. Petsonk. Petsonk.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Ms. Petsonk and Mr. Thompson, what's 
your sense on this Office of Outdoor Recreation--potential 
Office of Outdoor Recreation?
    Mr. Thompson. Well, Senator, thank you for the question. I 
would never comment on policy as it relates to that type of 
initiative, but here is what I will tell you that when we 
reconstituted, one of the legal responsibilities that we have 
is to promote the 50 states, the five territories, the District 
of Columbia, not only to, but through and beyond our gateways, 
but also urban and rural equally. Certainly, our country has an 
embarrassment of riches as it relates to outdoor, rural 
recreational opportunities.
    One of the things that happened during the pandemic when we 
were all sheltered in place here in the country and around the 
world, we couldn't travel. And then when we were able to 
travel, get out of our homes and then travel internationally, 
our sentiment research suggested that people were really hungry 
and looking for outdoor activities in rural, and more rural 
activities than even before. And then the actual visitation 
proved that to be the case.
    So, I know you have received record visitation to your ski 
resorts. I don't think that has probably slowed. Certainly, the 
good weather this year has helped to extend the season and 
whatnot. So that has always been an amazing asset that we have 
a chance to promote.
    And I--we work closely through the Tourism Policy Council, 
when invited to those conversations, to work with all the 
Federal assets that the Government has, owns, and has control 
of, and otherwise protects and nurtures.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you.
    Ms. Petsonk. Thanks, Senator Hickenlooper. I would echo Mr. 
Beall's comments with regard to the possible establishment of 
the office, and I would also like to note that the bipartisan 
infrastructure law requires the Department of Transportation to 
identify investments that could protect scenic but often less 
traveled roads, that promote tourism and economic development 
throughout the country. I have had the pleasure of being able 
to travel on one of those roads, the scenic byway that goes 
through the collegiate range----
    Senator Hickenlooper. Sure, I know it very well.
    Ms. Petsonk. And as well as many other scenic byways around 
the country. In fact, this past weekend, I took time off from 
preparing for this hearing to travel a scenic byway in Maryland 
that goes to Fort Frederick, which I recommend to you also. But 
the point is that these scenic byways which we fund through our 
Federal Highways Administration, play a very important role in 
supporting access to outdoor recreation.
    And so, I want to just emphasize, in April of this year, 
our Federal Highways Administration awarded $21 million to 33 
byway projects in 29 states. We have got a notice of funding 
opportunity for $20 million more for the scenic byways. And 
these are the kinds of investments that we think will help 
promote outdoor recreation.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. I appreciate that. And I will 
just finish with, within the Forest Service and the BLM and 
other Federal lands combined with State lands, we have a 
tremendous lack of parking access and getting into the back way 
to some of these outdoor recreational opportunities.
    And I think a lot of what your work is doing is setting the 
stage and helping us get to the point where we can begin to get 
more access to more parts of our beautiful country and get back 
to, you know, the--I don't know if you ever read a thing called 
Blue Highways, which when in scenic byways, a writer named 
William Least Heat Moon wrote this back in the 70s, but it is a 
great description of just how beautiful this country is when 
you get off the big interstates. And we thank you all. Thank 
you, Madam Chair. I yield back to you.
    Senator Rosen. [Technical problems]--Senator. I am going to 
yield to Senator Budd who has another question. Didn't have my 
microphone on. Senator Budd, please.
    Senator Budd. Yes, thank you. Just briefly, and this is for 
Mr. Beall and Mr. Thompson. Talk to me a little bit about your 
coordination with State offices, if you would, that have their 
own promotion responsibility, and how you coordinate with them 
and how you would avoid duplication of effort.
    Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Senator, for that question. So 
that speaks to the core value proposition that we provide. We 
are our Nation's destination marketing organization. There is 
only one of us. And before we were brought into existence that 
virtually every State has a State tourism office and probably 
400 cities have convention visitors bureau or other destination 
marketing organizations.
    When I first came here, I said, we have to be very 
respectful of what has always been there in place before we got 
here, but how can we add and create in ways that only we can 
do. As you may know, our funding source relies on 
contributions. Meaning we have to--we have access to $100 
million in our travel promotion fund every year, but we have to 
bring a dollar to get a dollar, and we have to raise $50 
million in cash a year.
    Our primary sector that contributes cash to cooperatively 
market with us is our destination marketing organizations at 
the State and local level. So, I would say that is one of our 
most engaged and collaborative relationships of all of our 
stakeholder audiences, certainly wherever I represent all the 
destinations, but then all the verticals that deliver the 
experiences on the ground every day.
    But those DMOs are experts. On my best day, I could never 
describe all the things there ought to see in North Carolina 
like your State tourism office, and I would never pretend to 
try to do that, but I provide, we provide platforms for them to 
be able to tell those stories in more compelling, right ways, 
and reach audiences that they would not maybe normally be able 
to reach on their own. So long winded answer to the question, 
they are very, very valuable partners to us.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. Anything to add, Mr. Beall?
    Mr. Thompson. Yes. In adding to that, State tourism offices 
are a very important stakeholder for the Department of 
Commerce, and we work very closely with them as we work to 
increase U.S. travel and tourism export opportunities and 
increase U.S. travel and tourism competitiveness.
    And I want to thank Congress for your support of the survey 
of international air travelers at the Department of Commerce 
that my office administers that measures the value of 
international traveler visitor--international travelers' 
spending and the characteristics they display while they are in 
the United States.
    And that information provides very helpful market 
intelligence to states and other stakeholders that are thinking 
about new international market opportunities. So, thank you for 
your support of our program.
    Senator Budd. Thank you both. Chairman.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I have two last questions. The 
first one will be for Mr. Beall, and the last one will be for 
all three of you.
    And I--the new Assistant Secretary that we hope to get 
nominated to the Department of Commerce, well they are required 
to increase and facilitate international business travel, just 
like we have been talking about, I want to build on that, 
including by facilitating large conferences and exhibitions, 
emphasizing, like we have been speaking about, rural 
destinations, supporting ecotourism, facilitating sports and 
recreation--I am not going to stop without the Golden Knights 
again today--and all of those activities in the U.S.
    It is especially important for Nevada, where people come 
from across the country and around the world for conventions, 
trade shows, conferences, exhibitions. Las Vegas is the 
convention capital of the world, hosting nearly 22,000 
meetings, conventions, and exhibits, and events each and every 
year.
    We are also the entertainment capital of the world, hosting 
events, the like I said, Formula One, the Las Vegas Grand Prix, 
Super Bowl 58, the NCAA Final Four. And so, can you please talk 
about how you will be facilitating in the Office and Department 
of Commerce, bringing these sorts of large conventions, sports 
competitions, special events? We know they happen all across 
the United States, not just in Las Vegas, but this is a huge 
part of our economy.
    Mr. Beall. Thank you, Chair Rosen. And thank you again to 
Congress for recognizing the important role of travel and 
tourism at the Department of Commerce and establishing the 
Assistant Secretary for Travel and Tourism position.
    And as we think about the global marketplace for travel and 
tourism, which is becoming increasingly competitive, the role 
of the Assistant Secretary will provide another opportunity to 
amplify the work that we are doing across the interagency, 
through the National Travel and Tourism Strategy, to increase 
and attract large scale events to the United States, because we 
recognize the economic importance and impact that these events 
have on our economy and in our communities.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. And the final question, we can't 
do any of this without a workforce, right? And so, the U.S. 
Travel and Tourism Advisory Board, or TTAB, it has advised that 
the pandemic had worsened the long standing barriers to 
workforce participation in travel and tourism industry and had 
created new hurdles to the workplace and to workplace 
satisfaction.
    And so TTAB has recommended that steps be taken to support 
travel and tourism workers' access to childcare, to affordable 
housing, to reliable transportation, and career pathways for 
women and underrepresented minorities, really for everyone.
    And so, as our last question, how do you feel maybe as we 
come out of COVID or just generally, some of these barriers to 
our workforce that are going to impact our ability to meet the 
kinds of goals that we hope for in our travel industry?
    Mr. Beall. I am happy to start. As you did mention, Chair 
Rosen, the Traveling Tourism Advisory Board is a unique board 
that advises the Secretary of Commerce on important policy 
issues impacting travel and tourism in the United States.
    And as you know, it is chaired by Bill Hornbuckle from MGM 
International based in Las Vegas, Nevada. And we are fortunate 
that we have been--the Secretary has been able to engage with 
the Travel and Tourism Advisory Board to receive 
recommendations on what the Federal Government can do to 
address workforce challenges.
    And those recommendations have been considered by the 
Tourism Policy Council, and that workforce is a focus in the 
National Travel and Tourism Strategy so that we can coordinate 
across Government to advance progress against this very 
important issue, which we know is critical for the travel and 
tourism industry.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. Ms. Petsonk.
    Ms. Petsonk. Thank you. The Department of Transportation is 
committed to working with the Department of Commerce and the 
other agencies in the Tourism Policy Council. We understand and 
appreciate that a more diverse and resilient workforce will 
make everyone in the United States better off.
    We see the benefits of investing in our people, 
particularly in the aviation sector, that is under the purview 
of my office, including not only traditional forms of aviation, 
commercial aviation, but also advanced air mobility. People who 
are going to be trained in that very interesting and important 
field.
    And it is our view that reaching more people from more 
diverse backgrounds, particularly underrepresented populations, 
will not only strengthen our transportation networks, make them 
more able to facilitate travel and tourism, and benefit the 
economy overall.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. And for the last word, Mr. 
Thompson. Talk to us.
    Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Madam Chair. We refer to travel as 
promoting the diversity of geography, experiences, and people. 
And I think that third component is the one that is often 
overlooked.
    When the pandemic hit and the hospitality industry was 
brought to its knees, you know, I think it is underrepresenting 
and underselling the hospitality industry by calling it that. 
In reality, what the hospitality industry is in every city and 
every little town in this country is the fabric of that 
community that makes it unique, its unique selling proposition.
    So, the fabric of every community across the country was 
brought to its knees. And I think it is really important that 
we get back to selling the beauty of these jobs and this 
industry, because I am a perfect example of an entry level 
employee that has risen to a CEO level. And every--and all 
across this industry, in every vertical sector that you could 
look at, there are those opportunities.
    And particularly now, with this challenge as the sector is, 
I think there is more opportunity than there has ever been for 
people to look at this and relook at it as an opportunity for a 
start, or even a career in my case. And I think that is the 
message that we need to be putting out there and trying to 
sell.
    Senator Rosen. Well, thank you. I appreciate you all being 
here for today's hearing. We learned an awful lot. And like I 
said, it is very exciting as we want to show off our beautiful 
country to the world.
    And so, the hearing record will remain open for two weeks 
until Tuesday, June 27, 2023. Any Senators that would like to 
submit questions for the record should do so by Tuesday, June 
27, 2023.
    Thank you again for testifying today. We ask that your 
responses be returned to the Committee as quickly as possible 
and no case later than two weeks after receipt. That concludes 
today's hearing.
    [Whereupon, at 3:34 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito to 

                              Brian Beall
    Question 1.  West Virginia has a new National Park at New River 
Gorge. How does the Department of Commerce work with land and water 
agencies to attract international visitors to visit Federal sites and 
their adjacent communities?
    Answer. The Department of Commerce (Commerce) recognizes the unique 
role that Federal lands and waters play in attracting international 
visitors to the United States. This is reflected in the 2022 National 
Travel and Tourism Strategy (Strategy), which was developed through 
close collaboration with Federal agencies responsible for U.S. land and 
water assets, including Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration and the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior. 
Commerce continues to work closely with relevant agencies through its 
leadership of the Tourism Policy Council, the legislatively mandated 
body responsible for coordinating travel and tourism policy across the 
U.S. Government, to implement the Strategy. As part of these 
implementation efforts, Commerce is making public lands and waters more 
accessible, delivering world-class experiences and customer service, 
and encouraging international visitation to all our unique Federal 
sites, which will benefit adjacent communities across the country.

    Question 2. How does the National Travel and Tourism Strategy 
support travel and tourism across the United States, not just in big 
cities and destinations, but also in communities beyond travel 
gateways?
    Answer. The 2022 National Travel and Tourism Strategy (Strategy) 
emphasizes the need to promote diverse tourism experiences and 
destinations and to extend the benefits of travel and tourism 
throughout the country, with a focus on underserved communities and 
populations. Supporting the development of diverse tourism assets will 
lead visitors to more destinations and can benefit adjacent 
communities, ensuring the benefits of travel and tourism are shared 
more equitably across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 
U.S. territories. The Secretary of Commerce has also asked for private 
sector advice, through the United States Travel and Tourism Advisory 
Board, on how the Federal government can accomplish the objectives set 
forth in the Strategy of ensuring diverse tourism experiences across 
the country and encouraging visitation beyond the gateway cities.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Peter Welch to 
                            Carol A. Petsonk
    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act required Amtrak, in 
coordination with the Department of Transportation and other Federal 
and Canadian entities, to issue a report with recommendations on how to 
improve cross-border train service. Amtrak's report highlights that the 
cost of building a preclearance facility remains a significant barrier.

    Question 1. What additional agreements, if any, are needed between 
governmental and private parties in both the United States and Canada 
to ensure that a preclearance facility is constructed as quickly as 
possible?

    Question 2. What steps can the Department of Transportation, its 
Federal partners, and Congress take to support these efforts?
    Answer. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP) maintain jurisdiction over preclearance 
facilities, the Department of Transportation (DOT) is committed to 
advancing world-class passenger rail in America. DOT will work with all 
stakeholders, including Amtrak and CBP, to assist in their important 
work to make investments in facilities and processes that facilitate 
cross-border operations while enhancing safety security. DOT and the 
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), as the lead Federal rail safety 
regulator, may provide important technical guidance and participate in 
interagency coordination. On the issues of financing and constructing 
preclearance facilities, including agreements required for expeditious 
construction of such facilities, DOT defers to the expertise of DHS and 
Amtrak.
    Implementing preclearance effectively requires a sterile corridor--
in other words, a route in which a train travels uninterrupted from its 
originating station to the first stop across the border. Operational 
issues that might cause it to slow down or to halt would result in a 
breach in the sterile corridor.

    Question 3. How can the Department of Transportation work with 
Amtrak and other Federal partners, such as U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, to ensure that requirements for a sterile corridor are met, 
including on routes between Vermont and Canada?

    Question 4. What steps can the Department take to continue to 
evaluate the feasibility and costs of maintaining sterile corridors?
    Answer. The Department of Transportation (DOT) stands ready to be a 
partner for entities seeking to develop world-class passenger rail in 
the United States. This includes providing technical guidance and 
collaborating with other Federal partners through interagency 
coordination. Ultimately, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
maintains jurisdiction over the requirements for preclearance, and DOT 
is prepared to advise on such matters that also fall within its 
jurisdiction. Additionally, DOT may provide technical guidance to 
intercity passenger rail infrastructure owners and operators, such as 
Amtrak, on requirements for corridors that fall under DOT authorities.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Peter Welch to

    Question 1. Collaborating with local tourism boards, businesses, 
and associations in Vermont is crucial. How can Brand USA improve 
partnerships with local stakeholders to develop joint marketing 
initiatives, enhance product offerings, and showcase the diversity of 
experiences available in Vermont and other states across the country?
    Answer. Collaboration is at the very heart of who Brand USA is and 
how our business model functions. Cooperative marketing weaves together 
the many stories and voices that constitute travel experiences 
throughout the United States. Brand USA coordinates with partners such 
as destination marketing organizations (DMOs), tour operators, lodging 
companies, and attractions to better tell the many USA stories in a 
compelling way. Local partners on the ground have the best 
understanding of what makes their place special, while we have the 
global infrastructure and reach those partners need to compete for 
international visitors. Brand USA also works with hundreds of local 
attractions and small businesses around the country each year to 
showcase the diversity of our people and our experiences in a 
meaningful and authentic way.
    In the case of Vermont, we work directly with the Vermont 
Department of Tourism and Marketing, as well as the regional DMO, 
Discover New England, to promote the Green Mountain State. Consumers 
can find inspiration and information on Vermont's state page, which is 
featured on VisitTheUSA.com and available in eight languages across 16 
market-specific websites. Similarly, Vermont destinations and 
experiences are also featured on the Discover New England subsite on 
VisitTheUSA.com.
    Other recent examples of this approach include featuring Vermont as 
part of Brand USA's social media influencer program, as well as 
showcasing the Bread and Puppet Theater in Glover as the subject of an 
episode of our Emmy Award-winning GoUSA TV program, ``Small Town, Big 
Story'' in partnership with the travel media company Atlas Obscura.
    Finally, I am delighted that Vermont Department of Tourism & 
Marketing will participate at Brand USA Travel Week U.K. & Europe in 
London this fall and gives the state the opportunity to meet with the 
top buyers and travel media from across the region to conduct business 
and promote the state and the unique experiences one can have only in 
Vermont.
    While we are proud of the body of work we have to showcase Vermont 
to the world, we are continuously working with our partners at the 
state and local level to find new and creative ways to build upon our 
existing partnership into the future.

    Question 2. Based on your experience, how can Brand USA leverage 
agritourism and ecotourism to appeal to environmentally conscious 
travelers seeking sustainable travel experiences?
    Answer. By mandate, Brand USA is required to promote all 50 states, 
the five territories, and D.C., as well as rural and urban areas 
equally. Throughout the course of the pandemic, our proprietary 
research showed that travelers are increasingly interested in outdoor 
experiences that allow them to explore and connect with nature--Our 
ongoing research suggests that enjoying the great outdoors through 
sightseeing, recreation, and other activities is of great importance to 
visitors to the USA.
    A variety of data sources suggest international visitors from 
certain markets and age brackets are increasingly interested in 
pursuing travel experiences that align with an environmental ethos. 
This is one of the reasons so many entities in the travel industry--
from airlines to hotels to rental car companies, cruise lines, and 
cities and towns themselves--are placing such importance on major 
initiatives toward more sustainable operations.
    As the Nation's DMO, Brand USA's role in the tourism ecosystem is 
to harness the remarkable stories that continue to make the United 
States the most aspirational travel destination in the world to tell 
them in a compelling way to the right people through the right channels 
at the right time to drive booking.
    From our giant-screen films `National Parks Adventure,' and `Into 
America's Wild' to original GoUSA TV programs like `Trails and 
Trailblazers,' to travel trade familiarization tours to our public 
lands and more, Brand USA is committed to inspiring travelers to visit 
the USA by highlighting the diversity of our natural landscapes, 
experiences, and the people who deliver them.
    For example, in Vermont we showcase destinations, experiences, and 
attractions like Mount Mansfield, the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller 
National Historical Park (which contains the country's oldest 
sustainably managed forest), Shelburne Farms in Burlington, and more on 
VisitTheUSA.com, which is translated into eight languages across 16 
markets.
    Brand USA will continue to promote the great outdoors and the 
variety of experiences that visitors can have, while working with 
destination marketing organizations, small businesses, local 
attractions and others to expand product offerings appealing to the 
environmentally conscious traveler.
