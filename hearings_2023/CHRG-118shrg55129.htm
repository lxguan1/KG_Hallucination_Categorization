                              ----------                              


                        Wednesday, May 10, 2023

                                        U.S. Senate
         Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room 
328A, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Debbie Stabenow, 
chairwoman of the committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Stabenow [presiding], Brown, Klobuchar, 
Bennet, Smith, Lujan, Warnock, Welch, Fetterman, Boozman, 
Ernst, Hyde-Smith, Marshall, and Braun.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Well good morning. I call the 
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry to order, and 
I think the word of this morning is ``flexibility.'' We have 
members that are having to be multiple places at once. Until we 
get ``Beam me up, Scotty'' we are just going to keep being 
flexible this morning.
    I am going to start with Senator Lujan, who has to 
immediately leave, but wanted to introduce our witness today, 
nominee today.
    Senator Lujan.
    Senator Lujan. Well, Chair Stabenow and to the Committee 
members, thank you for the time this morning and for going out 
of order. I certainly appreciate that. To our Ranking Member, 
it is good to be with you again, sir. Thank you for this 
important hearing.
    Today I have the honor of introducing my friend, the Under 
Secretary for Rural Development for the United States 
Department of Agriculture, Xochitl Torres Small.
    Her passion and determination have been an ongoing 
inspiration, and she quickly earned the respect of our 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle due to her drive to make 
real progress on issues facing rural America.
    In her current role as Under Secretary for Rural 
Development USDA, she oversees loans and grants to provide 
infrastructure improvements, business development, affordable 
housing, community facilities such as schools, public safety, 
health care, and high-speed internet access in rural, Tribal, 
and high-poverty areas. During her leadership, USDA Rural 
Development secured $2 billion to support rural broadband 
through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill.
    Torres Small has worked tirelessly on behalf of thousands 
of Americans, who have been the beneficiaries of her passion 
and determination to make our country a better place to live, 
work, and raise a family. I thank her for joining us here today 
and for answering our questions.
    Madam Chair and to the members of the Committee, for the 
past couple of months, like all of you, I have been honored to 
travel throughout New Mexico with listening sessions, to talk 
to farmers and producers about the upcoming farm bill. As we 
have a conversation and we understand the priorities that 
families have all over the rural parts of my State, they always 
ask for one person, Xochitl Torres Small. It is just refreshing 
when you are visiting with folks who are so busy and so 
preoccupied with daily responsibilities, but they take time to 
check on someone that they care about and someone that cares 
about them.
    I want to thank you, to our Under Secretary, Xochitl Torres 
Small, for being with us here today, and I thank our Chair and 
our Ranking Member, and I look forward to a good hearing.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much. What a wonderful 
tribute, so thank you so much, Senator Lujan.

STATEMENT OF HON. DEBBIE STABENOW, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE 
    OF MICHIGAN, CHAIRWOMAN, U.S. COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
                    NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY

    Chairwoman Stabenow. As we know, our Committee has deep 
understanding of the vital role that the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture plays in our country, and from farmers and ranchers 
feeding America and families trying to make ends meet, to the 
more than 46 million people living in a rural community around 
the country, the USDA touches the lives of countless Americans 
every single day. I am pleased that we are here today to 
consider a nominee who shares our understanding of, and 
appreciation for, this Department.
    Under Secretary Torres Small, welcome, and congratulations 
on your nomination to serve as the Deputy Secretary of 
Agriculture. Your impressive and wide-ranging background makes 
you an ideal candidate to help lead the nearly 100,000 public 
servants USDA has stationed at more than 4,500 locations across 
the country and around the world.
    Ms. Torres Small has strong roots in the agricultural 
community. The granddaughter of farmworkers, she grew up in the 
borderlands of New Mexico and understands both the virtues of 
and the challenges faced by our rural communities.
    She is also a trailblazer, as the first woman, the first 
person of color to represent New Mexico's Second congressional 
District in Congress. As a Congresswoman, Ms. Torres Small 
served on the House Committee on Agriculture, showing that she 
is deeply committed to food and farm policy. She prioritized 
investing in high-speed, affordable internet and modern, 
reliable water and wastewater systems for her constituents, 
making it easier for children to learn and farmers to grow.
    In the summer of 2021, I was proud to support her 
nomination to be Under Secretary of Rural Development at USDA, 
a position in which she was confirmed unanimously. At the time, 
rural communities were still reeling from the pandemic. Her 
leadership was vital to carrying out USDA Rural Development's 
mission of providing communities, and the small businesses and 
local governments that lift them up, with the support and 
resources that they need to be successful.
    Ms. Torres Small's leadership and advocacy before Congress 
was critical in our efforts to secure $2 billion to expand 
rural broadband through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. 
During her time as Under Secretary, Rural Development was the 
first Federal agency to invest Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
funds and physical infrastructure for high-speed internet. She 
also moved swiftly to make Rural Development funding available, 
which reduced energy costs for farmers and small businesses.
    Last year, Congress made the largest investment in rural 
electric since the New Deal, and under her stewardship, USDA 
has been a leader in developing and delivering these benefits 
to our rural communities.
    It is clear to me that Ms. Torres Small has a proven track 
record as a strong leader, which will be needed as the 
Department faces unprecedented challenges, like tackling the 
climate crisis and helping farmers manage geopolitical risks.
    Thank you again for being here today, Ms. Torres Small, and 
I look forward to hearing about your plans for the Department 
and your vision for the future of agriculture.
    Before turning this over to Ranking Member Boozman, I do 
want to say, though, also a thank-you to our former Deputy 
Secretary, Dr. Jewel Bronaugh, for her exemplary public 
service. Dr. Bronaugh was a leader in advancing equity at the 
Department and supporting mental health in our rural and 
farming communities, and in so many different ways was an 
amazing leader. We thank her.
    Now I will recognize Senator Boozman.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BOOZMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF 
                            ARKANSAS

    Senator Boozman. Well, thank you, Madam Chair, and thank 
you for holding this very, very important hearing today, and we 
appreciate Xochitl Torres Small for being here today as we 
discuss her nomination for the job of the Deputy Secretary of 
the United States Department of Agriculture, and we would like 
to welcome her back to the Committee and her supporters.
    As the second most senior official at the Department, the 
Deputy has significant responsibilities over nearly 100,000 
employees, 29 agencies, and 4,500 locations in the U.S. and 
abroad. Managing such a large and sprawling agency is not easy. 
Upon your confirmation you will have your work certainly cut 
out for you, but you will also have an opportunity to improve 
the operations of the Department at a pivotal time.
    Regardless of agency, employer, or location, our farmers, 
ranchers, schools, food banks, rural communities, all 
individuals and organizations that work with USDA deserve to 
have clarity and certainty at the end of every interaction with 
the USDA. This Committee deserves that too. As a Deputy, a 
focus on creating a culture of transparency, accountability, 
and responsiveness will make that a reality.
    To this day, USDA has been unable or unwilling to 
accurately tell the Committee how billions of dollars provided 
during the pandemic have been spent and what remains unspent. 
We have asked for this information in emails and letters to the 
agency, only to have the correspondence go unanswered. The lack 
of transparency about USDA's spending, the lack of meaningful 
response to Congress, and the lack of accountability by USDA is 
troubling.
    Let me be absolutely clear. I do not believe that you are 
responsible for this specific issue. As the Deputy you must 
provide leadership to USDA's appointed officials and the career 
agency heads, and create a culture of accountability.
    We have heard over and over again that the USDA's 
application processes are too complicated for the citizens in 
rural communities that need to access them. I know this is a 
concern that you share within the Rural Development programs as 
we visited about it extensively, and just recently, in a 
subcommittee hearing held by Senator Bennet and Senator 
Marshall we heard very similar comments regarding conservation 
programs. I have also heard from scores of farmers in Arkansas 
and around the country about the administrative burden required 
to access Farm Service Agency (FSA) programs.
    If USDA embraces transparency, accountability, and 
responsiveness, the Department cannot only correct these issues 
but meaningfully improve the experience of those that access 
these programs. Should legislative changes be necessary, we 
will certainly be glad to work with you to ensure the programs 
throughout the USDA are being delivered in a timely and 
efficient manner. Legislative changes without a change to the 
Department's culture, however, will not yield the desired 
results.
    I have greatly enjoyed working with you as you have served 
Rural Development. I have appreciated your thoughtfulness and 
your willingness to take the time to visit Arkansas and to 
understand the issues my State faces, and for that matter, to 
visit so many areas throughout the country and do the same 
thing. I believe that you are very well qualified to serve as 
the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture. I look forward to hearing 
more from you today and a swift confirmation process.
    Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much.
    Before turning to you I want to submit, for the record, a 
number of letters with many, many groups that are supporting 
your nomination. I would place this in the record, without 
objection.

    [The letters can be found on pages 32-53 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Now before your opening comments, Ms. 
Torres Small, if you would stand. We have two housekeeping 
matters. First, we will administer an oath, so please raise 
your right hand.
    Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to 
provide is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 
truth, so help you God?
    Ms. Torres Small. I so swear.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you. Second, do you agree that 
if confirmed, you will appear before any duly constituted 
committee of Congress if asked to appear?
    Ms. Torres Small. I so swear.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much.
    Now we will proceed and look forward to hearing your 
opening comments.

   STATEMENT OF THE HON. XOCHITL TORRES SMALL, NOMINEE TO BE 
DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE

    Ms. Torres Small. Chairwoman Stabenow, Ranking Member 
Boozman, and members of the Committee, for the opportunity to 
come before you today.
    I am deeply grateful for the path that has brought me here. 
I am the granddaughter of farmworkers, the daughter of 
educators, and am blessed by the love and support of a 
wonderful husband, family, and friends in New Mexico. I also 
want to thank Senator Lujan for his mentorship and support.
    Today is Dia de las Madres, so thinking about Dr. Bronaugh 
and thinking about the many women who brought me here, I am 
especially grateful for that.
    My own roots are both rural and urban, agricultural and 
international development, blue collar and white collar. What I 
love about this Department is that it brings all of those 
things together. The nutrition that fuels our lives means that 
we are all, each of us, connected to America's farmers. It is 
what connects all of your constituents in each of your States. 
Although I am sure that your urban constituents may call with 
very different issues than your rural constituents, we are all 
connected by land, we are all connected by resources, and we 
are all connected by food.
    The position for which I seek might be described as part 
manager, part departmental Ambassador. When it comes to 
management, one of the first things I learned as Under 
Secretary is to win over the constituents that we serve. It 
means also winning over USDA employees. I have often told the 
story about a woman in Alabama who did not trust the government 
to provide her clean water because the government had let her 
down so many times before, and it took a Rural Development 
employee knocking on the door, and having a conversation with 
her, to get her to trust again.
    We have the same challenge with many of our incredibly 
devoted professionals. One of the scores in the Federal 
Employee Viewpoint Survey that they score highest on is the 
comment, ``It is important to me that my work contribute to the 
common good.'' In fact, they score off the charts on this, 
because they believe in the work that they do, and that is why 
I believe in Rural Development.
    I also know that our employees at Rural Development and 
USDA face significant challenges, whether it is outdated 
technology that hinders their ability to comply with 
congressional directives, antiquated loan and grant 
applications that mean we are not serving the people who need 
and deserve our support, and the ongoing need to do more with 
less, which sometimes means accepting retirements while also 
maintaining a hold on hiring.
    That is why I am eager to work with you, to roll up my 
sleeves, to be able to do the management side of this job, 
because the people of this department, it is the glue. It is 
the glue that connects our programs together, and much more 
importantly, connects our programs to the people who deserve 
our support. If confirmed, the management side of the position 
would happily be front-of-mind for me, every single day.
    The Ambassador side of the job, I have learned from you, is 
important too. It means being a representative in front of 
Congress, in front of our sister agencies, to make sure that 
they understand farmers' and ranchers' needs, and to in front 
of the people that we serve. I would be a proud representative 
as Deputy Secretary.
    Now having run for Congress twice and only served once, I 
know that you cannot please everyone all of the time. I am not 
only familiar with what it is like to grapple with multiple 
views, I truly believe that that difference of opinion is what 
makes our country stronger. It allows us to find better 
solutions, and it allows us to find ways forward that will last 
the test of time. I have seen that in this very Committee, when 
many of you have pushed me to make Rural Development's programs 
easier to access, because no one should have to have a team of 
grant-writers to get our support. Now I know there is still a 
lot of work to do there, and I am eager to get to continue to 
do this work.
    Common ground is what grounds my work. If we do not agree 
on nine things then I am hopeful that we can find a tenth thing 
that we do agree on and work with that. That is why I feel that 
I am the right person for this job. That is why I want to do 
you proud, and that is why I look forward to our discussion 
today. Thank you.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Torres Small can be found on 
page 28 in the appendix.]

    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Continuing our 
flexibility this morning, I am going to defer to Senator Brown 
to ask the first question, and then we will go back to regular 
order.
    Senator Brown. You know, I love sitting on this Committee 
and looking over your--not that I do not like looking directly 
at you, but looking over your left shoulder. It took Chair 
Stabenow to be the only portrait here that has actual farm 
products in it. It is not a novel--well, I guess it is a novel 
idea. Thank you for that.
    From your comments, Madam Secretary, and I know Senator 
Boozman and Senator Stabenow and Tina, all of us agree on this, 
that this Committee, in many ways, is the least partisan 
committee in the Senate, and almost any time that Wes and I and 
others come up with ideas, in our roundtables or whatever, we 
go to a Republican, in our case, and find a partner, and that 
is why this Committee, and that is why the farm bill is going 
to be the best farm bill this Committee has ever passed, Madam 
Chair, in her last two years.
    I want to talk for a moment about East Palestine. I think 
you know the train derailment there. I go there more often than 
once a month. Today, an important day for East Palestine, and I 
think for the Nation's safety, that the Brown-Vance bill on 
rail safety, bipartisan, will pass out of the Commerce 
Committee today, bipartisanly, and I think we will have enough 
votes to get 60 in the Senate soon. Senator Schumer wants to 
schedule it as quickly as possible, and President Biden has 
assured us he is going to sign it.
    I want to talk a little bit about Norfolk Southern's 
failures to make appropriate safety precautions. We know all 
that. USDA's Rural Development plays an important role in 
communities like East Palestine. Every time I visit, I hear 
from residents eager to rebuild their communities and their 
businesses, wanting just to return their lives to some sense of 
normalcy, but beyond that, what USDA can do to make a 
difference in their lives.
    I just wanted a public commitment from you to work with my 
office and local leaders and businesses, including credit 
unions and banks serving these small counties, to convene an 
economic empowerment forum where the community can come 
together to learn about opportunities for creating economic 
vibrancy and prosperity.
    Ms. Torres Small. Senator Brown, thank you for your 
commitment to this issue and also thank you for Jonathan 
McCracken, who is now the State Director in Ohio, working very 
hard on this issue. I actually spoke with him earlier today, 
and so I do commit to participating in that convening and 
supporting it, recognizing that he has been on the ground for, 
and working very closely with your team from a Rural 
Development point of view. We will continue to work, and I 
appreciate your focus on this and driving us as well.
    Senator Brown. Thank you. Senator Stabenow and her staff 
know Jon was with me I think from my second month in the Senate 
until you stole him. I mean, we do not think of human beings 
that way exactly, in terms of stealing, but still, okay.
    Two months ago, Senators Casey and Fetterman, in the State 
just east of mine, and I wrote to Secretary Vilsack and 
Administrator Regan about the impact of the East Palestine 
train derailment could have on farmers in our area. I raised 
the issue with Secretary Vilsack. I have met dairy farmers two 
miles from the derailment who cannot sell their milk, even 
though they can test it and it is not contaminated, but who is 
going to buy milk from a farmer that close? Who is going to buy 
beef--local farmers with small beef cattle farms cannot sell 
their beef either because people that have been their regular 
customers. We know we need to do some very specific--we do not 
know all the answer, by a long shot, how to fix this.
    Would you commit to working with my office and Committee 
staff to provide the kind of technical assistance on changes 
that could be made so that USDA has the tools to respond to 
these kinds of disasters?
    Ms. Torres Small. Senator, from my perspective at Rural 
Development, we have been working very closely with your team 
on the existing challenges both when it comes to water as well 
as the community facilities that might be available or support 
that might be available in the future. I recognize that you are 
talking about more specifically farm testing and FSA's work, 
which is not currently within my purview. If confirmed as 
Deputy Secretary I look forward to working with you on these 
issues.
    Senator Brown. Thank you. In this case, taxpayer dollars 
should not be spent on this testing. It should be Norfolk 
Southern. I met with the CEO last week. He says to my face, he 
has said publicly they will continue to cooperate, and they are 
going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to do a lot of 
this, as you know.
    Last thing. I introduced, along with several people on this 
Committee--Senator Smith, who is sitting here, Senator 
Fetterman, Senator Bennet, who was here earlier, Senator 
Welch--on our Local Farms and Food Act. Will you work with us 
to continue to build support for farmers selling their produce 
locally, with food stamp benefits, SNAP benefits available to 
farmers markets, all the things we do that way, so good, 
nutritious food stays in the community and the wealth created 
by that stays in our community?
    Ms. Torres Small. Senator Brown, I deeply appreciate your 
connection to building local markets and supporting nutritious 
food. I am not specifically familiar with the bill but look 
forward to learning more about it.
    Senator Brown. You will be, Madam Secretary. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Very good. Expanding on what we have 
been doing to build on the local food economy is so much a part 
of everything. We certainly learned during COVID how critical 
it was to our access to food as well, in local communities. 
Thank you, Senator Brown, for your work in this area.
    I am wondering if you might speak a little bit. You talked 
about as Deputy Secretary that you would be the chief operating 
officer for the Department, which is so important, overseeing 
all of the operations and the work force of over 100,000 
employees, who I think we need to thank every day--they have 
been through a lot, and we certainly appreciate all of their 
work--working with Secretary Vilsack and so on to deliver on 
the mission.
    From our perspective, as we write the farm bill, the 
partnership with USDA has never been more important as we work 
on all of these issues that are so important. Could you talk a 
little bit more about your priorities, if confirmed as the 
Deputy Secretary, and how do you plan to use the lessons that 
you have learned from your time as Under Secretary of Rural 
Development as you go to this new role?
    Ms. Torres Small. When I started working as Under Secretary 
for Rural Development I realized that there is a real need to 
focus on operations because it is fundamental to making sure 
that rural people have the Rural Development that they deserve, 
that there are programs that are easy to access. Although 
sometimes that is about looking at the regulations, which would 
come under the purview of Deputy Secretary, sometimes it is 
also about the technology, making sure that the system that we 
are investing in works well on the front end for customer 
service, and that we are prioritizing those investments.
    Sometimes it also is about having an onboarding strategy 
that truly prepares the next generation of USDA work force to 
be customer service focused and to have those skills to provide 
that outreach.
    If confirmed as Deputy Secretary, I would want to focus on 
being that customer service agency that our farmers and rural 
people rely on, and all of the back-end work that supports that 
effort.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Absolutely. When we look at 
transitioning, because, I mean, you have a done a terrific job 
in your current role, and Rural Development has been tasked 
with implementing a number of really important things, 
including the largest investment in rural electric since the 
New Deal. If you are confirmed, how will you ensure a smooth 
transition with the person coming in after you, and how do you 
hope to continue your own leadership on rural issues?
    Ms. Torres Small. Rural Development has done some 
incredible things in the last two years, and it is because of a 
great team. When we look at the investment that has been 
received through the Inflation Reduction Act, through the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, being the first to get funds out 
for infrastructure for high-speed internet, it was a team that 
worked day in and day out together.
    My role as Under Secretary ended up focusing on a lot of 
those operations that would keep our team going into the 
future. One of the things that I did early on is prioritize 
employee meetings all across the country, because Rural 
Development is like other parts of USDA but pretty unique 
across the Federal Government, that we have over 450 offices 
across the country and people living in the communities they 
serve. It was really important for me to go and listen to them.
    Out of those meetings we put together an executive report 
called Team Rural Development, that identified some of the key 
challenges that folks are facing, like continuity in the hiring 
process or outdated technology, and identified priorities for 
how we can best address them. That was going to be my blueprint 
for the next two years, but now, hopefully, it will be a great 
guide for whoever comes in as Under Secretary.
    We have also set up a State Office of Operations, led by 
Director Basil Goodman, who has done an incredible job making 
sure that our field operations remain connected to program 
design that happens in headquarters. Having that consistent 
channel of communication will be crucial for the long term.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Great, and thanks. Let me ask a little 
bit more about local foods, and Senator Brown was talking about 
that, but local and regional food systems, because obviously 
USDA is playing a critical role, and there are opportunities 
now to reach to support more local processing or regional 
processing or urban agriculture or a whole range of things that 
really broaden people's understanding and support for 
agriculture as well as access to healthy foods.
    Would you talk a little bit more, from your perspective, 
about what it means to be building or strengthening local and 
regional food systems? I am assuming that you will work with 
this Committee and work with me to make sure we are doing that. 
I would love to have any further thoughts that you have on 
that.
    Ms. Torres Small. Rural Development has had a great 
opportunity in the wake of COVID to invest in food system 
resiliency, and a fundamental part of that is multiple options 
when it comes to markets. When I was in Florida, for example, I 
got the chance to meet a rancher who diversified his markets, 
investing in the bull line as well as cattle and grass-fed 
cattle, but also doing a U-pick blueberry, because he was 
connecting to people who were coming to visit Disney World but 
also wanted another experience. He was able to keep his farm in 
operation, even though he was facing significant land 
pressures, because he was finding ways to connect people to 
that new industry.
    I think there are opportunities like that, place-based 
opportunities, in Michigan with cherries, we should take great 
advantage of, and all across the country.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Great. Thank you very much. Senator 
Boozman.
    Senator Boozman. Thank you, Madam Chair, and Under 
Secretary Torres Small, we enjoyed you coming to Arkansas and 
really had a great discussion, lots of good questions. One of 
the things that came up repeatedly was what you said in your 
opening statement about the fact that you should not have to 
hire a grant-writer to be in a situation to access the programs 
that farmers and communities that are out there, but they are 
so difficult to access.
    One of the things that the Chair and I have been concerned 
about is getting specialty crops involved--and there are lots 
of programs for them, but many of these are small producers and 
they simply get frustrated. They do not understand how to work 
the system.
    Can you describe a little bit about what you have done, and 
are thinking about doing, to address this issue, and how those 
actions will inform other Department process reforms if you are 
confirmed?
    Ms. Torres Small. Thank you so much, Senator Boozman, for 
hosting that event, that listening session. Much of the work 
that we have done at Rural Development has come from sessions 
like that, where we learn about a problem and then do the 
investigation of how do we address it. ReConnect is a good 
example of how we are able to address some of those challenges.
    One of the things we heard from under-resourced communities 
is that they were having trouble coming up with a match to be 
able to qualify for ReConnect support for high-speed internet. 
We identified places where it made sense to remove that match 
so they could gain access, the places that needed it most.
    Another place that we have been able to make, that we are 
investing to make it more accessible is with our most direct 
customer, people who apply for mortgages through our Rural 
Housing Program. Through my service as Under Secretary for 
Rural Development we have prioritized investing in a new system 
that will make it easier, will compare with the private 
marketplace so that you can apply online, hopefully you can put 
in your information and a lot of it will pre-populate, all of 
the things that I took for granted when I took out my mortgage 
but right now is not available.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. USDA plays a critical role in 
representing the interests of farmers, foresters, and rural 
communities in informing other Federal agencies' actions that 
may impact agriculture in rural communities. It is notable that 
agencies like the FDA and EPA produce better regulations and 
programs when their USDA counterparts are involved. Examples 
include USDA's Office of Pest Management Policy's involvement 
in pesticides, APHIS's work on plant and animal biotechnology, 
USDA's leadership on Codex and food safety, et cetera.
    If confirmed, how will you engage other agencies, including 
FDA, EPA, and the other Departments of Labor, Transportation, 
to ensure their decisions fully consider the potential impact 
on America's farmers, ranchers, foresters, and rural 
communities? How are you going to work with others?
    Ms. Torres Small. This was a message I heard loud and 
clear, both in a staff interview and conversations with you and 
others, and it is something that I care a lot about as well. As 
Rural Development, we are the only agency that has a clear 
mission of serving rural America. When the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law passed and it did not include money through 
Rural Development for water and wastewater, but as someone who 
cares very deeply about that issue, we decided to work with EPA 
to find ways that we could leverage our expertise in rural 
areas and help make sure that States had the resources they 
needed and the support they needed to invest in rural areas. I 
am very proud that the Closing the Wastewater Access Gap has 
allowed us to partner in that way and find ways to better make 
sure those funds are working together.
    I think there are opportunities across the Federal 
Government to do similar work, where we are leveraging our 
rural experience and making sure that farmers and ranchers 
voices are heard.
    Senator Boozman. Very good. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Bennet.
    Senator Bennet. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair, and 
thank you very much, Ms. Torres Small, for being here. It is so 
wonderful to have a neighbor in this job and somebody who I 
know understands the challenges that we are facing out in 
Colorado and across the Rocky Mountain West. I also want to 
thank you for coming to the San Luis Valley and visiting our 
farmers there. You have an open invitation to come back any 
time you want. We would love to have you.
    We had a chance to catch up a little bit about the red tape 
at the Department of Agriculture when you were in my office the 
other day discussing this hearing. I recently heard about 
another case. This case was in Mineral County, Colorado, very, 
very rural Colorado, a county in my State with a population of 
only 865 people, but geographically large at the same time.
    Mineral County received a Rural Development Community 
Facilities Grant, which is the good news. Prior to accessing 
these funds they had to draft a request for a proposal that 
took two months for USDA to approve. Then they had to advertise 
the Request for Proposals in a printed newspaper three times, 
to meet the eligibility requirements. It took this county, with 
a staff of only three people, an extra year to access the grant 
funds because of these outdated and, in my opinion, unnecessary 
requirements. I do not think this is how our Rural Development 
programs should function. I think we can agree, I hope, that we 
need to streamline applications, we need to reduce the burden 
of our small towns and rural communities and local businesses 
and family farms and ranchers.
    For me these are not just words. I have been on this 
Committee for 14 years, and I feel like things have not gotten 
better in terms of what our farmers and ranchers, and rural 
communities are saying.
    I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how you are 
going to approach this question of reducing unnecessary 
contracting requirements, which hold back programs like the 
Regional Conservation Partnership Program, so that we are in a 
position someday to not have the same conversation over and 
over and again. We owe it to the agriculture producers in this 
country who are actually just trying to do the right thing, for 
themselves and for their families and for their communities. 
How are we going to know that we are actually making progress, 
finally eliminating some of this delay and red tape?
    Ms. Torres Small. Thank you so much, Senator Bennet, for 
continuing to push us on this.
    Senator Bennet. Well, I have not pushed on you very 
successfully so far.
    Ms. Torres Small. Well, speaking of the Community 
Facilities Grant in Mineral County, I believe it was a woman 
from Creede that I spoke to about this issue. It does appear 
that we were able to resolve it. However----
    Senator Bennet. Okay----
    Ms. Torres Small.--it took way too long.
    Senator Bennet [continuing]. you are hired for knowing 
that, first of all, so thank you.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Torres Small. I spoke directly with her, and it did 
take too long. My understanding of what it was, was it was a 
design-to-build plan, and so Rural Development has some current 
requirement that you should have to have a competitive bid.
    Now I agree with you that sometimes in rural places that 
does not work, and finding an engineer is really hard. The more 
you are able to bring us these challenges, we can dig into the 
details, find out what the problem is, fix it for that person, 
but also look at the policy behind that. Because here there was 
an exception process, but it was burdensome. How do we make 
sure that the exception process recognizes that there is maybe 
only a staff of two people in that office.
    Senator Bennet. I have been around this long enough to know 
that the Department is full of well-intentioned people, whether 
they are in Washington or whether they are out in Colorado. 
Actually when I say ``full,'' that is not accurate either, 
because there are a lot of places where we have got empty FSA 
offices and other offices, and that is clearly an issue that we 
need to deal with together.
    We have got to realign the incentives at the Department so 
that we are being timely and being responsive and being 
flexible.
    I am now out of time, so I will send you the other 
questions, which are about drought, and are about our forests, 
but they are all related. I look forward to helping you put us 
in the position to have a different conversation than the one 
that we have been having over the last 10 years or so. Thank 
you. Thank you for your willingness to serve.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. We all look 
forward to working on these in the context of this farm bill, 
so thank you for your leadership.
    Senator Hyde-Smith.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Chairwoman Stabenow and 
Ranking Member Boozman, for hosting this, and thank you for 
being willing to serve and stepping up and mainly for your 
pleasant disposition. You can just tell, you are so willing and 
eager to do this. That is a great attribute.
    Under Secretary, Americans' robust science-based pesticide 
regulatory system is essential to assuring consumers of the 
safety of pesticide products, which are vital in protecting our 
Nation's food supply. The USDA Office of Pest Management Policy 
develops and coordinates the Department's policy on pesticides 
and integrated pest management. Further, OPMP provides vital 
input and data to EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs in 
reviewing the registration and re-registration of crop 
protection tools.
    Ensuring EPA conducts a timely, predictable, transparent, 
and science-based review of these products is critical in order 
for producers to have access to safe and effective tools to 
protect against the pests and the diseases. If confirmed, what 
steps will you take to ensure OPMP continues its essential 
interagency work with EPA in the registration and re-
registration of crop protection tools, and how will you ensure 
the benefits and impacts to agriculture are appropriately 
considered in EPA's review process?
    Ms. Torres Small. Senator Hyde-Smith, thanks so much for 
this question and your clear attention to detail here. It is 
something that was brought up also in my staff interview and 
was very illustrative of the role that USDA plays in making 
sure that farmers and ranchers and their opinions are 
communicated across not just USDA but across the Federal 
Government, and also building a strong system of communication 
so that we are all working together.
    On issues like this in the past I have been involved, not 
with pesticides but with multiple agency interactions. From 
Rural Development one thing I have learned is that 
communication is key, and that sometimes even within our own 
department we are not always talking to each other. Making sure 
that we are busting those silos across mission areas is really 
important, so that we can leverage, as you mentioned, the 
science, the experience, the economics, all of those pieces, to 
look at the issue.
    In this case, regarding pesticides, I did commit in the 
staff interview to learning more about the issue and making 
sure that USDA is helping provide, in our areas of expertise, 
information to the agency.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you for those comments. As a 
former Ag Commissioner we have had lots of issues there, and it 
brings back flashbacks, actually.
    If confirmed, will you work to ensure OPMP has the staffing 
and resources that it needs? In your testimony you mentioned 
USDA's issues with staffing, retention, and low employee 
morale. I recently discussed USDA's issue with attracting and 
retaining APHIS and Food Safety Inspection Services 
veterinarians with Secretary Vilsack at an Agriculture 
Appropriations Subcommittee hearing. I would like to followup 
with you.
    I think it is very important to Congress to closely examine 
this, given the current highly pathogenic avian influenza 
outbreak, something that used to keep me awake at night. 
Although APHIS is doing the best it can in the midst of the 
worst animal health emergency in U.S. history, it is clear that 
the agency needs to improve staffing resources.
    Please tell us more about what your plan will be to address 
these staffing issues at USDA, if confirmed, specifically in 
regard to the shortage of veterinarians in APHIS and FSIS, and 
what we, as Congress, need to consider for how to best support 
your efforts there.
    Ms. Torres Small. First, thank you so much for your focus 
on employees and that strong connection to customer service 
that is a fundamental part of who USDA is. In my experience at 
Rural Development I have certainly seen the challenges when it 
comes to recruitment, making sure that we have the best 
applicants, as well as hiring and making sure that we are 
dedicating resources to hiring.
    It has been a challenge, and I will just be very honest 
with you. Sometimes with the budget we have to hire in fits and 
starts, and that impacts our ability to recruit because we do 
not have just a regular system of hiring.
    It is something that I have worked to pay a lot of 
attention to, also on the training and onboarding piece, right, 
how do we make sure, as we bring people on they have the 
training for customer service, they know where all of the 
levers are that they can pull in order to best serve someone, 
and that they practice a strong culture.
    One of the things I have also learned is that each mission 
area, or even each agency within Rural Development has 
different needs. In other places they have the funds to do the 
hiring, but now it is about building back up that system, or 
making sure that there is adequate understanding of the 
complexity of the positions so that they are graded at the 
right level.
    One of the things I truly hope to get to work on, if 
confirmed as Deputy Secretary, is making sure that the 
Department has the resources to analyze their specific 
challenges and build a program around the needs, focusing on 
customer service.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, and I am out of time, but I 
want to submit a question about chronic wasting disease as 
well, so I will do that. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you so much. Senator Ernst.
    Senator Ernst. Thank you so much, Madam Chair and Ranking 
Member, and thank you, Under Secretary Torres Small, for being 
here today and for your testimony. I appreciate our 
conversation yesterday in the office. It was as really great 
conversation, and I appreciate our shared background of growing 
up in rural America. You can tell your love of rural America 
just shows through, whether it is through your testimony, 
whether it is through those private conversations, but I truly 
do appreciate you.
    Personal opinion, but I think we need a lot more women like 
you serving in agriculture and making sure that our farmers and 
our ranchers and producers are not just simply surviving but 
thriving. I am glad that you are also on that mission with me. 
I cannot overstate that point enough, and it is comforting to 
see your openness, your willingness, again, to address today's 
challenges and complex issues to make sure that this happens 
for those folks living in the rural areas.
    On that note I do want to get into a few more specifics 
about concerns that constituents bring to me as I am going out, 
river to river, in the great State of Iowa, visiting all of our 
99 counties, just all across the State. Great, great people.
    Number 1, will you commit to modernizing and strengthening 
AFIDA and work with my staff to provide technical assistance?
    Ms. Torres Small. Thank you so much for bringing up this 
issue. As a former Member of Congress, having served on both 
the Armed Services Committee and the Homeland Security 
Committee, as well as Agriculture, I certainly understand that 
nexus of knowing agricultural land and who is owning it. I 
certainly commit to working with you on this issue, learning 
more about it, recognizing that there are some real challenges. 
We talked about the paper and the systems, and that there is 
not a clear, one-size-fits-all for all of the different State 
and local processes for land ownership. I certainly know that 
this is an interest of yours, and I appreciate the chance to 
get to work with you.
    Senator Ernst. Great. Thank you. Will you commit to 
supporting animal disease management through electronic ID tag 
support and new vaccine developments?
    Ms. Torres Small. This is something that has come on my 
radar as Under Secretary for Rural Development through meat 
processing, because of the highly pathogenic avian influenza 
and the challenges there when it comes to meat processing, 
although not within my purview of certainly seeing the impact 
that education and testing has had in reducing cases for highly 
pathogenic avian influenza, and also the value of REE and the 
work that they are doing to address the disease as well.
    Senator Ernst. Good. Thank you. Will you commit to sharing 
overall foodstock availability and the importance of the 
biofuels market to the rural economy with the EPA as they 
determine renewable volume obligations?
    Ms. Torres Small. This is an issue that you and Senator 
Klobuchar have brought up to me and recognize that my role 
currently does not work directly with the RVOs, recognizing 
that USDA has a lot of information that is important to share 
as EPA comes to those considerations.
    Senator Ernst. You have a lot of information and great 
voices as well coming from USDA, and hopefully can help shape 
and influence the EPA.
    Then do you agree that on-farm practices such as no-till, 
cover cropping, or precision technology help reduce carbon 
emissions, and if yes, will you advocate for the use of the 
GREET model to ensure lifecycle emissions of biofuels take full 
account of climate-smart agriculture?
    Ms. Torres Small. I really appreciate this question. You 
mentioned my rural roots. My aunt and uncle ranched in 
Colorado, and I spent summers up there, and I know how hard 
this work is. Trusting farmers and ranchers is really 
important. My uncle really wanted to have a role in preserving 
wetlands and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I think there 
is an opportunity to work with farmers and ranchers who want to 
do that, and I look forward to learning more about the issues 
specifically with you.
    Senator Ernst. Very good. Very good. Thank you very much. 
Thank you, Madam Chair, and I look forward to supporting your 
confirmation. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Terrific. Senator Smith.
    Senator Smith. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking Member, 
and Under Secretary Torres Small, welcome back to the 
Committee. It is great to see you here.
    I want to just start by saying I have been so impressed by 
your work, and particularly your commitment to get out of 
Washington and get around the country and really listen to 
people and talk to people. I know as Under Secretary you came 
to Minnesota, and we had a great visit. We visited a creamery 
in central Minnesota that was called Ten Finns Creamery, named 
after the 10 children, I think, that this dairy had. Although 
they then had two more children. They did not want to change 
the branding, though, to 12 Finns.
    We had a great visit and you listened really, really hard, 
and I appreciate that so much. Also you came before my 
Subcommittee on Housing to talk about the Rural Housing 
Service, so I want to touch on that in a minute.
    I want to start talking a little bit, going a little bit 
deeper into this staffing issue, that you referred to in your 
opening testimony and that we have been talking about. We all 
know that FSA and its agents are just so crucial in bringing 
kind of customer-facing tool for farmers and ranchers and 
producers.
    I frequently hear, in Minnesota, about staffing issues at 
local FSA offices. There is a need for increased cultural 
competency as agents are understanding the world that they are 
operating in, the different folks that they are dealing with, 
and also newer USDA programs, especially the programs around 
climate-smart agriculture. Sometimes when programs get rolled 
out not everybody is saying exactly the same thing about them.
    Secretary Vilsack, I would add, has mentioned in his 
testimony about how the compensation structure and the system 
for Farm Service Agency staff is not as competitive as it once 
was, and that creates problems for retention. We have lots of 
retirements, so it is a big challenge.
    Could you just talk a bit about what your strategy would be 
for improving staffing at USDA, particularly at local agencies 
that are so much customer facing?
    Ms. Torres Small. This is a crucial question, and from my 
Rural Development perspective it is exceptionally important, 
because 38 percent of our employees at Rural Development are 
eligible to retire in the next five years. This is a very key 
moment where we have got to identify how we are recruiting and 
hiring the best of the best, how we are making sure that we are 
training, we are leveraging that incredible experience that is 
still at Rural Development to train, and how we are preparing 
for that loss.
    One of the things I have learned at Rural Development is 
that you have to look at the situation from a few different 
standpoints. What is our budget to do hiring and how can we 
think as flexibly as possible? Where are the other places where 
other services might be helpful to lighten the load for staff? 
Then what is the long-term plan about where you want your team 
to be?
    If confirmed as Deputy Secretary, I will be a level away 
from those plans, but understand the importance of supporting 
mission areas in determining those plans, and if they have 
resources to do so. If they are thinking about, for example, 
the compensation structure, making sure that and working with 
their teams about how to show the complexity of the works that 
is done, and also what is the ability to progress quickly 
within a grade level, for example.
    Senator Smith. Thank you. I agree with all of that, and I 
think that we are a policy committee and not an appropriations 
committee. The discussions that we are having about how we set 
funding targets for agencies, including USDA, I think your 
points are just so good about how important it is that we set 
the right targets so that we are not actually cutting USDA, 
which some would be proposing, but we are figuring out how to 
make sure that you have the resources to do the service that we 
need.
    I just have a minute left, but I want to just thank you so 
much for your partnership as Senator Rounds and I have worked 
together on--I am introducing the Rural Housing Service Reform 
Act. This is our bill to modernize and update the essential 
programs of the Rural Housing Service, which are so important 
to small towns and rural places around the country. You and 
your staff have been extremely helpful in putting together that 
bill, which I believe will have strong bipartisan support.
    Could you just talk a bit about that work and how important 
you see it from your perspective in Rural Development?
    Ms. Torres Small. Folks do not always know this, but Rural 
Development has about a third of the housing that HUD has. They 
do not think of us as providing crucial, affordable housing in 
rural America, so that seniors can age in place and that 
working single parents can own their own homes.
    Administrator Altoro of the Rural Housing Service is 
working incredibly hard to make sure that these programs are 
even more accessible, and we deeply appreciate the chance to 
work with you and provide any technical assistance that you 
might require on your legislation. Really have appreciated the 
conversations that we have had so far.
    Senator Smith. Thank you very much. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Braun.
    Senator Braun. Thank you, Madam Chair. I enjoyed our 
meeting last week. We had a good, lively conversation.
    As I told you then, the thing I hear overwhelmingly from 
farmers would be Waters of the U.S. That has whipsawed back and 
forth for a long, long time. It seems to have the rule tweaked 
or changed, depending on which administration is in place. I 
think farmers are getting fatigued from it. Their job has 
gotten even more complicated due to current markets and high 
inputs costs, all the complications of running that very 
difficult small business.
    By and large, I was sensing a big relief when the Trump 
rule, you know, was acknowledged, trying to implement it, and 
then, of course, the Administration has completely flipped it 
back to where I think it is going to be in that onerous side 
where farmers think it is above and beyond what is necessary in 
terms of their own stewardship on their own property.
    A couple of things. Is there any interest on your part, 
number 1, to listen to farmers, which I would hope would be so 
they can tell you what I hear all the time, where it is going 
they do not think there are marginal benefits to it. They think 
it is an example of government being overburdening. When I look 
at some of the stuff they are having to contend with, or when I 
looked at like our own State, when I was driving between where 
I live to the capital and saw probably $200 signs posted all 
along our new interstate when it was in a little hillside that 
would not ever have water in it, you know, more than a moment 
or two during a storm, to me that was something gone too far.
    Where are you at on that? It is what I am hearing. They do 
not like where the new rule is going to go. Do you agree with 
the new rule, or do you think it needs to be tweaked to a point 
of more practicality?
    Ms. Torres Small. First, I want to respond to your point 
about listening to farmers. I think that is a crucial part of 
the work at USDA, and making sure that folks are hearing 
concerns and ideas and thoughts from farmers and ranchers as 
they are considering regulations.
    We did speak about Waters of the United States when we met, 
and I really appreciated that. It is something that, when I 
worked for Senator Udall as a field representative years ago, 
was also an issue. That question of consistency, about going 
back and forth, I truly understand, because it is not just 
about the rule itself, but it is about is there a rule that can 
settle, that folks can find some peace with and everyone agree 
on.
    That is where the listening comes into play. I think it is 
important that all of us are listening to each other. I think 
it is important that USDA communicate in our area of expertise, 
and then also that we are honoring the science behind decisions 
as well.
    Senator Braun. 50 years ago, when stewardship and 
conservation and that whole idea of keeping soil on your farm 
probably had lots of room for improvement, I do not see that. I 
see most farmers now embracing cover crops and doing riparian 
buffers, doing grass waterways, doing all the things that looks 
like they are 90 percent of the way. Then I have a local farmer 
that gets run down by our own conservation officer because he 
is doing a little ditch maintenance in a ditch that never has 
any rain in it other than very, very occasionally.
    I would say, listen, I have not talked to one farmer or one 
small developer that thinks the new ruling is practical and is 
going to give marginal benefits beyond the marginal cost. That 
is my observation. Do what you said you were going to do. 
Listen to farmers. Hear it for yourself.
    The other thing I have farmers worried about conservation 
practices being a prerequisite for keeping their safety net in 
place. Are you for that, or do you think those should be 
completely unconnected?
    Ms. Torres Small. I have to admit this is a place where I 
do not have a lot of expertise currently in my role as Under 
Secretary for Rural Development. I have seen real impact on the 
value of providing opportunities and incentives-based programs, 
whether it is when it comes to emergency rural health care, 
when it comes to grants for meat and poultry processing. I do 
understand the value of incentives-based, and certainly if 
confirmed as Deputy Secretary, to commit to looking more into 
the issue.
    Senator Braun. I think if you do what you said you were 
going to do, listen to farmers, I would love to get a report 
back in three to four months if they are telling you what I 
have told you, and then what you think about it after you have 
listened. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Marshall.
    Senator Marshall. All right. Thank you, Madam Chair, and 
welcome Under Secretary. It is great to have you back in front 
of us. Congratulations on your nomination to be Deputy 
Secretary.
    We have literally asked some of our producers back home 
what questions do you want us to ask you, so these are from my 
producers. Basically, as Deputy Secretary, you will be the COO 
of the USDA. We have heard from our stakeholders who are 
concerned about USDA's ability to timely deliver assistance and 
service to farmers. How do you plan to staff up and ensure USDA 
remains customer service oriented?
    Ms. Torres Small. This is a crucial question, and it takes 
a lot of components, and it something I am eager to dive into. 
A key part of it is making sure that our team has the training 
and the tools that they need to deliver services timely, that 
they have the training when it comes to customer service, so 
they are responding in appropriate amounts of time. Also that 
there is good communication across the team so that if someone 
in the field has a question about how a program is 
administered, they have got a clear connection to be able to 
speak to somebody in the national office. That is the key 
reason why we established the State Office of Operations, to be 
able to facilitate that dialog better.
    It is also about making sure they have the tools that they 
need to do the job. Having updated technology systems, where 
you do not have to open six different programs to enter in one 
thing. Then it is about making sure that we are finding ways to 
simplify our processes, whether it is how do we get an 
environmental report, or an engineering report that is a little 
bit simpler, or that we are removing match requirements so that 
folks can better qualify for our programs.
    Senator Marshall. Okay. Thank you for the answer.
    The second part of the question is one you and I have 
talked about several times. Agriculture is not a job that is 
accomplished well from home. Our farmers and ranchers have to 
go out and work in the elements every day. They show up and 
they work literally sunup to sundown. I remain concerned that 
not just in the USDA but so many of our departments and Capitol 
Hill, people are working from home still.
    An old saying, if you cannot measure it, you cannot manage 
it. I am not looking for you to tell me how many people 
traditionally have worked from home, or they are on the road. 
Are people at USDA back to work in the office yet? How do you 
measure that, and what is your goal? What do you think it 
should look like?
    Ms. Torres Small. You know, I really appreciate you 
continuing to have this conversation with me because I agree 
with you that physical presence in the office matters. It 
matters that somebody can walk up to a field office and there 
is somebody there to open the door and talk to them about their 
challenges. I agree with you that sometimes it is easier for me 
to walk across the hall and ask a question rather than having 
to dial them up on Teams.
    I have also learned that flexibility is important too. We 
talked earlier about the challenges of recruiting people, with 
38 percent of our work force eligible to retire in the next 
five years. One of the first folks I met in Minnesota, who had 
just been hired during COVID, so he was really eager to 
interact with that RD culture, and he showed up in person at 
our meeting because he wanted to meet me in person. He was also 
asking to meet me in person because he wanted to see if it was 
at all possible to get a printer at his home, because sometimes 
it made more sense for him to print out the documents, that 
still have to be filed by paper, and go directly to a client 
rather than having to commute to the office first.
    Senator Marshall. Right.
    Ms. Torres Small. That flexibility is crucial for being 
able to recruit and retain----
    Senator Marshall. I respect that, but, you know, we signed 
up for these jobs. I signed up to be a physician. I did not 
have the choice of working from home. When people sign up to 
work for the government, no one said they could work from home. 
I think that we would be much better served to have our 
employees back to work, but I appreciate your answer.
    Second question is about the technology, you mentioned, and 
just the application process. Senator Boozman was in Kansas 
recently with me. Over and over we heard from farmers, ``We 
have to hire an accountant to fill out this application form.'' 
They have become overly complicated.
    I was working with my son just yesterday on his application 
for scholarship and school, and there is one form that works 
for every university. Our office is trying to streamline a 
uniform type of application process, streamline this. Are you 
committed to working with us and giving us the technical 
language to get the job done right?
    Ms. Torres Small. I really appreciate your interest in 
this. I think there is a lot of work to do. Online applications 
are crucial. It is something that we are working on in the 
housing space. We have also worked on it for the Rural Energy 
for America program.
    When it comes to one application for all programs, it can 
get quite complicated. For example, combining our WEP programs 
for water and wastewater with SRF funds, because each State 
delivers the SRF funds. It is really hard to create an 
application that would work for everything.
    I recognize that there would need to be some really good 
conversations to figure out what is possible, and I would love 
to have those conversations with you.
    Senator Marshall. Madam Chair, could I have one more 
question.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Yes, you may.
    Senator Marshall. I am over my time limit here.
    My producers back home feel like USDA is not fighting on 
their behalf when it comes to science. Many of our 
environmental precision agriculture practices are being shunned 
by the EPA. We feel like the EPA is not respecting the USDA 
scientists, especially when it comes to pesticides. We feel 
like the EPA is ignoring USDA's suggestions for atrazine 
mitigation practices. EPA has ignored USDA's suggestions for 11 
safe uses of chlorpyrifos, and the DOJ sent a single email at a 
late time regarding the Ninth Circuit preemption case.
    Will you be our fighter? Will you be there fighting to 
represent agriculture, my producers, when it comes to working 
with the EPA and other departments at the White House?
    Ms. Torres Small. If confirmed as Deputy Secretary a 
fundamental part of my job is the interagency collaboration, 
and part of that from USDA is making sure that I am listening 
to farmers and ranchers in rural communities and also 
communicating our expertise at USDA to our sister agencies.
    Senator Marshall. Thank you so much. We look forward to 
supporting your nomination, and we know you will do a great 
job. Let us look forward to continuing the relationship and 
working together. Thank you.
    [Pause.]
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Senator Klobuchar.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you, Ms. Torres Small. I have 
enjoyed our discussion and also--sorry, I just got back. We had 
a big Commerce markup on the train derailment bill that we got 
through the committee, that Committee member Brown and Senator 
Vance are leading, and I am a co-sponsor, so I appreciate that.
    You have done a good job as Under Secretary of Rural 
Development, and we thank you for that, and I know that you 
will continue to be a strong advocate for our farmers and 
ranchers and rural communities.
    My first question, as co-chair of the Senate Broadband 
Caucus is about that area of our work that we are doing right 
now. I think the pandemic put a big magnifying glass on 
problems for rural areas. Do you agree that providing broadband 
internet access is a key rural development priority, and could 
you talk about getting the USDA portion of the funds out as 
soon as possible?
    Ms. Torres Small. First, just thanks so much to you and to 
Congress for the investment in high-speed internet. I think it 
is a truly needed thing that we have seen play out in the 
pandemic, but also since then when it comes to access to health 
care close to home and making sure that folks have good 
educational resources as well, and the chance to do their 
homework, actually, at home.
    Rural Development received about $2 billion in high-speed 
internet funds through ReConnect, and Administrator Berge has 
been working incredibly hard to get that out. In fact, we 
believe that by the end of the summer all of the funds will be 
awarded.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Very good. Thank you.
    Biofuel infrastructure, last Congress I led a bill with 
Senator Ernst that invested $500 million in funding for grants 
for fueling stations. I know the Secretary knows a lot about 
biofuels, coming from Iowa. The bill was included in the 
Inflation Reduction Act, thanks to Senator Stabenow's 
leadership. Both consumers and retailers are eager to see these 
funds be made available.
    Could you work with me to ensure these grants are 
distributed as soon as possible, maybe give me a status report 
on that?
    Ms. Torres Small. Thank you for that investment and also 
for your collaboration. We were talking about biofuels earlier 
as well. It is a crucial part of the Inflation Reduction Act. 
It is a crucial part of the Administration's approach to 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At Rural Development I have 
had the chance to learn a lot about it.
    We have distributed funds through HBIIP previously. We have 
announced those awards, that availability already when it comes 
to the Inflation Reduction Act funds.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Thank you. Minnesota is home to 
the Nation's largest producer of sugarbeets, something people 
do not always know. Some of it is that it is so cold in the 
northern part of our State that it is a natural freezer that 
goes well into May, in the ground. Could you talk about the 
fact that recently there have been increases in foreign imports 
above and beyond our WTO commitments. As you know, decisions on 
the sugar program are coordinated between USDA's Trade and 
Foreign Agricultural Affairs and Farm Production and 
Conservation mission areas. I hope that you will advocate for a 
seat at the table for any decisions made regarding the sugar 
program and work to ensure that the program does not exceed our 
import obligations under the WTO.
    Ms. Torres Small. Thank you for your advocacy on this. This 
is not something that I am very familiar with in my purview of 
Under Secretary for Rural Development, but I look forward to 
diving into it. I am very familiar with sugarbeet production 
and have had good conversations with farmers and their 
cooperative work in the Midwest. I know that Under Secretary 
Alexis Taylor is paying close attention to this issue and 
understands the current stock-to-use ratio is 13.5 to 15.5.
    Senator Klobuchar. Okay. Thank you.
    Last, as the average age of farmers continues to creep 
upward, it has become harder for beginning farmers to get 
established in agriculture. By the way, there are a lot of 
answers to our work force issues in ag country. One of them, I 
strongly believe, is immigration reform and looking at lifting 
some of the caps as well as being smart about spouses working. 
I think every one of our States, from red States to blue and in 
between, is dealing with this.
    The other thing we have to do I just make sure those 
beginning farmers and ranchers are able to get into the 
business. I worked to assist beginning farmers by reducing the 
cost of accessing crop insurance and incentivizing landowners 
with expiring CRP contracts to sell to beginning farmers.
    What are your thoughts on assisting beginning farmers to 
overcome the challenges they face in getting a foothold in 
agriculture?
    Ms. Torres Small. From my purview in Rural Development I 
have run into farmers who are trying to add value through our 
Value-Added Producer Grants, for example, and also trying to 
find new markets. One of the things when I talk to beginning 
farmers the biggest challenge is access to land. Recognizing 
that need and helping to try, I certainly think there is an 
opportunity for USDA to support those issues.
    It is also about, a farmer from New Mexico could tell his 
story of the development of his farm through the new tractors 
that he was able to first rent and then buy. Through RMAP 
within Rural Development there is a very small amount that is 
able to be used for farm equipment, but I know that working 
closely with FSA is crucial to be able to support new and 
beginning farmers.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you.
    Senator Lujan.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Under Secretary Torres Small, first I just want to say how 
proud I am to be here today with you, as a New Mexican, to 
watch your growth, your advocacy for people, and your ability 
to work across the aisle. It is incredible, and it reminds us 
of the tradition that has come out of New Mexico, with former 
United States Senator Pete Domenici, former United States 
Representative Manuel Lujan, who both had reputations of 
working with Democratic colleagues to prioritize New Mexico and 
make a profound difference across America. You reflect the very 
best of what that means. I just want to say thank you for 
continuing to move forward in accepting responsibilities that 
will transform the United States and transform New Mexico.
    One area that I have been asking many questions is 
surrounding historically underserved communities to the United 
States Department of Agriculture. I know this Administration 
has prioritized removing barriers for historically underserved 
communities, and the Department recently released an interim 
recommendation, a report that came out of their Equity 
Commission.
    Under Secretary, as Deputy Secretary how will you work to 
remove barriers for historically underserved communities to 
take advantage and be able to access more of the United States 
Department of Agriculture's programs?
    Ms. Torres Small. I know there was a Subcommittee hearing 
recently where a fellow New Mexican, a hard-working farmer, 
came and testified and talk about how he did not always feel 
like USDA programs were meant for him. That is a statement that 
I carry with me, recognizing that it is our job to make sure 
that farmers know, and underserved people in rural America know 
that our programs are meant for them.
    That means making sure that we have got the right approach 
to customer service, it means finding the things that are hard, 
that are cumbersome, and making them more accessible, and it 
means working together, if there are questions about technical 
assistance or challenges that might be legal, to be able to 
provide that information.
    One of the things that I am really proud of is through 
ReConnect we have been able to make that program significantly 
more accessible by reducing the match requirements and by 
focusing portions of the funds in the areas that need it most.
    I think there are a lot of lessons to be learned from 
ReConnect that hopefully, as we look at some of our older 
programs, because there are 50 programs in Rural Development. 
There are even tons more all across USDA. We have got to look 
at each and every one and figure out how we can make sure that 
people know that our programs are meant for them.
    Senator Lujan. I very much appreciate that and agree with 
that.
    One other area that I have been hearing more and more about 
from families across New Mexico, and it turns out that this 
seems to hold true across America. Even with the investment 
that came with the Inflation Reduction Act of nearly $20 
billion, we continue to hear how NRCS is overprescribed. We 
know that this program can make or break a small, single-use, 
small farm, small acreage, or a large producer across America. 
Especially because of the fires in New Mexico, I have learned 
more and more about the need for improvement with NRCS as well, 
to make sure that it can work when it is needed most.
    That plus EQIP, you know, I also believe, Madam Chair, that 
we could be doing a whole lot more for water conservation with 
another overprescribed program as well, and having irrigated 
all morning Monday, I certainly know where all the gopher holes 
are back at home now myself. I can see how that makes a 
profound difference for everyone.
    Nonetheless, Under Secretary Torres, what will you do to 
ensure that USDA can deliver the critical conservation programs 
and other IRA provisions needed to support farming and 
ranching, like NRCS and EQIP?
    Ms. Torres Small. Even from Rural Development I know how in 
demand NRCS programs are. A county commissioner from New 
Mexico, who was in the burn scar, came up to me just recently 
and said, ``We need NRCS.'' And one, that speaks to the value 
of the program, but two, that speaks to the demand of the 
program. And when programs are oversubscribed it can be hard to 
also say we need to make them more accessible. I understand 
that and really appreciate your advocacy here.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator Welch.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. I am proud to be a 
former colleague, and it is wonderful to have you here, and I 
also want to just acknowledge the great work that Xochitl 
Torres Small has done for us in Vermont, paying a visit and 
meeting with our rural folks. Thank you very much.
    I just have one question because I think you have covered 
most of the terrain. Senator Marshall asked you about working 
back in the office, and I think it is a fair question, and I 
know it is an issue that, coming out of COVID, people with 
significant managerial responsibilities have to address. There 
are advantages to being in the office. There are advantages, I 
know, in terms of recruiting the absolute best people to have 
some flexibility. I know this is something on your mind and on 
the mind of all of our folks with significant managerial 
responsibilities.
    I just want you to comment on your thoughts on how best to 
address this and how you would approach it.
    Ms. Torres Small. I so appreciate how many times you said 
``balance'' in that question, because it truly is a balance. As 
a former Member of Congress I know how important constituent 
services is, and being in the office can make a difference, 
making sure that people can come and knock on your door. Having 
the best and the brightest and being able to recruit those 
folks is also crucial. Being able to also retain them.
    About two weeks ago, I attended a retirement party for 
someone who has been working for Rural Development longer than 
I have been alive. He knows multifamily housing, inside and 
out, and was helping us figure out how to break down some of 
the silos, how to make sure that we are entering into contracts 
and saving multifamily housing properties faster.
    When we are trying to keep someone like that and make sure 
we are utilizing that experience as much as possible, I want 
all of the flexibilities available in order to leverage that 
knowledge for the last few years of their work here.
    Another way that we have seen the flexibility work is 
actually support the RD culture. For example, the technology 
that was provided during COVID, when many people had to work 
from home, allows them to now interact not just with their 
office, their area office, but with the entire State, because 
there are offices all across the State, and then also with the 
national office. I think that is kind of similar to the 
challenges that you see with a congressional office or a Senate 
office, where you are bridging that divide between the national 
policy piece and the folks who are experiencing it on the 
ground.
    There are all sorts of opportunities that we can leverage 
if we find the right balance, and if I am confirmed as Deputy 
Secretary, it is something I am committed to doing.
    Senator Welch. Thank you very much. I yield back.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Thank you very much. Senator 
Fetterman.
    Senator Fetterman. It is so great to see you again. I do 
not even need to wear my glasses.
    You came to my office for about 30 minutes, and we had a 
great conversation. I have the kind of sentiments of my 
colleague from New Mexico, beautiful State, and my departed one 
from Vermont. I have got to honestly say you are supremely 
qualified, and I am really just looking forward to voting for 
your support. I suspect a lot my colleagues will as well, too. 
I think we would be lucky to have you in our service and this 
new proposed rule.
    I am ceding the rest of my time back to the Chair. Thank 
you.
    Chairwoman Stabenow. Wonderful. Well, thank you so much. I 
think we have come to the end of the hearing. We want to thank 
you again for all of your comments and views and for working 
with us so closely, and I think it is very clear that there is 
strong bipartisan support for moving you forward to this new 
opportunity of leadership in the USDA.
    This concludes our hearing. The record will remain open 
until Friday, May 12th, at 5 p.m., for members to submit 
additional questions and statements.
    The hearing is adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 11:23 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
