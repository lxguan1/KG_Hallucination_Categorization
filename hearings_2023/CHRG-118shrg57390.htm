        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 11:04 a.m., in 
room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria 
Cantwell, Chair of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Cantwell [presiding], Klobuchar, Markey, 
Peters, Baldwin, Sinema, Rosen, Lujan, Hickenlooper, Welch, 
Cruz, Thune, Wicker, Fischer, Sullivan, Blackburn, Young, Budd,

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. Good morning. The Commerce Committee will come 
to order. Today, the Commerce Committee is meeting to consider 
the nomination of Gigi Sohn to be a Commissioner for the 
Federal Communications Commission.
    This committee has already held two previous hearings on 
her nomination, and so we know a lot about her background, her 
views, and important transparency issues, and we thank her for 
being here again today. If we want someone on the Federal 
Communications Commission who is truly committed to the job, 
then I believe Ms. Sohn fits that bill.
    She has a very long history at being part of a process at 
the FCC, and she is qualified. She will help deliver for the 
American people, and she has a keen eye on something that all 
members of this committee care passionately about, and that is 
affordable, accessible broadband.
    Thank you for your leadership and your advocacy on that 
issue. Although she has been before our committee, she has now 
been criticized for important policies like standing up for 
free speech. I want to thank you for your policy positions, 
knowing that some same people like Justice Gorsuch or Rand Paul 
or many others believe in the Fourth Amendment.
    Thank you for articulating those views as well. These 
personal attacks are a distraction from the fact that Ms. Sohn 
is immensely qualified for this position and a highly effective 
would-be FCC Commissioner.
    She has more than 30 years of experience working on 
telecommunications policy, including as senior adviser to 
Chairman Wheeler at the FCC. She is a prominent voice in the 
telecommunications area and importantly, as I mentioned, on 
accessibility and affordability. And if confirmed, she would be 
the first openly gay Commissioner of the FCC.
    Ms. Sohn has a history of putting the public interest 
first, regardless of whether that means supporting policies 
endorsed by Republicans or Democrats. She is well known for 
convening a broad range of stakeholders from both sides of the 
aisle on almost every part of the debate that we are looking 
at, regulatory frameworks, broadband deployment, broadcast 
issues, and mass media in the marketplace.
    This is why her nomination is supported by such a diverse 
group of people, former Mississippi Representative Chip 
Pickering, who stated that Ms. Sohn will be a great advocate 
and championing of the principles of competition and the First 
Amendment.
    Preston Padden, Former President of ABC and Founding 
Executive Director of Fox Broadcast, who stated that she has 
worked with and against--with various individuals for 30 years 
and is one of the most prepared and experienced nominees. And 
Mr. Chris Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax, who has urged the confirmation 
of Ms. Sohn's nomination and the fact that she is committed to 
promoting diversity, localism, and competition in the 
marketplace.
    So, it is no surprise that Ms. Sohn's career includes 
helping to ensure the carriages of all voices are heard. This 
is something this committee has to continue to work on, and I 
work--welcome the opportunity to work with my colleague, the 
Ranking Member, on this important issue. I know he has many 
views on this as well.
    But those many voices do include Fox Broadcasting, Newsmax, 
and OAN Networks, some of the very same networks that our 
colleague wrote a letter about when they were de-platforming 
the large cable providers. So, Ms. Sohn has been a consistent 
advocate for pro-consumers, common sense policies such as 
lowering the cost of broadband and working toward universal 
connectivity.
    Given that there is a great deal of work that needs to be 
done on this issue at the FCC, it is time to have a full 
Commission. We know that just a sampling of the work includes 
the oversight of their mapping efforts, making sure that we put 
a stop to robocalls, caller ID spoofing, ensuring the United 
States adopts cutting edge and forward-looking spectrum 
policies, and many other issues.
    I know she will be that voice and it is critical that we 
have one right now. We know that she is capable of helping us 
implement what are the broadband deployments that we have just 
put a lot of resources against.
    But I would ask those who are trying to reposition Ms. Sohn 
to think about who it is you are really advocating for, the 
billions of people--billions of dollars that people want to 
continue to have in expensive broadband, or the policies that 
will help us get true competition in the marketplace and 
finally deploy the types of broadband services that every 
American deserves.
    I hope that our hearing will help bring these issues that 
haven't been brought to light, further, to light, and that we 
have a healthy discussion, but we continue to respect the 
witness and her willingness to serve us at the FCC.
    And with that, I will turn it over to my colleague, the 
Ranking Member, Senator Cruz.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS

    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. And Madam Chair, I 
also appreciate your delaying this markup an hour so that we 
can all attend the classified briefing. It is important to 
members on both sides. We were very interested in doing so. 
Vetting a nominee to the Federal Communications Commission is a 
serious task.
    The FCC is an agency with vast power over how Americans 
communicate and what information they access. It is also an 
agency with a history of abusing vague statutory provisions to 
pursue partisan policy goals.
    We know enough from today's extreme left what happens when 
power is put in the wrong hands. It doesn't take much to 
imagine a partisan FCC going down a dark path of attempting to 
censor what we see, hear, read, and ultimately think.
    As such, our responsibility as Senators is to make sure 
that an FCC nominee not only has the expertise to be an 
independent regulator, but also possesses good judgment and 
temperament. The nominee must be fair, ethical, and perhaps 
most importantly, honest.
    On all of these fronts, this nominee has failed to meet the 
standard. There is a reason why we are on our third nomination 
hearing for Ms. Sohn. Both during this process and in her 
previous positions, she has shown herself to be a partisan who 
lacks the impartiality and candor necessary to serve in a 
leadership position at a powerful, independent regulatory 
agency.
    And she has repeatedly displayed bad judgment and 
questionable ethics. She is associated herself repeatedly with 
the most radical views on the far left. I want to break down 
each of these points, but first, let's recap how we got here.
    In March 2020, Ms. Sohn joined the board of a streaming 
service called Locast, despite knowing that it was embroiled in 
a lawsuit arising from the group's piracy of broadcast content. 
The following year, the White House began vetting her for a 
spot on the FCC. During the vetting process, a reasonable 
individual might have stepped aside from Locast but Ms. Sohn 
did not.
    Despite being considered to regulate the very same 
companies that were suing her organization for stealing from 
them, Ms. Sohn remained on Locast board. Then in the fall of 
2021, a Federal Judge found that Locast had engaged illegal 
behavior, ordered it to stop operating, and awarded statutory 
damages of $32 million to the broadcasters. On October 26, 
2021, President Biden announced his intent to nominate Ms. 
Sohn. Just 1 day later, Ms. Sohn signed an agreement settling 
the lawsuit.
    Ms. Sohn then hid significant details about the settlement 
from this committee. She actively misled Senators about the 
settlement's dollar value and her ability to share settlement 
information with the Committee. It is clear why. The settlement 
was a sweetheart deal. The broadcasters drastically reduced her 
organization's penalty by 98 percent, literally $0.02 on the 
dollar, from $32 million to $700,000.
    It was already improper that she executed a settlement with 
the broadcasters at the very same time she was being nominated 
to the FCC. But to then cut a sweetheart deal with them and to 
be dishonest with it, with members of this committee, is 
disqualifying. A basic requirement for public officials is 
trustworthiness. And on that front, Ms. Sohn has failed.
    If Ms. Sohn's brazen theft of intellectual property, her 
lack of candor, and her conflicts of interest weren't 
disqualifying on their own, then her long record of poor 
judgment should seal her fate. Just this past year, while her 
nomination was pending, Ms. Sohn was making multiple financial 
donations to Senators who were charged with voting on her 
confirmation.
    Had this been done by a Republican nominee, I have no doubt 
that my Democrat colleagues and their media allies would be 
apoplectic at this point. But sadly, this level of unseemliness 
is a pattern with Ms. Sohn.
    She has engaged in extreme vitriol against her political 
opponents repeatedly, and she has endorsed far left radicals' 
character assassination attempts against numerous Republican 
and Democrat Senators, indeed multiple Senators sitting on this 
committee.
    She has deep ties to far-left organizations, engages 
repeatedly in partisan attacks, and has also promoted anti-
police views. For example, she retweeted and liked post by 
Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling for defunding 
the police.
    And in July 2020, during riots in Portland, Oregon, she 
retweeted a post attacking Federal law enforcement officers as, 
``armed goons in riot gear with tear gas.'' It is no surprise 
that her nomination is opposed by multiple law enforcement 
groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the 
National Sheriffs Association.
    Ms. Sohn portrays herself as a defender of free speech, but 
she has a history of campaigning to censor conservatives. She 
calls Fox News, ``dangerous to our democracy,'' and has urged 
the FCC to revoke Sinclair's broadcast licenses. At the same 
time, she has a history of fighting against the indecency 
regulations that protect children from exposure to filth on TV.
    To Ms. Sohn, it seems that conservative speech is worse 
than obscenity. Madam Chairwoman, I do not believe this is a 
nomination that will earn the votes to be confirmed, and I do 
not believe her record is suitable to serve on the FCC.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Cruz. I am going to call on 
the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, Senator Lujan.

               STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, Ranking 
Member Cruz. As the Chair of the Subcommittee, it is an honor 
to be here before you. Now, Ms. Sohn, it has been a year since 
you were last before the Committee. Unfortunately, I missed 
your second hearing. I had a stroke, and it means a lot that 
you are back here so that I can fully participate in now your 
third hearing.
    In all full seriousness, I hope that there is a serious 
conversation today about your dedication and qualifications, 
and especially the dire need to fill the FCC. It has been 755 
days that we don't have a full functioning FCC.
    I know that we want to get there. I hope that that's 
something that is supported by the entirety of the membership 
of this body. With each additional day, more ink is spilled 
over this nomination. Frankly, we get more deliberate attempts 
to extend this vacancy for as long as possible.
    Now, I would like to take my time today to clarify the 
record and talk openly about what is happening. Fundamentally, 
this position remains vacant because the companies that are 
lawfully subject to oversight by the FCC don't want a watchdog. 
They don't want to be regulated, and these companies have spent 
an immense amount of money and influence to keep this position 
vacant.
    The more that I read the more time that goes by, it seems 
more and more clear to me. And it is frustrating because I know 
the importance of what these entities mean to the country, 
especially with building out the importance of the 
infrastructure in a bipartisan bill that we all supported 
together, and especially for those of us in more rural states 
with what a full functioning FCC will mean.
    Chair Cantwell, I ask for consent to enter into the record 
five documents.
    The Chair. Without objection.

        Deadlocked FCC could derail Biden's digital equity plans

    The Biden administration has charged the Federal Communications 
Commission with prohibiting digital discrimination--but without a third 
Democratic commissioner to break the agency's partisan deadlock, those 
plans are in trouble.
    Why it matters: One of President Biden's key domestic priorities, 
improving Internet access and affordability, can't advance unless the 
Senate confirms his FCC nominee.
    Catch up quick: The Federal Communications Commission has been 
deadlocked at 2 Democrats and 2 Republicans since Biden took office, 
and his nominee for the third seat, Gigi Sohn, has been awaiting a 
Senate vote for months amid Republican opposition.
    What's happening: The agency is required by the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act to craft rules preventing digital 
discrimination on broadband access.

  <bullet> The rules would prohibit Internet service providers such as 
        Comcast or Verizon from deployment discrimination based on the 
        income level or predominant race or ethnicity of the people 
        living in an area.

  <bullet> A 2020 study of Internet access in Oakland, Calif., found 
        that areas that were redlined by banks in the past--denied 
        loans or investment--now have less ISP competition and fiber-
        based services than their wealthier counterparts.

    The intrigue: FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel launched an 
inquiry in March, with support from the agency's Republicans, on how to 
create rules preventing digital discrimination and facilitating equal 
access to high-speed internet.

  <bullet> A major question is how the agency will interpret a part of 
        the law that says the rules should take into account issues of 
        ``technical and economic feasibility.''

  <bullet> Advocates fear Republicans at the agency will use that 
        exception to render new rules meaningless and say Rosenworcel 
        will need Democratic support to craft aggressive rules.

  <bullet> ``If the Biden administration, which fought for the 
        inclusion of this provision, really wants to operationalize 
        that sort of program to address more fundamental equity 
        concerns, they need a 3-2 commission and they need it 
        yesterday,'' Greg Guice, director of government affairs for 
        tech advocacy group Public Knowledge, told Axios.

    Between the lines: Despite the split, the FCC has adopted several 
policy items on a bipartisan basis, including a proposal to require 
``nutrition labels'' for Internet service and rules meant to boost 
competition among broadband providers in apartment buildings.
    The big picture: The FCC is also expected to reinstate net 
neutrality rules and tackle regulations on TV ownership if it gains a

  Biden's Internet promises in limbo amid long battle over FCC nominee

 Almost 250 groups will send a letter Friday to congressional leaders, 
 calling for the Senate to vote to confirm Democratic nominee Gigi Sohn

 By Cat Zakrzewski and Cristiano Lima October 14, 2022 at 8:00 a.m. EDT

    The nation's telecommunications regulator has been without a 
Democratic majority for the entirety of President Biden's 21-month 
tenure, hamstringing efforts to restore open Internet protections and 
close the digital divide.
    Breaking the deadlock at the Federal Communications Commission 
hinges on confirming Gigi Sohn, a longtime public interest advocate and 
former Democratic FCC official who was first nominated by the White 
House nearly a year ago. As the midterm elections approach and 
Democrats' ability to retain their narrow control of the Senate remains 
uncertain, Sohn's supporters are warning Congress that the clock is 
ticking to lock in a majority at the agency.
    On Friday, about 250 industry and public interest groups wrote a 
letter to top Senate leaders calling for a vote on Sohn's nomination 
before Congress adjourns at the end of the year.
    ``The FCC needs a full commission as it begins to deliberate on 
upcoming critical decisions that will have profound impacts on the 
economy and the American people,'' leaders from groups including the 
Consumer Technology Association, Rural Wireless Association and Color 
Of Change wrote in a letter shared exclusively with The Washington 
Post.
    The push from Sohn's supporters follows what her allies describe as 
an unprecedented effort from some telecommunications and media 
lobbyists to block her nomination. Biden's failure to secure a majority 
or full complement of commissioners at the FCC marks one of the longest 
delays in recent memory for a first-term president.
    ``It's insane,'' said Greg Guice, the director of Public 
Knowledge's government affairs team who has worked in roles related to 
tech regulation for more than 20 years. (Sohn previously worked at 
Public Knowledge, which is among the signatories of the Friday letter). 
Lobbyists ``know that being down one seat means they can better control 
the agenda,'' he said.
    The stakes for industry are high: During the Trump administration, 
the then Republican-led agency advanced a wave of deregulation, 
reversing Obama-era net neutrality protections and eliminating decades-
old rules that preserve media diversity in local markets. With a 
majority again, Democrats are expected to reverse those moves.
    Sohn's nomination also comes as the Federal government is expected 
to soon invest an unprecedented amount of funding in expanding Internet 
access, following the infrastructure legislation that Congress passed 
last year. That legislation directed the agency to develop rules to 
address discrimination in Internet access on the basis of income level 
or race. There are widespread inequities in how broadband is delivered, 
and new rules under a Democratic FCC could create more costs for major 
Internet service providers.
    Since the White House began vetting her for the position in the 
spring of 2021, Sohn has largely been sidelined from publicly 
commenting on telecommunications policy. Over the last year, she's been 
frequently attacked as a partisan in publications including Fox News, 
the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal op-ed pages. The process 
has taken a personal toll, opening Sohn up to threatening phone calls 
and e-mails and name-calling. Sohn, who would be the first openly gay 
FCC commissioner, has also faced attacks on her sexual orientation.
    ``It's a tragedy,'' said Gary Shapiro, the president of CTA and a 
friend of Sohn. ``We can't even let people we disagree with get into 
positions anymore without attacking them personally.''
    Sohn's nomination has seen fierce opposition from congressional 
Republicans, and some companies appear to be taking steps to target 
moderate Democrats who could decide her nomination.
    Comcast this year paid former Senate majority leader Tom Daschle 
(D) and his firm $30,000 to lobby on the ``Status of FCC nominations,'' 
among other issues, according to a July disclosure filing. Sohn is the 
only pending nomination for the commission.
    The company in January also tapped a former state lawmaker who 
served alongside Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), widely seen as a 
crucial swing vote on the Sohn nomination, to lobby on FCC nominations. 
The filing disclosing the lobbying focus was later resubmitted and 
amended to scrub mention of the FCC nomination, as news outlets 
reported at the time. Comcast also retained Larry Puccio, the former 
top aide to Sen. Joe Manchin III, another critical Democrat to lobby on 
telecommunications issues, though it did not mention nominations.
    Preston Padden, a former top executive at Fox and Disney, said he 
could recall no other occasion where companies ``microtargeted'' 
specific lawmakers to oppose a FCC nominee.
    ``What Comcast has done to Gigi Sohn in my experience is absolutely 
unprecedented,'' Padden said.
    The filings do not indicate how the groups lobbied on the 
nominations or other issues. Comcast did not return a request for 
comment. The company has previously declined to comment on lobbying 
filings.
    ``The Daschle Group did not lobby for or against any nominations,'' 
Daschle's vice president, Veronica Pollock, said. ``We consistently 
track the status of nominations and share updates with clients when 
there is movement in Congress.''
    Telecommunications companies are among the most formidable lobbying 
forces in Washington, but Sohn's supporters say it's impossible to 
calculate how much the industry has spent to specifically oppose her 
nomination because such figures are not broken out in Federal lobbying 
disclosures. AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and T-Mobile have spent over $23 
million combined lobbying Washington so far this year, with Comcast 
leading the pack at $7.4 million, according to data from OpenSecrets, a 
nonprofit that tracks spending on campaign finance and lobbying.
    David Segal, founder of the left-leaning advocacy group Demand 
Progress, said the telecom lobby ``still wields extraordinary political 
power'' in Washington, which companies have used to stymie efforts to 
address what he called their ``increasingly extractive business 
models.'' And they stand to benefit from a Sohn-less FCC, he said.
    ``The Biden administration has been strong on competition policy, 
and the FCC has important jurisdiction there that can't be deployed to 
full effect without a full commission,'' he said.
    The telecom giants have declined to publicly campaign against 
Sohn's nomination, and some have said they have remained neutral behind 
closed doors.
    AT&T spokesperson Alex Byers told The Post in a statement in May, 
``We have not taken a position on Gigi Sohn's nomination, have not 
asked any third-party organization to take a position, and have not 
funded any campaigns against her nomination.''
    Congressional Republicans have called into question Sohn's 
commitment to bipartisanship, citing her old tweets criticizing 
conservative news outlet Fox News. Sohn has pushed back on the claims.
    ``In Ms. Sohn, President Biden has nominated someone who cannot 
fulfill part of the responsibilities of FCC commissioner, and whose 
record strongly suggests that she cannot be relied upon to fulfill any 
of her responsibilities in an impartial manner,'' Sen. John Thune (R-
S.D.) said during a March floor speech. All 14 Republicans on the key 
Senate Commerce Committee opposed advancing her nomination.
    Sohn's confirmation has also been bedeviled by procedural factors 
and complications in the 50-50 Senate. A committee vote on her 
nomination was delayed during the absence of a key Democrat on the 
Senate Commerce Committee, and she has to overcome additional hurdles 
because that vote split evenly on party lines.
    Revolving Door Project director Jeff Hauser, whose watchdog group 
tracks Federal appointments, said a scarcity of floor time and 
``outdated'' Senate protocols have stymied Democrats' ability to 
quickly confirm nominees. The dynamic has forced Senate Democrats to 
make difficult choices about which appointees to prioritize, 
particularly as they push to confirm an array of judicial nominees 
before potentially losing control of Congress.
    ``Obama-era Democrats did not prioritize judicial nomination, and 
it is overdue progress that Biden and Schumer have done much better on 
that front. But judicial confirmations alone will not make the lame 
duck remotely successful,'' Hauser said, adding that ``it is urgent 
that they fill vacuums at independent agencies.''
    A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-
N.Y.) declined to comment on timing for a potential floor vote on Sohn.
    The White House reaffirmed its commitment to Sohn's nomination in a 
statement Wednesday.
    ``We've been working relentlessly with Congress to get a 
confirmation vote,'' White House spokesperson Olivia Dalton said. ``The 
majority of the FCC hangs in the balance and we want Sohn's talents, 
expertise and experience at the Commission.''
    The FCC said in a statement that despite the deadlock, the agency 
has made progress on broadband access, network security and other 
initiatives.
    ``While we look forward to the Commission having a full dais again, 
we've done a lot with a 2-2 bench and will continue to do so on behalf 
of the American people,'' the agency said in a statement.

                 The mystery of Biden's deadlocked FCC

How often do the parent companies of Fox News and MSNBC team up?

                        By NILAY PATEL/@reckless

                        Nov 3, 2022, 1:40 PM EDT

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Today, we're just talking about a problem. That problem is the 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is currently short a 
commissioner, and the Biden administration and Senate Democrats just 
can't seem to get that seat filled despite having nominated an 
amazingly qualified person. Her name is Gigi Sohn. The inability to get 
Gigi confirmed at the FCC has left the commission deadlocked with two 
Democrats and two Republicans. That means the commission in charge of 
regulating all telecom in the United States, including how you get your 
Internet service, is unable to get much done. And the Biden 
administration can't accomplish some of its biggest policy priorities, 
like expanding rural broadband and restoring net neutrality. President 
Biden first nominated Gigi Sohn to the FCC over a year ago, but the 
full Senate vote to confirm her just hasn't happened.
    We've been digging into this story for a few months now, trying to 
figure out what's going on here, and we found a simple but really 
frustrating answer.
    ``It's corruption. I mean, we can call it a lot of things, but what 
we're witnessing is just ordinary corruption,'' Karl Bode told us. Karl 
is a veteran telecom reporter. I've known him forever, and he is one of 
many people we talked to for this story.
    We're doing something a little different with this episode of 
Decoder. You're going to hear from a bunch of in-the-know people about 
what happened to Gigi Sohn's FCC nomination and why it matters. This 
story has strange crisscross alliances, behemoth bad actors, shady 
politicking, and even some good old-fashioned family drama. But most of 
all, it reveals a lot about the huge problems plaguing politics and 
policy in the United States today. Karl again: ``I've covered the 
telecom sector for I think 22 years, and I've never seen anything quite 
as shady as this.''
    And just so you know, here's a list of people and organizations we 
reached out to about this episode of Decoder who refused to speak to us 
on the record: Fox News, Comcast, the Fraternal Order of Police, former 
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten 
Sinema, Republican Senator Roy Blunt, the Biden administration, 
Verizon, the former Speaker of the Arizona House Republican Kirk Adams, 
former Democratic U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, FCC Chairwoman Jessica 
Rosenworcel, and FCC nominee Gigi Sohn. It's a wild one.
    Okay, the fight over Gigi Sohn's nomination to the FCC and why it 
matters. Here we go.
    The following transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.
    This story ends up revealing corruption, but it starts with good 
old-fashioned confusion.
    Karl Bode: It makes no sense that this has been such a protracted 
nomination process.
    That's Karl Bode again, talking about Gigi Sohn.
    Karl Bode: The thing that's funny to me is that if you talk to 
anybody in telecom policy on both sides of the aisle, she's extremely 
popular. She's well-qualified. We've seen people appointed to the FCC 
that have a tiny, tiny fraction of the experience.
    I agree with Karl, and that's why I started tracking this story. I 
have interviewed Gigi before, and she has even written for the Verge in 
the past--always about making Internet service better and cheaper for 
regular people. So I have been baffled as to why someone like Gigi Sohn 
couldn't get confirmed to the FCC. Gigi was nominated to the FCC over a 
year ago, and throughout her career, she has been popular with just 
about everyone. She is known as an incredibly talented telecom 
regulator who has been willing to work across the aisle.
    Gigi Sohn: Thank you, Chair Cantwell, Member Wicker, members of the 
Committee. I'm honored to be nominated by President Biden and to be 
considered by this committee for a seat on the Federal Communications 
Commission.
    Here's Gigi talking about her background at her first confirmation 
hearing in December 2021.
    Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge's Nilay Patel about 
big ideas--and other problems. Subscribe here!
    Gigi Sohn: The radio was always on in my family kitchen, where 
reports from the front lines of the Vietnam War, Watergate, and other 
critical events of the sixties and seventies resonated. It was there 
that I learned the power of communications networks to inform public 
discourse and promote democratic values. My love of local broadcasting, 
and especially radio, led me to Boston University, where I studied 
Communications Law and Policy. After school and private practice, I 
started what has been an over-30-year career as a public interest 
lawyer advocating for policies that ensure that modern communications 
networks are available to everyone, regardless of who they are or where 
they live.
    Gigi is a lawyer by training. She is currently a fellow at 
Georgetown Law and the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society. She 
co-founded and ran Public Knowledge, an organization that advocates for 
consumers in the telecom industry and I have talked with lots of people 
from Public Knowledge over the years. Given that the FCC is supposed to 
advocate for consumers, she seemed like a natural choice to be a 
commissioner. Plus, she has worked at the FCC before; she advised 
former chairman Tom Wheeler during the Obama administration when the 
FCC adopted its strongest-ever net neutrality rules.
    Makena Kelly: Here's the thing, when you talk to people about Gigi, 
if you were talking to them--Republicans, Democrats--a year ago, maybe 
a little over a year ago, everyone loved her.
    That was Makena Kelly, a politics reporter on the Verge team. 
Telecom lawyer David Goodfriend said something similar.
    David Goodfriend: Thousands of people have actually reached out to 
their members of Congress to say, ``We need you to confirm Gigi Sohn.''
    So did Craig Aaron, the co-CEO of Free Press, which advocates for 
competition in media and an open internet. Here is some of what he had 
to say about Gigi.
    ``She's been a consistent advocate for what's right time and time 
again, and she's shown she can work with just about anybody across the 
political spectrum.''
    Craig Aaron: She's been a consistent advocate for what's right time 
and time again, and she's shown she can work with just about anybody 
across the political spectrum--public interest, corporate interest, you 
name it, to get good things done. That's the kind of person you need at 
an agency like the FCC.
    One more person expressed his support for Gigi. Chris Ruddy, the 
CEO of Newsmax--yes, conservative cable network Newsmax--is a vocal 
supporter of Gigi's nomination.
    Chris Ruddy: I've strongly supported her nomination. I've known her 
for some time. I think she's a person of integrity. We probably 
disagree on a lot of issues. In fact, I know we disagree on any number 
of big issues. She would probably identify herself as liberal, maybe 
progressive, and I would say I'm conservative.
    Am I going to agree with her on every issue? No, but I do think 
that the fact that every major big company, all the big conglomerates, 
don't like her suggests that maybe she's on a path that's at least 
going to look out a little bit more for the consumer and the little guy 
and gal, so to speak.
    You'll hear more from Chris Ruddy later. Okay, if many people on 
both sides of the aisle love Gigi, why can't she get confirmed to the 
FCC?
    When we first started looking into this story earlier this year, it 
seemed like the Biden administration and its slim Democratic majority 
in the Senate just couldn't get this done, because, at the time, it 
really couldn't get much of anything done. A lot of the Democrats' 
biggest policy priorities were stalling out. Then, around the summer, 
things changed.
    News anchor: . . . where there appears to be a breakthrough on 
President Biden's economic agenda.
    News anchor: President Biden signed the $280 billion CHIPS and 
Science Act into law today.
    A flurry of big legislation passed.
    News anchor: You've got the CHIPS Act the President signed today, 
the PACT Act, which he'll sign here tomorrow, and then by the end of 
the week, the Inflation Reduction Act.
    The usual holdouts like Senators Manchin and Sinema got on board 
and the Dems were getting things done.
    News anchor: The biggest U.S. investment ever to help fight climate 
change passing the House, the Inflation Reduction Act now headed to the 
President's desk.
    There was still no movement on Gigi. It was around this time that 
we finally got to the bottom of why.
    David Goodfriend: Gigi Sohn is a manifestation of a much bigger 
tug-of-war going on right now between a very small number of extremely 
powerful corporate interests and the public interest.
    That's David Goodfriend, the telecom lawyer again. David previously 
worked at the FCC, and he has also known Gigi for a long time.
    David Goodfriend: There are really two companies that have been 
literally financing a campaign to stop the Senate from confirming Gigi 
Sohn, and those two companies are Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corporation and 
Comcast. Those two companies have paid for lobbyists to actively court 
swing votes in the Senate against Gigi Sohn.
    We promised crisscrossed alliances and here they are. Rupert 
Murdoch, who controls Fox News and The Wall Street Journal parent 
company News Corp, is on the same side as the Roberts family and 
Comcast, which owns MSNBC. These are not your usual allies.
    It's bizarre that Comcast and the Fox News machine have teamed up 
to obstruct Gigi, and they're doing it in two politically critical 
states.
    David Goodfriend: who used to serve as chief of staff to Senator 
Manchin back when Senator Manchin was governor. Senator Manchin has not 
said one way or the other which way he intends to vote, and that's 
because his former chief of staff was hired by Comcast to lobby him 
against Gigi.
    The same thing happened in Arizona, home of centrist Democratic 
Senator Kyrsten Sinema.
    David Goodfriend: Back in January, Comcast hired a lobbyist in 
Arizona named Kirk Adams of Consilium Consulting. And Adams filed a 
lobbying disclosure, which of course he's required to do, and it lists 
on his very own disclosure that he expects to work on FCC nominations. 
He then quickly recanted that and replaced it with telecommunications 
policy.
    Well, Comcast refused to comment, but I think the article in Ars 
Technica points out that this was pretty clearly an attempt by Comcast 
to swing Senator Kyrsten Sinema's vote against Gigi Sohn. They've done 
it in Arizona, they've done it in West Virginia, and they're hoping 
that they can stave off enough Democratic votes in the Senate to stop 
her from being confirmed.
    This is where I should disclose that Comcast's NBCUniversal 
division is a minority investor in The Verge's parent company of Vox 
Media, which we disclose all the time. Anyway, while Comcast was busy 
lobbying politicians, Fox News and The Wall Street Journal, which are 
both owned by Rupert Murdoch, were actively running negative stories 
about Gigi. Karl Bode told us about this too.
    ``None of these are supported by any facts that you can find if you 
spend 30 minutes objectively researching her record.''
    Karl Bode: All of the Fox properties have been very active in 
pushing things, ideas--false ideas like Sohn hates the police, she'd be 
bad for rural America, she wants to censor conservatives, she's bad for 
media diversity. None of these are supported by any facts that you can 
find if you spend 30 minutes objectively researching her record.
    Here are just a couple Fox News segments about Gigi. You will hear 
one Fox anchor talking to Ted Cruz, and another Fox guest referencing 
the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party.
    News anchor: What do you think of this woman, Gigi? The name sounds 
a little funky, and the glasses make me think twice, but she seems like 
she has a radical agenda. Now she's in charge of this place?
    Sen. Ted Cruz: Yes. Look, she hates Fox News. She has been vocal 
and partisan a long time.
    News guest: Looking up the word ``hack'' in the dictionary, Gigi 
Sohn's photo should be right next to it. She wants to pull the 
broadcast license of this network. Gigi Sohn will turn the FCC into the 
CCP, and this is a bridge even Pyongyang wouldn't go over.
    Part of the argument on Fox News is that if Gigi is added to the 
FCC, she'll somehow censor Fox. But there's no evidence that she has 
any plans to do that at all. Even if she wanted to, it's not like she 
could, because that is not a power the FCC has. In fact, the more 
likely outcome is the opposite: that she would encourage Fox to say 
whatever they want.
    Katharine Trendacosta: I don't even understand that argument 
because Gigi is pretty infamously in favor of free expression online, 
and the FCC has no control over that.
    That is Katharine Trendacosta from the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation.
    Katharine Trendacosta: That's not really its job, especially when 
it comes to telecommunications. The FCC doesn't tell phone companies 
that if you make a lewd phone call, they have to cut you off of phone 
service. That's the same bucket that the Internet is under, right? So, 
none of that is related to anything. The FCC is not involved in 
deciding what speech is or is not allowed on the internet, at least.
    There is a long and complicated tangent we could go down here. 
Basically, the Supreme Court has held that since the public owns the 
airwaves in the United States, the government can regulate broadcast 
speech to make sure it's in the public interest. That's where you get 
the FCC doing things like indecency complaints, the seven dirty words, 
and fines for Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl. 
Traditional broadcast networks like ABC and CBS are using the public's 
airwaves, and the government can tell them what's allowed and what's 
not. Cable networks like Fox and Internet companies like Google and 
Facebook don't broadcast on public airwaves, so there is really no 
legal basis for the FCC to regulate what happens there.
    Katharine Trendacosta: TV and the radio--those are public airwaves 
that the FCC has granted people permission to use. And so they have 
certain rules about that, because anyone could listen and it's a public 
space. However, as we all know, if you're on cable, those rules don't 
apply because that's not a public airwave that has been licensed out. 
It's basically that. It's the difference between something that is a 
publicly owned airwave and something that is privately owned.
    Despite that reality, Fox News is out there saying, ``Watch out for 
a Democratic FCC commissioner. She'll censor your speech.'' And this 
smear campaign has extended across the rest of Rupert Murdoch's media 
properties.
    We did reach out to News Corp, the parent company of The Wall 
Street Journal, and in an e-mail, News Corp chief communications 
officer Jim Kennedy denied a coordinated attack. He told us, ``The Wall 
Street Journal and its editorial board speak for themselves. News Corp 
did not lobby for or against the nomination.''
    There's a lot of pearl-clutching over stray tweets.
    Despite this denial of a coordinated attack against Gigi Sohn, The 
Wall Street Journal and Fox News are still attacking her.
    Craig Aaron: There's a lot of like, ``oh my God,'' pearl-clutching 
over stray tweets.
    That's Craig Aaron again.
    Craig Aaron: What you see is a lot of quotes taken out of context, 
a lot of essentially front groups, like organizations that take a lot 
of money from big telecom and big cable interests, coming out with push 
polls.
    A push poll is a poll with very suggestive questions that basically 
trick people into agreeing with anything you want.
    Craig Aaron: Like, ``Oh, I think the police are very concerned 
because Gigi once said something about encryption,'' or questioning her 
stance on rural America and parsing quotes out of context. And 
suddenly, you see it in an ad, and then it's on The Wall Street 
Journal's editorial page, and then it pops up over here. And then all 
of a sudden, a lot of people who literally live to take company money 
to smear people on their behalf, start raising their hand and trying 
out and saying, ``Oh, I could also say mean things about this 
candidate.'' And you start to get this noise floor that then reaches 
policymakers and decisionmakers.
    Craig mentioned a Wall Street Journal op-ed, but there have been 
several Journal opinion pieces, including one by the editorial board 
with headlines like, ``A Media Censor for the FCC?'' ``Hyperpartisan 
Gigi Sohn Doesn't Belong at the FCC,'' and my favorite, ``Gigi Sohn and 
the Police: Democratic senators are at risk if they vote for Biden's 
progressive FCC nominee.''
    The police thing is something else, by the way. The Fraternal Order 
of Police published a press release about a poll it commissioned, 
claiming that, ``When shown messaging about Gigi Sohn's past actions 
such as, `Gigi Sohn has publicly supported defunding the police,' ''--
they mean liking tweets--``61 percent of registered voters indicate 
that they are less likely to support Ms. Sohn's nomination.'' We asked 
for more information about the specific questions on this poll, but the 
Fraternal Order of Police declined to comment.
    Another thing that has added fuel to the ``Gigi is anti-police'' 
fire is that she is also on the board of the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, or EFF. You have already heard from Katharine Trendacosta 
of EFF. The EFF opposes tech companies turning user information over to 
the police, and well, the police don't like that very much.
    What Senate Republicans have really grabbed onto are the tweets 
Craig mentioned. In 2020, Gigi tweeted, ``For all my concerns 
about#Facebook, I believe that Fox News has had the most negative 
impact on our democracy. It's state-sponsored propaganda, with few if 
any opposing viewpoints. Where's the hearing about that?'' Gigi was 
asked about that one at her first confirmation hearing by Missouri 
Senator Roy Blunt, a Republican.
    Sen. Roy Blunt: I've got a list of comments here about Fox News. 
Are you biased against them?
    ``Anyone who knows me knows I'm pretty direct.''
    Gigi Sohn: You are referring to my tweets that are now pretty 
famous. I understand they're concerning to some, and anyone who knows 
me knows I'm pretty direct. But they were made in my role as a public 
interest advocate. They were made in the context--and I think context 
is very important--context of hearings, hearings and media reports. You 
know, maybe the tone was a little sharper. Maybe I should have dulled 
it a little bit. But again, it was part of my job, essentially, as a 
public interest advocate.
    Sen. Roy Blunt: And do you think they're the only news agency that 
is state-sponsored propaganda? That's your quote, by the way.
    Gigi Sohn: Yes, I know it's my quote, yes. Just to complete my 
thought. My opinions as a public interest advocate will have no bearing 
on how I behave as a policymaker if I'm confirmed.
    Another shady actor joining Comcast and the Murdochs on the anti-
Gigi team was the American Accountability Foundation. The AAF is a 
whole other tangent we could go on. Jane Mayer did great reporting on 
them in The New Yorker, but basically, they're a totally mysterious 
dark money group. No one knows where their funding comes from, but 
their sole explicit purpose is to smear and obstruct Biden nominees.
    They come up with wild narratives, especially about lesser-known 
nominees, and push them until they catch on with conservatives. You 
might have seen that Marjorie Taylor Greene made the baseless 
accusation that then-Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson had 
been lenient on sex offenders during her time as a U.S. district court 
judge and even called her ``pro-pedophile.'' It was the AAF that 
started peddling that story. And Gigi has been on their hit list too--
she's on the front page of AAF's smear website BidenNoms.com.
    While all this external shadiness was going on to make noise about 
Gigi's nomination, a bunch of procedural stuff was happening inside the 
Senate chambers. Lots of boxes need to be checked for a nominee to be 
confirmed to the FCC. First, the president nominates someone. President 
Biden took office in January 2021, and he moved quickly on some 
progressive nominations, like the appointment of Lina Khan to the 
Federal Trade Commission. But he didn't move on the open FCC slot. So 
by the time he first nominated Gigi in October of 2021, the telecom-
driven propaganda machine had had plenty of time to gear up, bracing 
itself to obstruct the confirmation.
    The Senate Commerce Committee held Gigi's first confirmation 
hearing in December 2021; you have already heard some clips from it. At 
these hearings, different senators on a committee interview the 
nominee, and then the committee votes on the nominee. If they vote yes, 
the nomination goes to the Senate floor, where a majority of all U.S. 
senators have to vote ``yes'' to get the nominee confirmed. Likely 
because of all of the lobbying in opposition to Gigi, the committee 
failed to advance her nomination to the floor for a confirmation vote, 
and her nomination expired. So then Biden had to renominate Gigi in 
January of this year, and she had a second confirmation hearing in 
February. As you might have imagined, the Republicans came out swinging 
in this one.
    Sen. Dan Sullivan: I don't even know where to begin here. I too am 
very disturbed with, Miss Sohn, with your tweets.
    Sen. Mike Lee: If you're trying to force the hand of the agency of 
the law-making body of the Federal government, by doing that which only 
Congress can do, how is that constitutional?
    Sen. Dan Sullivan: Damn. That's way out there. Do you think most 
Republicans are racists and white supremacists?
    Sen. Ted Cruz: And I've got to say, Ms. Sohn, the timing of the 
settlement stinks.
    Sen. Dan Sullivan: I don't see how you can be unbiased. It seems to 
me you have conflicts everywhere, and that makes your impartiality, not 
to mention your judgment--I think you have very big issues with 
judgment given your previous tweets.
    Eventually, despite all this, Gigi won the committee's vote, and 
her nomination went to the Senate floor. But there still hasn't been a 
floor vote to confirm her to the FCC even though she was nominated over 
a year ago.
    So, why didn't the Biden administration push for a floor vote that 
would've led to Gigi's confirmation? They chose not to--at least not 
publicly.
    Makena Kelly actually asked Senator Schumer about this earlier this 
month.
    Makena Kelly: What is happening with Gigi Sohn? Should we expect 
her to be confirmed?
    Sen. Chuck Schumer: What's happening? Makena Kelly: Nothing.
    Sen. Chuck Schumer: Well, right now, the administration is working 
on getting the votes for her. They're not there yet, but they're 
pushing hard to get the votes.
    Here's Karl Bode.
    Karl Bode: From what I understand, there were some concerns that 
the nomination of Gigi Sohn early on would've conflicted with their 
efforts to pass the infrastructure bill. I think they were concerned 
that any controversy around the nomination of a progressive reformer 
might cause some additional ripples in efforts to get the votes lined 
up for infrastructure. I'm not sure that's necessarily true, but from 
what I understand that was the thinking of some of the advisers that 
went into the delay.
    So it sounds like passing that flurry of legislation was 
prioritized over Gigi's nomination, but we're not really sure. There 
was some noise that a vote might happen before the Senate's Fourth of 
July recess, but now it's November, and the midterms are in just a few 
days.
    Karl Bode: Comcast was really active in states where Democrats were 
vulnerable in the midterms.
    Karl told us that Comcast and other members of Gigi's opposition 
have specifically targeted Democrats in red or purple states who are 
worried about getting reelected, spooking those vulnerable Democrats 
from supporting Gigi. That's how Republicans and big telecom ground 
things to a halt, and there was some help from Democrats along the way.
    ``I don't care how far you have to dig, it's not based on anything 
close to fact.''
    Karl Bode: I've seen like--Heidi Heitkamp, she's a former 
Democratic senator who I think is running a little PAC that I think the 
telecom industry is feeding, spreading the idea that Sohn is really bad 
for rural America. It's bipartisan. I think it's a little heavier on 
the right-wing side since they pretty much have a unified blockade 
against her nomination, but it is bipartisan. The whole Heidi Heitkamp 
project is basically suggesting that she's terrible for rural America, 
which again, I don't care how far you have to dig, it's not based on 
anything close to fact.
    Here's the thing though. Yes, the opposition to Gigi comes from 
both sides, but so does the support.
    Gigi has long worked with right-wing news networks that compete 
with Fox News to make cable systems like Comcast more competitive. She 
worked with Charles Herring, the president of right-wing One America 
News Network (OAN), to get his other channel WealthTV onto big cable 
systems by filing complaints against them. And she worked with Newsmax 
CEO Chris Ruddy to oppose the merger of Sinclair Broadcast Group with 
Tribune Media Group, which would have consolidated broadcasting to 73 
percent of U.S. households. These are competition concerns, not speech 
regulations.
    So when Gigi was first nominated, Ruddy offered his support for her 
nomination. You heard from him at the top. Chris runs Newsmax, one of 
the most conservative news outlets in the country. Here's more from our 
conversation with him.
    Chris Ruddy: I can tell you a few years back, I opposed the merger 
of Sinclair television stations with Tribune, which would've created a 
massive television network that reached 80 percent and had control over 
the market of 80 percent of U.S. television homes.
    That statistic is actually closer to 73 percent.
    Chris Ruddy: I opposed it and she opposed it. And so I think where 
we find common interest is that I tend to support even Democrats that 
support the issues that I care about.
    There's been a lot of commentary about Gigi in particular that says 
she is in support of speech regulations. It seems like you're more 
worried about competition issues. Are you at all worried about her 
speech or her tweets, I suppose?
    ``I don't think that she's ever called for closing down any 
conservative or any other media that I'm aware of.''
    Chris Ruddy: I'm actually worried about speech issues, but I don't 
think that she's ever called for closing down any conservative or any 
other media that I'm aware of. You know, the criticism of Gigi is that 
she once said during the [Facebook] hearings after the election, I 
think in a tweet, she suggested there should be hearings about Fox 
News. Okay. And I think that she said it was ``Trump TV'' or something. 
Well, conservatives have said similar things about CNN and called CNN 
the ``Clinton News Network'' or ``state-run TV'' at one point, I 
remember. So, you know, it's political rhetoric.
    She never, ever called for deplatforming. I know that when I had 
the issue after the election, people were calling for Newsmax to be de-
platformed, we strongly, vigorously had to defend ourselves and she was 
sympathetic--even thought she didn't agree with us--to our viewpoint 
that we should have the right to broadcast and exist on the internet, 
cable, and OTT streaming platforms.
    Where do you think the opposition to Gigi's confirmation comes 
from?
    Chris Ruddy: Well, I think a lot of it is that she's been a fairly 
progressive activist, so that's given an easy target for Fox in this 
very highly polarized world. She's also been a very strong supporter of 
net neutrality. Now, I don't personally like the idea that the 
government should regulate the internet, but I do believe that it 
should be an open platform, and I do like the basic concept behind net 
neutrality, which is that no company can squelch or limit other players 
on the Internet in their access to broadband.
    And we've seen it happen on the Internet where Newsmax is being 
limited or algorithms have been used against us by places like Facebook 
and Twitter and other places. So it's very concerning to me that some 
major broadband provider could start squelching access to the Newsmax 
stream. Now, we're not aware of that happening, but I think protections 
need to be in place. So I'm basically in favor of a concept that's 
similar to net neutrality, but it became such a highly polarized issue, 
net neutrality--
    Yes.
    Chris Ruddy: I think conservatives actually should support it, but 
liberals were the ones to sort of back the idea. Again, not the full 
regulatory concept behind it, but a robust idea that everybody should 
have access to the Internet and it should be like a utility.
    The other player here is Fox News, which really opposes Sohn's 
nomination. Do you think that they're pushing against her because they 
don't want you to compete with them on Comcast and other cable 
networks?
    Chris Ruddy: The cable industry's a bit of a racket, and the big 
broadcast companies are part of the racket and they benefit from it. 
The people that get screwed are the consumers, the cable customers. And 
so the way the racket works is if you own a lot of television stations 
that a local cable company needs--ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox affiliates--they 
basically have you over a barrel because if they don't give you your 
channel, people are going to go to another cable system, right?
    So now they put a gun to your head and they say, ``We want huge 
fees for the local network affiliate. We have five other channels we 
want you to put on your basic channel guide, and we want you to pay us 
for those channels.'' And there should be a requirement at the FCC that 
big broadcast companies can't demand that local cable operators take 
their package of channels and put them on. And what's happened is it's 
driven up consumer costs, which affects me and everyone else that's 
buying cable. But also if I'm an independent cable operator, I can't 
get cable carriage, or it's very difficult because so much of the 
bandwidth and the channel guide is taken up by all of these 
conglomerate broadcast television companies.
    So Fox has really milked the system and they've been a big 
beneficiary, and they just want to keep that system going. As a side 
benefit, they also reduce the potential of Newsmax.
    Everybody's so afraid of Fox. They will seek to destroy you 
personally if you go against them. So a lot of people just are quiet 
about it.
    ``Everybody's so afraid of Fox.''
    Have you talked to anyone in the Biden administration or Senator 
Schumer about Gigi's nomination and where it stands? Have you pushed 
for it?
    Chris Ruddy: I wouldn't discuss who I personally have chatted with 
or what particular agency. I can tell you that I have talked to both 
Democrats and Republicans. But we still support Gigi Sohn for the FCC 
commissioner.
    So Ruddy and Newsmax continue to support Gigi Sohn's nomination, 
but something weird is going on at their big competitor, another far-
right news channel, OAN.
    OAN president Charles Herring released a statement supporting Gigi 
in December of 2021, laying out reasons very similar to Chris Ruddy. 
But then his dad, OAN CEO Robert Herring, rebuked his son for endorsing 
her on the OAN airwaves. Here are some bits from that broadcast, but 
let me set them up for you. First, an OAN anchor calls Gigi ``an enemy 
of the First Amendment,'' then reporter Pearson Sharp interviews Robert 
Herring. Here is some of that conversation.
    Pearson Sharp: Sohn is one of the most extreme leftists anywhere in 
Washington. In fact, she's not just a radical leftist, she's a Marxist 
who has absolutely no regard for free speech or the Constitution. Gigi 
is an enemy of the free press. Where do you stand on her nomination? Do 
you or does One America News support Gigi Sohn's nomination?
    Robert Herring: Well, this is why I had to come on. My son came out 
and supported her, but the company itself is not supporting him. At 
that point, I had to come out and explain that there's no way this 
company would ever support her, and no way I'll ever let it happen. How 
my son decided he wanted to, I don't know, I think that because we 
worked with her for--not really worked with her, but we've known her 
since about 2003 or 2004, and she's never done anything for us. My 
son's out there saying that the company [supports her], but there's no 
way. She shouldn't be anywhere near the FCC, as far as I'm concerned.
    Pearson Sharp: Now I know that you personally reached out to Fox 
News to offer your support, didn't you?
    Robert Herring: I did. I called a couple of people over there that 
are very high and told them, ``I'm sorry,'' and that we'll try and 
straighten it out, and that we should never have backed her.
    That's a lot of groveling to Fox News. I mean, wow.
    So we've talked about who has opposed Gigi and how, but why? Why 
has big telecom gone to such lengths to oppose Gigi's nomination? David 
Goodfriend explained to us.
    David Goodfriend: Rupert Murdoch and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts are 
determined not to let the Senate confirm Gigi. Why is that? It all 
comes down to their business. Comcast is in the broadband business and 
they don't want the government telling them what to do, so they don't 
like net neutrality. In fact, they've really campaigned against net 
neutrality. The Obama administration put in place the strongest rules 
ever to preserve an open internet, and Comcast went to war. The 
manifestation of that war is their determination not to have Gigi Sohn 
confirmed in the Senate.
    Rupert Murdoch wants to buy more properties, he doesn't like a lot 
of attention to which broadcast stations he owns or which streaming 
services he owns, and yet Gigi Sohn has been very clear that she thinks 
there should be limits on the amount of concentration of media 
ownership. These two billionaires have decided that they're trying to 
stop Gigi Sohn.
    Karl said something similar, mentioning that telecom wants to 
prevent the FCC from getting an active and engaged commissioner like 
the FTC got with Lina Khan.
    Karl Bode: I think there's a real aversion amongst these telecom 
giants. They really don't want a progressive reformer in there who's 
willing to shake things up in any degree. They enjoyed pretty much a 
captured FCC for four years under Trump, and now they've enjoyed an FCC 
for another two years that basically lacks the voting majority to do 
anything remotely controversial or anything that the public has 
demanded that their representatives do. It's corruption. I mean, we can 
call it a lot of things, but what we're witnessing is just ordinary 
corruption. It gets justified and dressed up as something more 
intellectually complicated, but it is just corruption.
    Verge policy reporter Makena Kelly reiterated this as well.
    Biden has made it clear that he wants to restore net neutrality, 
and you can't do that unless there's three Democratic commissioners at 
the FCC.
    Makena Kelly: What they really care about the most--why you keep it 
two to two--is because Biden has made it clear that he wants to restore 
net neutrality, and you can't do that unless there's three Democratic 
commissioners at the agency.
    Makena also gave us another example of the kind of problems that 
arise when the FCC is at a stalemate and largely unable to take action 
against big telecom.
    Makena Kelly: The Biden administration struck a deal with a bunch 
of telecoms--Comcast, Verizon, AT&T--to basically either lower their 
lowest broadband plans or make them cheaper so low-income families 
would have better access to the internet, and that had nothing to do 
with the FCC, really. It's the Affordable Connectivity Program that was 
passed through Congress, of course, but it was just deals that they 
struck with these companies. It was just a private market solution.
    One of the things that really struck me about those deals is that 
immediately thereafter, Verizon increased its rates. So they got money 
from the government and then they increased their rates for their other 
subscribers. It seems like that's the sort of thing a functional FCC 
would be in charge of, but at two to two, it seems like they can't 
really do much of anything.
    AT&T gave us this statement: ``We have long supported an open 
internet, and any suggestion otherwise is wrong. We have not taken a 
position on Gigi Sohn's nomination, have not asked any third-party 
organization to take a position, and have not funded any campaigns 
against her nomination.''
    With the FCC in its current state, big telecom isn't really being 
regulated--and that is by big telecom's design, as we've heard. But 
there are other consequences of this weakened FCC.
    One is that the FCC isn't at full strength to improve access to the 
Internet in rural and underprivileged areas. This was particularly 
problematic during the pandemic when people depended on reliable 
Internet at home for just about everything. Craig Aaron from Free Press 
also emphasized how the need to close the digital divide became even 
more urgent when the pandemic hit.
    Craig Aaron: The Federal Communications Commission is the place 
that sets the rules for how these companies are going to operate--
whether they can rip you off, what your choices are going to be, is 
there going to be real competition. The FCC has a big role to play. It 
actually has a lot of power over shaping the kind of Internet we're 
going to have. Is it just going to be Facebook? Is it just going to be 
dominated by a few players? Or are we actually going to get back to 
talking about big open pipes that make anything possible? That is the 
promise, the original promise of the internet.
    In fact, the current chair of the FCC herself, Jessica Rosenworcel, 
talked to us about this on the Vergecast during the pandemic.
    Jessica Rosenworcel: I think we need a nationwide plan for 
addressing the digital divide. As a nation, we need a policy that 
addresses how we're going to connect all of us and what are the plans 
we want in place to make sure it happens.
    So what's going to happen to Gigi Sohn's confirmation into the FCC? 
There are three possible outcomes here. The most likely scenario is the 
vote will happen in the lame duck period between November and January, 
when new senators have been elected but haven't yet taken office. 
Several other FCC commissioners--Simington, Carr, Tate, and Edelstein--
were confirmed during the lame duck period, so it's very possible this 
will happen.
    Another outcome is that a floor vote on Gigi happens next year with 
a new Senate.
    The third possible outcome is that Gigi never gets a vote, the 
Biden administration gives up and puts forth a new nominee who's more 
amenable to big telecom. Karl Bode told us he's worried that might 
happen, but David Goodfriend offered us a silver lining.
    David Goodfriend: Well, in some ways, it's a very sad commentary on 
the outsized influence of a few multi-billion-dollar companies on our 
politics and our public policy. But on the other hand, I've really felt 
inspired by the amount of support that Gigi is getting, because it's 
very rare that you see such a diverse coalition on anything right now.
    I mean, think about it. Newsmax, one of the most conservative news 
outlets in the United States, supports her. The Communications Workers 
of America, a labor union, supports her. And thousands and thousands of 
individual Americans have gone out of their way to tell their senators, 
``We support her. We like her.'' When's the last time you found an 
issue like that in today's Washington? It's rare. So it's inspiring to 
see how much support there really is for her, and I think she'll be 
confirmed, because she's shown that she has the mettle for it.
    Look, I don't know what's going to happen with Gigi's nomination. 
Obviously, it's too late to get it done before the midterms--they're 
just a few days away. But I do know that if no one fills the seat at 
the FCC at all, there will be no meaningful change to net neutrality, 
no push to close the digital divide, no emphasis on creating more 
competition for broadband access. There will just be a lot of nothing.
    I also know that Americans pay more money for slower broadband than 
just about every other country in the world because we have utterly 
failed to regulate our ISPs, and that is a big problem.

BLOCKING COMPETITION--

   ISP admits lying to FCC about size of network to block funding to 
                                 rivals

ISP gave FCC false coverage information to prevent others from getting 
        grants.

                     JON BRODKIN--2/2/2023, 2:06 PM
                     
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Ryan Grewell, who runs a small wireless Internet service provider 
in Ohio, last month received an e-mail that confirmed some of his worst 
suspicions about cable companies.
    Grewell, founder and general manager of Smart Way Communications, 
had heard from some of his customers that the Federal Communications 
Commission's new broadband map falsely claimed fiber Internet service 
was available at their homes from another company called Jefferson 
County Cable. Those customer reports spurred Grewell to submit a number 
of challenges to the FCC in an attempt to correct errors in Smart Way's 
service area.
    One of Grewell's challenges elicited a response from Jefferson 
County Cable executive Bob Loveridge, who apparently thought Grewell 
was a resident at the challenged address rather than a competitor.
    ``You challenged that we do not have service at your residence and 
indeed we don't today,'' Loveridge wrote in a January 9 e-mail that 
Grewell shared with Ars. ``With our huge investment in upgrading our 
service to provide xgpon we reported to the BDC [Broadband Data 
Collection] that we have service at your residence so that they would 
not allocate addition [sic] broadband expansion money over [the] top of 
our private investment in our plant.''
    The e-mail is reminiscent of our November 2022 article about a 
cable company accidentally telling a rival about its plan to block 
government grants to competitors.
    Speaking to Ars in a phone interview, Grewell said, ``This cable 
company happened to just say the quiet part out loud.'' He called it 
``a blatant attempt at blocking anyone else from getting funding in an 
area they intend to serve.''
    It's not clear when Jefferson County Cable plans to serve the area. 
Program rules do not allow ISPs to claim future coverage in their map 
submissions.
    Jefferson County Cable ultimately admitted to the FCC that it filed 
incorrect data and was required to submit a correction. The challenge 
that the ISP conceded was for an address on State Route 43 in Bergholz, 
Ohio. The town is not one of the coverage areas listed on Jefferson 
County Cable's website.
    While checking the FCC broadband map today, we confirmed that the 
address is no longer listed as having Jefferson County Cable service. 
But that one fix alone wouldn't prevent the company's grant-blocking 
strategy from working, because the FCC map still lists the company as 
serving the address right next door and others on the same road.
False data hurts ISPs seeking grants
    False broadband data could hurt Smart Way directly because the ISP 
plans to apply for grants to upgrade its network. There have been over 
a million challenges submitted to the FCC nationwide, and it's unknown 
how many mistakes are on the map overall.
    The new FCC map is supposed to show exactly which homes and 
businesses have access to Internet service and what types of service 
are available at each address. Using that data, the U.S. government and 
states will decide how to allocate Federal funding to projects that 
fill in broadband-availability gaps.
    But the maps rely on Internet service providers to report where 
they offer service and are rife with errors that show ISPs claiming to 
serve more homes than they actually do. Nevada officials said they 
found more than 20,000 mistakes in their state alone. Vermont officials 
said the map is ``missing or incorrectly lists the location of over 
60,000 broadband-serviceable locations'' and ``lists service 
availability levels far beyond what the state has found through its 
mapping and what we are hearing about from residents.''
    If you'd like to submit challenges, you can search for reported 
broadband availability at specific addresses here [https://
broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home#/] and use that page to file challenges. In 
addition to the individual submissions, state governments and 
broadband-focused groups have been submitting bulk challenges.
    Grewell said he submitted about a dozen challenges in late 
November, most of which pertained to addresses purportedly served by 
Jefferson County Cable. He said he filed the ``challenges in areas that 
I knew there was no fiber-to-the-home whatsoever.''
    We haven't received a response to requests for comment from 
Loveridge or Jefferson County Cable. But Jefferson County Cable 
withdrew its coverage claim at the one address referenced in 
Loveridge's e-mail after Grewell's challenge.
    ``The provider subject to your challenge has conceded the challenge 
and is required to submit a correction for the challenged location in 
the online portal within 30 days,'' the FCC told Grewell in an e-mail 
notification on January 12.
    Despite that one success, Grewell told us yesterday that he hasn't 
received responses for any of the other addresses he challenged. The 
successful challenge at one address also didn't trigger map updates to 
nearby homes, as previously mentioned.

    Jon is Ars Technica's senior IT reporter, covering the FCC and 
broadband, telecommunications, tech policy, and more.

    Senator Lujan. We heard extensive testimony on the need for 
the FCC to craft rules preventing digital discrimination on 
broadband access. These rules are required by the bipartisan 
Infrastructure Investments in Job Act, but there is a 
significant pressure coming in the docket, and some, like the 
Wall Street Journal editorial board, are trying to turn the 
bipartisan priority into a partisan fight that shouldn't be.
    Second, multiple reports have found that ISPs, big and 
small, provided false data to the FCC's maps in an anti-
competitive effort to block rival companies from getting a 
share of the $42.5 billion this committee provided for 
broadband. Third, and finally, before Christmas, in December 
2022, internal documents indicated that Chairwoman Rosenworcel 
proposed fines against major wireless carriers for failing to 
safeguard data on real time locations.
    For most Americans, the FCC is the only cop on the beat 
protecting them from predatory data practices and ensuring 
Internet companies provide accurate information. Chairwoman 
Rosenworcel requires a full Commission to do her job enforcing 
current law to the fullest extent and to keep these companies 
accountable.
    We have heard from a lot of my colleagues. Now, some have 
suggested that you are not qualified. I disagree with that. The 
facts show that these arguments are just a bunch of hot air, 
coming from a state with the largest international balloon 
fiesta.
    The record shows that Gigi Sohn is a dedicated public 
servant who is qualified and ready to be confirmed. She will 
act to uphold the law dutifully and honorably. Unfortunately, 
though, we are seeing this stalled for way too long.
    So, Madam Chair, I want to thank you and the Ranking 
Member, and all of our colleagues for being here today. Ms. 
Sohn, for being here at yet again for this important hearing, 
and I look forward to a vote not just out of this committee, 
but on the full floor to support your confirmation. Thank you, 
Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Thank you. I misspoke earlier, the Chair of the 
Subcommittee, Chairman Lujan. And now if the Ranking Member of 
the Subcommittee, Senator Thune, would like to make a 
statement.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think we have all 
been down this road before. And I think that Senator Cruz in 
his opening remarks hit on a number of issues that I think I 
find disqualifying for the nominee. And I would--we have big 
differences, I think as perhaps a lot of people here know, when 
it comes to major policies.
    Ms. Sohn is interested in reinstituting the Obama era, 
heavy handed net neutrality rules that were reversed under then 
FCC Chairman Pai in 2017, rules that I would remind people 
would regulate the Internet like a public utility under Title 
II of the 1934 law.
    So that in and of itself to me represents a major problem 
from just a policy standpoint. But I also want to reiterate 
some of the things that were mentioned by Senator Cruz in his 
opening remarks.
    And that is, I think, Ms. Sohn as an FCC official--you 
know, we are going to talk about this a little bit later, but 
the issue of leaking nonpublic, confidential information 
further speaks to the fact that if confirmed, you are not going 
to bring the spirit of bipartisanship that present and past 
Commissioners have demonstrated.
    Your long record, I would say a virulent partisanship has 
raised a number of questions as to whether or not you can serve 
as an impartial Commissioner, and I think those concerns 
remain. You have been an outspoken critic, as Senator Cruz 
pointed out, of conservative media outlets that you would be in 
charge of regulating. You have supported far left initiatives 
such as defunding the police.
    And you have been hostile, I would add, to broadband 
companies serving rural areas like those in my home State of 
South Dakota. So, I would just close by saying that almost all, 
if not all, individuals in politics have strong convictions, 
but serious leaders demonstrate the ability to act in a fair 
and impartial manner.
    You have not, and Madam Chair, should this nomination come 
for a vote before this committee, I urge all my colleagues, for 
those reasons and many others which I am sure we will get into, 
to join me in opposing the nominee before us. Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Thune. Now, we will have an 
introduction by Ms. Sohn--by Mr. Chad Rupe who is joining us 
remotely.
    He was a Trump Administration official for the Rural 
Utility Services, Department of Agriculture. He has been a long 
leader in rural broadband and developing State directors board 
working group.
    So, you are also active in the effort in Wyoming. Thank you 
very much for joining us.

  STATEMENT OF CHAD RUPE, FORMER USDA RURAL UTILITIES SERVICE 
              ADMINISTRATOR, TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

    Mr. Rupe. Good morning, Chairman Cantwell, and Ranking 
Member Cruz, and members of the Committee. My name is Chad 
Rupe. I am currently the General Manager of Ponderosa 
Communications. And as the Chairwoman mentioned, I am also the 
Former Administrator for the RUS under the Trump 
Administration, and a former State Broadband Program Manager 
from Montana.
    I am here today, however, in my capacity as a friend of 
Gigi Sohn, and it is truly an honor for me to come before the 
Committee to introduce her to you and to register my strong 
support for Gigi to be the next Commissioner of the Federal 
Communications Commission.
    During my time as the USDA Rural Development State Director 
for Wyoming and as the Administrator for RUS, I led the Trump 
Administration's efforts to get broadband to our rural 
communities, including through the Reconnect Broadband Program 
and implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill.
    It was as a State Broadband Program Manager for Montana 
that I got to know Gigi and see how she approaches challenges 
like bringing broadband to rural America. I saw that Gigi was 
deeply passionate about the importance of working to close the 
digital divide for all of our communities. I saw that she 
understands the term rural means much more than a destination 
given to an area based on population. She knows that each one 
is unique and presents varying challenges to connectivity.
    Importantly, I saw that she firmly believes that these are 
not partisan issues, so when we make them partisan, we fail to 
serve the folks in those rural communities who are just looking 
to ensure their families are able to enjoy the many benefits 
that come from broadband connectivity.
    For the past 5 years, Gigi has worked closely with State 
broadband leaders from states as different as Vermont, 
Nebraska, and Louisiana, providing them with counsel and 
connections with Federal broadband leaders. In her previous two 
confirmation hearings, Gigi pledged to be the FCC's State 
liaison, and I have no doubt she will keep that promise.
    Such a role is critical now that the states have primary 
responsibility for ensuring that the billions of dollars 
provided in the bipartisan infrastructure law is well spent. 
The FCC's work has been crucial to ensuring that the economic, 
health, and educational benefits that flow over broadband are 
reaching all of our communities.
    More work needs to be done for sure, and Congress has taken 
an all of Government approach to moving that great work 
forward. And the role of the FCC in those efforts is as crucial 
as it has ever been.
    Gigi will be a great addition to the Commission as it seeks 
to fulfill the charge that Congress has passed it with 
performing. And in closing, I would say to this committee that 
I was proud to learn that there are over 400 organizations and 
leaders that agree with me, Gigi will be a great Commissioner. 
They include Republican and Democratic State and local 
legislators, business leaders, consumer advocates, and over 
350,000 citizens.
    Gigi is a dedicated public servant and a strong voice for 
consumers and a hard worker who will bring her 35 years of 
work, elevating the public's interest to the portfolio of work 
before the Commission. I urge this committee and the Senate to 
swiftly confirm her to this post.
    Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.

                     Remarks Introducing Gigi Sohn

    Chad Rupe: Good morning, Chairwoman Cantwell and Ranking Member

    Sen. Cantwell: Thank you, Mr. Rupe. Just one question for you, are 
those the Tetons behind you?
    Chad Rupe: That is Yosemite, actually, Chairwoman. Ponderosa 
Communications is proud to serve about 10,000 telephone and broadband 
subscribers in California, in the Sierra Nevadas as well as rural 
communities in Arizona.
    So fortunately, it's a great family-owned rural business that's 
been in operation since 1908. So, we're very proud to serve these rural 
areas.
    Sen. Cantwell: Thank you. It definitely is going to be a very big 
focus of this committee to make sure that we get broadband expansion in 
rural communities. So I'm sure we'll hear a lot about that today.

    The Chair. Thank you, Mr. Rupe. Just one question for you.

    Ms. Sohn, welcome. If you want to introduce any family 
members, but you are welcomed to make an opening statement.

   STATEMENT OF GIGI B. SOHN, NOMINEE TO BE A COMMISSIONER, 
               FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

    Ms. Sohn. Thank you, Chairwoman Cantwell. And good morning, 
Ranking Member Cruz, and members of the Committee. Today I am 
joined by my wife, Lara, our daughter Yosselin, and my brother, 
Adam. I want to acknowledge my mother, Roma, who can't be here 
today. People who know her say that I get my determination and 
fortitude from her.
    Since there are several new committee members, let me 
introduce myself. I grew up with three brothers in a middle-
class household on Long Island--I still say Longiland. My 
father was an Accountant for the Grumman Corporation and my 
mother was one of the first Physician Assistants certified in 
New York State.
    My formative years were filled with sports and music, 
including cheering for my beloved Mets and Jets. A broadcasting 
law course of my sophomore year at Boston University changed my 
life. I was fascinated with the power of communications 
networks to inform public discourse and promote democratic 
values.
    I was awakened to the important role Government can play in 
ensuring that all voices are heard. After law school and 
private practice, I started what has been a nearly 35-year 
career as a public interest lawyer, advocating for policies 
that ensure that modern communications networks are available 
to everyone, regardless of who they are or where they live.
    For the past two decades, I have worked toward the goal of 
ensuring that every U.S. household has robust and affordable 
broadband Internet access. From 2013 to 2016, I was privileged 
to serve as counselor to then FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, where I 
gained the invaluable experience of working inside the agency 
and learning the different tools needed to be an effective 
policymaker.
    Today, at my third confirmation hearing, 15 months after I 
was nominated, I would like to answer a question that I know is 
on the minds of many on the dais and in this room: why am I 
still President Biden's nominee for the fifth seat in the FCC? 
There are four reasons.
    First, I care deeply about the mission of the FCC and have 
dedicated my entire career to that mission, ensuring that 
everyone, regardless of income level, race, gender, sexual 
orientation, or where they live, has access to affordable and 
robust communications networks so they can be full participants 
in our economy, our education and health care systems, our 
culture, and our democracy.
    I have accomplished a great deal as a public advocate, but 
after I left the FCC, I knew I wanted to 1 day return as a 
public servant to continue this important work. Second, I 
believe it is critical for at least one member of the FCC to be 
a consumer advocate who has spent a career not beholden to any 
interests but those of the public.
    I have certainly worked with industry toward common goals, 
and many in the industry are among the over 400 groups that 
support my confirmation. But my roots and my heart are with 
everyday Americans the FCC by law is tasked to serve.
    Third, I am extremely well qualified. Even those who oppose 
my confirmation agree that I have a deep knowledge of the 
issues before the FCC, and thanks to my time working at the 
agency, I know how it operates. I am proud of my bipartisan 
network that includes pretty much every FCC stakeholder, 
including State and local officials, tribal leaders, industry, 
academia, public interest, public safety, civil rights, and the 
disability community.
    I know everybody and they know me. They also know, 
regardless of whether we agree on policy, that I am a straight 
shooter who will listen, try to find common ground, and take 
their equities into account.
    Last, I believe deeply that regulated entities should not 
choose their regulator. Unfortunately, that is the exact intent 
of the past 15 months of false and misleading attacks on my 
record and of my character.
    My industry opponents have hidden behind dark money groups 
and surrogates because they fear a pragmatic, pro-competition, 
pro-consumer policymaker who will support policies that will 
bring more, faster, and lower priced broadband and new voices 
to your constituents. The FCC has been without a majority for 
the entirety of the Biden Administration, over 2 years, at a 
time when closing the digital divide is front and center.
    There are too many important issues in front of the 
Commission to lack a full complement of members, including 
improving the broadband maps, fixing the Universal Service 
Fund, closing the homework gap, ensuring fair access to 
broadband, and protecting consumers' privacy.
    Americans deserve a full FCC where I could play a critical 
role in addressing every one of these, but time is of the 
essence. In closing, I want to give my heartfelt thanks to 
President Biden for his belief in me, to Chairwoman Cantwell 
and her staff for their constant support, and to the other 
committee members and their staffs who have worked so hard on 
my behalf and on behalf of the American people.
    If I am confirmed, I look forward to working with all the 
members of the Committee, as well as the sitting Commissioners, 
to achieve universal connectivity in the United States. Thank 
you, and I look forward to your questions.

    21. Please identify each instance in which you have testified 
orally or in writing before Congress in a governmental or non-
governmental capacity and specify the date and subject matter of each 
testimony.
    List of testimony attached (Attachment E).
    22. Given the current mission, major programs, and major 
operational objectives of the department/agency to which you have been 
nominated, what in your background or employment experience do you 
believe affirmatively qualifies you for appointment to the position for 
which you have been nominated, and why do you wish to serve in that 
position?
    I have spent nearly my entire career as an advocate for universal 
and affordable access to open and democratic communications networks, 
be they broadcast, cable, telephone, or broadband. That is the exact 
statutory mission of the FCC--to ensure that everyone in the U.S. has 
access to and can use the networks that are central to an informed 
democracy, a strong economy, and an open society. That goal is more 
important today than it has ever been, as access to broadband is 
essential to full participation in our society and our economy and our 
education and health care systems.
    In addition to my substantive knowledge, I co-founded and built the 
non-profit organization Public Knowledge, and successfully managed it 
for 12 years. I left the organization in strong financial and 
managerial health, and it will celebrate its 22nd anniversary this 
year. During my tenure as Counselor to former Chairman Wheeler, I 
became intimately familiar with the inner workings of the FCC. I worked 
with nearly every Bureau and Office, including all of the other 
Commissioners' offices, the Managing Director's office, and other 
technical and administrative offices.
    Finally, over the past nearly 35 years, I have built a network of 
colleagues, friends, and advisors from across industries and sectors, 
including philanthropy, academia, the public interest community, and 
federal, state, and local policymakers. This network will be critical 
to addressing what I believe is the FCC's biggest challenge--ensuring 
that every household in the U.S. has affordable and robust broadband 
Internet access.
    23. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to 
ensure that the department/agency has proper management and accounting 
controls, and what experience do you have in managing a large 
organization?
    As a member of the FCC, I believe that I would have a duty to 
ensure that the agency has proper management and accounting controls. I 
was the President and CEO of the non-profit Public Knowledge for 12 
years, and while it was not a large organization, it had its own 
challenges regarding management and accounting, albeit on a smaller 
scale. I was a CEO that hired a strong executive team but took ultimate 
responsibility for the finances and management of the organization.
    24. What do you believe to be the top three challenges facing the 
department/agency, and why?

  <bullet> I believe that the FCC's top challenge is ensuring that 
        every household in the U.S. has affordable and robust broadband 
        Internet access. Tens of millions of people in the U.S. lack 
        affordable and robust broadband Internet, and such connectivity 
        is essential to ensure full participation in our society, our 
        economy, our education and health care systems and our civic 
        life. Thanks to Congress, the FCC's job was made a bit easier 
        when it provided over $45 billion for broadband deployment and 
        another $14.2 billion for the Affordable Connectivity Program, 
        which helps low-income families to pay for broadband service. 
        But the success of the deployment program (BEAD) depends on the 
        FCC developing accurate maps of where broadband can and is 
        being delivered to American households. And even when the BEAD 
        money is spent, there will still be carriers in the most rural 
        parts of America that will need operating funds. Thus, the FCC 
        (with Congress' help) must find ways to keep the Universal 
        Service Fund healthy. Not only does the Fund support carriers 
        in high-cost areas and low-income households, it also provides 
        the funding for essential broadband in rural health care 
        facilities and K-12 schools. Achieving the goal of universal 
        and affordable broadband Internet access will take an ``all-
        hands-on-deck'' approach, with the Federal government, states, 
        rural and urban communities, the philanthropic sector, and 
        industry working together to build and execute a blueprint for 
        universal broadband. The FCC must be a leader in building and 
        executing this blueprint.

  <bullet> Another major challenge for the FCC is ensuring that our 
        communications networks are resilient, secure, and protective 
        of user privacy. There have been too many instances over the 
        past several years of networks failing, often for long periods 
        of time, as a result of major natural disasters, which are 
        becoming increasingly common. The FCC's June 27, 2022 order 
        adopted measures that will lead to greater reliability and 
        resiliency for mobile wireless networks during natural 
        disasters and other emergencies. This is a great first step. 
        The FCC must hold all network operators to high standards of 
        resiliency to ensure that people can stay connected when it is 
        a matter of life and death. In addition, the FCC must ensure 
        that our networks are safe from malevolent actors here and 
        abroad. Just this month, a major wireless carrier announced 
        that a hacker was able to obtain personal data, including 
        names, birthdates, and phone numbers from 37 million customers. 
        While the data breach notification rules the FCC recently 
        proposed are strong and necessary, the FCC must ensure that 
        such breaches rarely occur, if ever. The interconnected 
        broadband networks that underpin our digital economy are among 
        our most vulnerable attack conduits. Thus, the FCC must ensure 
        that cybersecurity is an essential duty for network providers. 
        This means developing an oversight regime that requires network 
        providers to determine best practices, subject to regulatory 
        oversight.

  <bullet> A third major challenge for the FCC is developing spectrum 
        policy with its Federal government colleagues that will balance 
        making significant amounts of spectrum for 5G mobile broadband 
        service (and making that spectrum available to a wide variety 
        of users) with also making significant amounts of spectrum 
        available for innovative unlicensed uses. Sound spectrum policy 
        is only possible with close coordination between the FCC and 
        other government agencies, including state and local 
        governments, which are critical to lowering barriers to 
        deployment of 5G and wireline broadband infrastructure.

    4. Describe any business relationship, dealing, or financial 
transaction which you have had during the last ten years, whether for 
yourself, on behalf of a client, or acting as an agent, that could in 
any way constitute or result in a possible conflict of interest in the

each potential conflict of interest.
    In connection with the nomination process, I have consulted with 
the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Communication 
Commission's Designated Agency Ethics Official to identify potential

    5. Identify any other potential conflicts of interest, and explain 
how you will resolve each potential conflict of interest.
    In connection with the nomination process, I have consulted with 
the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Communication 
Commission's Designated Agency Ethics Official to identify potential 
conflicts of interest. If confirmed, any potential conflicts of 
interest will be resolved in accordance with the terms of the ethics 
agreement that I have entered into with the Commission's Designated 
Agency Ethics Official. I am not aware of any other potential conflicts

    6. Describe any activity during the past ten years, including the 
names of clients represented, in which you have been engaged for the 
purpose of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat, or 
modification of any legislation or affecting the administration and 
execution of law or public policy.
    During the past ten years, both in my capacity as President and CEO 
of Public Knowledge, in my current and previous Fellowship positions 
and in my personal capacity I have influenced the passage, defeat and 
modification of legislation and affected the administration and 
execution of law and public policy. This includes proposed and adopted 
laws and policies affecting communications, competition and technology 
law and policy. I have been asked for advice and guidance by Hill and 
agency staff, have been asked to testify numerous times, have written, 
spoken, and appeared in media about such proposed laws and policies.
    I have not represented any clients in these matters.
                            c. legal matters
    1. Have you ever been disciplined or cited for a breach of ethics, 
professional misconduct, or retaliation by, or been the subject of a 
complaint to, any court, administrative agency, the Office of Special 
Counsel, an Inspector General, professional association, disciplinary 
committee, or other professional group? If yes:

  a.  Provide the name of court, agency, association, committee, or 
        group;

  b.  Provide the date the citation, disciplinary action, complaint, or 
        personnel action was issued or initiated;

  c.  Describe the citation, disciplinary action, complaint, or 
        personnel action;

  d.  Provide the results of the citation, disciplinary action, 
        complaint, or personnel action.
    No.
    2. Have you ever been investigated, arrested, charged, or held by 
any Federal, State, or other law enforcement authority of any Federal, 
State, county, or municipal entity, other than for a minor traffic 
offense? If so, please explain.
    No.
    3. Have you or any business or nonprofit of which you are or were 
an officer ever been involved as a party in an administrative agency 
proceeding, criminal proceeding, or civil litigation? If so, please 
explain.
    Yes. In 2014 a former employee of Public Knowledge who was 
terminated for poor performance, refusal to abide by the terms of a 
Performance Improvement Plan, and insubordination, filed an age 
discrimination complaint against the organization with the DC Office of 
Human Rights. The Office dismissed the complaint as without merit.
    In addition, Sports Fans Coalition NY, Inc. (SFCNY), a non-profit 
corporation which I served as a board member from March 2020 to May 
2022, had a service (Locast) that operated under a statutory copyright 
exemption for non-profits (17 USC 111(a)(5)). In 2019 an action was 
brought against SFCNY by four broadcast networks in the District Court 
for the Southern District of New York. On August 31, 2021, the District 
Court determined that the exemption did not apply and Locast ceased 
providing service immediately thereafter. The matter was settled and 
the District Court entered a final satisfaction of judgment on February 
15, 2022. I resigned from the SFCNY board on May 9, 2022.
    4. Have you ever been convicted (including pleas of guilty or nolo 
contendere) of any criminal violation other than a minor traffic 
offense? If so, please explain.
    No.
    5. Have you ever been accused, formally or informally, of sexual 
harassment or discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, or 
any other basis? If so, please explain.
    I have never been so accused in my personal capacity. However, in 
2014 a former employee of Public Knowledge who was terminated for poor 
performance, refusal to abide by the terms of a Performance Improvement 
Plan, and insubordination, filed an age discrimination complaint 
against the organization with the DC Office of Human Rights. The Office 
dismissed the complaint as without merit.
    6. Please advise the Committee of any additional information, 
favorable or unfavorable, which you feel should be disclosed in 
connection with your nomination.
    None.
                     d. relationship with committee
    1. Will you ensure that your department/agency complies with 
deadlines for information set by congressional committees, and that 
your department/agency endeavors to timely comply with requests for 
information from individual Members of Congress, including requests 
from members in the minority? Yes.
    2. Will you ensure that your department/agency does whatever it can 
to protect congressional witnesses and whistleblowers from reprisal for 
their testimony and disclosures? Yes.
    3. Will you cooperate in providing the Committee with requested 
witnesses, including technical experts and career employees, with 
firsthand knowledge of matters of interest to the Committee? Yes.
    4. Are you willing to appear and testify before any duly 
constituted committee of the Congress on such occasions as you may be 
reasonably requested to do so? Yes.

    Chairman Coble, Congressman Berman and other members of the 
Subcommittee, my name is Gigi B. Sohn. I am the President of Public 
Knowledge, a new nonprofit public interest organization that seeks to 
ensure that citizens have access to a robust public domain, an open 
Internet and flexible digital technology.
    I want to thank the Subcommittee for holding this important hearing 
on the great promise of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks and some of the 
perils associated with their use. I am honored that you have chosen my 
organization to represent the citizen/consumer perspective at this 
hearing.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Public Knowledge is working in partnership with the Center for 
Democracy and Technology and Consumers Union on P2P and related digital 
copyright issues.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    My hope is that this hearing will further advance the dialogue that 
Public Knowledge and other public interest organizations have already 
begun with the various interested industries and with policymakers. 
That dialogue is intended to find solutions that provide the content 
industry with a ``reasonably secure'' digital environment for its 
content while ensuring that citizens retain their rights under 
copyright law and continue to have access to an open Internet and the 
kind of flexible technology that they have come to expect and enjoy.
P2P Technology is Changing the Face of Computing--For the Better
    In just two years, P2P has become a computing phenomenon. Millions 
of Internet users are communicating with each other through P2P file 
sharing software programs that allow a group of computer users to share 
text, audio and video files stored on each other's computers. While the 
P2P applications we know today are just a few years old, the technology 
underlying P2P is at the heart of the Internet. The Internet was 
designed to be a distributed system of linked computers in which users 
could freely share content and data stored on each other's computers.
    Few disagree that P2P networks are already changing the way 
businesses, educators, artists and ordinary citizens use their 
computers. In businesses, for example, they offer an alternative to 
centralized server-based sharing of documents and projects.\2\ The vast 
majority of these changes are positive. By linking together individual 
computers and distributing their power, P2P technology is superior to 
the centralized server approach because it:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ A recent Gartner Research Note (Technology T-16-2550, September 
16, 2002) predicts that ``[b]y 2005, 10 percent of business 
interactions will occur via P2P-enabled technologies (0.7 
probability).''

  <bullet> is more cost effective

    Already, both public and private P2P networks are helping small and 
large businesses (including content companies), universities, artists 
and others work collaboratively and more efficiently. Here are some 
examples:

  <bullet> The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Robert 
        Kirkpatrick, Distinguished Associate Professor of English and 
        Director of the London Summer Honors Program at the University 
        of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, used Groove Network's P2P 
        tools to manage a class in the composition of poetry. Among 
        other things, Kirkpatrick used P2P technology to encourage 
        collaborative editing and comment on students' work, adjust the 
        syllabus, archive course materials, and create a list of links 
        to resources of poetic forms and vast archives of complete 
        works of poems and critical writing. The class also uses the 
        Groove tools for a class forum and an announcement board to 
        share information on musical, dramatic and other events on 
        campus. Kirkpatrick said that P2P technology ``makes it 
        possible to extend that most expensive form of education--one-
        on-one tutorial--into a cohesive class experience. . ..It comes 
        very close to being, for me, the ideal academic tool.'' \3\

  <bullet> CenterSpan. CenterSpan is a distributed content delivery 
        network licensed to distribute copyrighted digital content from 
        major media companies. Earlier this year, CenterSpan announced 
        an agreement with Sony Music Entertainment whereby CenterSpan's 
        secure P2P network provides music from Sony Music artists to a 
        wide variety of online service providers seeking to offer their 
        subscribers streaming and downloadable music.\4\

  <bullet> J!VE Media. J!VE Media is the creator of a suite of digital 
        video packaging, digital rights management and media delivery 
        services which enable content providers to distribute protected 
        digital video content via publicly accessible P2P networks, 
        including the Gnutella Network (which includes users of 
        LimeWire and Morpheus) and the Fastrack Network (which includes 
        users of KaZaA and Grokster). J!VE uses P2P distribution 
        technology because it allows content owners to rely almost 
        entirely on users to provide the most costly computing 
        resources involved in digital distribution: data storage and 
        bandwidth. J!VE distributes only authorized content, and its 
        customers include: 1) the Priority Records division of the EMI 
        Recorded Music Group; 2) Koch International, the world's third 
        largest independent music label; and 3) The Comedy Network, 
        Canada's 24 hour comedy cable channel.\5\

        authorized by copyright owners for distribution. One of the 
        chief hurdles facing Project Gutenberg and public domain 
        projects like it has been the expense of hosting and 
        distributing the resulting files. Today, these expenses are 
        being reduced, and valuable public domain works are reaching 
        more people, because these texts are being distributed over P2P 
        networks.\6\

  <bullet> Furthur Network. The Furthur Network is a non-commercial, 
        open source, P2P network of legal live music. Music lovers 
        download and share music from each other. Musicians that allow 
        the non-commercial taping and trading of their live 
        performances are allowed on this publicly accessible P2P 
        network. This would include bands like the Grateful Dead, the 
        Allman Brothers Band and the Dave Matthews Band. TDK, the 
        consumer electronics and recordable media company has recently 
        recognized the importance of this segment of the music industry 
        by sponsoring the third annual Jammy Awards, which honors 
        musicians who focus their art on live music. In the words of 
        Bruce Youmans, TDK's Vice President of Marketing, ``There are 
        literally hundreds of sources, including directly from some of 
        the artists performing at the Jammys, for legally acquiring 
        today's best music without infringing on artists' copyrights.''

    All indications are that P2P technology will stimulate our economy 
if it is allowed to flourish. As with any successful new technology, 
innovators will seek to capitalize by developing new applications for 
P2P.\8\ Moreover, since every computer on a P2P network becomes, in 
effect, a file server for every other computer, it is likely that 
businesses and individuals will demand faster and more powerful PC's. 
Equally as important, many experts predict that increased use of P2P 
networks will drive up the demand for broadband.\9\ It is not difficult 
to see why--using the increased bandwidth capabilities of a P2P 
network, a homeowner using only a DSL line could send files at a speed 
and capacity that is eight times faster than a T-1 line!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ One exciting P2P application that is in its nascent stages is 
``P2P signing'' for the deaf and hard of hearing. Through this 
application, an interpreter in one location can use high-speed 
communications and low-cost video cameras to provide interpreting 
services to consumers at other locations across the country. Frank G.

Like Other Technologies, P2P Can Be Abused
    Despite the recognition of Congressman Berman and other legislators 
of the enormous promise of P2P networks,\10\ the focus of this hearing 
is on their abuses--that is, the illegal sharing of copyrighted 
material over these networks. Let me be clear--Public Knowledge does 
not condone the illegal sharing of files on any network--be it P2P or 
otherwise. We believe in the constitutional and historical purpose of 
copyright protection, that is, to encourage the creation of new 
artistic works for the ultimate benefit of the public. That purpose is 
not well served by individuals who engage in large scale illegal file 
trading. As discussed below, we think that the content industry has 
several avenues available to it to curb these abuses that will also 
preserve the technology and the rights and expectations of consumers 
and computer users.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ Speech by the Honorable Howard L. Berman to the Computer and 
Communications Industry Association Regarding Solutions to Peer to Peer 
Piracy (June 25, 2002), www house.gov/berman/p2p062502 html (``P2P 
networks represent as much of an opportunity as a threat to copyright 
creators. P2P represents an efficient method of information transfer, 
has the potential to greatly reduce the costs associated with server-
based distribution systems, and can support a variety of legitimate 
business models.'')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    That being said, my fear is that the emphasis on the abuses of P2P 
networks may well give rise to actions that could ultimately destroy 
the promise of this technology. As discussed below, proposed laws like 
H.R. 5211 could lead to actions by copyright owners that could 
literally bring these and other networks to a sudden and unfortunate 
halt. Even where the copyright owner's motives are the most benign, 
actions authorized by this bill could seriously tax these valuable 
networks by making them less efficient, more unstable, and subject to 
greater private control. That is not good for consumers, the tech 
industry or the content industry, which believes, as I do, that it will 
figure out how to harness P2P technology and profit. Thus, it is not 
just the illegal activity that might be slowed by the kinds of self 
help techniques authorized by this bill, but also every legitimate 
current and yet-to-be-developed business dependent upon the promise of 
P2P technology.
    P2P networks, like other technologies (e.g., cars, telephones) can 
be used for good, or they can be abused. But we don't outlaw these 
technologies or limit their legitimate use because of the possibility 
(and yes, even the probability) that someone will use them to do harm. 
Public Knowledge supports targeted mechanisms to limit abuses of these 
networks. But we cannot support laws or technological measures that 
harm legitimate uses of the technology in the effort to curtail 
illegitimate ones.
The Content Industry Has Tools at Its Disposal Which, If Used Together, 
        Can Limit the Impact of Illegal File Trading Over P2P Networks.
    Over the past several months, my staff and I have had a number of 
productive conversations with various sectors of the content industry. 
While we have not agreed on everything, I have appreciated their 
willingness to be candid and engage in a continuing dialogue. One thing 
the various sectors of the industry have been willing to admit is that 
infringement cannot be stopped completely. This is true with regards to 
physical infringement as well as virtual infringement.
    Thus, the critical question becomes: how can the effect of illegal 
file trading over the Internet be limited without eroding the 
legitimate consumer/computer user rights and expectations? I propose a 
combination of three tools:
Enforcement of Existing Laws
    Both the Copyright Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
provide for remedies for certain unlawful uses of copyrighted 
material.\11\ There is little evidence and indeed, the content 
industries do not claim, that when the law is enforced it is 
ineffective. In fact, when the content industries choose to enforce 
their rights under these laws, like in the Napster, Audiogalaxy and 
Madster (aka ``Aimster'') cases, they have succeeded.

U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2318-2319A.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite its claims that billions of songs have been illegally 
downloaded, we are not aware of a single case in which the recording 
industry has taken legal action against an individual downloader. The 
problem is that the recording industry apparently does not want to 
enforce the rights it claims when it comes to illegal P2P file trading 
because it looks bad to sue its own customers. Therefore, the industry 
has decided instead to shift that burden onto other corporations, and 
in particular, ISPs. As many of you know, the RIAA is seeking to force 
Verizon to hand over the names of its customers based solely on the 
RIAA's allegations that those customers are engaging in infringing 
activity. Verizon, backed by civil liberties and other public interest 
organizations such as my own, has argued, among other things, that 
forcing ISPs simply to give copyright owners the names of their 
customers without a judicial determination that they may be engaged in 
any illegal conduct would violate the constitutionally mandated privacy 
and anonymity rights of their customers, and put ISPs in the untenable 
position of having to respond to the numerous identification requests 
that would inevitably result.
    Were Verizon and other ISPs to comply with such requests, the RIAA 
would be empowered to collect sufficient information with which to 
conduct investigations of potential defendants and engage in 
surveillance over a period of days or even years, choosing to sue the 
defendants presenting the worst facts and having profiles least likely 
to garner public or judicial sympathy. As is often said, bad facts make 
bad law. The RIAA plan appears to have no other purpose than to find 
the worst facts before seeking an interpretation of its legal rights.
    Verizon's refusal to succumb to the RIAA's request does not leave 
the industry without a remedy. It can bring a ``John Doe'' lawsuit 
against anonymous infringers and serve Verizon with a third-party 
subpoena pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 45. Once the industry has 
satisfied a judge that its allegations of infringement have evidentiary 
support, Verizon (and other ISPs) will be required to make available 
those names. With ``robot'' technology that allows the industry to 
pinpoint the most egregious uploaders with some (but by all means not 
perfect, see discussion below) accuracy, the industry's complaint that 
it would have to bring numerous expensive lawsuits rings hollow. Unless 
the industry wants to sue every person with a handful of infringing 
files on its hard drive, it has the economic and technological means to 
locate the kind of large scale alleged infringer that it would want to 
bring to court.
    An industry-initiated law suit against a large scale infringer 
could also have the benefit of serving as a deterrent to other bad 
actors. As we have seen in other contexts, specifically targeted 
lawsuits and other legal action can have a deterrent effect, and also 
educate the public as to what is legal. But if the industry refuses to 
bring targeted cases, we will only be left with unfounded complaints 
that the copyright law provides a ``right without a remedy.'' The 
remedies exist, but copyright owners must take up the challenge of 
invoking them.
Non-Invasive Self-Help
    Public Knowledge does not oppose the use of reasonable non-invasive 
self-help techniques by the content industry. By non-invasive, we mean 
techniques that do not entail a third party attacking a file located on 
a computer hard drive (or denial-of-service attacks on individual users 
or on providers). Examples of non-invasive self-help include spoofing, 
flooding, decoy, spoiler files and redirection. Many of these 
techniques involve the intentional distribution of phony or corrupted 
files that an individual seeking to make an unlawful reproduction will 
then download. Others will send downloaders to legitimate sites. What 
distinguishes these techniques is that they are activated by an 
individual's affirmative effort to obtain an unlicensed copy of a file.
    On the other hand, Public Knowledge cannot support self-help 
techniques that permit the copyright owner to block access to an 
individual's computer hard drive for the purpose of making an allegedly 
illegal file unusable or incapable of being downloaded.
    In the most popular of these techniques, commonly known as 
Interdiction, a computer program repeatedly requests the same file from 
a particular P2P network user. As a result, no one else can get to that 
file, or to any other file on that user's computer even if the other 
files to which access is sought are perfectly legal and downloading 
them is perfectly lawful.
    There are several problems with self-help techniques of this kind. 
The first, of course, is that the program, or robot, could be mistaken 
in its determination that a file is one that warrants protection. While 
we have received assurances from the RIAA that the ``bots'' that its 
member companies use are extraordinarily accurate, evidence submitted 
in its pending litigation with Verizon demonstrates otherwise. For 
example, UUNet, an ISP, was sent a notice by Warner Brothers, owner of 
the copyright to the motion picture ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's 
Stone.'' The notice asked UUNet to disable access to a user, 
identifying as the single infringing file a 1K file named ``harry 
potter book report.rtf.'' The size and type of the file make it clear 
that the file was nothing more than a child's school book report on a 
Harry Potter book. The record includes other examples of similar 
inaccuracies.\12\

    \12\ Motion for Leave to File and Brief Amicus Curiae of United 
States Internet Service Provider Association in Support of Respondent 
filed in Recording Industry Association of America v. Verizon Internet 
Services, Case No. 1:02MS003323 at 6-12.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Moreover, it is important to remember that the members of the RIAA 
will not be the only copyright owners capable of using these 
techniques, particularly if H.R. 5211 becomes law. The fact that 
Interdiction not only makes unavailable the allegedly infringing file, 
but also makes the rest of the user's files unavailable only 
exacerbates this problem.
    A second concern is that Interdiction and similar self-help 
techniques punish individuals for ``making available'' copyrighted 
content, regardless of whether that content was legally obtained or 
not. Such punishment would extend copyright protection beyond what the 
law currently allows. Unlike in the European Union, U.S. copyright law 
does not give a copyright owner a separate right to ``make available'' 
his work. Efforts to include such a right here have been heretofore 
rejected.
    Finally, we are concerned with the worst case scenario--that 
repeated requests or similar actions could prevent a user from 
accessing the Internet for any other purpose, resulting in a so-called 
``denial of service.'' Regardless of whether an individual has an 
infringing file, denial of service caused by self-help will burden ISPs 
and other network users, both indirectly and directly. This is 
particularly true where such attacks can be done secretly, such that a 
user's first call will be to its own ISP to complain about a 
malfunction. Even on a network where a loss of service for one may not 
directly affect other users, every denial of service claim requires ISP 
time and resources to figure out its cause, causing it to spend less 
time on other, more serious service problems, which might be caused by 
cyberterrorism, other security breaches or legitimate technological 
breakdowns. This has an indirect effect on all the other customers on 
an ISPs network and also burdens the entire network. Moreover, with 
some ISP networks (particularly the shared architecture of cable modem 
service), the service quality of innocent ISP customers could be 
directly affected if invasive self-help leads to a denial of service 
for another customer--in other words, innocent ISP customers are harmed 
by the acts of one suspected infringer.
    Legitimizing and harboring invasive self-help has startling 
implications. Again, whether the large content companies use techniques 
that are more accurate and often unrecognized by the computer user is 
nice, but is largely beside the point. If expressly permitted or 
protected, self-help of various shapes and sizes will be available to 
all copyright owners, some of whom may believe that it is perfectly 
within their rights to launch denial of service attacks. Some of these 
attacks may affect actual infringers, while some almost certainly will 
affect innocent parties, who will have no idea why they (or others) 
cannot access their files or why their Internet service is not working. 
These attacks will likely provoke retaliatory attacks by some users, 
and the acquisition of defensive software by others. Soon, the Internet 
will look like the Wild West, with self help bots and bot blockers 
replacing guns as the weapon of choice.
    The collective impact of all these self help efforts, particularly 
if they are sanctioned by law, might be to reduce or eliminate the 
effectiveness of the Internet as a communications medium in a number of 
ways, from consuming bandwidth to forcing ISPs into imposing crippling 
terms-of-service agreements. The final victim of this Internet free-
for-all, of course, would be rollout of broadband, for which P2P is the 
``killer app.''
Promoting Competition to Build a New Business Model
    Last June, at the request of USA Today, I spent several hours 
discussing digital media issues with a number of top executives from 
the content and consumer electronics industries. What struck me was 
that the New York representatives of the content industries all agreed 
on one thing: that they had to create new business models that take 
advantage of the low cost, ubiquity and speed of the Internet. In 
answering the question of whether the recording industry had responded 
to the Internet needs of its customers, John Rose, Executive Vice 
President of the EMI Group stated:

        There's no question that this industry, like every other 
        industry that went through this, didn't deal with it in as 
        forward-thinking a manner as it could have. The real question 
        is: here's where we are, what do we do about it? There's no way 
        you're going to constrain the Internet, . . . The question is, 
        can you come up with economic models to empower guys like Alan 
        [McGlade of MusicNet, an industry-backed online music 
        service]?\13\

    These content industry executives believe, as I do, that if they 
can provide easy access to a wide range of high quality content at a 
fair price, most consumers looking for content over the Internet will 
choose their services.\14\ In other words, they believe that they can, 
in fact, ``compete with free.'' \15\ Rob Reid of Listen.com, an online 
subscription music service that licenses music from the recording 
industry, said as much in a recent Department of Commerce Forum:

intellectual property on the Internet, cooperate across sectors and

    \15\ Bon Jovi and its record company, Vivendi Universal SA's

        The way I compete [with free] is I have to create a service 
        that's better than free, which is hard to do. I mean, that's 
        hard to do. I mean, that's a tough proposition, but the good 
        news is people do opt for things that are better than free all 
        the time. If they didn't, you know, we'd be eating at soup 
        kitchens every night, and not going to restaurants. And just 
        looking around this table, I see a bottle of Poland Springs . . 
        . that tells us that designer water is a multi-billion dollar 
        industry, and that comes out of the faucet for free. So better 
        than free does exist. . . .\16\

    Despite the fact that industry efforts to bring content online have 
been going on for years, a successful business model has not emerged. 
One of the reasons this is so is that creating such a model is not a 
simple task--it takes time, resources and sometimes plain dumb 
luck.\17\ But I believe that there are two other reasons a business 
solution has been slow in coming: 1) the same industry minds have been 
attacking the same problem for all that time, and 2) the industry has 
refused to permit others to try and figure out how best to deliver 
content over the Internet.

by online music services (including those backed by the recording 
industry) in getting permission to sell certain songs over the 
Internet. Amy Harmon, ``Copyright Hurdles Confront Selling of Music on 
the Internet,'' NY Times, September 23, 2002 at C1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If the content industries are sincere in their desire to create new 
business models (and I believe that they are), then they should give 
others the opportunity to help them to do so. Not for free--for 
example, the recording companies could license their music to various 
online retailers and ask the licensee for the same statutory rate that 
the publisher gets ($0.08) for each song the licensee sold online. 
Retailers who choose to offer them to the public must all pay the same 
``wholesale'' price but can then compete vigorously with each other to 
find the business proposition most appealing to consumers. This is a 
win-win situation. The copyright owner gets paid, and a competition 
ensues to build an online music service that provides a high quality, 
large catalogue at a reasonable price. In fact, several successful 
business models could emerge that are entirely different than anything 
being contemplated today and appeal to different types of consumers, 
just as retail stores do for pre-packaged goods. There will be 
failures, no doubt--but until innovators and entrepreneurs are given a 
chance to fail, the chances that success will be achieved are greatly 
diminished, and the public benefit from broad and competitive 
dissemination will surely be lost.\18\

H.R. 5211 is a Well-Intentioned but Flawed Bill
    Public Knowledge appreciates the good intentions of Reps. Berman, 
Coble, Smith and Wexler in sponsoring H.R. 5211. We believe that they 
are sincere in their desire to encourage P2P technology and to stem the 
flow of illegal file sharing.
    Unfortunately, these good intentions cannot save this flawed bill. 
Part of the problem is that because P2P technology underlies the entire 
Internet, it is difficult to draft legislation that addresses specific 
P2P networks such as Morpheus and KaZaA without also including the 
entire Internet and World Wide Web in its scope. Also, as discussed 
above, it is difficult to imagine certain ``self-help'' techniques that 
could interfere with specific P2P networks that would not also put the 
efficient functioning of the larger Internet at risk, impose enormous 
new tech support burdens on ISPs and impair customer satisfaction with 
broadband. Finally, as discussed above, while we may accept that some 
of the techniques now in use by the content industries are somewhat 
benign, this bill allows for self-help by all copyright owners--some of 
whom may not have the same concerns about upsetting their customers as 
do large content companies.
    Among the provisions in this bill that are the most troublesome 
from a consumer perspective are:

  <bullet> The bill gives copyright owners extraordinary powers to 
        engage in self-help. H.R. 5211 grants copyright owners and 
        their agents the right to break any law, state or federal, 
        civil or criminal, in furtherance of ``disabling, interfering 
        with, blocking, diverting or otherwise impairing'' the 
        availability of his or her copyrighted works on a public P2P 
        network. This extraordinary power is limited by five vague 
        conditions: 1) the copyright owner may not ``alter, delete, or 
        otherwise impair the integrity of any computer file or data 
        residing on the computer of a file trader'' (Subsection (a)); 
        2) the owner must not impair the availability of files on a 
        targeted computer other than the works the copyright owner 
        owners except as ``reasonably necessary'' (Subsection 
        (b)(1)(a)); 3) the copyright owner may not cause ``economic 
        loss'' to any person other than the targeted file trader 
        (Subsection (b)(1)(B)); 4) the copyright owner may not cause 
        ``economic loss of more than $50'' to the targeted file trader 
        (Subsection (b)(1)(C)); and 5) the copyright owner must notify 
        the Attorney General seven days before engaging in self-help 
        (Subsection (c)).

    These conditions leave the door wide open for abuse by the 
        copyright owner and harm to computer users. For example, the 
        limitations on altering and deleting files in subsection (a) 
        conceivably would not prevent a copyright owner from cutting a 
        user's DSL line or even his phone line, or knocking his 
        satellite dish off his roof. The ``as reasonably necessary'' 
        language of subsection (b)(1)(a) is undefined and invites a 
        raft of excuses for why an individual's non-infringing files 
        were impaired by self-help. The subsections prohibiting 
        ``economic loss'' do not cover any non-economic loss that a 
        target file trader or innocent victim may incur. And Subsection 
        (c)'s notice provision is toothless: there is nothing in the 
        bill that gives the Attorney General guidelines by which to 
        judge self-help techniques or the power to reject them. All 
        that is required by that subsection is notice.

  <bullet> The bill shifts the burden of using self-help mechanisms 
        onto the consumer. Currently, the content industries are very 
        careful about the type of self-help techniques they use. This 
        is not only for public relations reasons--the misguided use of 
        these techniques that harms an innocent party could also result 
        in serious legal liability for a copyright owner. By providing 
        a safe harbor for a whole range of non-invasive and invasive 
        self-help techniques, H.R. 5211 removes the incentives and 
        sanctions that currently impel content owners and others to be 
        careful in their self-help. While the damage limitation for 
        bringing a legal action for misguided self-help is only $250, 
        copyright owners know that most victims will never sue because 
        it is not worthwhile to do so; the damage rarely will be large 
        enough to justify the time and cost of litigation.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \19\ This is exacerbated by the fact that under the bill, a victim 
must first ask the Attorney General to decide whether her complaint is 
a valid one.

    Equally as troubling is the fact that the bill creates no 
        obligation for the copyright owner to notify a victim that her 
        Internet access has been impaired. If they are subject to 
        misguided self help, the vast majority of computer users will 
        have no idea why their computer has broken down or why they can 
        no longer access certain files. Without a notice requirement, 
        even a tech-savvy victim who figures out what has occurred and 
        decides to bring a lawsuit will not likely know whom to sue. 
        Only if the victim can figure out exactly who impaired her 
        system (among millions of copyright owners) can she then ask 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        for the reasons for that action. Subsection (c)(2)(A).

  <bullet> The bill erects enormous procedural obstacles for a victim 
        of self-help to overcome before she can seek the remedies 
        provided. H.R. 5211 creates a new cause of action for an 
        affected file trader when a copyright owner ``knowingly and 
        intentionally impairs . . . [a] particular computer file . . . 
        and has no reasonable basis to believe that such [file] 
        constitutes an infringement of copyright,'' and also causes 
        over $250 dollars in damages to the file trader. But where H.R. 
        5211 giveth, it also taketh away. Even though the copyright 
        owner is engaging in egregious and willful activity, the bill 
        erects procedural hurdles to innocent citizens seeking to 
        obtain restitution for wrongful self-help. The innocent file 
        trader cannot get to the courtroom without first getting 
        permission from the Attorney General (Subsection (d)). Whether 
        the victim will ever get to court is left to the sole 
        discretion of the Attorney General, who has four months to make 
        that determination. This creates a supreme irony: the bill 
        erects huge legal barriers for citizens seeking remedies for 
        misguided self-help, while it dismantles them for content 
        companies seeking remedies for infringement. This is not only 
        anti-consumer, it is also likely unconstitutional. It delegates 
        to the Executive Branch the discretion to block civil litigants 
        from access to Federal courts, and delegates to private parties 
        the power to do what no government can; namely, to 
        surreptitiously impose a prior restraint upon communications 
        that are presumptively protected by the First Amendment without 
        any judicial determination that the speech being suppressed is 
        unlawful.

  <bullet> The bill expands protection for copyrighted works beyond 
        that required by the Copyright Act. Subsection (a) of the bill 
        provides a safe harbor for self-help actions that impair the 
        ``unauthorized'' distribution, display, performance or 
        reproduction of a copyrighted work on a publicly accessible P2P 
        network. But not all ``unauthorized'' uses of copyrighted works 
        are illegal under the Copyright Act. In addition, as discussed 
        above, by permitting self-help against individuals who merely 
        make works available (rather than just those who illegally 
        download available works), the bill gives copyright owners an 
        additional ``right to make available to the public.'' This 
        right is now only recognized by European intellectual property 
        laws, and has heretofore been rejected in the U.S.

    H.R. 5211 is well intended to stem the flow of illegal file 
trading, but it goes way beyond what is necessary to permit the content 
industries to engage in the type of non-invasive self-help described 
above. While Public Knowledge might consider supporting a narrowly-
crafted proposal that clarifies that non-invasive self help is 
permissible, H.R. 5211 is not that bill.
Conclusion
    In conclusion, I want to thank Chairman Coble, Congressman Berman 
and the other members of the Subcommittee for holding this hearing to 
discuss P2P networks. As the sole representative of consumer and 
citizens rights at this hearing, I would respectfully ask that you keep 
the record open for thirty days to permit other public interest 
organizations to submit testimony and comments.
    Public Knowledge urges the Subcommittee to act cautiously before 
seeking to alter the nature of a technology that improves the already 
significant abilities and flexibility of computers and the Internet, 
benefits artists, educators and businesses, and may very well be the 
``magic bullet'' that drives broadband adoption. Illegal file trading 
on P2P networks can be limited through a combination of rigorous 
enforcement of the law, non-invasive self help techniques and promotion 
of competition to build new business models for online music. H.R. 
5211, however, goes far beyond what is necessary or reasonable to limit 
illegal file trading, and if passed, could lead to actions by copyright 
owners that could threaten the core capabilities of the Internet.
    Thank you.

    The Chair. Thank you, Ms. Sohn. And I am going to try to go 
quickly because we have 5-minute rounds and I am going to try 
to stick to that with everybody, and hopefully the comity of 
this effort will get information out for people.
    So, first of all, it is impressive that you have so many 
conservatives supporting your nomination, and I do think that 
speaks to your work for so many years in the field and your 
commitments to those issues of free speech.
    One of the issues, though, I kind of started thinking with 
all these attacks against you, I thought, well, this is a proxy 
fight for net neutrality. I think you and I have talked about 
that a little bit. And while I think that the Commission has 
every right to deal with net neutrality, I think me personally, 
I think the Congress is the best place to deal with that issue 
ultimately, because I think whatever the FCC does ends up 
probably in a legal dispute.
    So, but that aside, I started thinking the vitriol of these 
attacks made me think that, no, it is even more than this, that 
somehow you are a smart, talented individual that is going to 
go there and fight for affordable broadband anywhere.
    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely.
    The Chair. And somehow, if affordable broadband gets 
deployed anywhere, then somehow more affordable broadband might 
get deployed everywhere. So, I think there is probably billions 
of dollars at stake here, and that is why the vitriol is coming 
at you.
    Now, I hope that we can see through that today and really 
talk about the issues. I do want to talk about a couple of 
things, though, that have been brought up by my colleagues. So, 
I will get back to the issue of affordable broadband.
    So, a lot of people have made things of tweets. These are 
retweets. Is that correct--most of the things that people have 
talked about are retweets, is that correct?
    Ms. Sohn. Retweets and likes, yes.
    The Chair. OK. So, I am not saying that that--I mean, we 
all should be held accountable. But my guess is I don't know 
that any of these people up here could be probably on any job, 
if we looked at all of their tweets and retweets and looked at 
what people said. So, to me, that is not the issue. Second, 
this letter from the Fraternal Order of Police. Do you support 
Edward Snowden?
    Ms. Sohn. No, I actually think Edward Snowden is a Russian 
asset. I do not support Edward Snowden. And I think it is 
important to say that when somebody is on the board of an 
organization, it doesn't mean that they agree with every single 
thing they do.
    I am on the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. I 
am a proud board member. But they are involved in about 50 
different issues. And there are some things I care deeply about 
and I agree with, some things I don't agree with at all, 
including their embrace of Edward Snowden.
    And some things, frankly, are not in my wheelhouse.
    The Chair. I agree with you. I think it gets complicated. I 
mean, Peter Thiel is giving a ton of money to the EFF for 
awards for people that they think the EFF should be holding up. 
So, listen, it goes a lot of different ways. But on this issue 
of information for law enforcement, you believe in making sure 
that there are warrants and that people can get access to this 
information. Is that correct?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes. If I am confirmed, I will fully abide by 
CALEA, which the FCC does have a small role in. And yes, I do 
believe that law enforcement needs to abide by the First and 
Fourth Amendments. I don't think that is a radical position at 
all.
    The Chair. But people get confused on end-to-end encryption 
and think that there is no data available there and there is 
data. And once it is decrypted, they could also get access to 
that data. Is that not correct? And you support law enforcement 
getting access both through the initial information and the 
decrypted information, is that correct?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes.
    The Chair. OK. So, I think there is a misalignment here 
about what your view is, at least from the perspective of that 
letter, and I hope that we can continue to have some 
information and correction on that.
    And to this point of the settlement, again, another board 
that you were on and another settlement, which you didn't have 
anything to do with the details of the settlement. And in 
consequence, you also, when you were before this committee, 
were prohibited in talking about the exact details.
    I think my colleague, Senator Wicker, tried to get you on 
this point, but you were prohibited by law from discussing that 
settlement amount as a board member. So, I just want, if you 
could clarify this again for the members quickly.
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, I think there are a couple of things that 
need to be clarified. First of all, I was bound by the 
settlement agreement. OK, I was not a party to the litigation, 
so I never had any liability whatsoever.
    So, this notion that, you know, I got some sort of 
sweetheart deal. There was never a sweetheart deal as to me. 
Frankly, it wasn't even a sweetheart deal as to Locast. So, 
there was a settlement decided on, on October 12th, that was 2 
weeks before I was nominated and I did not know at the time 
that I was going to be nominated, that Locast would pay 
$700,000 to the networks.
    Then there was two weeks later, the document that I signed 
talked about $32 billion. Now, that was never--I am sorry, 
Senator Cruz, you are wrong. The judge never said that there 
was a penalty of $32 million, and the judge never said that 
Locast had any liability whatsoever.
    The Chair. Well, we are going to get into this and my time 
has expired, but I just--I want people to know you came to the 
second hearing after that decision so we could have the 
hearing. So, I feel like you showed a great deal of 
transparency on this issue and I appreciate it. And I will have 
to get back to my lowering costs of broadband for the second 
round. Senator Cruz.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Sohn, this is 
your third hearing. That is highly unusual. One of the reasons 
that you have had third hearing--three hearings is that in the 
first hearing, you went through the entire hearing without 
disclosing the sweetheart settlement concerning Locast.
    And the entire purpose of the second hearing was when that 
came to light. You actively misled Ranking Member Wicker when 
he asked you in writing about the $32 million settlement. You 
did not correct the record that it was, in fact, only 2 percent 
of that amount, $700,000.
    You also disclosed at that second hearing that you never 
notified the White House of this sweetheart deal, even though 
you signed it literally the day after they announced their 
intention to nominate you.
    My question is this, do you think that your failure to 
disclose the secret deal to this committee and your failure to 
disclose it to the White House, do you think that reflected 
poor judgment, yes or no?
    Ms. Sohn. No. I answered Senator Wicker's question 
honestly, and on advice of counsel.
    Senator Cruz. So, no, you don't think it was poor judgment?
    Ms. Sohn. No, I do not, because I was bound by the 
confidentiality agreement of the settlement.
    Senator Cruz. With respect, no, you were not. The 
confidentiality agreement, Section 6.0 prohibited you from 
communicating with the media or the press. The last I checked, 
the U.S. Senate is not the media or the press. You had an 
obligation to answer this body accurately and you did not.
    I would note the White House is not the media or the press, 
and you told this committee you didn't inform the President of 
it either. Let me move on, you don't think it was poor judgment 
to mislead this committee or to mislead the President who was 
nominating you. Let me ask you a second question----
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, I don't agree that I misled this 
committee, so I would like to make that clear.
    Senator Cruz. The record is, I believe, abundantly clear. 
And in fact, I will be sending out my cross-examination from 
the last hearing where you repeatedly mislead this committee in 
that hearing. And in fact, we will go ahead and actually put 
this up.
    I will note, I asked, did you disclose to the Committee 
that agreement? I did. Did you disclose the agreement to the 
Committee? I did. Hold on a second, did you disclose it to this 
committee, yes or no? I did.
    You disclosed the $700,000 secret settlement? No. So, three 
times you say I did, and then, oh, no, you did not. You misled 
this committee and you also misled the White House. Let me ask 
you second, the 15 months that your nomination has been 
pending, you have made not 1, not 2, not 3, you have made 12 
separate political contributions to Senators running for 
office.
    I have been in the Senate 10 years. I have never seen a 
nominee make contributions to Senators while your nomination is 
pending. I have never seen that once. I had my staff search the 
records, if we could find anyone in the Trump Administration 
who had done that, my staff was unable to find that.
    You have been a significant political donor over the years, 
giving over $32,000. You gave--do you believe it was poor 
judgment to give 12 separate political contributions to 
Democrat Senators while your nomination was pending?
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, I am a citizen who just wanted to 
participate in the democratic process. The answer is no.
    Senator Cruz. So yes, or no? Do you think it is poor 
judgment to cut checks to Senators who are voting on your 
nomination while it is pending? No other nominee that we can 
find has ever done that. Do you think it was poor judgment?
    Ms. Sohn. Relatively small donations, no, I don't.
    Senator Cruz. It was over $1,000--$32,000 over your life.
    Ms. Sohn. Well, that is over my life.
    Senator Cruz. Well, over $1,000 while your nomination was 
pending. All right.
    Ms. Sohn. But not to one person. Most----
    Senator Cruz. Oh, no, no. They were to a dozen Senators. To 
a dozen different Senators, including Senators who have been 
critical of your nomination and Senators who have not. You 
managed to cover the waterboard of Democrats running for 
office.
    All right, let's turn to another issue, which is you have 
been an active supporter of a left-wing activist group called 
Fight for the Future. And I will say the record of Fight for 
the Future is really quite remarkable because they have blasted 
members of this committee on both sides of the aisle.
    Here is a billboard that Fight for the Future put up in 
West Virginia in 2017 attacking Senator Joe Manchin, a 
Democrat. The billboard essentially accuses Joe Manchin of 
being corrupt. Ms. Sohn, do you believe Joe Manchin is corrupt?
    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely not.
    Senator Cruz. You don't. OK. Well, that is interesting. I 
will point out in 2017, Fight for the Future also erected 
similar billboards accusing Senator Tester and Senator Peters 
of being corrupt, both of whom are members of this committee. I 
can't recall a nominee who has actively supported efforts to 
blast members of this committee to run billboards.
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, may I address that, please?
    Senator Cruz. You may.
    Ms. Sohn. When you say actively, I give every single 
organization with whom I work on net neutrality $100 
contributions at the end of the year. It doesn't mean I agree 
with their tactics.
    Senator Cruz. Ms. Sohn, with respect--the time is limited. 
And yes, it does, because after they put up the billboards 
attacking Manchin, Tester, and Peters as corrupt, afterwards, 
you sent this tweet. Just made my end of year donation to this 
organization, urging others to do it after they did that.
    And because the time is limited, I will note this group 
also blasted Marsha Blackburn, Dan Sullivan, and 
astonishingly--Roger Wicker, and astonishingly called for 
Chairwoman Cantwell to be fired. And after each of those--to be 
removed as Chairwoman of this committee.
    After each of those, you supported it. And in fact, I want 
to turn to the final point, the Roger Wicker one, where this 
group protested and said, ``you are buying a Senator.'' And you 
said ``you don't support their tactics.''
    I am going to point out you tweeted, ``well done,'' to this 
radical group who blasted the former Ranking Member of this 
Committee in saying that his donors were ``trying to buy a 
Senator.''
    If they were ``trying to buy a Senator,'' were you ``trying 
to buy Senators'' when you made a dozen contributions?
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, I did not know, number one, that that 
was about Senator Wicker. Number two, I was criticizing----
    Senator Cruz. It says Senator Roger Wicker, right there.
    Ms. Sohn. OK. Well----
    Senator Cruz. That is literally what you retweeted was his 
name.
    Ms. Sohn. That is fine. But I was actually criticizing the 
donors and not criticizing the Senator.
    The Chair. Senator Markey.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have known Gigi 
Sohn for 30 years. Ms. Sohn is one of the single most qualified 
candidates for any position to ever come before the Commerce 
Committee for confirmation.
    We knew that before Ms. Sohn testified before this 
committee in December 2021 as President Biden's nominee for the 
FCC, based on her decades of service protecting the public 
interest, that she had an outstanding record.
    And we certainly know that now, as Ms. Sohn comes before 
the Committee for a third time, that her record is historically 
good. Since President Biden selected Ms. Sohn, she has become 
the subject of smears, double standards, and personal attacks. 
And let's be clear, it is not just Ms. Sohn who has suffered 
during this process.
    The American people have suffered as well, because in the 
time when telecommunications policy and broadband are more 
important than ever, the Federal Communications Commission, the 
expert agency, has been missing a commissioner.
    And without Ms. Sohn, the FCC has been unable to take 
critical steps to close the digital divide, make sure the 
Internet remains free and open for everyone, protects 
consumers, and ends the homework gap once and for all for 
American children.
    So, make no mistake, every day that Ms. Sohn goes without 
being on the FCC is a win for giant telecommunications 
companies and their army of lobbyists here in Washington, D.C. 
It is a loss for the American people. And why do the giant 
companies oppose Ms. Sohn?
    Because she believes in Darwinian paranoia inducing 
competition in the telecommunications field. She believes in 
consumer protections. Those giant incumbent companies want to 
change the name to incumbent communications companies.
    They don't believe in competition and they don't believe in 
consumer protections, and that is why they don't want Gigi Sohn 
on the Committee. So, I would like to, actually for the record, 
introduce the 400 individuals and organizations who are 
supporting her, for the record.
    The Chair. Without objection.
    [The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    Senator Markey. Thank you. And I would like to turn to you, 
Ms. Sohn, with the remainder of my time, and give you an 
opportunity to respond to any of the accusations that have 
already been made about you in this committee.
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, I would like to actually like to address 
something that Senator Thune talked about, about an alleged 
leak at the FCC. And what he is talking about was an inspector 
general report 2016, 7 years ago, where the Inspector General 
found that because Chairman Wheeler had authorized me to speak 
to the press about something that was nonpublic, that it became 
public.
    So, there was no leak, and the Inspector General cleared 
everybody of wrongdoing. So, I think it is really important to 
understand that when you are talking about my honesty and 
integrity, the IG report found no wrongdoing and there was no 
leak.
    That is a meme that keeps getting repeated, and that just 
frankly drives me a little bit nuts. The other thing I wanted 
to discuss was back to the Locast case. The Locast case was 
never about money.
    Even before I joined the board in 2019, 2 months after the 
case was filed, the parties agreed that this case was not about 
piracy, that it was about whether Locast qualified for an 
exemption as a nonprofit under the copyright law.
    And that is why this case has never been about money. What 
the networks wanted and why they settled was because they 
wanted Locast gone, and that $32 million was just put in a 
public document in order to scare away the next Locast.
    Senator Markey. Meaning that they wanted to ensure that 
there was a deterrent to any other competitors that might want 
to get into the communications sector. Is that what you are 
saying?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes. So, $32 million was what the plaintiffs 
could have gotten had we gone to trial, and had we appealed. We 
decided not to appeal, even though, frankly, the case was weak. 
The networks were delighted, in fact they were pressuring us to 
settle because it was such a weak decision.
    Senator Markey. So, you settled, or Locast settled because 
of the incumbent telecommunications companies that wanted so.
    Ms. Sohn. Yes. So, and that is the thing, a settlement is 
an agreement between two parties. That is why I find it odd to 
call it a sweetheart deal.
    You are talking on one side about the most powerful 
networks, right, the four broadcast networks and I think there 
were some other broadcasters as well, versus this little 
nonprofit that had a $2 million budget.
    I mean, it is a settlement. It is an agreement between two 
parties. It is not a sweetheart deal. I think the broadcasters 
got exactly what they wanted. Locast did not get what it 
wanted. Locast wanted to stay in business.
    Senator Markey. There are so many red herrings against your 
candidacy. We might have to put in an aquarium here in the well 
of the Committee to be able to nominate them all. Thank you.
    The Chair. Senator Thune.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Madam Chair. And let me just go 
back because you mentioned something about this being a proxy 
fight over net neutrality. And it really isn't that. But we did 
go back, we restored the--in 2017, those rules were reversed.
    Six years since then, broadband access has expanded and 
reached more rural areas, Internet speeds have increased, there 
is more competition, creating more value to consumers here in 
the United States.
    And even in the U.K., which imposed heavy handed net 
neutrality regulations in 2016, they moved to lessen its net 
neutrality regulations after seeing a decrease in broadband 
investment and not being able to meet consumers' demands 
through the course of the pandemic.
    So, you said--and I mean, your support for that is very 
clear. But the reason I don't think this is not a proxy on net 
neutrality, your nomination. I think what perhaps it is a proxy 
on is the partisanship with which you approach not only that 
issue but every other issue.
    There was an attempt here on this committee to try and come 
up with a bipartisan agreement to deal with the issue of 
blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, all those sorts of 
things. And then the FCC under Chairman Wheeler, who was a very 
partisan FCC Chairman, probably the most partisan in history, 
decided to go their own way.
    And so, my question, I guess, having to do with that 
subject, because I want to get to one other issue that you 
mentioned. But let's just say, for example, that Congress were 
to decide, you know, to do something on this issue of blocking, 
for example.
    Do you believe that the FCC should come to Congress for 
more direction before attempting any iteration of net 
neutrality rules to prevent the back and forth between 
administrations, which is what we will see when administrations 
flip and the FCC changes majorities, you are going to get this 
back and forth, which creates no stability, no predictability, 
and completely undermines the conditions for investment, if you 
want to continue to see the technology expand and grow.
    So, I guess the question is, do you think that the FCC 
ought to come to Congress before you do something like that, 
yes or no?
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, I think I said this in both my hearings, 
prior hearings. I would love for Congress to give the FCC 
proper authority and specific authority to adopt net neutrality 
rules. Now, net neutrality has been repealed now for--well, we 
have been debating net neutrality for over 20 years and 
Congress has not done so.
    The most important thing I want to make clear is that to me 
the issue is not about blocking and throttling and paid 
prioritization. It is about whether an agency, which was 
created in 1934 to oversee communications networks, should have 
the power to oversee the most powerful communications network 
of our time.
    Congress has had many, two decades now, to decide that 
authority, and it has refused to do so. However, I still 
believe Congress should do so, and I beg Congress to do so. But 
until then, until it does so, the agency has got to have 
authority.
    Senator Thune. So, if we came up with something up here 
that, for example, legislation that would prevent blocking but 
only blocking, would you support that, yes, or no?
    Ms. Sohn. As a partial solution, yes, but not the entire 
solution.
    Senator Thune. All right. Let's shift to the, as you will 
likely recall, as part of a request I made to the FCC when 
serving as Chairman of this Committee, you were named, you 
mentioned this as being a source for leak of confidential 
information that ultimately turned what could have been a 
bipartisan decision to adopt a cap for the Lifeline Program 
into a partisan vote that left the program uncapped at the 
time. You recall this particular investigation, you said you 
did----
    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely.
    Senator Thune. So, is it correct that you did leak certain 
information about the FCC's Lifeline order to the press at the 
direction of then Chairman Wheeler, yes, or no?
    Ms. Sohn. It was not a leak. I will admit that I called 
Politico and told them that there was a deal, although I did 
not reveal the amount of the cap because Chairman Wheeler 
authorized me only to reveal the existence of the cap, not the 
amount. And when he authorized me, as the IG says on the final 
page, that turned nonpublic information into public 
information. So, at that point, it was no longer a leak.
    Senator Thune. Well, on the IG report, the point isn't that 
it was illegal, but that it was blown--it blew up a bipartisan 
deal.
    So, I want to come back to my original premise, and that is 
your activities at the FCC previous, everything that you have 
advocated since, including activity in political campaigns, 
which has already been alluded to, suggests that you would be a 
very partisan influence on a Commission that, in my view, deals 
with issues where you need to try and find some consensus.
    What happened with the IG report, and I have got a copy of 
the IG report here, is that a deal, which was in the, you know, 
throes of being made between the--all five Commissioners, 
Republicans and Democrats, was scuttled and it was tanked.
    It was torpedoed by going public and trying to undermine 
that deal. That to me is, I think, the essence of what the IG 
report suggests, and I think it does get at the very heart of 
your qualifications as an FCC Commissioner.
    And I know I am out of time, so I would just add one final 
point. And I said this before at a hearing last year, and that 
is the issues--there was an Op-ed that Heidi Heitkamp, former 
Senator, Democrat Senator from North Dakota, submitted while 
your nomination was under consideration previously, in which 
she says, ``Sohn is wrong for the FCC and rural America,'' 
based on your comments, critical comments about delivery of 
broadband in rural areas?
    The Chair. I am going to let Ms. Sohn respond to that. 
Thank you, quickly, and then we are going to Senator Klobuchar.
    Ms. Sohn. Yes. So just two things really quickly. Chairman 
Wheeler, and it is in the IG report, would have gone along with 
that vote. The only reason that I was asked to call Politico is 
because the meeting kept getting delayed and delayed and 
delayed and we were just being inundated with calls.
    So, Wheeler actually would have done anything that 
Commissioner Clyburn would have asked to do. So that is number 
one. Number two, on the Heitkamp point. I am supported by, as 
you saw Chad Rupe, former RUS Administrator for the Trump 
Administration, Hilda Legg, former RUS Administrator for the 
Bush Administration, and NTCA, the Rural Broadband Association, 
WTA, Rural Broadband Advocates, and the Rural Wireless 
Association.
    And that is because I believe they need better broadband 
and I am absolutely a huge supporter. What I have criticized, 
and what Senator Heitkamp took way out of context was a speech 
that I gave that said that the Federal Government had not done 
a good enough job with the $50 billion it had over a decade in 
getting rural broadband to America.
    So, she took what I said completely out of context. I am a 
huge supporter of rural broadband and my supporters prove it.
    The Chair. Thank you----
    Senator Thune. Madam Chair, the IG report, the whole point 
was to scuttle a bipartisan deal on Lifeline.
    The Chair. Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you very much, Ms. Sohn. Let's 
take off on the broadband issue, which is so big to so many of 
us, especially those of us with rural areas. We know the FCC is 
responsible, one of the key agencies responsible for the 
rollout of the bipartisan infrastructure law. How does the lack 
of a full Commission, which has been going on for way too long, 
ultimately affect consumers who need reliable, affordable 
Internet access?
    Ms. Sohn. Well, it affects them in a myriad of different 
ways. I mean, first, and this is one of my frustrations of not 
having been confirmed yet, is I would love to be able to help 
the FCC ensure that they have the most accurate broadband map 
that they can possibly have.
    Now, I can't fix it myself, but I have unbelievable 
relationships with the states, including many of the states of 
folks that sit on this dais, and I would love to help improve 
that broadband map.
    And without an accurate broadband map, the money that is 
going to be spent by the Commerce Department is not going to go 
to the right places. And this is not to criticize the FCC. I 
think they are doing the best they can with what they have. But 
I could be an enormous help in that regard. There are many 
other things--I will stop there.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. I want to turn to something else I 
care a lot about, and I think you and I have talked about this 
before, and that is 9-1-1 centers. An estimated 240 million 
calls are made to 9-1-1 centers annually.
    However, often they are relying on outdated technologies. 
In many places, it doesn't even support text messages, which is 
how so many people are going to contact 9-1-1. Can you speak to 
the importance of upgrading 9-1-1 systems?
    I am one of the Chairs of the 911 Caucus. I have always 
cared a lot about this issue. And if confirmed, could you talk 
about what you think needs to be done?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, look, there is nothing more important that 
the FCC does that ensures that the public is safe.
    And when I was at the FCC with Chairman Wheeler, we 
actually started the proceeding that kind of got kicked off, NG 
9-1-1, and that is why public safety officials and NENA, which 
is the 9-1-1 association, support my confirmation.
    So, I would want to improve NG 9-1-1, if I am confirmed, 
and certainly ensure that it works properly in rural areas, 
because I know that is a problem.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Speaking of something else that you 
have touched on before about rural areas, and that is back to 
the broadband issue. In rural areas of my State, about 16 
percent of households lack access at even baseline speeds.
    And could you talk about your plans, after this bill has 
been passed, for achieving universal access to broadband, 
specifically in rural communities?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes. Thanks, Senator. What I believe deeply is 
that the FCC needs to work very, very closely with the NTIA to 
ensure that the really over $47 billion that the broadband 
infrastructure--the bipartisan infrastructure law has put out 
for broadband deployment is well spent, and that the states 
have the wherewithal to spend that money wisely.
    Because what we don't want is to come back in 5 years and 
say, wow, we spent $47 billion and we still have huge swaths of 
America, of rural America, and frankly, urban America, that 
don't have adequate broadband.
    So, I think the FCC needs to be a partner with the NTIA in 
implementing the terms of the infrastructure law and making 
sure that that money is spent, the taxpayer money is spent 
wisely and effectively.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. One of the issues that have 
come up over the years is the mapping, and maps have been a 
serious problem. I know you know that. The Broadband Data Act, 
which I led with Senators Wicker, and Peters, and Thune, is 
focused on improving the FCC's data collection process to get 
more accurate maps.
    It was signed into law in March 2020. Talk about how you 
are going to be able to focus on maps, if confirmed, to the 
areas that are served or unserved?
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, I will make this vow to everybody on 
this--in this room and on this dais. If I am confirmed, the 
first thing I am going to do is offer my assistance to the 
Chairwoman to do anything that it takes to make those maps as 
accurate as possible, so when NTIA gives out that money or 
allocates that money on June 30, we have the best map possible 
in the time that we have.
    Now, the map is iterative and it is going to keep getting 
better, getting better, getting better, but that June 30th date 
is a really, really critical date. And that is why time is 
really of the essence to get me confirmed. Because if I don't 
get confirmed at all, there is not going to be a fifth person 
on the FCC in time to do anything about those maps.
    So, I care deeply about this issue because I worked really, 
really hard on the broadband provisions of the infrastructure 
law. I was the person who sold it to the public interest 
community.
    It was not everything that the public interest community 
wanted, but I thought it was important because it was 
bipartisan and it was a lot of money, and it could do a lot of 
good. And I would like to continue that.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Peters.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you very much. Thank you.

                STATEMENT OF HON. GARY PETERS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN

    Senator Peters. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Sohn, well 
certainly, thank you for appearing before the Committee now a 
third time, and I certainly appreciate the opportunity to 
further discuss both your priorities and my priorities, and how 
the FCC can best serve Americans.
    First question is related to auto safety, and as Chairman 
of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, I am focused on 
improving safety on our roadways. Nearly 43,000 people died on 
our roads in 2021, the largest year over year increase since we 
began collecting records. And many of these deaths are 
avoidable, if we facilitate broad deployment of roadway safety 
technologies like C-V2X, which basically stands for cellular 
vehicle to everything technology.
    And that is why State Departments of Transportation, 
industry, safety groups, and academia have all lined up to ask 
the FCC to grant waivers to allow the deployment of this 
lifesaving technology, which, among other things, can enable 
vehicles to see around corners, beyond visual line of sight, 
provide safety warnings to at-blind intersections, alert driver 
to poor road conditions, or active school or work zones.
    Previous studies have estimated that deploying this 
technology could eliminate or mitigate the severity of more 
than 80 percent of light vehicle crashes. Deployment will also 
keep us from falling behind other nations that are already 
integrating this technology into their infrastructure.
    And that is why yesterday, Senator Lummis and I sent a 
letter to the FCC urging it to take action to grant these 
waivers and move forward on this technology within the auto 
safety spectrum.
    Madam Chair Cantwell, I would, without objection, would 
like to submit the bipartisan letter.
    The Chair. Without objection.
    [The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    Senator Peters. Thank you. So, Ms. Sohn, my question to you 
is, do you agree that it is important for Americans that we 
protect auto safety spectrum and deploy safety technologies 
like C-V2X on American roadways?
    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely, sir. Yes.
    Senator Peters. Thank you. Second, as you know, in 2020, 
Congress passed the Secure and Trusted Communications Act to 
ensure that American broadband networks were free from the 
influence of Chinese state connected companies like Huawei and 
ZTE.
    In that bill, Congress promised broadband providers that we 
would help them pay and, ``rip and replace,'' this equipment.
    So, my first question is to you, do you agree with the 
Secure and Trusted Communications Act that it is critical to 
our national security to eliminate Chinese state connected 
technologies from U.S. networks?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, sir. And I agree with former Commissioner 
O'Rielly that it is underfunded right now and needs more money.
    Senator Peters. Well, that leads the next question. 
Certainly, securing the networks is essential, and that is why 
I have been disappointed by Congress' failure to close the Rip 
and Replace funding shortfall that rural providers are facing 
as they try to remove Huawei and other equipment from their 
broadband networks.
    Ms. Sohn, the first time you were before this committee, we 
talked about the importance of supporting innovative broadband 
solutions like Northern Michigan University's Educational 
Access Network in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
    And now that very network and the communities that it 
serves are basically being hostage or being held hostage by a 
$27 million funding shortfall to carry out this Rip and Replace 
mandate.
    As Michigan's representative here in Congress and in the 
Senate, I am committed to getting this funding, of course, 
across the finish line. But my question for you, as an FCC 
Commissioner, would you commit to working with the Hill and 
rural broadband providers to ensure that they are supported 
throughout this critical process to secure our networks?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, sir. And in fact, I just met with a bunch of 
members of the Rural Wireless Association who talk to me about 
their concerns of invoices not getting paid for Rip and 
Replace, so I have a great relationship with those broadband 
providers. And yes, I absolutely will work with them.
    Senator Peters. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Fischer. And I apologize, she 
should have been next before, so thank you for your indulgence. 
Appreciate it.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Madam Chair. This is now the 
third time that Ms. Sohn has come before the Committee. She has 
given dismissive and evasive answers, and outright flipped on 
positions she had otherwise consistently taken throughout her 
career. I continue to have serious concerns about the nominee's 
record.
    She has troubling conflicts of interest which prompted her 
second appearance before the Committee last year. She was a 
leading board member of Locast, a company that pirated content 
from local broadcasters.
    A Federal court issued an injunction against her company 
from operating this illegal scheme. Ms. Sohn tried to do damage 
control in our hearings. She eventually promised to recuse 
herself from certain proceedings at the FCC, if confirmed. I 
believe this promise essentially admitted to conflicts of 
interests on matters such as retransmission consent and 
television copyrights, but her recusal was non-binding and 
vaguely construed.
    Her answers to hearing questions also showed no regret for 
her actions. She even downplayed the situation by emphasizing 
that Locast was just a nonprofit, framing the company as if it 
were a charity. It is not. The FCC is charged with protecting 
intellectual property rights.
    Copyright protections are the lifeblood of local 
broadcasters. But Ms. Sohn thinks she is some kind of copyright 
Robin Hood. She told this very committee that she thought she 
was helping broadcasters while she was, in fact, stealing their 
content. It is incredible. Locast wasn't the first copyright 
controversy centered around Ms. Sohn.
    She also championed the FCC's failed Set-Top Box order 
while she was a senior adviser at the Commission. That order 
received major blowback for the lack of transparency around its 
drafting and circulation as well. I previously questioned Ms. 
Sohn about transparency concerns, such as why she bragged on a 
public panel about concealing another controversial order as a 
senior FCC adviser.
    Then there was the Inspector General report, which I would 
say found that she did leak confidential documents to the press 
while employed at the FCC. Her actions purposely derailed a 
bipartisan agreement to reform the Lifeline Program.
    I am certain we will only see more of this partisan 
deceptive conduct if the Senate moves this nomination forward. 
The FCC's mission rests on advancing communications in ways 
that serve the public interest. I am afraid Ms. Sohn and I have 
very different outlooks about what is in the public interest.
    I cannot support a nominee who would put rural broadband 
access on the back burner. I cannot support a nominee who has 
willfully jeopardized local broadcast stations. I cannot 
support a nominee who would oversee public safety 
communications but has amplified rhetoric to defund the police.
    And I cannot support a nominee who has a record of acting 
unethically while working at the very agency to which she is 
nominated. I voted for Democratic FCC nominees in the past, 
including Chairman Rosenworcel and Chairman Stark--and 
Commissioner Starks. I do not agree with all of their 
positions, but they were qualified and they were not driven by 
bias.
    This nomination has turned into a spectacle because of the 
nominee's own record and actions. I will not support a partisan 
nominee and I urge the Administration to withdraw the 
nomination.
    At the previous two hearings, I have asked the nominee 
questions and I have no additional questions at this time. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Senator. Next, I will recognize 
myself for 5 minutes. Ms. Sohn, did you have something you 
wanted to respond to?
    Ms. Sohn. Well, it might take up the full 5 minutes. I 
would like an opportunity to respond to Senator Fischer.
    Senator Fischer. I ask no questions, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Senator. Ms. Sohn, opponents to 
your nomination continue to classify your support of net 
neutrality as, ``extreme.'' Ms. Sohn, do majority of Republican 
and Democratic voters support net neutrality?
    Ms. Sohn. By overwhelming margins.
    Senator Lujan. So, a majority of Americans, Democratic 
voters, Republican voters, Independents, believe net neutrality 
is needed. Now, to me, that is the opposite of extreme. We 
should ensure Internet providers are common carriers and 
prohibited from prioritizing or discriminating lawful content 
on their networks.
    Now, Ms. Sohn, you have a strong record of defending free 
speech and viewpoints from across the aisle. At the FCC, and as 
a public interest advocate for decades, you have continuously 
fought for the rights of both conservative and liberal voices.
    Yes or no, do you commit to upholding and promoting the 
free speech rights of all Americans?
    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely.
    Senator Lujan. Can you reiterate for this committee some of 
the endorsements you have received from organizations across 
the spectrum?
    Ms. Sohn. Sure. Organizations include Newsmax, the 
President of OAN. These are two of the most conservative cable 
networks on the planet, and I have received some blowback on 
the left from that.
    Parents Television Council, which is a very conservative 
organization that fights to keep obscenity and indecency off 
broadcasting. I have support from Preston Padden, as we talked 
before, who is a former Fox News lobbyist.
    Chad Rupe, Hilda Legg. Daniel Linville of West Virginia, 
who is as conservative as you can get. He is a West Virginia 
Legislator.
    Senator Lujan. Ms. Sohn, I am going to interject. I didn't 
realize the list was so long.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Sohn. It is longer.
    Senator Lujan. What I will ask is that you submit them into 
the record so that we have them for the record as well.
    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely.
    Senator Lujan. Now, Ms. Sohn, we have gone over 2 years 
without a full Commission at the FCC. The cost to the American 
public for this vacancy has been extreme. The FCC is charged 
with overseeing some of the most critical sectors of the 
American economy, media and communications.
    These are massive industries that are also on the verge of 
receiving a historic amount of public funding from the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The FCC is the lawful 
regulator and enforcement agency for the Federal Government's 
effort to fight against robocalls and to ensure consumers have 
a voice on their side when they have an issue with their cable, 
cell, or broadband provider.
    Every second we wait, to me, the worse it gets. Can you 
please discuss the cost this long-term vacancy has had on 
American consumers?
    Ms. Sohn. Senator Lujan, you actually mentioned some of 
them early on in your opening statement. One that really comes 
to mind is the fact that a $200 million penalty against some 
wireless carriers who sold personal information to data brokers 
who then sold them to bounty hunters, and those bounty hunters 
find people that don't want to be found, including domestic 
violence victims.
    They cannot vote that out because they don't have a third 
vote. I mean, this is, you know, this is a no brainer. 
Similarly, now, there have been now at least three major 
reports about carriers who lied, flat out lied, and admitted 
finally that they lied about where they provide service.
    The FCC cannot do anything to try to deter that kind of 
conduct. The enforcement mechanism of the FCC when it comes to 
things like that really is almost shut down. But some of the 
other things they can't do are extend E-Rate funding to 
classrooms, fix or do anything with regard to the media 
ownership rules, fix the Universal Service Fund, which is 
something that a lot of people on this dais want to happen.
    And of course, they can't reinstate the authority to 
oversee broadband and impose net neutrality rules.
    Senator Lujan. I appreciate that. And in my opening, I 
failed to ask for unanimous consent to offer a sixth letter 
into the record, the Smear Campaign Against FCC Nominee Gigi 
Sohn, written by Preston Padden, who is the former President of 
ABC Television Network and a founding executive of Fox 
Broadcasting title.
    So, I would ask unanimous consent to offer this into the 
record. And if there is no objection, it is allowed.
    [The information referred to follows:]

    Senator Lujan. With that, I will call on our next Senator, 
Senator Vance.

                STATEMENT OF HON. J. D. VANCE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Vance. All right. Senator Lujan, thank you, Mr. 
Chairman. And, Ms. Sohn, thank you for coming before us today. 
So, I want to take my line of questioning a slightly different 
direction from some of the other folks.
    And I think just to be directly, Ms. Sohn, there are 
actually areas of substantive agreement between the two of us 
on some of these issues. But I also notice that you are a 
participant in what I would call this weird racialization of 
American political rhetoric in the last few years.
    And in particular, I think coming out of a desire to give 
equal opportunity and fairness to every American, regardless of 
skin color, that is, of course, a very good thing, there has 
been this weird trend in certain corners of American politics 
to be very, very racialized and even to criticize explicit 
racial groups almost as a pejorative.
    And you, unfortunately, have participated in that. And I 
want to ask just a couple of questions on that. Before I do, I 
want to illustrate this by pointing out something that is going 
on in my state.
    We have a very, very bad train crash in East Palestine, 
Ohio. It has caused a terrible chemical spill. Likely 
environmental consequences as far as the eye can see. And of 
course, we are doing as much as we can to help constituents on 
the ground.
    But I note that Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg 
yesterday when he made some public remarks, instead of 
commenting on this or talking about the issue or giving any 
reason to think that he is focused on one of the major 
transportation mishaps in this country over the last couple of 
years, he decided to instead focus on the terrible scourge of 
too many white men in the construction industry.
    And I find that preposterous, both on its own face, but 
also as a focus from the Secretary of Transportation. So, I 
want to read you a tweet with that backdrop in mind. And I 
quote, ``President Obama is a raggedy black supremacist 
President and his cowardly enablers would rather kill everybody 
than stop killing white people.''
    Do you think a person who said that should be appointed or 
confirmed to the FCC?
    Ms. Sohn. Could you re-read? I didn't quite get that. Could 
you just re-read that? Would you mind?
    Senator Vance. ``President Obama is a raggedy black 
supremacist President, and his cowardly enablers would rather 
kill everybody than stop killing white people.'' Do you think a 
person, yes or no, who says that should be appointed to the 
FCC?
    Ms. Sohn. I would need to know more of the context, 
honestly.
    Senator Vance. OK. Well, I think clearly a person who said 
that should not be appointed to the FCC. And in fact, you 
retweeted the exact same thing only with President Trump 
instead of President Obama and the races reversed.
    Let me read another tweet and let me ask you if this is an 
acceptable thing for an FCC Commissioner. ``Angry black woman, 
not a good look, Judge Brown Jackson.'' Would a person who 
tweeted that pejoratively be deserving of the position that you 
are seeking?
    Ms. Sohn. I think it has nothing to do with the position 
that they are seeking. So, not necessarily.
    Senator Vance. So, I think that is----
    Ms. Sohn. I know I tweeted something about Judge Kavanaugh, 
right.
    Senator Vance. I think that is preposterous. Come on. You 
tweeted at Judge Kavanaugh, ``angry white man, not a good look, 
Judge Kavanaugh.'' And I here is why I think that it is 
relevant.
    We live in a country that is very diverse, people come from 
very different backgrounds. And one of the things that 
preserves what little racial comity and harmony we have in this 
country is that our leaders don't use that racial comity and 
harmony like a toddler who discovered their daddy's gun.
    You talk about racial issues in a way that will inflame the 
very worst things in our country, and I fear that if you are 
given this position of authority, you will use that authority 
to continue to inflame and to continue potentially even to 
censor based on some of these ideas. Now, I have just 
illustrated a couple of ways that we talk about these issues or 
some of our leaders talk about these issues.
    I hope that I never do. And if I do, I hope my constituents 
will hold me to account for it. But one of the things that I 
fear here is that you are being appointed to a position with an 
incredible amount of control over the way that we communicate 
with each other, the way that we debate with each other, the 
way that our politics actually manifests itself in the public 
debate.
    And I guess I would ask you, do you think those comments 
are a good thing for the American people to hear, given how 
much power you will have if you get confirmed?
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, I made those comments in my role as 
either a private citizen or a public advocate, and they will 
have absolutely no bearing on how I would act as an FCC 
Commissioner.
    Senator Vance. Ms. Sohn, I appreciate that, but they reveal 
something about how you see the world, how you think about the 
world, and how you feel about the world.
    So, I understand and respect that you made them in your 
capacity as a private citizen, but they are reflective of a 
person who will have a lot of power if the Senate confirms your 
nomination.
    And this is why I am going to oppose your nomination 
despite some areas of substantive agreement. Thank you, Ms. 
Sohn.
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, if I could just say, I can't just walk 
into the FCC and say, OK, Gigi Sohn wants all these things to 
happen and they will happen.
    First of all, I am not going to be the Chair and let's put 
that one on the table and put that to bed because that is the 
latest K Street rumor, right, that the White House wants to 
make me the Chair. That is false. As FCC Commissioner, you have 
to follow the law. You have to follow the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
    There is a procedure before you. You have to follow the 
record. You have to meet with stakeholders. You can't just 
willy nilly make a decision based on what your predilections 
are. And if I were to do that, well, first of all, I would have 
to get two other votes, which would be unlikely.
    But if that were to happen, a court could reverse it 
because you have to follow process. And I think it is really 
important for people who think that I am some sort of Svengali 
who could just walk into the FCC and make it bend to my will, 
that I can't do that under the law.
    Senator Vance. OK. Ms. Sohn, look, I appreciate that, and I 
appreciate that we have a Constitution, and we have certain 
procedures we have to follow. Of course, I am one of 100 
Senators and I can't walk into this body and make things 
exactly as I want them.
    The point is not that you will have complete power over the 
FCC. The point is that we live in a country that is undergoing 
a series of very toxic movements in the way that we talk about 
one another.
    And I think in particular, the racial dialog, the racial 
rhetoric that you have used is disqualifying, whether you have 
a lot of power or a little power. I don't think it is what we 
need in our public administrators. I yield the rest of my time. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Senator. Next, we will hear from 
Senator Rosen. Senator Rosen.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Well, thank you, Senator Lujan. Appreciate 
you recognizing me, and I really appreciate today's hearing. 
But before I begin my questions, I would like to echo concerns 
raised about the nominee's positions on matters of importance 
for law enforcement, both nationally and in Nevada.
    Law enforcement groups have expressed serious concerns 
about Ms. Sohn's membership on the board of a digital privacy 
organization that has strongly advocated against law 
enforcement access to digital evidence needed to hold criminals 
accountable and to protect the public.
    Also of concern to law enforcement are allegations that the 
nominee has expressed support for movements aligned with 
defunding the police, or at the very least, defunding police 
surveillance tools, again, needed to keep our communities safe.
    These are questions that have already been raised by other 
members of the Committee today, so I am not going to elaborate 
further, but I will note that such concerns by law enforcement 
do give me pause. I would like to use my time today to touch on 
an issue of critical importance to Nevadans, rural access to 
broadband.
    And so, we want to close that digital divide, particularly 
in our rural frontier communities. And Nevada's goal of 
bringing affordable, reliable broadband across the state by 
2029 is essential, absolutely essential to supporting our 
state's needs. As we saw during the pandemic, broadband is 
critical when connecting to school, to work, health care, to 
our friends, to our family.
    And now, more than ever, we must make sure that Americans 
have access to reliable and affordable broadband. That is why I 
am proud to have led many efforts on this subject, like my 
Middle Mile Broadband Deployment Act, which was included in the 
bipartisan infrastructure law and will help our communities get 
better connected.
    So, Ms. Sohn, as you know, mountains, deserts, valleys, we 
have it all. We have challenging terrain in Nevada, and it 
often separates rural and tribal areas from other communities 
with more broadband access.
    So, if confirmed, how will you address these challenges to 
close the digital divide by bringing high quality and 
affordable broadband to all Americans no matter where they 
live, even in these remote rural communities?
    Ms. Sohn. Thank you, Senator Rosen. And I hope you will 
give me an opportunity to address the law enforcement issue, 
because I think it is critically important and I think my 
positions have been grossly misstated.
    And my position on the EFF board also grossly misstated. 
So, I hope you will give me that opportunity with a meeting 
this hearing to talk about that, because it is really important 
that we get the record straight.
    But let me address your main question, because as you may 
know, I have had several conversations with Brian Mitchell, who 
is the head of the broadband office in Nevada, and we have 
talked at length about the concerns that Brian has in 
particular and the state has with the maps.
    I have seen your letter with Senator Cortez Masto 
expressing concern about the maps. And I really, really would 
love the opportunity to be at the FCC to try to make that map 
as good as possible before NTIA has to allocate its money on 
June 30.
    So, to me, there's nothing more important right now than 
getting that money spent wisely and getting those maps right.
    Senator Rosen. Well, thank you. We really appreciate that. 
I am just going to, really quickly, I just have a minute left 
and I know we are in the middle of a vote, but I just want to 
talk about connecting small businesses because 99 percent of 
businesses in Nevada are small businesses, and we are on the 
forefront of emerging technologies, electric vehicles, 
blockchain, autonomous vehicles, lithium batteries.
    We are just doing it all. And as these enterprises continue 
to make significant investments in my state, we need to be sure 
that small businesses have the support of these innovative 
companies, the suppliers, contractors, the vendors, all the 
way, that they have the digital tools and the broadband access 
they need.
    And so I know I just have a few seconds left, so I just 
want to say how--you said you are speaking with Nevada and 
others, how should the FCC work with Federal agencies, 
including our economic development agency and our Small 
Business Administration, to be sure that small businesses like 
those up and down my state are participating in the Internet 
connected economy and have good access?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes. I think it is critical that the FCC work 
with any and all agencies, coordinate with those agencies, 
whether it be the Department of Agriculture, the Small Business 
Administration, or the Department of Commerce.
    Those relationships are critically important to make sure 
that everybody gets connected, and to make sure that we are not 
duplicating efforts. I think that is also very important. There 
is concern, frankly, from a lot of Republicans and 
conservatives about the fact that there are so many different 
agencies that have some sort of stake in broadband that we may 
be duplicating efforts.
    And I think it is incumbent on the leadership of those 
agencies to get together quite often to make sure that that is 
not happening.
    Senator Rosen. Well, thank you. I look forward to seeing 
streamlining in so many of our agencies to get the job done for 
our constituents. I see my time is up. Thank you.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Senator Rosen. Senator Blackburn.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Sohn, thank 
you for your time yesterday, and thank you for being with us 
again. A couple of things I want to discuss that I didn't get 
to yesterday. In your past careers, you have made it your job 
to go after certain companies in the telecom industry, and you 
have particularly been harsh with Internet service providers.
    And in 2019, you tweeted, and I am quoting the tweet, ``big 
tech companies are under enormous scrutiny while big telecom 
and cable deregulated and consolidated. What is missing is the 
enormous amount of money big telecom and cable are spending to 
ensure that the focus stays on tech and not them.''
    Even in your testimony that you submitted to us, you 
suggest that regulated entities are the ones making false and 
misleading attacks, and I am quoting you there, on your record 
because they fear you, your choice of terms.
    So how can we believe you will be impartial if an issue 
involving any of these companies comes before you as a 
Commissioner?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, first, I would say that every single 
industry player who I have criticized, I have also worked with. 
And not long before I got nominated, I worked closely with 
Verizon and Comcast and AT&T to get the emergency broadband 
benefit, to get a letter together to support the emergency 
broadband benefit.
    So, I have worked with these companies. And as I said to 
Senator Vance, a proceeding at the FCC is constrained. You have 
to follow the record, decide based on the record, using the 
procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act----
    Senator Blackburn. Yes. Let me ask you about that and where 
you are going with that response. And I saw your response to 
Senator Vance.
    So, if you are leaning into this component, that your 
background, as you say in your testimony, your background as an 
advocate, your choice of words there, and you suggest that that 
is what makes you a good Commissioner. That is going to help 
make you a good Commissioner.
    If being an advocate is what positions you to do this job, 
then why should we think you would act differently in this job 
when you were a Commissioner?
    Ms. Sohn. I know that the role of a policymaker is 
different than the role of an advocate. And just let me also 
say, I really only asked to be treated like other nominees for 
the FCC.
    We have had nominees for the FCC, including my former boss, 
who worked for two industries. And he was a very, very fervent 
advocate for his industries. Chairman Pai worked for Verizon, 
and I am sure he was a very fervent advocate for Verizon.
    So, I am going to just ask to be treated the same way, 
Senator.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. Let's look at it a different way. 
You were named a top lobbyist by the Hill in 2012 and 2013. So, 
do you consider yourself a lobbyist or do you consider yourself 
an advocate?
    Ms. Sohn. I haven't been registered as a lobbyist for 
years, and that just--if I was registered as a lobbyist, it was 
very briefly. But when I ran Public Knowledge, I stopped going 
to the Hill, so it didn't make any sense.
    And that Hill lobbyists, best lobbyists doesn't mean that 
you are registered as a lobbyist, it just means you are a good 
advocate. So, I was very proud of that distinction.
    Senator Blackburn. OK. All right. I checked on the number 
of filings that you signed your name to at the FCC. And filings 
and proceedings, it was nearly 150 that you had signed your 
name to. You said you will voluntarily recuse yourself from 
some broadcast issues if confirmed.
    However, you also participated in proceedings on many other 
topics, ranging from net neutrality to universal service and 
intra-carrier compensation.
    Once again, as we look at this, whether the work is as an 
advocate or a lobbyist, or a term you have discounted, 
activist, should you be recusing yourself from all of this 
variety of issues that are going to come about, issues you have 
previously signed your name to filings and proceedings.
    Would you be recusing yourself from all of those?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, Senator. I addressed this quite at length in 
the February 9th hearing, and I will just repeat myself. My 
voluntary recusal was an attempt to address the concerns, and 
we heard them again today, that people had over my 
participation on the Sports Fan Coalition New York Board, which 
ran Locast.
    So, I voluntarily recused myself at the nexus of the work I 
had done previously at the FCC--not at the FCC, as an advocate 
working at the FCC, and the Locast board. So that is why I 
voluntarily recused, to address those specific concerns.
    What you are asking for is not tethered to anything other 
than just every single issue out there. And again, I just want 
to be treated the same----
    Senator Blackburn. No, I would disagree with that. These 
are tethered to statements you have agreed with and filings 
that you have signed your name to. So, it is relevant. I see my 
time is over, but this does have an impact. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you. Senator Baldwin.

               STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN

    Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for 
appearing again in front of the Commerce Committee. Your 
perseverance is admirable, and particularly in light of the 
attacks that have been made against your character. It was 
clear after your first hearing that you are qualified to serve 
as a Commissioner of the FCC.
    It was also clear after your second hearing that you are 
well qualified to serve as Commissioner of the FCC, and I am 
every bit as confident that it will be as clear by the end of 
the day today, at your third hearing, that you are qualified 
and ready to serve for the FCC.
    People across my state look forward to your confirmation 
and to the FCC having a full complement of Commissioners to 
tackle truly important issues, including rural broadband 
deployment, support for local news and television, and 
advancing digital equity.
    Last time you appeared before this committee, I noted the 
historic nature of your nomination and how important it was for 
the country to see LGBTQ people, whether they are Senators or 
soon to be FCC Commissioners, in prominent roles while being 
their true selves.
    Like I said, then, being first is not always easy, but 
millions of people across the country, including myself, are 
grateful for you continuing to pave the way for LGBTQ people 
who want to serve their country.
    Ms. Sohn. Thank you.
    Senator Baldwin. I want to turn to a couple of questions 
here on specific matters. I was honored to lead the National 
Suicide--the bipartisan National Suicide Hotline Designation 
Act, which transitioned the National Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline into an easy to remember three-digit code, 9-8-8, to 
better serve people in crisis situations.
    I was disturbed to learn recently that there was a nearly 
daylong outage of the 9-8-8 hotline back in December and that 
it was a result of a cyberattack.
    While FCC has since proposed regulations to bring 9-8-8 
outage reporting requirements in line with 9-1-1 outage 
reporting requirements, I am concerned that the 9-8-8 lifeline 
remains vulnerable to cyber-attacks or will, which would 
prevent people in crisis from getting the help they need.
    What more can the FCC or Congress do to improve the 
resiliency of 9-8-8 and 9-1-1 services?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, thank you, Senator. I have always thought 
that the FCC should play a larger role in ensuring that our 
networks are secure and resilient. The Chairwoman has done some 
good work with regard to mobile networks, but I think we need 
to do more, and I think the FCC needs to have a more active 
role, and if Congress would like to give it a more active role, 
that would be great, to oversee the cybersecurity practices of 
ISPs.
    Senator Baldwin. OK. I believe that there's tremendous 
value in consumers having access to relevant local news and 
programing. In a world in which we can increasingly seek out 
our sources that simply tell us what we want to hear, local 
media can provide timely, trustworthy information that helps 
Wisconsinites and others connect with their communities and 
neighbors.
    That is why Senator Markey and I last week introduced or 
reintroduced the Protecting Community Television Act to support 
funding for public education and Government or PEG channels.
    Thousands of Wisconsinites rely on these channels to get 
news and other programing rooted in their own communities, and 
in-kind contributions play an important role in those services.
    Ms. Sohn, from your experience as a consumer advocate, do 
you agree that local media is important, including for 
improving our national discourse? And if confirmed to the 
Commission, what could the FCC do to better support these PEG 
channels?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, that is a great question. Look, I believe 
that local media, whether it be broadcasting or PEG channels, 
are really sort of the bulwark against some of the partisanship 
that we have been talking about today.
    And I will even admit that some of my tweets have been 
sharp and I have admitted before. You know, this country has 
changed a lot since 2016, let's just face it. I did not like 
the FCC's decision to include in-kind contributions as part of 
the 5 percent of the cable fee, and I would support it if the 
Chairwoman were to start a proceeding to reverse that.
    If the record showed that that was a thing to do, my 
inclination would be to, you know, to reverse that decision, 
because I think it is important--it is amazing how many people 
watch PEG. You don't think it, right.
    You see it and you see these basic, you know, these very 
basic channels with basic entertainment but people watch it, so 
it is critically important because people do want to know what 
is going on in their community. And I think the FCC is tasked 
by law to promote that.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Budd.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED BUDD, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Budd. I thank the Chair. Ms. Sohn, welcome back to 
the Committee. Good to see you. Enjoyed our conversation last 
week. So, my constituents in North Carolina, they support law 
enforcement and they want safer communities. Many live, work, 
and raise their families in those rural communities.
    Bridging the digital divide and getting access to every 
American has long been a bipartisan interest and an important 
job for the FCC. In written congressional testimony, you claim 
that ``policymakers have focused disproportionately on 
broadband deployment in rural areas.''
    Residents of North Carolina know that improving Internet 
access in rural areas keeps these smaller communities thriving. 
We need an FCC that is focused on bridging the digital divide 
in North Carolina and prioritizing the economic and educational 
benefits of better broadband.
    It is also concerning that law enforcement groups like the 
National Sheriffs Association and the Fraternal Order of Police 
oppose your nomination. You are listed as a board member of the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation, EFF.
    And since your nomination, you have tried to minimize the 
significance of your board seat, but being a board member is no 
small thing. EFF has called you a close collaborator for nearly 
20 years. You have donated to them and made public calls for 
others to donate to EFF.
    In a letter to this committee, the Fraternal Order of 
Police stated that you have an anti-police bias and refused to 
disavow many extreme positions from EFF.
    In the summer of 2020 as rioters burned businesses across 
the country, EFF encouraged folks to go to the streets, even 
publishing a memo on how to thwart law enforcement 
investigations, suggesting people buy a pre-paid disposable 
phone and dress for anonymity.
    Chair, I would like to submit this to the record.
    The Chair. Without objection.
    [The information referred to follows:]

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    

    Senator Budd. Thank you. Now, the FCC and law enforcement, 
they work together a lot, as we know. And as you know, the FCC 
makes sure that law enforcement alerts are delivered over 
communications networks and that those networks can comply with 
court orders to aid in law enforcement investigations.
    Your deep association with anti-law enforcement views of 
the EFF leads me to believe that your confirmation would, as 
the Fraternal Order of Police wrote, ``show a complete 
disregard for the hardworking men and women of law 
enforcement.'' Ms. Sohn, you have taken to social media to 
express your anti-police bias.
    For example, you have retweeted and liked statements 
supporting defund the police. You have also retweeted a 
statement referring to Federal law enforcement officers 
responding to riots in 2020 as, ``armed goons in riot gear with 
tear gas,'' as Senator Cruz mentioned in his opening remarks.
    Ms. Sohn, given your demonstrated anti-police bias, do you 
understand why law enforcement officers don't trust you to look 
out for their best interests, especially if you helped lead an 
agency that is a critical partner of law enforcement, yes or 
no? Just simply, simply yes or no, please.
    Ms. Sohn. Could you repeat the question, because I kind of 
lost----
    Senator Budd. Yes. The question is really based on your 
understanding of why law enforcement is concerned. I mean, do 
you understand why law enforcement has concern, yes or no?
    Ms. Sohn. No, I don't.
    Senator Budd. You actually don't. OK, so that is actually 
telling----
    Ms. Sohn. I am very surprised.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. I do want to reclaim my time here. 
So, I mean, it is obvious why they would be concerned with 
these tweets and retweets and the things that you would 
support.
    But, Ms. Sohn, the EFF published a guide called, Attending 
a Protest, that tells people to wear a mask, it will protect 
you from being identified in photos of the protest. Ms. Sohn, 
does encouraging folks to hide their identity during violent 
situations make law enforcement's job easier, yes or no, 
simply.
    Ms. Sohn. I don't consider protest necessarily violent, 
sir. Look, I don't make policy on EFF board.
    Senator Budd. Well during violent situations as we saw in 
2020, do you understand why law enforcement would have a 
concern with you suggesting that people enhance their 
anonymity, yes or no?
    Ms. Sohn. I understand why people might not want to be 
seen. I understand that. But I had nothing to do with----
    Senator Budd. So, I was hoping for a yes or no, that you 
could actually understand law enforcement's concern.
    Ms. Sohn. I understand. I absolutely understand.
    Senator Budd. Do understand law enforcement's concern?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes.
    Senator Budd. Thank you. Ms. Sohn, you know, we can learn a 
lot by who a person associates with, and you have been 
associated with a lot of radical partisans. You are an EFF 
board member and have received support from a group, 18 Million 
Rising, which has said, ``policing has never been an effective 
response to violence because police are agents of white 
supremacy.''
    The FCC needs impartial leadership, and unfortunately, I 
don't believe that you offer that. I fear that your 
confirmation would make it harder for law enforcement to 
protect North Carolinians and make it harder for my State's 
many rural communities to get desperately needed broadband.
    I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
oppose your nomination. And again, thank you for being here. I 
yield back.
    Ms. Sohn. Can I respond to that?
    The Chair. Yes, go ahead, quickly.
    Ms. Sohn. Just a couple of things. First of all, my tweets 
and retweets are about as banal and basic as you can imagine. 
Police brutality is bad. Militarization of police--again, this 
is not me speaking who just likes and retweets.
    That Alexandria Ocasio tweet or retweet that I did was 
because she was explaining what she meant by defund the police. 
I actually personally feel that the defund the police term is 
stupid and it has been counterproductive. That is the only 
reason I retweeted that. I do not support defunding the police.
    Senator Budd. Madam Chair, just to be clear, I did yield 
back my time. Thank you.
    The Chair. I thank the Senator. Go ahead.
    Ms. Sohn. OK, thank you. Let me just say first that I am--I 
have always respected and worked with law enforcement ever 
since I was in law school. In fact, I just did a walk through 
in my neighborhood 2 weeks ago with the police, so I am really 
baffled by this opposition.
    It is--the Fraternal Order of Police's biggest concern is 
EFF's encryption position, which, by the way, the FCC has no 
jurisdiction over and I have not spoken about it. I mean, it is 
similar with the FOSTA-SESTA.
    I have not spoken about these things. These are not--I care 
about FCC stuff, and this is not FCC stuff.
    The Chair. Senator Welch.
    Ms. Sohn. I think it is a bit overwrought, to be honest 
with you.
    The Chair. Senator Welch.

                STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT

    Senator Welch. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have two real 
concerns. One is that we get rural broadband broadly and 
effectively deployed. Number two, that we have an effective 
functioning FCC. And that requires, number one, that we do have 
some bipartisanship on this committee.
    Every one of us represents rural areas. My Republican 
colleagues in many cases have more rural areas than we do. 
Mapping is critical to that, and our understanding in Vermont 
is that the mapping is overstating the coverage. That has been 
the case for some time. We have been asking that there not be a 
distribution of money until we have confidence that the mapping 
is solid.
    What say you about the mapping and what you will do to make 
certain that before we act on the deployment, we have accurate 
maps to guarantee that folks in rural areas, the last barn on 
the dirt road in Vermont has access to high-speed internet?
    Ms. Sohn. So, Senator, two things. You probably know that I 
recently spoke with Christine Hallquist, who is the head of the 
broadband office in Vermont. And my wife and I have a very 
close relationship with Vermont, having had our civil union 
there.
    So, we love the state. And yes, I agree with you 100 
percent. It is critical to get those maps as accurate as 
possible by June 30. And I would dedicate myself to doing it, 
if I could get confirmed.
    Senator Welch. Well, if we don't have accurate maps, we 
have got to wait until we do get them.
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, so----
    Senator Welch. And there is a tension between getting the 
money out the door and getting it out the door in a way that is 
going to be effectively utilized, right?
    Ms. Sohn.--without a doubt. There is a huge tension. And I 
understand why the Commerce Department wants to get the money 
out. I don't think they are going to change. So that is why I 
think it is important to get somebody in there now who is going 
to work their tail off to try to get those maps as accurate as 
possible.
    Senator Welch. Right. Let me let go on to another question. 
You know, Senator Thune brought up, I think, a very fair 
concern, and that is, will the Commission work with the 
Congress to do things where there is a bipartisan path forward? 
And my understanding of the distinction between what you said 
and what he was concerned about as a leak versus you were 
authorized.
    So, I am going to take you that that is what you were 
doing, something you thought was fully authorized. But in the 
spirit of what Senator Thune was asking, can you pledge as a 
Commissioner that you will do your level best to work with 
Congress in an effort to get to the bipartisan approach that we 
need in order to get rural broadband in all of our communities?
    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely. And I did play, as a public advocate, 
I played a very large role in working both with Republicans and 
Democrats to get that bill passed.
    Senator Welch. Right. And the third is a point I want to 
make.
    Madam Chair, there is a real dilemma for rural America, and 
the dilemma is that the big cable companies and the big telecom 
companies have a business model that is very much oriented 
toward making money, which is easier to do in the dense urban 
populations and they are leaving us in the rural areas behind.
    And that is true whether you are Senator Schmitt in 
Missouri or you are in rural Northeast Kingdom, Vermont. And we 
have in Vermont community union districts, and those have been 
empowered with local authority to make decisions where they are 
on the hook to make certain that that farmer at the end of the 
dirt road has high speed Internet.
    That is the objective, not maximizing the profit. Is that a 
model that you see as being helpful to guarantee that rural 
folks without much economic clout are going to get what they 
absolutely need?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, I love that model. And in fact, the 
infrastructure law requires the states to confer with local 
communities. And if they are not doing that, that is something 
that NTIA needs to look and make sure that is happening.
    So, the local communities are on the front lines of knowing 
who has broadband and what they need, what the community needs, 
so they must work with the State level folks who are getting at 
the money.
    Senator Welch. Well, I mean--and I am having more 
confidence in Vermont that if we do this right, the money 
actually is going to make a difference for those folks in rural 
America. And I don't think we did the job we needed to do in 
the past round of funding. So, I wish you luck. Thank you for 
being here, and I yield back.
    Ms. Sohn. You have great leadership in Vermont, so I agree 
with you. I think you will get good carve in there.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Schmitt.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC SCHMITT, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI

    Senator Schmitt. Thank you, and welcome back I suppose. It 
is my first time with you, but I did want to touch on a couple 
of issues maybe that have not been addressed yet. The FCC, as 
you know, has an important role in the lives of Americans. It 
has--it is an independent agency, of course, with the stated 
mission of overseeing and improving our communications system.
    But beyond those stated goals, the FCC also plays an 
important role in safeguarding some of our most important and 
fundamental rights. The FCC ensures that our Nation maintains 
the principles of freedom of speech and freedom of expression.
    The First Amendment, I really believe, is our pressure 
release valve as a country to speak your mind. And the FCC is 
crucial in ensuring Americans can express themselves, agree, 
disagree, and ensure dissent is protected.
    In carrying out the agency's duties, the FCC ensures that 
we are able to connect with friends and family, but also 
exercise our fundamental rights of freedom of speech and hear 
differing viewpoints.
    An FCC Commissioner must commit himself or herself to these 
noble goals, and Commissioners should work with Congress to 
protect Missourians and every American's right to freedom of 
speech.
    Our republic simply cannot endure if we decide that only 
certain individuals or certain viewpoints can be heard, 
silenced, or censored. Yet, in direct contrast to these 
principles and freedoms of this country was founded upon, some 
of the largest companies in the history of the world, these big 
tech monopolies have worked recently to silence or censor 
viewpoints, specifically conservative ones.
    The examples since you last testified in front of this 
committee are numerous. For example, Google censored Republican 
fundraising efforts in e-mail platforms. Google owned YouTube 
removed videos created by the Conservative Political Action 
Conference. Google altered search engine results related to an 
interview on the Joe Rogan Podcast.
    In my previous job as AG, we filed a landmark lawsuit that 
exposed a lot of this. That has been amplified by the Twitter 
files and the subject of a lot of the hearings that are 
happening over the House. What deeply concerns me is that you 
have spent the last two decades of your life pushing an agenda 
on behalf of these same big tech companies.
    The ties between you and these big tech companies are 
clear, numerous, and quite frankly, disturbing. Public 
Knowledge, the nonprofit that you founded in 2001 and served as 
its President, received $100,000 from Google, over $50,000 from 
Amazon, over $50,000 from Facebook, as well as hundreds of 
thousands of dollars from third party groups connected to these 
big tech companies.
    According to public disclosures, the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation, a foundation where you serve as a board member, was 
one of the groups that received, and I quote, ``the most 
substantial contributions from Google's U.S. Government Affairs 
and Public Policy team.'' Your ties to Google were so tight 
that already back in 2007, Politico noted that you worked 
closely with Google on several policy issues.
    According to Mana, a national Latina organization as a 
senior adviser to the FCC several years ago, you championed a 
proposal to let Google and other tech monopolies pillage 
minority programmers television's content without paying for 
it. In 2020, you criticized my colleague, Senator Cornyn, and 
continued to push the big tech agenda by defending Section 230 
liability protections for those companies.
    So, my first question simply is, do you honestly expect the 
members of this committee or the American public to believe 
that you can be neutral with this long history and conflict of 
interest?
    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely. And let me say first to Senator, nice 
to meet you as well, that the FCC does not have jurisdiction 
over Google. I had to provide every single radio, television, 
and news article that I was quoted in for the last 10 years.
    You will see, particularly the last 5 years, I have been as 
critical of big tech companies as you have. So, my relationship 
with them back in the day when they were smaller, when they 
promoted policies that Public Knowledge agreed with, yes, we 
were on the same side. And talking about the money, we got 
money from everybody.
    I asked money from every company. We would get money from 
Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, DirectTV. So, we are not partisan when 
it came to money.
    Senator Schmitt. Let me ask you, because you have mentioned 
that some of these claims are phony, and we will get to some of 
that and I may have to come back, but do you believe so-called 
disinformation should be censored?
    Ms. Sohn. I don't think the FCC should have any role in 
that, no.
    Senator Schmitt. But largely speak--I mean, in this 
Government, there has been a ministry of truth propped up, 
right? A disinformation----
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, I actually have a difference of opinion 
than some of my colleagues about disinformation. And certainly, 
Government should not censor it, no.
    Senator Schmitt. Well, let me just follow up briefly here. 
So, in 2020, you specifically said that ``conservative bias on 
Facebook and Twitter,'' those claims were ``phony.''
    In 2016, a whistleblower of Facebook exposed that the 
company would suppress news stories, including stories about 
Senator Romney, Senator Cruz, the Ranking Member of this 
Committee. Do you think that that claim is phony?
    Ms. Sohn. I am not saying that claim is phony, but what I 
was tweeting about was the fact that there was a guy who would 
every week list the top viewed things on Google or the top 
topics on Facebook and they were, 9 of the 10 of them were 
conservative.
    Senator Schmitt. OK well in 2021, YouTube suspended Senator 
Rand Paul after he pointed out that cloth masks were 
ineffective, relying on President Biden's own former COVID 
adviser. Is that claim phony?
    Ms. Sohn. Excuse me?
    Senator Schmitt. Is that claim phony, the fact that Senator 
Rand Paul was taken down because he claimed cloth masks were 
ineffective?
    Ms. Sohn. I don't think that is phony. But YouTube has a 
right under the First Amendment to do that if they want to.
    Senator Schmitt. OK, so here is where I want to get. Let me 
just wrap up----
    The. Chair. The Senator's time has expired and you are one 
minute over. And so, let's--we will, if you can stick around, 
you can come back, but we have two other members and we need to 
get to our lunch, so I am trying to be respectful. Senator 
Sinema.

               STATEMENT OF HON. KYRSTEN SINEMA, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA

    Senator Sinema. Thank you, Chair Cantwell. And thank you, 
Ms. Sohn, for returning to the Committee to answer more 
questions related to your nomination as FCC Commissioner. Last 
year, as the Committee considered your nomination, we discussed 
how your time on the Board of Directors of Locast could impact 
your work as an FCC Commissioner, if confirmed.
    Following that hearing, you filed a recusal agreement to 
the FCC Ethics Office to recuse yourself from matters involving 
retransmission consent or television broadcast copyright for 3 
years, and now you are recusing yourself for 4 years from the 
rules governing retransmission consent on any related FCC 
dockets.
    So, I have two questions, first, why did you recuse 
yourself when you testified to this committee last year that a 
recusal was unnecessary? And second, do you believe that your 
recusals from these matters and dockets will negatively impact 
the ability of the FCC to oversee these areas within its 
jurisdiction?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes. I recused myself, I voluntarily recused 
myself because there was such widespread concern--I think I 
counted eight people on the members of the Committee who are 
concerned about my membership of Locast and whether that would 
bias me or not. And I didn't believe I would be biased, but I 
thought just it would be the better part of caution for me to 
voluntarily recuse.
    And this is a narrow recusal, in my opinion. I narrowly 
recused from a number of issues that rarely come before the 
full Commission, and when they do, they are usually voted on in 
a 4-0 manner. So, my four-year recusal was for a docket that 
had not seen any action in almost a decade, 9 years, excuse me.
    So that is 10--I am losing the name of the docket. So, to 
me, it is important that I voluntarily recused, but I don't see 
it really detracting from my duties. The other recusal was for 
retransmission consent and broadcast copyright. Again, these 
are things that rarely come before the full Commission.
    And broadcast copyright never does, but retransmission 
consent does on occasions. And Senator Fischer actually pointed 
out that it has come before the Commission I guess 10 times and 
in 12 years, or 12 times in 10 years.
    But every single time it was a 4-0 decision. So, I don't 
think it is going to take me away from the work of the 
Commission.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. Ms. Sohn, a number of law 
enforcement organizations oppose your nomination to be a 
Commissioner. These organizations are taking these positions 
based on your social media engagement and concerns about your 
position with regard to access to digital evidence.
    So, what is your perspective regarding law enforcement's 
ability to access digital evidence with a valid warrant? And 
relatedly, what is your position on warrant proof encryption?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, these are issues that I really don't have 
positions on. The EFF has a position on them. I do think people 
should be able to encrypt their personal communications. But I 
think there has to be a balance.
    So, for example, under CALEA, the FCC is required and 
telecom companies are required to give law enforcement access. 
So, of course, law enforcement should have access with a 
warrant to lawful communications.
    So, I will be honest with you, Senator Sinema, this is one 
of the things that kind of baffles me because the FCC does not 
have jurisdiction over encryption issues. So, my personal 
opinion, which again, it is not a fully formed one because I am 
not an expert on it, I don't think it is really particularly 
relevant to this conversation because it is nothing I would 
ever deal with at the FCC.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. You know, just last month, the 
Tucson Unified School District was hacked by a criminal 
ransomware gang. It held their network hostage, causing 
disruptions in school operations for 2 weeks. The FBI and CISA 
have warned for years that schools are vulnerable to cyber-
attacks.
    Now, this is just the latest of a series in cyber-attacks 
on Arizona schools. In the Navajo Nation, a ransomware attack 
on the Window Rock Unified School District took their systems 
entirely offline, causing lengthy delays in payroll and other 
services.
    The FCC in September received a letter from the Arizona 
Department of Education urging them to allow schools to use E-
Rate funding for more advanced cybersecurity infrastructure and 
systems.
    The E-Rate program currently supports broadband and basic 
firewall systems, but it limits aid for advanced network 
protection. So do you support allowing schools to use their E-
Rate funds to purchase a broader range of cybersecurity tools 
such as advanced firewalls and other network security services?
    Ms. Sohn. I think that is something that the FCC should 
definitely look at. I have heard about this in Arizona and 
other states, and I think this is something where E-Rate 
funding, if we are talking about making sure that students, K 
through 12 students, have the best networks, the most secure 
networks, it seems to me logical, and again, the FCC would have 
to do a proceeding on this, to extend E-Rate funding to 
cybersecurity tools.
    Senator Sinema. Thanks. And you and I have discussed net 
neutrality a few times, but I wanted to follow up on those 
conversations. As you know, there have been decades of partisan 
disagreement about net neutrality, and the FCC changes the 
rules every Administration, which leads to litigation.
    I think the only way for us to fix it is for Congress to 
pass a bipartisan bill that provides these protections while 
ensuring opportunity for innovation. Has your position 
regarding net neutrality changed since we last spoke, and do 
you still support using Title II of the Telecommunications Act 
to pursue net neutrality?
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, my position hasn't changed to the extent 
that I don't like the ping pong game any more than you do, and 
I would love to see Congress pass a law. However, if Congress 
doesn't do so, it is critically important that the FCC have 
oversight over broadband.
    And right now, you know, for good or for ill, that 
authority is Title II with a lot of forbearance. So, in 2015, 
when I was at the FCC, we forbore from 90 percent of Title II, 
I think unfortunately is the only answer.
    But I would welcome the opportunity to work with Congress 
to craft a bill that gives the FCC some authority over 
broadband oversight and deals with net neutrality.
    The Chair. Senator Young. Thank you.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. TODD YOUNG, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA

    Senator Young. Hello, Ms. Sohn. Welcome to the Committee. I 
have to say, in preparing for this hearing and watching your 
exchange with some of my colleagues, before I have to say, I 
have been reminded of a number of concerns that I have about 
your nomination. You are, of course, entitled to free speech. 
You are not entitled to a Senate confirmation. I know you 
understand that.
    Last time you came before this committee, we discussed your 
voluntary recusal from retransmission consent issues and what 
so many have been calling the disown rule for recusal, how it 
is going to be defined moving forward. Based on a number of the 
issues that were raised here today, and some in previous 
hearings, it seems that this rule, so to speak, may come into 
play for many other topics.
    The FCC is a public interest regulator, and the American 
people, of course, deserve a full time Commissioner that won't 
be forced to recuse him or herself from relevant issues. And on 
top of that, if you don't recuse yourself from a number of 
different issues, it has become clear that the American people 
can't necessarily trust that you will make objective decisions 
in furtherance of the public interests.
    We need a fair and impartial regulator at this powerful 
Federal agency. A former Democratic colleague of ours has 
called for a new nominee due to your, ``extremist tactics.'' 
The Progressive Policy Institute opposes your nomination.
    This is not a GOP or conservative front group. They have 
cited your, ``pattern of illiberal intolerance for voices on 
the left,'' voices on the left, ``who dissent from your hard 
left orthodoxies.'' Frank Washington, he is a veteran of the 
Carter Administration, and he wrote, and of the FCC, and he 
wrote an Op-ed opposing your nomination and detailing what I 
will say is a cozy relationship with big tech.
    In that Op-ed, he went on to write, ``what is most 
troubling is the patronizing mindset she has displayed toward 
minority communities, an all too familiar strain of 
progressivism that invokes our cause and showcases our voices 
when convenient, but then belittles us if we challenge their 
central planning orthodoxies.''
    Additionally, you have accused Members of Congress of being 
bought and paid for and yet you have apparently made a host of 
generous political donations to United States Senators while 
your nomination was pending before this very committee.
    Finally, I am most concerned with the letters that we have 
received from numerous law enforcement organizations, and this 
has been mentioned before, the Fraternal Order of Police, 
National Sheriffs Association, the National Association of 
Police Organizations. These letters highlight concerns about 
your liking and retweeting of posts on social media about 
defunding the police.
    The National Sheriffs Association states, ``law enforcement 
officers across the country risk their lives every day to 
protect and serve our communities. They deserve the support of 
senior officials in the Federal Government who help to set 
policy. Unfortunately, Ms. Sohn has failed to provide such 
support by using social media to promote alarming statements 
that denigrate law enforcement.''
    The FOP states that your public record is disqualifying to 
become a member of the FCC, and their letter further highlights 
that a vote to favorably report Ms. Sohn's nomination would 
show a complete disregard for the hardworking men and women of 
law enforcement who are simply trying to do their jobs and 
protect the public.
    As I said before, we need a fair and impartial regulator at 
the FCC and the litany of concerns raised by a variety of 
stakeholders give me great hesitation as to whether you will be 
able to serve in that capacity.
    Can you please, and I am going to give you an opportunity 
to respond, can you please address the concerns raised by left 
leaning stakeholders, for example, that you are intolerant to 
views that are not far enough left for you?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes, that is--I have never heard that before, 
actually. And actually, I have a reputation of bringing people 
of all different ideologies together. I just think that is 
false. Let me talk about the allegations of bias, because they 
cut very deep for me because I take them very, very seriously.
    And I have conferred with ethics counsel both at the White 
House and also at the FCC to make sure that I will be free of 
bias. And if somebody believes that I would be biased in a 
particular docket, they can raise that with the FCC, and I will 
talk to ethics officials. So, I pledge to you that if there is 
an allegation of bias, that I will talk to agency officials and 
make sure that I can participate.
    The Chair. Thank you. Senator Sullivan.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Sohn, I have 
had continuing concerns about you from your previous two 
hearings and my concerns are only--increased during this 
hearing.
    This is a hugely important position. It relates to free 
speech in America, it relates to liberty, it relates to 
elections. It encompasses so much. And I think you have 
demonstrated here, and through your actions, that you are a far 
left partisan whose public record demonstrates a profound lack 
of judgment, lack of candor, professionalism, and very 
importantly, temperament, needed to be an FCC Chairman, or an 
FCC Commissioner.
    And by the way, there are all these talks about smears, 
character assassinations, vitriol. The Chairman mentioned that. 
I am simply going to ask you about your statements, and if 
there is any vitriol in this hearing, it is coming from your 
words, not our words.
    So let me begin by an issue that is directly in your 
wheelhouse if you are confirmed. You said, ``for all my 
concerns about Facebook, I believe that Fox News has had the 
most negative impact on our democracy. It is State sponsored 
propaganda.''
    Now millions of people watch Fox News. I happen to be one 
of them. Before Fox News came on the air, there was very little 
conservative voices. So, do you still believe Fox News is State 
sponsored propaganda?
    And if they came before you as a Commissioner, you 
certainly would recuse yourself, wouldn't you? I mean, this is 
not just a minor statement, you are calling them the most 
negative impact on our democracy and State sponsored 
propaganda. Is MSNBC State sponsored propaganda?
    Ms. Sohn. So, Fox News, actually, the FCC doesn't have 
jurisdiction over Fox News. And just as an----
    Senator Sullivan. The FCC or any of its entities came 
before--if Fox News or any related entity came before the FCC, 
would you recuse yourself?
    Ms. Sohn. No. In fact, I helped Fox broadcasting----
    Senator Sullivan. No, no, answer the question----
    Ms. Sohn. I helped Fox Broadcasting Network actually get on 
the air.
    Senator Sullivan. Do you know, when you call something 
State sponsored propaganda, isn't that a little bit of a bias? 
The answer is yes, come on.
    Ms. Sohn. The conversation----
    Senator Sullivan. Be direct with me----
    Ms. Sohn. Let me--Senator, if I may. I was talking about, 
this was in the context of the Section 230 hearing where folks 
were talking about disinformation on platforms. And the point 
that I was making in that tweet was that if the Government is 
going to look at platforms, they also need to look at Fox News.
    Senator Sullivan. I think, look, I have a lot of questions 
for you and I am going to try to be respectful, but I also, if 
I think you are filibustering, I am going to cut you off.
    I think when you call an entity one of the most negative--
having one of the most negative impacts on our democracy and 
State sponsored propaganda, and you have control over speech, 
that is a giant problem, and it certainly shows a lack of 
judgment and a bias.
    So, by the way, a bias on conservative views. Let me go to 
another issue that is very troubling to me, and it is your open 
disdain for Republicans, OK. Now, you have said, ``Republicans 
know that the only way they can win an election is to suppress 
the vote.''
    Wow, that is not my view. That is not the view of 
Republicans here. The only way Republicans can win is to 
suppress the vote. You also said maybe--``maybe next elections, 
Republicans will stop beating up on gays and women.''
    I mean, do you understand how, just ridiculously 
infuriating statements like this are? You are ripping half of 
the country, do you realize that?
    Ms. Sohn. So, let me address the one about----
    Senator Sullivan. No, just answer my question. Do you 
apologize for these statements? By the way, when people say 
this has nothing to do with the FCC, baloney. This is about 
free elections. You are saying you think Republicans want to 
suppress the vote.
    Ms. Sohn. This wasn't----
    Senator Sullivan. I mean, do you understand how offensive 
these kind of statements are? And by the way, how untrue they 
are? These aren't retweets. These are your statements. You want 
to talk about vitriol for America? This is pouring gas on 
American partisanship.
    The Chair. Senator, let her answer the question.
    Ms. Sohn. Senator----
    The Chair. Because I need to get to two more people.
    Ms. Sohn. Yes. I have admitted that some of my tweets were 
sharp and more partisan than I would even prefer. However, that 
tweet in particular was in reaction to what happened in Harris 
County, Texas, where the Republican leadership shut down drive 
thru voting. And that, again, has nothing to do--that was my 
opinion----
    Senator Sullivan. Madam Chairman, I have another question. 
I----
    Ms. Sohn. So, it is--you have to have the context.
    Senator Sullivan. Actually, you do, but you don't, right. I 
mean, you are making a statement, ``Republicans know the only 
way they can win an election is to suppress the vote.'' It is 
offensive. And it is--and it goes your character, it goes to 
your judgment. Let me just mention one other and then I am 
going to come back in round two. You keep saying that you are 
``baffled'' by opposition by police forces, baffled.
    And I know we have talked about it, the National 
Association of Police Organizations, they are very against you. 
And it is not because of the security of information, it is 
retweeting things like armed goons in riot gear, defunding the 
police.
    They are saying it is profoundly concerning to us that a 
nominee for the Commissioner of the FCC has harbored such an 
openly and hostile and defamatory views of the police. I was 
just out with the Anchorage PD doing a ride along recently.
    Why on earth would you be baffled by their opposition when 
you are making statements or supporting statements that are so 
derogatory? It is obvious why, because you are coming at them 
so hard. Why would you be baffled?
    Ms. Sohn. I am baffled because there are 11 out of 18,000 
tweets of mine, those 11 tweets, most of them were police 
brutality is bad, police shouldn't have tanks and armored 
vehicles.
    Senator Sullivan. Armed goons?
    Ms. Sohn. What is that?
    Senator Sullivan. Armed goons.
    Ms. Sohn. OK, well, again----
    Senator Sullivan. You are baffled that they are opposing 
you after you called them armed goons?
    Ms. Sohn.--that is one tweet out of 18,000.
    Senator Sullivan. That is one tweet enough to make you 
disqualified, in my view. And the law enforcement in America 
right now is undergoing profound challenges. And it is also 
remarkable, you mention it, that the FCC doesn't have a lot of 
authority over law enforcement, but that law enforcement is 
coming out so strongly against you.
    And it is because you are driving a narrative that is so 
harmful to them. And by the way, it is untrue. They are not 
armed goons. They are heroes. And you ought to apologize for 
all of these.
    The Chair. Senator Sullivan, thank you. I don't know if 
that was your second round or if you went over a couple of 
minutes, but we do want to go to that quickly if we can. I know 
people have to get to other things, but I do want to 
accommodate members. So, Senator Cruz and then Senator Schmitt, 
and then, yes.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just as a 
housekeeping matter, I would ask unanimous consent to enter 
into the record four different things: a letter from the Log 
Cabin Republicans opposing Ms. Sohn's nomination, a letter from 
numerous police groups opposing Ms. Sohn's nomination, and a 
letter from FCC Commissioner Mike O'Reilly, former 
Commissioner, about the program under Mr. Rupe.
    The Chair. Without objection.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
                                 

    Senator Cruz. Ms. Sohn, I think you have a long and 
consistent career as a zealous partisan advocate. There is a 
role for partisan advocates. It just doesn't happen to be on an 
independent agency charged with overseeing communications in 
the United States.
    You also have a consistent pattern of being unable to 
perceive conflicts of interest, whether it is deceiving this 
committee and the White House about the sweetheart settlement 
that you signed the day after your nomination was announced, or 
whether it is being the only nominee I have seen in a decade to 
make contributions to Senators who are voting on your 
nomination while your nomination is pending, or whether it is 
bizarrely supporting an extreme group that blasts multiple 
Senators from both parties.
    Now, I asked you about Joe Manchin and the group Fight for 
Our Future, where they ran billboards saying Joe Manchin is 
corrupt. You said you didn't agree with that. I asked you 
whether you agreed with them that Jon Tester is corrupt.
    You said you didn't agree with that. I asked you whether 
you agreed with them that Gary Peters is corrupt. You said you 
didn't agree with that. Well, I didn't get to finish.
    The Chair. Are you going to go to me?
    Senator Cruz. Oh, I am.
    The Chair. OK.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Cruz. Because she has attacked you, too, but 
vicariously.
    The Chair. I am not sure she has. I think an organization 
she belongs to has.
    Senator Cruz. The group that--but not just belongs to----
    Ms. Sohn. Not even belong.
    Senator Cruz.--raises money for. So, so, this group also 
ran the following billboard. It is a picture of Senator Sinema. 
Also, a member of this committee. And it is not subtle, in case 
you want to miss the message they are trying to convey. It is 
in bright red right at the top. It says, Sinema is corrupt. Do 
you agree with their sentiment that Senator Sinema is corrupt?
    Ms. Sohn. Of course not.
    Senator Cruz. Of course not. OK, you say. Of course not. So 
that billboard went up in 2019. At the end of 2019, what did 
you do? You sent out a fundraising e-mail for this organization 
at the end of 2019, so after they had put this billboard up.
    Did you know about the billboards they put up attacking 
Manchin, and Peters, and Tester, and Sinema?
    Ms. Sohn. I only actually knew the one about Senator 
Sinema. I didn't know about the other ones.
    Senator Cruz. OK, so you knew they had called Senator 
Sinema corrupt.
    Ms. Sohn. I did.
    Senator Cruz. And after they called Senator Sinema corrupt, 
you asked people to contribute to them. Is that correct?
    Ms. Sohn. I asked people to contribute not because of all 
their tactics----
    Senator Cruz. That is a yes or no question.
    Ms. Sohn. One time--yes, I did.
    Senator Cruz. OK. So, you knew they were calling Senator 
Sinema corrupt and you asked them to contribute afterwards. And 
by the way, the next year, so this is 2019--you know these 
tactics, you don't mind, you were aware of them.
    You have testified you knew about them, at least with 
regard to Senator Sinema, and you wanted people to support 
them. You also did it again in 2020. And Chairman Cantwell 
asked if I was going to ask about her.
    I would like to point out this same group sent a letter to 
Chuck Schumer demanding that Chuck Schumer remove Senator 
Cantwell as the Chairman of the Commerce Committee. Why? 
Because this committee hadn't confirmed you yet.
    Now, I think that is a pretty extreme proposition. I have 
got to say, I have never seen a nominee or a group that the 
nominee fundraises for demand her own party's Chairwoman be 
fired because you haven't been confirmed yet. Do you understand 
why this seems one heck of a conflict of interest?
    Ms. Sohn. I don't see how it is a conflict of interest, 
sir.
    Senator Cruz. Does it seem impartial or does it seem like 
an extreme partisan willing to burn, burn everything down if 
either party doesn't do what you want?
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, I don't agree with all the Fight for the 
Future's tactics. However----
    Senator Cruz. Except you raise money for them, you know 
about them, and you raise money for them.
    Ms. Sohn. I don't raise money for them.
    Senator Cruz. You send tweets every year asking people to 
contribute. When you ask people to contribute, that is called 
raising money. Let me ask you, does the FCC have an obligation 
to defend democracy?
    Ms. Sohn. Absolutely.
    Senator Cruz. Absolutely. OK. I would like to look at chart 
number 15. Chart number 15, you tweeted and I am going to read, 
``I agree that scrutiny of big tech is essential, as is 
scrutiny of big telecom, cable, and media. And trust me, the 
latter played their own role in destroying democracy and 
electing autocrats like, say, Fox News.''
    Millions of Americans watch Fox News. Do you believe Fox 
News, as you said, this is not a retweet, this is you tweeting, 
that Fox News plays a role in destroying democracy. Do you 
understand why millions of people don't think you are fair and 
impartial to regulate communications?
    Ms. Sohn. Fox News is not regulated by the FCC. And yes, I 
have some issues with Fox News. I also have some issues with--
--
    Senator Cruz. Some issues? Destroying democracy, that is 
not little. Let's look at number 16. Senator Sullivan asked you 
about that. You describe Fox News as State sponsored 
propaganda. You don't talk about vitriolic rhetoric, Senator 
Sullivan is right, it is coming from you. These are your words.
    What about Fox News is State sponsored? You know, you talk 
a lot about private actors. Last I checked, Fox News is not 
part of the Government. I want you to explain those two words, 
State sponsored. Why, because State sponsored suggests that at 
the FCC you would use Government regulatory power to go after 
them and silence them. What did you mean by State sponsored?
    Ms. Sohn. What I meant by that, and again, remember, I 
regretted the tone of that, was that they were very, very, very 
close to the Trump Administration. And the two of them were 
sort of interacting. That is why I called it State sponsored.
    Senator Cruz. Can I ask you one final question, is MSNBC 
very, very close to the Biden Administration?
    Ms. Sohn. I haven't the slightest idea. I don't watch it.
    Senator Cruz. You don't watch MSNBC?
    Ms. Sohn. I do not. I don't watch CNN either. I listen to 
NPR. Honestly, I don't.
    Senator Cruz. Thank you.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Sohn. I don't like screaming chyrons from anybody.
    The Chair. I am going take my time, if I could here, for my 
second round. And then just to clarify, you have a lot of 
conservative support. And I know that News Corp and various 
people have been supporters of you.
    And, you know, it is kind of interesting listening to 
everything today because I know these people know you in 
totality, right. And so, it is interesting that now people are 
trying to capture a moment of a retweet or a statement when in 
reality, these very conservative organizations who have been 
active in this space, like News Corp or the former Fox official 
or others, because I am assuming that they know your work and 
know your policy on important issues as it relates to 
competition.
    So, oh, I guess--where is that. OK. I didn't even know that 
that chart existed, but that is OK. OK. A chart of Republicans, 
I guess that you said something nice about. OK, we will go back 
to my opening statement, which was literally about the number 
of endorsements that you have had from conservatives.
    So I wanted to go back to that because the issue is, what 
are these policies that you think are pro-competition issues, 
that you think help keep the airspace--I know this is going to 
shock Senator Cruz, but you know what I would love to work with 
the two of you and come up with something on free speech 
because it is being challenged right now.
    And I don't think everybody is comfortable with a bunch of 
executives that say that they created advisory committee and 
can swing back and forth about what it is they do or don't do. 
We had the Facebook whistleblower here and basically, they had 
ignored pleas from my office, from my constituents to take down 
hate messages against the Rohingya in what was happening in 
Myanmar, and Facebook refused to do it.
    And I don't mean like once, I mean like with legal threats 
refused to do it. So, I don't think any of us want this world 
where we think a bunch of, you know, execs are calling the 
shots on what we need for free speech.
    So, I know you believe in free speech, and I think that is 
why they are supporting you. And if I am reading the quotes 
correctly, they are saying these conservatives are supporting 
Gigi Sohn because she believes in free speech. So, but in 
addition, we have had a transformative landscape here as it 
relates to broadcasters, right. And I want many voices in 
broadcasting because I think if you have competition in 
broadcast information, I think you will get better information.
    True competition will get you more perfect information. 
Then on this other issue, we are trying to push a lot of 
dollars at broadband but still not getting where we need to go. 
So, what can you tell me that you would support in both of 
these areas that are competitive features that would help us?
    I am disturbed that our colleagues have spent so much time 
talking about your personal associations, because I think they 
know you are a pro-consumer person. And so, but I would like to 
debunk the anxiety here and just talk about what are those pro-
consumer, competitive ideas that you have.
    Ms. Sohn. Well, for local broadcasting, I think we need to 
revisit the media ownership rules because they have led to 
enormous consolidation. And if we really care about local 
broadcasting and diversity in broadcasting, and the last FCC 
basically for all intents and purposes, eliminated those rules.
    And I think we need to go back and look at that and look at 
other ways that we might be able to promote local broadcasting, 
particularly ownership by minority and women. There is another 
issue that is right in the FCC's wheelhouse, which Senator Cruz 
you just put out a statement about a little while ago, and that 
is the de-platforming of Newsmax and OAN.
    I don't know why DirectTV deplatformed them. I spilled 
blood trying to get them on platforms. The predecessor to OAN 
is called Wealth TV, but also Newsmax, so I am very troubled by 
that. But I fear that there may be some competitive issues at 
play. I don't know the actual facts, but I think it is 
something the FCC should investigate.
    You know, for some--these guys are real independent 
programmers, right. They have got one channel or maybe they 
have two channels and they often get knocked out off of 
platforms because somebody can bundle 15 channels. Or, you 
know, or they have these what is called most favored nation 
clauses.
    So, I think, you know, the FCC, because we have been so 
busy working on broadband--we, sorry, the FCC has been so busy 
working on broadband that sometimes these important media 
consolidation issues kind of get pushed by the wayside.
    So, I think this is an opportunity, the de-platforming of 
Newsmax, to look at some of the practices around bundling and 
most favored nation clauses.
    The Chair. Senator Schmitt, did you have a second round?
    Senator Schmitt. I did. Thank you. Yes, thank you, Madam 
Chairwoman. You know, beyond some of the concerns that have 
been brought to light of the connections with big tech and some 
of these really inflammatory statements that you still have not 
apologized for, you have called them sharp, but I really find 
it astounding that you have not apologized for some of these 
statements, especially with regard to law enforcement.
    But beyond that, I wanted to explore your advocacy for 
massive economy changing regulations like net neutrality. In my 
preparation for this hearing, I did go back and watch some of 
your previous exchanges before this committee, and in 
particular with Senator Lee and Senator Sinema, you essentially 
said, I think you have said it here today, that Congress should 
act on this issue, but if Congress doesn't act and the FCC can.
    Now, since you were here last time, of course, the Supreme 
Court decided the West Virginia v. EPA case, which narrows 
rulemaking authority for agencies, including the FCC, on major 
questions of economic and political significance, of course, 
the major questions doctrine. And so, I don't have a lot of 
time.
    So, I want to ask you, because I am very interested in 
knowing a couple of simple questions. First, do you believe 
that the FCC can implement massive regulations that would have 
wholesale restructure in economic sector or massive regulations 
that are political or economically significant? Do you believe 
the FCC can do that?
    Ms. Sohn. Well, Senator, it is hard to for me to answer 
that question without more specifics----
    Senator Schmitt. Well, what about net neutrality? I am 
asking you specifically.
    Ms. Sohn. Let's talk about net--I think that is----
    Senator Schmitt. Well, actually, so I have laid it out. 
Now, I don't have a lot of time. Net neutrality, you know what 
that is and you know what the major questions doctrine is. Do 
you believe you can act on that?
    Ms. Sohn. So, the problem is that the Brand X case is a 
direct contravention of the West Virginia case.
    Senator Schmitt. Ma'am, I am just going to ask you, yes or 
no, do you think you can act on net neutrality if Congress 
doesn't act?
    Ms. Sohn. I think the FCC can and has the authority to act. 
That doesn't mean it won't be challenged. And the West Virginia 
case is going to be a challenge for net neutrality rules.
    Senator Schmitt. But you see, you understand the importance 
of that case was a lot of bureaucrats will say this is 
ambiguous, there is gray area.
    They have narrowed that down specifically so that in fact 
bureaucrats and regulars can't act on these sorts of issues 
without Congress acting because it is a part of a broader 
structure here, right.
    The Constitution was created to make sure the people, the 
Article I branch has these decisions because they are 
accountable. You can send us here and you can send us home or 
you can send us back.
    They can't do anything about you after you get past this 
hearing. And I just asked you a question, if you think you can 
act on this and you said you have, and you have no ability to 
do that.
    Ms. Sohn. Well, Senator, again, Chevron still is good law. 
And I have lived by Chevron and died by it.
    Senator Schmitt. But Chevron has been modified, you would 
admit that, correct?
    Ms. Sohn. Well, you know, it isn't that--it hasn't been 
modified.
    Senator Schmitt. Well, then let's add another thing to the 
list of reasons why you shouldn't be confirmed, because the EPA 
case makes very clear that people who might--you know, you want 
to be in a position where you can do this.
    And what it appears to me is that regardless of what the 
law says, regardless of what now the Supreme Court of the 
United States precedent is, that you think you can act on 
issues of major and economic significance or political 
significance just because you are frustrated Congress hasn't. 
You see how that might be a problem, right?
    Ms. Sohn. I don't think it is a problem because Brand X is 
opposite. So, the Brand X case says that the FCC has the 
authority to decide whether broadband is a telecommunications 
service or an information service. And that is kind of the crux 
of net neutrality.
    Now, whether the FCC could actually adopt net neutrality 
rules, I think that is a more difficult question, I will be 
honest with you.
    Senator Schmitt. So, on net neutrality, specifically in 
2015--in 2020, you said that the 2015 implementation net 
neutrality order that then President Obama, it wasn't enough. 
You said, ``I am not advocating for just reinstating the old 
rules.'' So even if the question of legality, of the 
Constitutionally of your actions, your comments demonstrate 
that you actually want to go much further than that.
    And based on my review of your record, your statements--by 
the way, I was just referring to statements you made before. 
You made very clear that even after the EPA, West Virginia 
case, you are doubling down on this.
    That your willful ignorance of that ruling, I have strong 
concerns that you will be unbiased, which I have indicated 
before, in an independent agency that has broad authority, and 
instead be pushing a radical agenda that you want.
    And I would submit to you that if that is what you want to 
do, you ought to run for office, you ought to run for the 
Senate, you ought to run for Congress. But I think you are 
trying to do an end around here by being on the FCC and getting 
what you actually want, which is not how this system was set 
up. So, with that, I am done. Thank you.
    The Chair. Senator Sullivan.
    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Madam Chair. And Ms. Sohn, I 
think you are getting a sense of frustration here. And let me, 
you keep talking about context, let me give you some context. 
You know, you are one of a long line of Biden Administration 
nominees who have made tweets and statements about Republicans 
being white supremacists, Republicans want to suppress the 
vote, Republicans, ``beating up women and gays.''
    That is, you are quote, racists. And you know what, it is 
just tiring. It is really tiring. It was almost at one point, 
it seemed like if you made one of these statements in a tweet, 
the Biden Administration put you at the top of the list to 
nominate you, right. So, you are part of that cohort and it is 
frustrating.
    Do you understand why people get frustrated? Do you 
understand why millions of Americans look at this and go, 
really problematic, she does not have the temperament making 
these statements. Do you understand that?
    Ms. Sohn. I understand that people are frustrated and I 
don't like the partisanship either. You know, things have 
gotten sharper since 2016.
    Senator Sullivan. But you keep saying sharper, but you are 
going to have enormous power if you are an FCC Commissioner. 
Let me just make two final points. One is just a correction for 
the record.
    You probably don't know it, but in terms of OAN, the 
President of OAN just tweeted out ``your lack of support for 
diverse voices makes her unqualified to be an FCC 
Commissioner.'' That is Charles Herring. Maybe he is watching 
the hearing, and has been, has changed his view. And similarly, 
the CEO of OAN just said One American News, the CEO and Owner 
just tweeted that ``OAN will not, does not, and will not, will 
never support Ms. Sohn for Commissioner.''
    So just correcting the record, saying earlier you said OAN 
supports you. I think definitively they don't. Let me ask a 
final question, which is a really important one, and it relates 
to the policies that you would be really overseeing, and it 
relates to rural broadband connectivity for rural communities.
    You know, we just had an infrastructure bill that focused 
on this. A lot of people talk about it, you have. You know, it 
is important for urban areas to go from 4G to 5G. You know, I 
always raise my hand, say, hey, what about no G? What about no 
G? My state is not connected at all.
    And so, the infrastructure bill prioritized rural 
communities, and yet you have again, come out with, I believe, 
an elitist urban, rural view on broadband connectivity. And I 
am not going to quote from you, I am going to quote from an Op-
ed from Senator Heidi Heitkamp, who last year wrote an Op-ed 
entitled, ``Gigi Sohn is Wrong for the FCC and Rural America.''
    I would like to submit that for the record, Madam Chair.
    The Chair. Without objection.
    [The information referred to follows:]

              One Country Project--Mar 2, 2022; 3 min read

                Sohn is Wrong for FCC and Rural America

                       By Senator Heidi Heitkamp

    There has been a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking done to 
analyze election results with an eye towards rural America--namely 
Democrats trying to figure out how to gain traction there. In most 
elections if Democrats could just move 70-30 losses in rural counties 
to 60-40 losses, they would have a path to victory statewide. Far too 
often the policy vision to deliver this electoral improvement is boiled 
down to one simple idea: give them broadband.
    It's not the only idea that works in rural America, but it isn't a 
bad one and it's certainly a needed one. A few important stats:

  1.  ``22.3 percent of Americans in rural areas and 27.7 percent of 
        Americans in Tribal lands lack coverage from fixed terrestrial 
        25/3 Mbps broadband, as compared to only 1.5 percent of 
        Americans in urban areas, according to a recent report by the 
        Federal Communications Commission.'' (USDA, 2020)

  2.  ``Rural residents are still less likely than those living in 
        suburban areas to report having home broadband.'' (Pew 
        Research, 2021)

  3.  ``About 81 percent of rural households are plugged into 
        broadband, compared with about 86 percent in urban areas.'' 
        (New York Times, Census Bureau Data, 2021)

  4.  ``More than 30 million Americans--many of whom live on Tribal 
        lands or in other rural areas--do not have access to broadband 
        infrastructure that delivers even minimally sufficient 
        speeds.'' (White House Fact Sheet)

    But here's what's so confusing: How can Democrats support rural 
broadband expansion and also support Gigi Sohn? Sohn, the Biden 
Administration's nominee for FCC Commissioner, has made numerous public 
statements that call into question whether she will work to bring 
broadband to all rural Americans expeditiously.

  <bullet> In a testimony to the House Energy & Commerce Committee, she 
        said ``policymakers have focused disproportionately on 
        broadband deployment in rural areas of the United States.''

  <bullet> During an April 2021 interview with Bloomberg Government, 
        saying ``What [have we gotten] for [the Federal government's 
        existing] $50 billion investment? Not much.''

  <bullet> Sohn also criticized the FCC broadband policies and claimed 
        they ``made it really easy'' for rural broadband companies ``to 
        basically suck at the government teat to the tune of tens of 
        billions of dollars.''

    Given the significant progress that's been made in closing the 
rural digital divide in recent years, and all the important work that 
remains to fully close the gap, this deeply cynical view of rural 
broadband efforts doesn't inspire confidence.
    Priorities matter, and Sohn has consistently tried to downplay the 
importance of policies focused on rural broadband and shift attention 
toward her preferred constituencies in urban areas.
    Sohn has also been a longtime advocate of ``overbuilding,'' 
spending taxpayer dollars to build government-run networks in areas 
that already have service. This drains resources that should otherwise 
be going toward those Americans, overwhelmingly in rural areas, that 
have no service options. Given the supply chain problems and equipment 
and workforce shortages already affecting broadband deployment, it's 
unconscionable that policymakers would allocate resources to 
overbuilding areas with installed service while putting rural Americans 
who have no service at the back of the line.
    Senate Democrats should decide that enough is enough and ask 
President Biden to choose a new nominee for the FCC--one that can 
advance their agenda without these extremist tactics. Sohn is a mixed 
message at best and will obliterate any Democrats hope they will get 
credit for broadband wins.

    Heidi Heitkamp is the founder of the One Country Project and former 
Democratic senator from North Dakota.

    Senator Sullivan. So, in it, Senator Heitkamp, Democrat 
Senator Heitkamp said that in your testimony before the House 
Energy and Commerce committee, you said, ``policymakers have 
focused disproportionately on broadband development in rural 
areas of the United States.'' Then, this is Senator Heitkamp 
talking here, Sohn also criticized the FCC broadband policies 
and claimed they made it, ``really easy for rural broadband 
companies,'' this is now you, she is quoting you, ``to 
basically suck at the Government's teat to the tune of tens of 
billions of dollars.''
    It is pretty vitriolic, in my view. And then here is how 
Senator Heitkamp summarizes her Op-ed against your 
confirmation, ``given the significant progress that has been 
made in closing the rural digital divide in recent years and 
all the important work that remains to fully close the gap, 
this deeply cynical view of rural broadband by Gigi Sohn does 
not inspire confidence.'' I couldn't agree more.
    This is a gigantic issue for me and my constituents, and 
for Democrats and Republicans. So, do you still think Senators 
like me, ``focus disproportionately on broadband development in 
rural areas''? I guarantee you, my constituents who have no G 
would fundamentally disagree with you.
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, just because I said they 
disproportionately focused doesn't mean that I don't support 
all efforts. And like I said, I was one of the biggest 
supporters of the BEAD Program in the infrastructure bill. It 
doesn't mean I don't support rural broadband, but there has 
been, and particularly at the time, not so much now, OK. It is 
interesting----
    Senator Sullivan. You, well this--I am quoting you from 
2020.
    Ms. Sohn. Right. Correct. I was testifying at a hearing 
about closing the digital divide and digital equity. And I 
wanted to make the point that nobody really was talking about 
the digital divide in cities at the time and that everybody was 
only talking about rural. Now we are talking about urban and 
rural, and I think that is really good.
    Senator Sullivan. But you make, the statement makes it 
sound like----
    Ms. Sohn. Because it is taken out of context.
    Senator Sullivan. You are critical of Legislators who are 
trying to close the rural divide. And again, it makes me 
nervous about what you will do if you become the Commissioner 
with now not only an anti-conservative view, an anti-Republican 
view, you have an anti-rural America view, and it is not just 
me saying it, Heidi Heitkamp said it.
    Ms. Sohn. Senator, if you would meet with me, and I think 
we are going to meet so I am really happy about that, you will 
see that I know more about how to fix the digital divide in 
Alaska than most people. And I would really love to talk to you 
about the substance because I have got all kinds of ideas.
    I share some of your concerns about the rural health care 
program, about other programs. I can't--and I have a lot of 
support in your state. Hopefully you have heard from some of 
them.
    So, I do care deeply, particularly about your state and 
making sure everybody has broadband because I know it is the 
least connected state.
    Senator Sullivan. It is.
    Ms. Sohn. So, I hope we do have an opportunity to actually 
talk about what is real in your state, because I think I would 
be a fantastic Commissioner for the state of Alaska.
    The Chair. I am even willing to join that meeting, just as 
I have joined other Alaska infrastructure meetings.
    Senator Sullivan. I want to compliment the Chair on these 
kind of issues.
    The Chair. No, no, it really is important. I mean, Alaska 
does have a very, very unique challenge. And all the things 
that you think you are going to do for all the rest of the 
states is not going to work in Alaska, so it needs its own 
plan. So, I appreciate that and I will happily attend that 
meeting.
    So, this is the close of our hearing. Before we close, I 
would like to confirm, Ms. Sohn, if you pledge to work 
collaboratively with the Committee and provide thorough and 
timely responses to requests for information that we put--that 
you put together important policy papers and appear before the 
Committee when requested?
    Ms. Sohn. Yes.
    The Chair. Senators will have until the close of business, 
Friday, February 17, to submit questions for the record. Thank 
you all. That concludes our hearing.
    [Whereupon, at 1:42 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                                 ______
                                 
  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Raphael Warnock to 
                              Gigi B. Sohn
    Broadband. Ms. Sohn, when you were last before this Committee, you 
committed to me that you would work with my office to connect every 
Georgian to the Internet. I was glad to champion the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act (Pub. L. 117-58) and its generational 
investment in broadband deployment. However, I am concerned that 
without accurate mapping, these funds may not go to the places that 
need them the most. In December 2022, I led a letter with every member 
of the Georgia delegation calling on the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) to extend its deadline for states to submit challenges 
to its draft broadband map, emphasizing the need for accurate mapping.

    Question 1. Do you agree that accurate broadband mapping is 
essential to the efficient deployment of Federal resources?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 2. If confirmed, what steps would you take to ensure that 
the FCC's broadband mapping, which will guide the deployment of funding 
from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, is accurate?
    Answer. With the June 30 deadline for allocating funding for the 
Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program just four 
months away, time is of the essence. If I am confirmed, I will work 
with the Chairwoman and the states to find creative ways to improve 
both the service location map and the availability map before the BEAD 
allocations are made. After June 30, I will continue to work with the 
states to ensure that their challenges are considered fairly and that 
they obtain the information they need to perfect them.

    Question 3. If confirmed, will you commit to working with my office 
and other Georgia stakeholders to ensure their information is reflected 
in funding decisions?
    Answer. Yes.

    ACP Implementation. The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) has 
been a success, however, like any new program, it can be improved to 
ensure it fulfills Congress' intent.

    Question 4. What program improvements do you believe are needed to 
enhance the operations of and increase participation rates in the 
Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP)?
    Answer. I agree that the ACP has been a success, and also that it 
could be improved upon to ensure that every household that is eligible 
can make use of it. I would make three changes to the program:

1.  A More streamlined, User-Friendly application process. The 
        application process for the Affordable Connectivity Program is 
        already cumbersome and difficult for applicants and is causing 
        many applicants to not complete their application and enroll in 
        the program, despite being eligible for it. The two-step 
        enrollment process and need for documentation for verification 
        often prevents eligible households from completing enrollment. 
        More clarity on required documentation and a more seamless, 
        human-centered user interface would support increased 
        enrollment.

2.  Better enrollment data and continued support for digital navigators 
        and future ACP outreach grant funded partners. The FCC should 
        seek to provide the greatest possible amount of useful ACP data 
        in a form that can easily be aligned to the boundaries of local 
        jurisdictions, communities and neighborhoods, and matched with 
        relevant local data from the American Community Survey and 
        related sources on such topics as age, race, language, income, 
        family characteristics, housing occupancy, school affiliations, 
        public health, etc.--not to mention household computer 
        ownership and broadband adoption.

   To ensure those who need these programs have access, there is a need 
        for more training, simplicity, and continued funding for on-
        the-ground, person to person innovative enrollment support. 
        It's essential that both trusted organizations and providers 
        are well-trained to properly enroll and serve households that 
        need support with understanding the ACP process. More 
        formalized training and technical assistance and support from 
        USAC would ensure more organizations have the tools and 
        training they need to adequately serve their constituents.

3.  Appropriations to continue the program. The lack of clarity on 
        ACP's continuation is beginning to hamper enrollment. 
        Forthcoming research from Brian Whitacre, Hernan Galperin, and 
        John Horrigan shows many households are not enrolling out of 
        fear the program will end. In addition, digital inclusion 
        practitioners and those who have spent time promoting the 
        program are in the difficult position of advertising and 
        enrolling participants in a program that they cannot promise 
        will last or be available to the participant a year from now. 
        Internet service providers' low-cost programs are helpful, but 
        they all have participation limitations. Without Congressional 
        action, this vital program will go away in just a few short 
        years.

    USAC Oversight. The Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) 
manages verifications of customer enrollments into ACP; however, 
constituents in Georgia have noted that USAC can experience outages 
lasting many hours.

    Question 5. What steps would you take, if confirmed, to improve the 
performance of USAC?
    Answer. As you note, the ACP is a successful program that was stood 
up by the FCC and USAC in a very short period of time. While it is not 
acceptable to have frequent outages, I do not have an insight on the 
extent of the problem. If confirmed, I promise to look into this issue 
to determine whether there are directives that the Commission can make 
to USAC to improve its performance to ensure that consumers have access 
to the online databases necessary to enroll in the ACP and other USAC 
programs.
                                 ______
                                 
      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                              Gigi B. Sohn
    Question 1. You've repeatedly defended your past rhetoric on the 
basis that you were acting in your capacity as a ``public interest 
advocate'' and that your ``opinions as a public interest advocate will 
have no bearing on how [you] behave as a policymaker'' at the FCC. For 
instance, in response to questions from Senator Vance during the 
hearing on February 14, 2023, you testified that previous incendiary 
comments that you made were made ``either in [your] role as a private 
citizen or public advocate.'' You also responded to one of Senator 
Blackburn's questions by saying that ``the role of a policy maker is 
different than the role of an advocate.'' I'd like to hear more about 
what being a public interest advocate means, in your view. Yes or no: 
is it still your position that your ``opinions as a public interest 
advocate will have no bearing on how [you] behave as a policymaker''?
    Answer. Yes. As a policymaker I am bound by the Administrative 
Procedure Act to make decisions based on the totality of the record and 
the law. If confirmed, my decision making will be subject to this 
requirement, and will also be shaped by input from stakeholders, my 
staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the members of this Committee. If a 
regulatory body fails to make decisions based on the record of a 
proceeding and the law, it would likely be overturned by the Federal 
courts.

    Question 2. How do you define the role of a public interest 
advocate?
    Answer. A public interest advocate is someone who publicly supports 
or recommends a particular cause or policy.

    Question 3. How was calling Senator Mitch McConnell the ``grim 
reaper'', which you have done, in the public interest or part of your 
job as a public interest advocate?
    Answer. As I stated in my February 22, 2022 Questions for the 
Record, I do not think that partisan and petty name calling is 
appropriate for a public official. It was an off-hand comment made as a 
public advocate and in the context of a policy discussion of the 
Senate's consideration of the Save the Internet Act, which would have 
reinstated the 2015 Open Internet Order. Senator McConnell said that 
the bill was ``dead on arrival'' in the Senate, hence the ``grim 
reaper'' reference. Regardless, I regret the comment.

    Question 4. How was saying that Fox News is ``state sponsored 
propaganda'', ``dangerous to our democracy'', and ``destroying our 
democracy and electing autocrats'', which you have done, in the public 
interest or part of your job as a public interest advocate?
    Answer. For over 30 years, I have worked to ensure that our 
communications networks promote democratic values, and that includes 
speaking publicly via differing mediums, including social media. While 
my tone was perhaps sharper than I might have preferred, those tweets 
were commentary on the impact specifically of Fox News on our 
democracy. Recent news reports that Fox News anchors believed that 
claims of 2020 election fraud were false yet continued to push that 
idea \1\ would tend to support my concern.

Times, February 16, 2023. Found at https://www.nytimes
.com/2023/02/16/business/media/fox-dominion-lawsuit.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Moreover, over the past 5 years, my job as a public interest 
advocate included publicly commenting in various forums on policy 
issues involving not only telecommunications and media, but also online 
platforms like Meta, Amazon, and Google. In the context of the ``state-
sponsored propaganda'' tweet, I was commenting on Twitter about a 
hearing where online platforms were being singled out as the source of 
disinformation in our society. I suggested, perhaps more sharply than I 
would have preferred, that if Congress wanted to examine disinformation 
on social media, it should also look at mainstream media as well.

    Question 5. How was alleging that Republicans are a threat to our 
republic and saying that ``Republicans know that they only way they can 
win is to suppress the vote'', which you have done, in the public 
interest or part of your job as a public interest advocate?
    Answer. I made those comments as a private citizen--they had no 
relation to my work as a public advocate for open, robust, and 
affordable communications networks. As I discussed at the February 14 
hearing, the latter comment was made in response to the news report 
that Republicans in Harris County, Texas discontinued drive-up voting 
in the middle of the 2020 election.

    Question 6. How can you be this offensive and unfair as a ``public 
interest advocate'' but expect senators to believe you'll be impartial 
and fair as a ``public interest regulator''?
    Answer. I don't believe that I am offensive and unfair, but in any 
event, the role of a regulator is very different from that of an 
advocate. As a regulator I would be bound by the Administrative 
Procedure Act to make decisions based on the totality of the record and 
the law. If confirmed, my decision making will be subject to this 
requirement, and will also be shaped by input from stakeholders, my 
staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the members of this Committee. If a 
regulatory body fails to make decisions based on the record of a 
proceeding and the law, it would likely be overturned by the Federal 
courts.

    Question 7. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that calling Fox 
News ``state sponsored propaganda'' was part of your job. How is Gigi 
Sohn the person different from ``public interest advocate Gigi Sohn''? 
Please explain how you can separate the two.
    Answer. ``Public Interest Advocate Gigi Sohn'' writes, speaks, 
testifies, and otherwise publicly advocates on issues related to 
communications and technology law and policy. These include, broadband 
policy, privacy, content moderation, antitrust, media policy, and only 
rarely, international communications and technology policy. ``Gigi Sohn 
the person'' is a citizen who comments on a wide range of things 
unrelated to my work, including politics, sports, culture, food, 
friends and family.

    Question 8. The Communications Act, which you would be required to 
apply and interpret as an FCC commissioner, charges the FCC with 
regulating and issuing licenses in the ``public interest.'' In fact, 
the Communications Act mentions that term 103 times. What is the 
difference between working in the public interest at Public Knowledge, 
the Benton Institute, and Georgetown University and working in the 
public interest at the FCC?
    Answer. If I am confirmed as an FCC Commissioner, I would be bound 
by the Administrative Procedure Act to make decisions based on the 
totality of the record and the law. If confirmed, my decision making 
will be subject to this requirement and will also be shaped by input 
from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the members 
of this Committee. If a regulatory body fails to make decisions based 
on the record of a proceeding and the law, it will likely be overturned 
by the Federal courts.
    A public interest advocate is not bound by the Administrative 
Procedure Act and needn't take into account the totality of the record 
of a proceeding or take input from others.

    Question 9. At your nomination hearings, you have stated that you 
have consulted with a group of outside advisors during the course of 
your nomination process, including an advisor(s) who counseled you that 
you could not share information about the Locast secret settlement 
agreement with this Committee. What are the names of the outside 
advisors that you have consulted with during the course of your 
nomination process?
    Answer. In my hearings and Questions for the Record, I told the 
Committee that I consulted with outside advisors with regard to the 
scope and duration of my voluntary recusal. Specifically, those 
advisors were Greg Guice of Public Knowledge and Ernesto Falcon of the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation, as well as Committee staff. I was 
advised by Michael Dockterman of Steptoe and Johnson, attorney for 
Sports Fans Coalition New York, Inc., about the confidential Locast 
settlement agreement.

    Question 10. What is the name(s) of the advisor(s) who counseled 
you that you could not share information about the Locast secret 
settlement agreement with this Committee.
    Answer. Michael Dockterman, Steptoe and Johnson, attorney for 
Sports Fans Coalition New York, Inc.

    Question 11. When previously asked by Senator Blunt if you believe 
that Locast impacted local broadcasters, you responded, ``I do not 
agree that Locast's operations were financially harmful to local 
broadcasters'' but then pivoted and did not provide an explanation. 
Please explain why you believe retransmission of broadcast TV signals 
without paying fees is not harmful to broadcasters and content 
producers.
    Answer. Judge Stanton did not find that any local broadcasters were 
harmed financially by Locast's operations, and the fact that the case 
narrowing agreement limited the case only to the question of whether 
Locast qualified for a non-profit exemption under copyright law, is 
evidence that the plaintiffs knew that proving damages was going to be 
extremely difficult.
    I did not say, and do not believe, that as a general rule, that 
retransmission of broadcast TV signals without paying fees is not 
harmful to broadcasters and content producers.

    Question 12. You previously stated that you have no bias against 
the broadcast networks that sued SFCNY for operating Locast and won a 
permanent injunction against you. Does your involvement in Locast 
create an appearance of bias on your part against the broadcast 
networks in any way?
    Answer. No. Nothing I have said or done with respect to this 
lawsuit creates an appearance of bias. In this way, I am no different 
from a nominee who works for a media company that gets sued by another 
media company. Without more, the mere fact that the networks sued an 
organization on whose board I sat doesn't create an appearance of bias 
on my part.

    Question 13. Does your involvement with Locast create a conflict of 
interest on your part with respect to serving as an FCC commissioner?
    Answer. No. Neither the Office of Government Ethics nor the FCC's 
Office of the General Counsel believe my involvement with Locast 
creates a conflict of interest.

    Question 14. Does your voluntary recusal dated January 27, 2022, 
remain in effect?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 15. What is the termination date for your voluntary 
recusal from participation in FCC Docket No. 10-71 or any related FCC 
docket concerning the same issues?
    Answer. July 1, 2025

    Question 16. What is the termination date for your voluntary 
recusal from participation in any proceeding before the FCC where 
retransmission consent or television broadcast copyright is a material 
issue in the FCC's disposition of that proceeding?
    Answer. July 1, 2024

    Question 17. Did you have any discussions with the broadcasting 
industry about the contours and scope of your proposed recusal before 
submitting your January 27, 2022 recusal letter?
    Answer. No.

    Question 18. Did you have any discussions with anyone in Congress, 
including congressional staff, about the contours and scope of your 
proposed recusal before submitting the letter?
    Answer. Yes, as I discussed in my February 22, 2022 Questions for 
the Record, I discussed the contours and scope of my proposed recusal 
with Committee staff.

    Question 19. Did you have any discussions with anyone in the White 
House, including staff, about the contours and scope of your proposed 
recusal before submitting the letter?
    Answer. No.

    Question 20. Who will be the final arbiter on which proceedings you 
will be recused from?
    Answer. FCC ethics officials in the Office of General Counsel.

    Question 21. If confirmed, will you commit to asking the FCC Office 
of General Counsel to make a determination on FCC proceedings for which 
you believe that your voluntary recusal does not apply, but for which 
members of this Committee believe it does?
    Answer. As noted above, the FCC's Office of General Counsel will be 
the final arbiter regarding any proceedings that would require my 
recusal.

    Question 22. If confirmed, please list all ongoing FCC proceedings 
you will recuse yourself from.
    Answer. I have committed to recusing myself from docket number 10-
71. In addition, for one year after confirmation (if I am confirmed), I 
cannot participate ``personally or substantially'' in matters where the 
entities for which I worked (Georgetown Law Institute for Technology 
and Policy, Benton Institute for Broadband and Society), on whose 
boards I served (Electronic Frontier Foundation and Sports Fans 
Coalition NY, Inc), and for whom I provided consulting services (5 
``expert'' networks) are ``a party or represent a party,'' unless I am 
authorized to participate by the Office of General Counsel.

    Question 23. Do you stand behind your statement in your voluntary 
recusal that it was issued ``to avoid any appearance of impropriety and 
in interest of ensuring that the public has full confidence that 
policymakers will make decisions free of bias?''
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 24. If your answer is ``yes'', then why didn't you recuse 
yourself from other proceedings in which you personally participated, 
including those in which you filed signed comments or other documents?
    Answer. As I testified at the February 9, 2022 hearing and 
addressed in my February 22, 2022 Questions for the Record, I was 
trying to address the concerns of some members of this Committee with 
respect to my involvement in Locast, so I crafted a temporary and 
narrow voluntary recusal at the nexus of my involvement with Locast and 
my personal participation in a 12-year-old Petition for Rulemaking 
seeking changes to the retransmission consent regime.
    I relied upon precedent involving former Chairman Kennard, who 
voluntarily recused himself from a fairness doctrine related docket 
because he had signed a pleading as an NAB intern many years before. I 
had signed a Petition for Rulemaking seeking changes to the 
retransmission consent regime, and the docket remains open, so I have 
voluntarily offered to recuse myself for a limited period from issues 
emanating from that petition.
    By contrast, requests for recusals from other proceedings in which 
I personally participated are not tethered to anything and are without 
precedent. They are basically saying that I should be recused from 
everything and anything I've ever advocated for or against. Imagine the 
implications of that--anyone, whether they be in private practice, 
working for a corporation, an academic, or a public interest advocate, 
would have to recuse themselves from any matter on which they've taken 
a position on, whether or not they were representing specific clients. 
The result would be an FCC populated by members with no background in 
communications law and policy. That is a result that I don't believe 
that anyone wants.

    Question 25. You previously stated that your recusal was voluntary 
and that you could withdraw your recusal after consulting with the 
FCC's General Counsel. Will you leave no doubt and make your recusal 
mandatory?
    Answer. My recusal is voluntary and the ethics officers in the 
FCC's Office of General Counsel saw no need to make it mandatory. I 
intend to abide by my recusal.

    Question 26. Why didn't you disclose your voluntary recusal 
agreement in response to any of conflict of interest questions in 
Section B of the Senate Commerce Committee Nominee Questionnaire that 
you submitted in the 118th Congress?
    Answer. I have never claimed, nor did the FCC's ethics officials 
determine, that my membership on the SFCNY Board presented a conflict 
of interest. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(a) defines a conflict of interest as 
one where a person has a ``financial interest directly and predictably 
affected by [a] matter.'' Neither my membership on the SFCNY Board nor 
my recusal involves any financial interest. Moreover, neither the 
Office of Government Ethics nor the FCC's Office of the General Counsel 
believe my involvement with Locast creates a conflict of interest.
    In any event, I have made my voluntary recusal letter well known to 
the members of this Committee. Apparently, even some of the new members 
of the Committee were aware of the recusal. For example, when I met 
with Senator Budd on February 10, he asked me questions about the scope 
of my recusal agreement.

    Question 27. Although you have promised to recuse yourself from 
retransmission consent proceedings due to your position on the SFCNY 
board, the illegal operations of Locast and your publicly expressed 
sentiments cast a pall over many proceedings. For example, you have 
previously stated that you weren't willing to expand your recusal to 
cover mergers involving the Locast litigants or parties harmed by 
Locast. Yes or no: Will you reconsider that position?
    Answer. No. And as discussed in detail in response to question 28 
below, no court has declared Locast's operations to be ``illegal'' and 
no court has found that any party was ``harmed'' by Locast.

    Question 28. In February 2022, Standard General announced their 
intent to acquire Tegna. The FCC is currently reviewing this 
transaction. Given that Tegna owns channels whose signals were 
illegally retransmitted by Locast, including four stations in Texas, do 
you agree that it would create an appearance of impropriety for you to 
participate in this transaction review? Why or why not?
    Answer. I do not agree that it will create an appearance of 
impropriety for me to participate in this transaction review. First, no 
court has determined that any broadcaster's channels were ``illegally 
retransmitted'' by Locast. The court only found that Locast did not 
qualify for a non-profit exemption under copyright law. No 
determination was made that Locast acted illegally. Second, the mere 
fact that Locast carried a particular broadcaster's signal does not in 
and of itself create an appearance of impropriety, particularly in 
light of the fact that Judge Stanton did not find that any broadcaster 
was harmed by Locast's service. Finally, Tegna was not a party to the 
lawsuit against SFCNY. As previously noted, if I am confirmed, the FCC 
ethics officials will be the final arbiter regarding any necessary 
recusals.

    Question 29. An overarching issue in the Standard General-Tegna 
transaction is its impact on retransmission consent fees. Given that 
you have promised to recuse yourself from retransmission consent 
proceedings, do you plan to also recuse yourself from reviewing this 
transaction? If not, do you at least plan to recuse yourself from the 
portion of any decision that addresses or resolves concerns about 
retransmission consent fees? Why or why not?
    Answer. I do not plan on recusing myself from the portion of any 
transaction that addresses or resolves concerns about retransmission 
consent fees because my voluntary agreement excludes ``any assignment 
or transfer of control of broadcast, cable and satellite companies.'' 
As previously noted, if I am confirmed, the FCC ethics officials will 
be the final arbiter regarding any necessary recusals.

    Question 30. More broadly, if you're confirmed, do you plan to 
recuse yourself from any future FCC transaction reviews that involve a 
broadcast company whose signals Locast, under your leadership, also 
illegally retransmitted? Why or why not?
    Answer. I do not plan on recusing myself from any future 
transaction involving a broadcast company whose signals Locast 
transmitted because: 1) My voluntary agreement excludes ``any 
assignment or transfer of control of broadcast, cable and satellite 
companies''; 2) No court has determined that any broadcaster's channels 
were ``illegally retransmitted'' by Locast. The court only found that 
Locast did not qualify for a non-profit exemption under copyright law; 
and 3) The mere fact that Locast carried a particular broadcaster's 
signals does not in and of itself create an appearance of impropriety, 
particularly in light of the fact that Judge Stanton did not find that 
any broadcaster was harmed by Locast's service. As previously noted, if 
I am confirmed, the FCC ethics officials will be the final arbiter 
regarding any necessary recusals.

    Question 31. Similarly, given that retransmission consent fees are 
a significant issue in almost every transfer of broadcast licenses, 
transfer of cable operations, or review of broadcast or cable media 
ownership, do you plan to recuse yourself from participating in such 
proceedings where retransmission consent is a significant part of the 
FCC's review? Why or why not?
    Answer. I do not plan on recusing myself from these proceedings 
because my voluntary recusal specifically exempts them.

    Question 32. You previously tweeted that the FCC should look into 
revoking Sinclair's broadcasting licenses--a grave threat to any 
broadcaster and one revealing undue partiality. Do you agree to recuse 
yourself from any adjudication or enforcement action regarding 
Sinclair, including any transaction review? Why or why not?
    Answer. I will not recuse myself from any adjudication or 
enforcement action regarding Sinclair. I believe that I can review 
matters involving Sinclair Broadcasting in a fair and neutral way. 
Regardless of what I might have said four years ago about a merger that 
was blocked by the Trump FCC, it would have no bearing on any future 
proceeding involving Sinclair. In those future proceedings, I would be 
bound by the law to decide matters based upon and supported by the 
record of that proceeding. If the FCC makes a decision that is not 
supported by the record of a particular proceeding, it is likely to be 
reversed by the Federal courts of appeal.
    It is important to note that the question of whether Sinclair is 
fit to be a broadcast licensee came up in the context of its proposed 
merger with Tribune. The FCC, under former Chairman Ajit Pai, 
effectively blocked the merger because it found that ``there was a 
substantial and material fact as to whether Sinclair affirmatively 
misrepresented or omitted material facts with the intent to consummate 
this transaction without fully complying with the media ownership 
rules.'' I supported that decision, and said that, ``[i]f true, this 
allegation raises a legitimate question as to whether Sinclair is fit 
to be a licensee at all, and not just a licensee of Tribune's 
stations.'' This is consistent with the Administrative Law Judge, 
appointed by then-Chairman Pai, who said that Sinclair's 
misrepresentations ``may be so fundamental to a licensee's operation 
that it is relevant to its qualification to hold any station license.''

    Question 33. In response to a QFR from Senator Sinema after your 
second nomination hearing, you said ``copyright is outside the FCC's 
jurisdiction.'' However, copyright issues were central to two 
proceedings that you worked on under former FCC Chairman Wheeler--the 
set-top box proposal and the proposal to define online video 
distributors as MVPDs. Do you wish to retract or modify your statement 
that ``copyright is outside the FCC's jurisdiction'' in light of these 
proceedings?
    Answer. I stand by my statement. Copyright law is outside the FCC's 
jurisdiction. Congress gave the FCC authority to regulate the video 
marketplace in various ways--to promote competition in video 
distribution and to ensure that cable set-top boxes are available on a 
retail basis from manufacturers who are not affiliated with cable 
companies. Video programming is protected by copyright law and some 
rightsholders who disagree with Congress's choice to give the FCC 
limited jurisdiction over the delivery of video programming have argued 
that implementing Communications Act provisions would somehow conflict 
with copyright law. No court has ever made such a determination. The 
FCC's efforts to ensure competitive delivery of video programming 
online no more conflicts with copyright law than the Commission's 
earlier efforts to promote Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) programming 
delivery. And the Commission's attempt to update its CableCARD rules to 
promote set-top box competition in light of marketplace changes no more 
conflicts with copyright law than the CableCARD rules themselves do.
    While the Commission does not have jurisdiction over copyright law, 
it also does not have the ability to prevent companies from raising 
copyright issues as potential objections to its pro-competition 
mission. The Commission must give due weight to these concerns while 
continuing to carry out its statutory mission.

    Question 34. Regarding the set-top box proposal--a rule you 
championed that would have required cable and satellite TV providers to 
make their TV channels and copyrighted content available to third party 
video device and software companies--many were concerned that the 
proposal would boost piracy and undermine content licensing agreements 
and the Register of Copyrights at the time stated that the proposal 
``raise[d] serious concerns as a matter of copyright policy'' and 
appeared to ``inappropriately restrict copyright owners' [rights over 
their works].'' Do you still believe that the set top box proposal was 
the right approach?
    Answer. The set-top box proposal was a rule championed by Chairman 
Wheeler and it was my job to support him in that effort. As you note, 
various parties raised copyright concerns and, as a result, the 
proposal did not move forward.

    Question 35. Do you think changes in the marketplace and/or 
technology have rendered the set-top box proposal irrelevant and 
unnecessary?
    Answer. I haven't thought much about the set-top-box proposal since 
I left the FCC in 2016 and I don't expect the Chairwoman to circulate 
such a proposal.

    Question 36. Yes or no: If confirmed, would you oppose any attempt 
to bring back former FCC Chairman Wheeler's set-top box proposal?
    Answer. I haven't thought much about the set-top-box proposal since 
I left the FCC in 2016 and I don't expect the Chairwoman to circulate 
such a proposal.

    Question 37. At your third nomination hearing, you testified that 
``the FCC doesn't have jurisdiction over Google.'' I am concerned that 
this suggests you are unaware of many of the FCC's activities. Are you 
aware that the FCC issues FCC Registration Numbers (FRNs) to each of 
its regulatees?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 38. Are you aware that Google now holds 12 FRNs?
    Answer. I was not aware of the number of FRN's Google holds, but I 
am not surprised.

    Question 39. Are you aware that the FCC requires certain regulatees 
to register with USAC and file a Form 499?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 40. Are you aware that Google has registered and filed the 
Form 499 for 4 separate entities (including for Google Voice, Google 
Hangouts, and Google Fiber Phone)?
    Answer. I was not aware of how many Form 499s Google has filed, but 
I am not surprised.

    Question 41. Are you aware that the FCC requires companies to 
acquire a license before transmitting on certain radio frequencies?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 42. Are you aware that Google appears to hold 44 active 
spectrum licenses?
    Answer. I knew Google held spectrum licenses, although I did not 
know how many.

    Question 43. Are you aware that the FCC requires entities to apply 
for an experimental license before transmitting in certain 
circumstances?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 44. Are you aware that Google has applied for 108 
experimental licenses since 2011?
    Answer. I assumed that Google has applied for/held experimental 
licenses, but I did not know how many.

    Question 45. Are you aware that the FCC regulates wireless devices, 
like cellphones, and requires them to follow Federal rules before they 
may be imported into or marketed in the United States?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 46. Are you aware that Google offers phones, like the 
Google Pixel, that must comply with these rules?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 47. Are you aware that the FCC regulates undersea cables 
under the Cable Landing License Act?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 48. Are you aware that Google has repeatedly applied for 
and received a license to land undersea cables in the United States 
through its wholly owned affiliate GU Holdings?
    Answer. I was not aware.

    Question 49. Are you aware that the FCC requires broadband 
providers to file certain deployment information with the Commission 
under the Broadband DATA Act?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 50. Are you aware that Google Fiber is required to file 
such data?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 51. Are you aware that the FCC's Internet Freedom 
transparency rule requires an Internet service provider to publicly 
disclose information about its network management practices, 
performance characteristics, and commercial terms?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 52. Are you aware that Google Fiber is subject to this 
rule?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 53. Are you aware that the FCC has an electronic comment 
filing system that provides access for regulatees and the public to 
file comments and ex partes in FCC proceedings?
    Answer. Yes.

    Question 54. Are you aware that Google has, on its own or in 
conjunction with others, apparently filed 1,291 comments or ex partes 
at the FCC since 2006?
    Answer. I know that Google has been an active participant in FCC 
proceedings, but I did not know how many filings it has made.

    Question 55. Do you wish to retract or modify your statement that 
``the FCC doesn't have jurisdiction over Google''?
    Answer. When I made the statement ``the FCC doesn't have 
jurisdiction over Google,'' I was responding to Senator Schmitt, who 
was attempting to make the case that I am closely aligned with Google 
and other ``Big Tech'' companies, despite my clear record of 
criticizing them for acting anticompetitively, violating consumer 
privacy and generally being too powerful. He said, in part:

        ``For example, Google censored Republican fundraising efforts 
        and e-mail platforms. Google owned YouTube removed videos 
        created by the Conservative Political Action Conference. Google 
        altered search engine results related to an interview on the 
        Joe Rogan podcast. In my previous job as AG, we filed a 
        landmark lawsuit that exposed a lot of this that's been 
        amplified by the Twitter files and then subject of a lot of the 
        hearings that are happening over at the House.''

    Senator Schmitt was quite clearly talking about Google's online 
services and content, e.g., its search engine, You Tube, Gmail, etc. It 
was in that context that I said that ``the FCC doesn't have 
jurisdiction over Google,'' because it does not have jurisdiction over 
Google's online services and content.
    I would be happy to modify my statement to say that ``the FCC 
doesn't have jurisdiction over Google's online services and content.''

    Question 56. At your third nomination hearing, you testified that 
``the FCC doesn't have jurisdiction over Fox News.'' Yet, minutes 
later, you explained that ``the de-platforming of Newsmax and OAN'' is 
an ``issue that is right in the FCC's wheelhouse'' and ``it's something 
that the FCC should investigate.'' Given your statement that the de-
platforming of Newsmax and OAN is ``something that the FCC should 
investigate,'' is it fair to say that you are aware that the FCC has 
jurisdiction--including investigatory powers--over matters involving 
the carriage of cable programming networks, such as Fox News?
    Answer. Pursuant to 47 USC Sec. 536, The FCC's program carriage 
rules prohibit multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), 
like cable systems and satellite providers, from engaging in certain 
anticompetitive practices with regard to video programmers like Fox 
News, Newsmax and OAN. Thus, when the FCC investigates whether the 
program carriage rules are violated, it is doing so pursuant to its 
jurisdiction over MVPDs, not jurisdiction over video programmers like 
Fox News. Newsmax, OAN, and Fox News can file program access complaints 
at the FCC, but that doesn't make them subject to the FCC's 
jurisdiction.

    Question 57. Are you aware that Fox News is subject to ongoing FCC 
regulation regarding consumer accessibility (e.g., closed captioning 
and audio description), emergency alerts, and commercial loudness?
    Answer. None of these regulations apply to cable networks like Fox 
News. Closed captioning, emergency alerts and commercial loudness apply 
to broadcasters, cable systems, satellite systems and other MVPDs. 
Audio description applies only to MVPDs and to television station 
licensees that are the largest network affiliates in the 80 largest 
markets.

    Question 58. Are you aware that the Fox News Channel cable network 
is just one asset owned by Fox Corporation, which also owns the Fox 
Broadcasting Company and local FOX television stations, among other 
media outlets? Are you aware that these entities are regulated by the 
FCC?
    Answer. I am aware that Fox Corporation owns Fox News Channel as 
well as Fox Broadcasting Company, the latter of which is regulated by 
the FCC. As former Fox lobbyist Preston Padden told this Committee in a 
letter dated January 30, 2023, ``because Ms. Sohn fights for underdogs 
(which Fox certainly was in its early days), and because she saw the 
pro-consumer benefits of a fourth network, she was very helpful to our 
efforts to fend off fierce lobbying attacks from the three established 
networks and to secure the waivers that we needed.''

    Question 59. Do you wish to retract or modify your statement that 
``the FCC doesn't have jurisdiction over Fox News''?
    Answer. No.

    Question 60. You have offered evasive and conflicting statements 
regarding whether you support regulating the rates charged for 
broadband Internet access service. For instance, you have stated that 
the FCC should have the authority to require an ISP to provide a low-
cost broadband service to low-income families \2\ while simultaneously 
stating--both at your first two hearings and in questions for the 
record--that you do not think the FCC should set rates for broadband. 
For purposes of transparency, I'd like you to clarify what you meant by 
your previous statements that you oppose broadband rate regulation. 
Clarity is especially important since there are many ways the FCC could 
attempt to regulate rates beyond setting broadband rates on an ex ante 
basis. Please define what you meant by broadband rate regulation when 
you made your previous statements opposing broadband rate regulation. 
To better understand your interpretation of what counts as broadband 
rate regulation and the forms of rate regulation you would support or 
oppose, please provide yes/no responses to the following questions: Is 
your definition of broadband rate regulation limited to ex ante rate 
setting, or do you also consider ex post review of providers' broadband 
prices a form of rate regulation?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. I cannot answer that question in the absence of specific 
facts and a full record. I cannot say unequivocally that I would or 
would not consider a certain regulation ``rate regulation'' simply 
because it is ex ante or ex post.

    Question 61. Yes or no: Would FCC declaring a broadband provider's 
rate unlawful on the grounds that it is not ``just'' or ``reasonable'' 
constitute a form of rate regulation?
    Answer. I cannot answer that question in the absence of specific 
facts. If I am confirmed and such an issue would come before the 
Commission, I would look at the totality of the record and the law and 
come to a conclusion with input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow 
Commissioners, and the members of this Committee.

    Question 62. Yes or no: Is the 2015 net neutrality order's mandate 
that broadband service providers provide free terminating access to 
edge providers a form of rate regulation?
    Answer. I cannot answer that question in the absence of specific 
facts. If I am confirmed and such an issue would come before the 
Commission, I would look at the totality of the record and the law and 
come to a conclusion with input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow 
Commissioners, and the members of this Committee.

    Question 63. Yes or no: If the FCC were to prohibit ``zero-rating'' 
by broadband providers, would that be a form of rate regulation? Please 
also indicate if you would support such a prohibition.
    Answer. I cannot answer that question in the absence of specific 
facts. If I am confirmed and such an issue would come before the 
Commission, I would look at the totality of the record and the law and 
come to a conclusion with input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow 
Commissioners, and the members of this Committee.

    Question 64. Yes or no: If the FCC were to prohibit broadband data 
caps, would that be a form of rate regulation? Please also indicate if 
you would support such a prohibition.
    Answer. I cannot answer that question in the absence of specific 
facts. If I am confirmed and such an issue would come before the 
Commission, I would look at the totality of the record and the law and 
come to a conclusion with input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow 
Commissioners, and the members of this Committee.

    Question 65. Yes or no: If the FCC were to require broadband 
providers to provide ``wholesale'' unbundled access to their networks, 
would that be a form of rate regulation?
    Answer. I cannot answer that question in the absence of specific 
facts. If I am confirmed and such an issue would come before the 
Commission, I would look at the totality of the record and the law and 
come to a conclusion with input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow 
Commissioners, and the members of this Committee.

    Question 66. Yes or no: Do you support requiring broadband 
providers to provide wholesale unbundled access to their competitors?
    Answer. I cannot answer that question in the absence of specific 
facts. If I am confirmed and such an issue would come before the 
Commission, I would look at the totality of the record and the law and 
come to a conclusion with input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow 
Commissioners, and the members of this Committee.

    Question 67. In 2020 California implemented a new rule precluding 
companies participating in the state's Lifeline program from charging 
low-income customers a co-pay for certain subsidized plans. Yes or no: 
Do you consider the prohibition on a co-pay in this context to be a 
form of rate regulation?
    Answer. I am not familiar with the referenced California rule, so I 
am unable to provide an opinion.

    Question 68. Yes or no: If the FCC were to require broadband 
providers to offer a specific cost tier, such as a low-income offering, 
would that be a form of rate regulation? Please also indicate if you 
would support such a requirement, and if so, how do you determine what 
a ``low-income'' price is without setting a rate.
    Answer. As I responded to Senator Scott in the Questions for the 
Record from my February 2022 hearing and to questions at my two 
previous hearings, I do not think that the FCC should set rates for 
broadband--it is something that the agency has tried in the past with 
respect to cable and it was not successful. However, I do believe that 
the FCC should have the authority to require an ISP to provide a low-
cost broadband service to low-income individuals and families, 
particularly if those ISPs obtain funding from the Federal government. 
It is well established that the Federal government can require public 
benefits in exchange for public funding. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 
(1991). What I have not called for is for the FCC to set the rates for 
those low-cost tiers. If the Commission were to explore this issue, I 
would look at the totality of the record and the law and come to a 
conclusion with input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow 
Commissioners, and the members of this Committee.

    Question 69. In response to Senator Thune, you said at the hearing 
that if Congress were to adopt bright line net neutrality rules--i.e., 
a ban on blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization--that you would 
find it to be inadequate for addressing net neutrality because you 
believe the FCC also needs to have general FCC oversight over 
broadband. Under your scheme, is there a limiting principle when it 
comes to the FCC's authority over broadband? If so, please explain it.
    Answer. What I have said at all of my hearings is that I support 
Congressional efforts to give the FCC specific oversight authority over 
broadband and specific authority to adopt net neutrality rules. I 
believe that, in doing so, Congress ought to debate the limits of that 
authority, but that it should not leave the FCC without such authority.
    The 2015 Open Internet rules, which I supported, placed very strict 
limits on the FCC's authority over broadband, forbearing from the vast 
majority of Title II of the Communications Act. Should the Chairwoman 
undertake such a proceeding again, I would look at the law and the 
totality of the record and come to a conclusion with input from 
stakeholders, my staff, my fellow Commissioners and members of this 
Committee, about the proper scope of FCC authority.

    Question 70. When asked about what harms resulted from the repeal 
of the 2015 Title II order, you have repeatedly cited the throttling of 
Santa Clara firefighters during the Mendocino complex fire. This claim 
has been widely debunked: Verizon's conduct wasn't prohibited by the 
2015 rules, and you even stated in QFRs last year that the problem 
wasn't so much the lack of net neutrality rules but the ``FCC's lack of 
oversight of broadband.'' Under what specific part of the 2015 rules 
would the FCC have had authority to seek recourse against Verizon?
    Answer. As I said in my December 8, 2021 Questions for the Record 
in response to a question from Senator Lee, the repeal of the 2015 Open 
Internet Order, including the FCC's relinquishment of its oversight 
over broadband, impacted the Santa Clara County Fire Department because 
the Fire Department had no recourse when its broadband was throttled. 
Indeed, it was a seven-month dispute over a data plan that impacted the 
Fire Department's ability to communicate with other public safety 
entities and the public. But the Fire Department had no government 
entity that it could turn to for a resolution of the dispute. Indeed, 
neither the FCC nor the FTC publicly offered its help to resolve the 
matter after it became national news. The FCC's lack of oversight of 
broadband was more the cause for this situation than the lack of bright 
line net neutrality rules.
    While I did surmise that the general conduct standard might have 
been a tool to resolve this matter, I have been critical of the general 
conduct standard in the past. In an October 2020 paper, I stated that 
the general conduct standard was ``too vague and complicated'' and 
urged that it be replaced with a simple ``unreasonable discrimination'' 
standard similar to that adopted by the FCC in 2011.

    Question 71. You have previously stated that the 2015 Title II 
order did not go far enough. Please specify the ways in which you would 
have gone further than the 2015 rules. You testified that your vote is 
needed at the FCC to reform the Universal Service Fund (``USF''). 
Please detail with specificity how you would propose to reform USF.
    Answer. I supported the 2015 Open Internet Order in its entirety. 
In an October 2020 academic paper, I said the FCC should reinstate its 
authority to oversee the broadband market, and if it did so, then it 
should not forbear from two provisions that it had previously, Sections 
251(c)(3) (unbundling) and 254 (universal service). But that was over 
two years ago, and my positions are always evolving because of changes 
in technology, how consumers use the Internet, and business practices. 
Regardless, whatever I said in an academic paper would have no bearing 
on any future proceeding the Chairwoman might start and, if I am 
confirmed, I would look at the totality of the record and the law and 
come to a conclusion with input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow 
Commissioners, and the members of this Committee.
    I do not have an exact prescription for reforming the Universal 
Service Fund. I testified at my December 2021 hearing that the 
contribution mechanism should be fixed and I also said then that I was 
open to any and all solutions.

    Question 72. Section 60506 of the IIJA mandates that the FCC issue 
rules by November 15, 2023 to ``facilitate equal access to broadband 
Internet access service, taking into account the issues of technical 
and economic feasibility presented by that objective, including. . 
.preventing digital discrimination of access based on income level, 
race, ethnicity, color, religion, or national origin.'' Notably, the 
statute defines ``equal access'' to mean the ``equal opportunity to 
subscribe to an offered service that provides comparable speeds, 
capacities, latency, and other quality of service metrics in a given 
area, for comparable terms and conditions.'' Despite the narrow 
statutory role carved out for the FCC here, some have raised the 
concern that a far-left FCC could attempt to use this language to 
exercise unprecedented authority over the broadband market--even beyond 
the 2015 Title II rules. In a recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the 
FCC floated using the provision to impose broadband rate regulation and 
interrogate providers' business practices under a ``disparate impact'' 
standard. The Commission is also considering both adopting a private 
right of action and enabling state attorneys general to bring lawsuits 
to enforce the law. Given that the statute only speaks of ``terms and 
conditions'' but omits mention of ``rates,'' do you think section 60506 
gives the FCC authority to regulate or review rates charged by 
broadband service providers, either on an ex ante or ex post basis?
    Answer. The Commission has opened the required rulemaking 
proceeding regarding digital discrimination. If confirmed, I would look 
at the totality of the record and the law and come to a conclusion with 
input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the 
members of this Committee.

    Question 73. Given that the statute refers to ``equal opportunity'' 
not ``equal outcome,'' do you think section 60506 gives the FCC 
authority to use a disparate impact standard to measure digital 
discrimination rather than a disparate treatment standard?
    Answer. The Commission has opened the required rulemaking 
proceeding regarding digital discrimination. If confirmed, I would look 
at the totality of the record and the law and come to a conclusion with 
input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the 
members of this Committee.

    Question 74. Given that the statute defines equal access to only 
mean ``equal opportunity to subscribe to an offered service . . . in a 
given area,'' do you think that section 60506 gives the FCC authority 
to review the deployment decisions of broadband Internet access service 
providers?
    Answer. The Commission has opened the required rulemaking 
proceeding regarding digital discrimination. If confirmed, I would look 
at the totality of the record and the law and come to a conclusion with 
input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the 
members of this Committee.

    Question 75. Do you think section 60506 gives the FCC the authority 
to create a private right of action to enforce FCC rules?
    Answer. The Commission has opened the required rulemaking 
proceeding regarding digital discrimination. If confirmed, I would look 
at the totality of the record and the law and come to a conclusion with 
input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the 
members of this Committee.

    Question 76. Do you think section 60506 gives the FCC the authority 
to authorize state and local enforcement of its rules?
    Answer. The Commission has opened the required rulemaking 
proceeding regarding digital discrimination. If confirmed, I would look 
at the totality of the record and the law and come to a conclusion with 
input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the 
members of this Committee.

    Question 77. Do you think section 60506 gives the FCC jurisdiction 
over other parts of the digital marketplace, such as Internet content, 
apps, and devices?
    Answer. The Commission has opened the required rulemaking 
proceeding regarding digital discrimination. If confirmed, I would look 
at the totality of the record and the law and come to a conclusion with 
input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the 
members of this Committee.

    Question 78. Do you think section 60506 gives the FCC authority to 
create new subsidy programs for devices like laptops, tablets, and 
smartphones?
    Answer. The Commission has opened the required rulemaking 
proceeding regarding digital discrimination. If confirmed, I would look 
at the totality of the record and the law and come to a conclusion with 
input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow Commissioners, and the 
members of this Committee.

    Question 79. You testified that the opposition to your nomination 
is due to ``regulated entities'' that oppose you. As discussed during 
your hearing, multiple law enforcement organizations oppose your 
nomination. Yes or no: do you believe these law enforcement 
organizations are surrogates for ``regulated entities''?
    Answer. I do not know what has motivated these organizations, 
particularly because the issues on which they oppose me (EFF's support 
of end-to-end encryption and Edward Snowden's behavior) are not issues 
within the FCC's jurisdiction and are also not issues that I have 
spoken about publicly. Jim Pasco, the Executive Director of the 
Fraternal Order of Police, admitted that encryption is not within the 
FCC's authority when he told NBC News that ``if the FCC had a role 
[with regard to encryption], we would certainly be alarmed if she was 
part of that role.'' \3\

    Question 80. The Coalition of Large Tribes has said that in their 
personal interactions with you while you were at the FCC, ``[s]he 
offended many of us with her abrupt and disrespectful approach 
responding to criticism of Tribal representatives trying to raise 
concerns in FCC consultations. Quite frankly, her behavioral toward 
Tribal leaders was unacceptable.'' Do you believe these concerns are 
disingenuous?
    Answer. This accusation lacks specifics and appears to have no 
grounding in fact. I have no recollection of ever participating in a 
tribal consultation when I was at the FCC.
    In any event, two of COLT's members have publicly supported my 
confirmation: the Navajo Nation and the Northern Arapahoe Tribe. I was 
told that those organizations did not participate in the decision to 
send this letter because they had already publicly supported me. 
Similarly, the Chairman of COLT, who is the President of member Oglala 
Sioux Tribe, did not participate in the decision because we know each 
other as Open Society Foundation Leadership in Government Fellows. I do 
not know whether the Ft. Belnap Indian Community, which has publicly 
opposed me, participated in the decision.

    Question 81. You testified that you are baffled by law 
enforcement's strong opposition to your nomination because ``it is 
nothing I would really ever deal with at the FCC.'' Even putting aside 
online activity on defunding the police and retweeting a tweet that 
called Federal law enforcement officers ``armed goons in riot gear with 
tear gas,'' do you acknowledge that FCC rules directly intersect with 
the role of law enforcement in several key areas, including (1) CALEA 
regulations, which enable law enforcement to conduct lawful 
interception of communications over broadband and telephone networks, 
(2) Next Generation and Enhanced 911 calling, for which the FCC 
continues to develop rules to ensure that public safety can keep pace 
with technological developments, and (3) an increasing FCC role in 
ensuring the cybersecurity of communications networks, including 
coordination with law enforcement agencies?
    Answer. When I said that ``it is nothing I would really ever deal 
with at the FCC,'' I was referring to the substantive issues that the 
law enforcement organizations have raised as reasons for opposing me, 
that is, EFF's support for end-to-end encryption and Edward Snowden's 
leak of classified materials. Neither of these are issues within the 
FCC's jurisdiction and are also not issues that I have spoken about 
publicly. Jim Pasco, the Executive Director of the Fraternal Order of 
Police, admitted that encryption is not within the FCC's authority when 
he told NBC News that ``if the FCC had a role [with regard to 
encryption], we would certainly be alarmed if she was part of that 
role.'' \4\ Moreover, I don't agree with every position EFF takes, and 
there are some issues that it works on that are not in my areas of 
interest. In any event, the Board does not make policy for the 
organization.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The law enforcement organizations did not say anything about my 
active participation in the public safety issues over which the FCC 
does have jurisdiction, like Next Generation 911, text-to-911, network 
resiliency and unimpeded public safety access to communications 
networks. For those issues, I have the support of former FCC Public 
Safety and Homeland Security Bureau Chiefs and NENA: the 911 
Association.
    As I testified at my last hearing--I made no statements of my own 
in the handful of tweets highlighted by the Fraternal Order of Police. 
They were mostly likes and retweets of others protesting police 
brutality, militarization of the police, and unfair treatment of 
peaceful protestors made around the time of George Floyd's killing. The 
two that mentioned ``defunding the police'' were explanations of the 
term, not an exhortation, and as I testified, I don't agree with the 
sentiment. The tweets also referred to specific instances of abuse--I 
don't believe that all law enforcement should be blamed for the bad 
actions of others. I have worked--and continue to work--with law 
enforcement in my work and my personal capacity.

    Question 82. Please describe with particularity the process by 
which you answered these questions for the record, including 
identifying who assisted you in answering these questions along with a 
brief description of their assistance.
    Answer. I answered these questions using transcripts and Questions 
for the Record from my previous two hearings. For those questions 
requiring answers on policy, I researched them myself. Lori Maarbjerg 
of the FCC assisted me with these questions--reviewing my answers, 
editing them for clarity, and formatting the document.
                                 ______
                                 
     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to 
                              Gigi B. Sohn
    Question 1. In your recent nomination hearing, when asked about the 
Inspector General's 2016 report regarding your role in the leaking of 
information to reporters, you testified that: ``The only reason I was 
asked to call Politico was because the meeting kept getting delayed and 
delayed and delayed. And we were just getting inundated with calls.'' 
That testimony is false, correct?

    Question 2. The Inspector General's 2016 report found that you 
called a reporter at Politico at 10:13 am, which was before the 
scheduled 10:30 am start time of the FCC meeting. Your testimony that 
you only called the reporter ``because the meeting kept getting 
delayed'' is not true, correct?

    Question 3. In fact, the Inspector General's 2016 report 
specifically stated that you called the reporter to inform her ``that 
there was a compromise on Lifeline, including the fact that there would 
be an annual cap on the amount of money available in the Lifeline 
program,'' among at least one other purpose. So, contrary to your 
testimony, the evidence shows that you did not call the reporter only 
``because the meeting kept getting delayed and delayed and delayed,'' 
correct?
    Answer to Questions 1-3. Given that all three of your questions are 
asking the same thing, I have chosen to consolidate my answer. I don't 
agree that my testimony was false. To the extent that you would like to 
quibble with the words that I used, perhaps I shouldn't have said 
``only'' when I chose to clarify why I was asked to call the Politico 
reporter, although as you note, I also said ``we were just getting 
inundated with calls.'' As noted in the Office of Inspector General 
memo regarding the matter, I was asked to contact the Politico reporter 
because the Office of Media Relations was getting inundated with calls 
from reporters, the meeting was being delayed to 12:00 PM, and the 
Chairman authorized the disclosure of certain facts regarding the 
situation in order to provide the context for the delay of the meeting. 
My recollection of the event was that there were multiple delays and, 
as noted in the OIG memo, the meeting began at approximately 2:00 PM. 
So while I was not as precise as I should have been in saying that when 
I made the 10:13 phone call the meeting ``kept getting delayed and 
delayed and delayed,'' it already had been delayed once and it would be 
delayed at least several times more afterwards.
    However, I believe that it is important to note two additional 
things that are contrary to the assertions that you made at the hearing 
which directly relate to the specific concerns that you had back in 
2016. First, as the Office of Inspector General found, there was no 
``leak'' of nonpublic information because the Chairman's authorization 
to disclose the information made it public information. Second, the 
Office of Inspector General specifically concluded that ``we found no 
evidence that the information was provided to the press in an attempt 
to unduly influence the outcome of the vote.'' \5\

                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roger Wicker to 
                              Gigi B. Sohn
    Question 1. Ms. Sohn, can you explain why you cannot be viewed as 
impartial on proceeding concerning retransmission consent or television 
broadcast copyright issues?
    Answer. I have not said that I ``cannot be viewed as impartial'' in 
proceedings concerning retransmission consent or television broadcast 
copyright issues. I voluntarily recused myself from those issues for 
portions of my term, if I am confirmed, ``to avoid any appearance of 
impropriety and in the interest of ensuring that the public has full 
confidence that policymakers will make decisions free of bias.'' I did 
so to address specific concerns from a number of Committee members 
about my membership on the Sports Fans Coalition New York, Inc. (SFCNY) 
Board, which oversaw Locast's operations.

    Question 2. Ms. Sohn, as you are likely aware, we have 4 new 
members on this committee. In the updated questionnaire you submitted 
to the committee, you failed to mention your voluntary recusal as a 
conflict of interest. Do you agree this omission, whether intentional 
or careless, misleads our new members of an issue that is a serious 
concern regarding your nomination?
    Answer. No, I do not agree. I have never claimed, nor did the FCC's 
ethics officials determine that my membership on the SFCNY Board 
presented a conflict of interest. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(a) defines a 
conflict of interest as one where a person has a ``financial interest 
directly and predictably affected by [a] matter.'' Neither my 
membership on the SFCNY Board nor my recusal involves any financial 
interest. Moreover, neither the Office of Government Ethics nor the 
FCC's Office of the General Counsel believe my involvement with Locast 
creates a conflict of interest.
    In any event, it appears that the voluntary recusal was already 
known to at least some of the new members of the Committee prior to my 
hearing. When I met with Senator Budd on February 10, he asked me 
questions about the scope of my recusal agreement.

    Question 3. During your last nomination hearing, you stated that 
you were unable to answer questions concerning the Locast settlement 
because you were bound by a confidentiality agreement. You stated that 
``If asked by the media or press about the agreement,'' you ``may only 
state that the litigation is over and refer the person inquiring to the 
order.'' Again, you were not prohibited from answering questions before 
the Commerce Committee. But in your written responses to Questions for 
the Record submitted to you by members of the committee, you did not 
adhere to the language outlined in the confidentiality agreement. Can 
you explain why you failed to comply with the agreement?
    Answer. During my last nomination hearing, I stated that I was 
unable to answer questions concerning the confidential Locast 
settlement agreement in writing, in the Questions for the Record from 
the first hearing. That is because the confidentiality provision of the 
Settlement Agreement says that:

        ``No Party will communicate or authorize anyone to contact or 
        communicate with the media or press (orally, in writing, or 
        otherwise) concerning the Agreement or the Order, or issue any 
        press release or other written statement disclosing the terms 
        of the Agreement. If asked by the media or press about the 
        Agreement, a Party or its counsel may only state that ``The 
        litigation is over' and refer the person inquiring to the 
        Order.'' [emphasis mine]

    As advised by counsel, I was prohibited by the terms of the 
Settlement Agreement from issuing to the media or to anyone else any 
``other written statement disclosing the terms of the Agreement.'' That 
clause is not limited only to the press. Therefore, in response to the 
written questions I received from the Committee, I could not disclose 
the terms of the Agreement.
    Moreover, neither you nor Senator Sullivan ever asked me for the 
specifics of the Settlement Agreement. Had that been the case, I would 
have said in writing ``the litigation is over.'' Instead, you asked me 
where the money for the settlement was going to come from, and I 
answered honestly, ``[t] he settlement funds come from amounts 
collected to fund SFCNY operations after SFCNY pays its vendors.''
    You and Senator Blunt asked me for a copy of the Settlement 
Agreement, and I referred you to the parties to the litigation for that 
document. Again, you did not ask me to divulge the terms of the 
Agreement.

    Question 4. On December 22, I sent a bi-partisan letter to 
Chairwoman Rosenworcel and Assistant Secretary Davidson of the FCC and 
NTIA. The letter asked for the challenge period to submit location and 
availability challenges to the FCC's broadband maps to be extended. 
Congress directed the FCC and NTIA to improve the broadband maps to 
identify served and underserved areas.

    a. Ms. Sohn, would you explain the important role the FCC National 
Broadband Map will serve to expand high-speed Internet access to 
Americans?
    Answer. The FCC's National Broadband map is critically important, 
as it will determine how the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity Access and 
Deployment (BEAD) funding will be allocated to each of the states. If 
the map is inaccurate, certain states will lose money they need and 
deserve to ensure all of their residents have broadband access, while 
others will be unjustly enriched.

    b. Do you agree that extending the challenge process would allow 
for more challenges to be submitted and lead to a more accurate 
broadband map?
    Answer. Extending the challenge process for the preliminary map 
would allow for more challenges to be submitted. Whether it would lead 
to a more accurate broadband map would depend on how long the extension 
is.

    c. Do you agree with the FCC's decision to not extend the FCC 
National Broadband Map challenge process?
    Answer. The FCC is trying to strike a balance. On the one hand, 
states are understandably unhappy about the short time period that they 
received to make challenges and that the FCC's rules favor broadband 
providers in the event of a dispute. On the other hand, the areas that 
the BEAD program will fund are already way behind, so there is a 
countervailing desire to provide the states with the BEAD money as soon 
as possible. Unless NTIA extends its date for allocating the BEAD funds 
to the states, the FCC's hands are tied.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn to 
                              Gigi B. Sohn
    Question 1. You founded Public Knowledge and have also been 
associated with other groups, including the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation, which have received hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in donations from Big Tech companies and groups 
that represent them. For example, Public Knowledge, which you founded, 
has taken substantial sums of money from Google, Amazon, Facebook, and 
Apple. Several Big Tech-affiliated groups have also publicly endorsed 
your nomination for Commissioner. I am very interested in your 
association with some of these companies.

    a. Have you ever worked on projects on behalf of Big Tech companies 
or their associations or coordinated on efforts with them?
    Answer. I have never worked on projects specifically because they 
would benefit big tech companies. When their interests aligned with 
Public Knowledge's, we did work together. Over the past five years, as 
the companies have grown bigger and more powerful, our interest have 
aligned much less, and other than agreeing that the FCC has no 
authority to interpret Section 230 of the Communications Act, I can't 
think of anything we've worked on together since then.

    b. Since you left the FCC, have you taken any money from Big Tech 
companies or their associations to fund your work?
    Answer. No.

    c. Do any of the Big Tech companies provide funding to the Benton 
Foundation, where you are currently employed as a fellow?
    Answer. To be clear, I am not an ``employee'' of the Benton 
Institute for Broadband and Society. I am a consultant with the title 
Senior Fellow and Public Advocate. It is my understanding that Benton 
received a one-time contribution from Google Fiber for its 40th 
anniversary celebrations in Chicago and Washington, DC in 2022.

    Question 2. In 2016, while you were an employee at the FCC, the 
agency's Inspector General cited you in a report stating that you 
leaked non-public information about a deal the agency was working on to 
Politico. You stated at your hearing that this leak was authorized by 
former Chairman Wheeler.

    a. In your nomination questionnaire, this report is not mentioned. 
In fact, when asked if you have ever been ``cited for a breach of 
ethics,'' you answered ``no.'' Did you disclose this report to the 
Committee when you were vetted for this role?
    Answer. To be clear, I did not ``leak'' non-public information. The 
Inspector General found that when Chairman Wheeler authorized me to 
tell Politico that there was a compromise with a cap on Lifeline, that 
information became public. I was not ``cited for a breach of ethics,'' 
the Office of Inspector General found no wrongdoing on anybody's part 
in the incident. Therefore, there was no reason for me to mention this 
report, which has been public for over 6 years.

    b. Did you disclose this report to the White House?
    Answer. I don't recall what question the White House would have 
asked that would have required me to disclose it, but since I wasn't 
``cited for a breach of ethics,'' did not have a complaint filed 
against me, and was not found to have committed any wrongdoing, I don't 
know why I would have disclosed it to the White House.

    c. You would obtain a high-level security clearance if confirmed to 
be a Commissioner. Do you disagree that leaking non-confidential 
government information--especially for strategic purposes--raises 
ethical concerns and concerns about your fitness to hold such 
clearances?
    Answer. I did not ``leak'' information of any kind. Chairman 
Wheeler authorized me to tell Politico that there was a compromise with 
a cap on Lifeline, and once he did, that information became public. 
Given the facts of the situation, I do not believe that there are any 
ethical concerns about my fitness to hold any security clearances.
                                 ______
                                 
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito to 

                              Gigi B. Sohn
    Question 1. In 2020--you said in testimony before the House: 
``While policymakers have focused disproportionately on broadband 
deployment in rural areas of the United States--Americans who live in 
cities also face enormous challenges to broadband connectivity''--And--
``The country's broadband adoption problem is three times higher in 
urban areas than rural.'' For the more than 30 percent of West 
Virginians who lack access to broadband connectivity--do they have a 
broadband adoption problem or a broadband deployment problem? Can 
people adopt what has not yet been deployed?
    Answer. As I write this, I am sitting in Davis, West Virginia, and 
I have felt firsthand the deployment problem in the state. I do not 
know what West Virginians adoption problem is, because the FCC does not 
collect that kind of data, although I believe it should. Regardless, my 
testimony has been taken out of context to make it sound like I do not 
support more deployment of rural broadband. Nothing can be farther from 
the truth. In my last public speech, to the Association of Public and 
Land Grant Universities, I criticized the Federal government for not 
doing enough to ensure that rural America is served with robust and 
affordable broadband. And I have been critical of carriers who have 
taken billions of taxpayer dollars and then don't build what they have 
promised. I have support from President Trump's and President George W. 
Bush's Rural Utilities Service Administrators, as well as NTCA--Rural 
Broadband Association, the Rural Wireless Association and WTA: 
Advocates for Rural Broadband.
    Just this week, I met with the Speaker of the West Virginia House 
of Delegates and the Chair of the Technology and Infrastructure 
Committee of the House of Delegates to talk about how we might work 
together to ensure that West Virginia receives the benefits of 
broadband the state so richly deserves.

    Question 2. Ms. Sohn, I understand that the FCC is not the primary 
agency involved in NEPA permitting--but as a larger philosophical 
question--if the goal is deploying broadband as quickly as possible to 
all Americans--why not provide a categorical exclusion from NEPA for 
all broadband projects?
    Answer. I would need to know a lot more about NEPA permitting for 
me to answer this question intelligently. If I am confirmed, I look 
forward to working with you on this issue.

    Question 3. Ms. Sohn, how do we speed up deployment in my state of 
West Virginia to hit 100 percent served?
    Answer. As I said I my December 8, 2021 Questions for the Record, 
we need a coordinated and cooperative approach among federal, state, 
and local officials and interests to ensure that every West Virginian 
has the ability to access a robust, scalable, broadband network and the 
means to purchase that service, which is so critical to meeting their 
daily needs. If confirmed, I am committed to working with federal, 
state, and local partners to meet West Virginia's needs.

    Question 4. Ms. Sohn, what can the FCC do to ensure Universal 
Service Fund support recipients are qualified and deserving of the 
funding they receive?
    Answer. As I said in my December 8, 2021 Questions for the Record, 
in my opinion the FCC must take four steps to ensure that recipients of 
USF support are qualified and deserving of the funding they receive. 
First, the FCC must conduct serious due diligence to ensure that 
possible recipients have the technical, operational, and financial 
expertise to build the promised networks. Second, the FCC must conduct 
oversight to ensure that the promised networks are being built. This 
includes not only requiring progress reports from the recipients, but 
actually visiting the sites where networks are being built. Third, the 
FCC must hold those who do not build promised networks accountable. 
This accountability must include more than fines--it must include 
requiring a defaulting entity to remit the USF funds and prohibiting 
that entity from participating in the next round of funding. Fourth, 
the FCC must coordinate with NTIA, USDA, and other agencies that fund 
broadband to ensure that the programs are complementary, consistent 
with the law, and to direct funding to appropriate areas without 
unnecessary duplication.

    Question 5. Ms. Sohn, Big tech makes a lot of money off advertising 
over broadband networks. What are your thought on requiring them to 
help pay for the deployment of high-speed broadband?
    Answer. As I said in my December 8, 2021 Questions for the Record, 
I agree that the USF contribution mechanism needs reform. Now that the 
Commission has completed the report to Congress required by Section 
60104 of the IIJA to evaluate how the funds in the infrastructure bill 
impacts the USF debate can start on how to move forward--whether it is 
in the Congress or at the Commission--to determine the appropriate 
solution, but all options should be on the table. Some of those 
options, including requiring Big Tech to pay into the universal service 
fund, would necessitate Congressional action to give the FCC the 
authority to require them to pay.

    Question 6. Ms. Sohn, what are your thoughts on expanding the USF 
contribution pool to all broadband providers?
    Answer. I agree that the USF contribution mechanism needs reform. 
Now that the Commission has completed the report to Congress required 
by Section 60104 of the IIJA to evaluate how the funds in the 
infrastructure bill impacts the USF, debate can start on how to move 
forward--whether it is in the Congress or at the Commission--to 
determine the appropriate solution, but all options should be on the 
table, including expanding the USF contribution pool to all broadband 
providers.

    Question 7. Ms. Sohn, what price point do you consider Internet to 
be affordable?
    Answer. I don't have an answer to that question. To the extent that 
the Chairwoman starts a proceeding that requires that question to be 
answered, I would look at the law and the totality of the record and 
make a decision, with input from stakeholders, my staff, my fellow 
Commissioners and members of this Committee.

    Question 8. Ms. Sohn, what are your thoughts on the progress of 
updating the FCC broadband maps? How do we keep them up to date?
    Answer. Progress is being made, but I understand it is taking 
longer than many state officials, including West Virginia state 
officials, would prefer. If I am confirmed I would work with the 
Chairwoman and the states to find creative ways to improve the maps 
before the BEAD allocations are made at the end of June and also going 
forward.
    One way to improve the maps are to make sure that the FCC has the 
ability to verify coverage and hold carriers accountable when they 
overstate coverage. There have been no fewer than three news articles 
\6\ in the past few weeks of carriers purposefully overstating their 
coverage. The FCC needs a full slate of Commissioners to deter conduct 
like this in the future.

    Question 9. Ms. Sohn, unlicensed and shared spectrum is crucial to 
advancing innovation and entrepreneurship. What's next from your 
perspective in supporting innovation in unlicensed and shared bands?
    Answer. Unlicensed and shared spectrum access have been very 
successful spectrum access regimes the Commission developed to promote 
innovation and entrepreneurship. Unlicensed spectrum has allowed 
technologists to innovate for decades, bringing about Wi-Fi and 
Bluetooth connectivity as well as the full range of consumer and 
business devices that rely on those technologies.
    The Citizens Band Radio Spectrum (CBRS) band, which became 
operational in 2020, has already demonstrated the broad range of 
entrepreneurial applications it can support. It has been put to use by 
businesses to assist in tracking inventory, provide secure 
communications, supplement Wi-Fi connectivity, and collecting data to 
promote greater efficiency. It has also been used by schools, 
libraries, Tribal entities and rural communities to provide broadband 
connectivity.
    These two spectrum access regimes are also used by providers of 
mobile service to aid in their traffic management and to ensure their 
customers have robust connectivity. In short, unlicensed, shared, and 
licensed access to spectrum helps promote a healthy ecosystem that 
benefits all consumers.

    Question 10. Ms. Sohn, many communities in my state, have had to 
forego other Federal funding opportunities that would allow for more 
rapid broadband deployment to unserved areas because certain census 
blocks were included in an RDOF bid. What are potential Federal 
remediation efforts for rural areas in my state that were included in 
an RDOF census block but are also eligible for other types of Federal 
support?
    Answer. As I said in my December 8, 2021 Questions for the Record, 
the decision by the FCC under the former Chairman to restrict access to 
other funding streams for participants in the RDOF program has 
perplexed me. The goal is to get people connected to this essential 
service and to do so quickly. If confirmed, I look forward to working 
with my colleagues on this and related issues.

    Question 11. Ms. Sohn, the FCC, NTIA, and USDA all entered into an 
interagency agreement to coordinate broadband funding deployment. In 
your experience--can you speak to the effectiveness of these 
interagency agreements? Do you have thoughts on how to beef up 
coordination between agencies to ensure the efficient use of taxpayer 
money to deploy broadband in West Virginia?
    Answer. I believe that the May 2022 Memorandum of Understanding 
between the Commission, NTIA, USDA, and the Treasury Department 
regarding information collection and sharing is important. The agencies 
need to be in frequent contact so there is as much coordination as 
possible to ensure that the Federal funds allocated for broadband 
deployment are spent efficiently and provide the intended results.

    Question 12. Ms. Sohn, what are your thoughts regarding tech 
neutrality in terms of Federal dollars being spent?

    a. Is there a particular form of broadband delivery that should 
take priority?
    Answer. As I said in my December 8, 2021 Questions for the Record, 
the objectives of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 
lays out that Congress wants broadband infrastructure that can ``easily 
scale,'' ``meet the evolving connectivity needs of households and 
businesses,'' and ``support the deployment of 5G, successor wireless 
technologies, and other advanced services.'' I believe infrastructure 
that meets the objectives Congress laid out in its infrastructure 
program should take priority.
    In order to make these assessments, it is critical for the Federal 
government rely on objective technical analysis by engineers to ensure 
the best use of Federal funds to maximize long term value to 
communities. Many Members of Congress, led by Senators Thune and 
Klobuchar, have weighed in with the FCC to improve its assessments of 
projects that seek Federal dollars and to scrutinize the technical 
capabilities of applicants before Federal dollars are given out. I 
completely agree.

    Question 13. Ms. Sohn, what role do you see low earth orbit 
satellite constellations playing in the short term and long term as far 
as providing sufficient service in a mountainous and heavily forested 
state like West Virginia?
    Answer. As I said in my December 8, 2021 Questions for the Record, 
the purpose of lowering the orbit of these satellites was to improve 
the latency of satellite broadband delivery. However, the drawback of 
this approach is that it requires the base station to ``see'' the 
satellite at a lower point on the horizon. This means that mountainous 
and heavily forested areas--like those in West Virginia--are more 
difficult for base stations to operate as opposed to more open and 
flatter rural areas. However, I remain confident that the Federal 
investment in infrastructure under the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act makes traditional on the ground infrastructure feasible even 
in the most difficult to serve areas.

    Question 14. Ms. Sohn, the Internet ecosystem continues to grow, 
with more broadband providers who are also recipients of government 
broadband funding. This trend is likely to accelerate considerably as 
NTIA and the states begin the award infrastructure funds for broadband 
network deployment. However, the recipients of government funding can 
be subject to vastly different regulations depending on their 
characterization or their historical designation as an incumbent LEC--
e.g., pole rates, labor requirements, tax laws, service requirements, 
legacy telephone obligations, and legacy cable obligations. These 
varying regulations have real impacts on their deployment, operating 
costs, and competitiveness. Should the government create more parity 
amongst the recipients of government funds in the interest of 
facilitating network modernization, broadband deployment, and creating 
a more competitive market?
    Answer. As I said in my December 8, 2021 Questions for the Record, 
I believe that the FCC should do what it can under the law to create 
parity and ensure that robust, scalable broadband networks are deployed 
and available to every consumer and business across the Nation. 
However, there may be limitations to what the FCC can achieve without 
Congress addressing some of the disparate requirements. For example, 
Section 224 of the Communications Act grants access to poles in certain 
situations but does not apply uniformly to all poles across the Nation. 
Moreover, the provision that grants access to certain poles is 
currently limited to only telecommunications carriers and cable 
providers. The FCC currently is limited in its pole attachment 
jurisdiction to ensure broadband deployment across the nation, and if 
confirmed, I would very much look forward to working with you and your 
office to further engage on this issue.

    Question 15. How can the Committee be assured that you will adhere 
to your voluntary recusal commitment if it is non-binding?
    Answer. I intend to adhere to my voluntary recusal commitment. It 
is possible, although unlikely, that the General Counsel will authorize 
me to participate in a proceeding covered by my voluntary agreement. 
However, I will note that Chairman Kennard was not accused of violating 
the terms of his voluntary recusal from a fairness doctrine-related 
docket when the General Counsel authorized him to participate in that 
docket.

    Question 16. What are your views on symmetrical Internet speeds? 
Does raising the required broadband speed for Federal funding hurt 
Federal funding for rural areas in any way?
    Answer. Generally, symmetrical speeds are preferable to allow both 
downloading and uploading of large files, although I understand such 
speeds are not always possible in some of the most remote areas of the 
country. The IIJA sets a minimum speed of 100/20 for carriers to obtain 
funding. I think this helps, rather than hurts, rural areas because it 
levels the playing field between urban and rural areas with regard to 
broadband speeds and robustness. For too long, rural areas have been 
stuck with slow and expensive Internet access. The IIJA rightfully 
seeks to fix that.

    Question 17. Ms. Sohn, what do you see as the happy medium between 
pole owners and those seeking to get access to poles to deploy 
broadband in rural areas?
    Answer. I agree with Chairwoman Rosenworcel that it is essential 
for the Commission to have pole attachment policies in place that help 
to facilitate--and not impede--broadband deployment, particularly in 
rural areas. The Commission has the authority under Section 224 of the 
Communications Act to regulate the rates, terms, and conditions of pole 
attachments. The Commission recently sought further comment on issues 
related to pole replacements, including how utilities and pole 
attachers must share the cost of pole replacements. The Commission also 
sought comment on what reforms it could adopt to avoid disputes or 
resolve disputes more quickly. If I am confirmed, I look forward to 
learning more about this issues and working with your office.
