                         THURSDAY, MAY 11, 2023

                               U.S. Senate,

                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in 
room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Ben Ray 
Lujan, Chairman of the Subcommittee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Lujan [presiding], Cantwell, Klobuchar,

Blackburn, Vance, and Lummis.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BEN RAY LUJAN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO

    Senator Lujan. Good morning. Before we get started, I just 
want to share with all of our colleagues that because there are 
multiple hearings and markups today, I'm going to do my due 
diligence to keep us to the 5-minute number. That way we can 
make sure that we accommodate more colleagues, as well.
    I want to thank Ranking Member Thune for working with me on 
scheduling, on putting this together, as well. I want to 
recognize the Chair, Ranking Member Cruz, as well, for being 
partners in our work to close the Digital Divide.
    Now universal service has been a critical part of 
communications policies since Alexander Graham Bell invented 
the telephone. Last Congress, we passed the bipartisan 
Infrastructure law and made a historic commitment. We made it 
abundantly clear that every household, every health care 
center, every school, every community institution, and every 
business in the country should have access to high-quality 
affordable broadband service.
    And while the $65 billion of investment we made in that 
package was important, I recognize that one-time investments 
will only get us so far. We also need programs that can meet 
the needs of future connectivity and continue to deliver 
affordability and access to households and institutions year 
after year.
    That was the reason behind the 1996 Telecommunications Act 
and the creation of FCC's Universal Service Fund. The fund 
supports four programs with a proven track record and the 
programs are high-cost support, also known as the Connect 
America Fund, low-income support or the Lifeline Program, and 
schools and libraries support or the E-Rate Program to ensure 
our educational institutions have high-quality access and rural 
health care support which helps ensure telehealth services are 
available and accessible in our rural communities.
    Through these programs, none of our schools or hospitals, 
including those in the most rural communities across the 
country, should be left behind.
    In the 21st Century, we understand that connectivity makes 
a difference whether our children are prepared to compete 
globally, whether our health care system is well equipped to 
save lives, whether we can provide equitable opportunities in 
historically underserved communities, and whether American 
workers can participate in the 21st Century economy.
    As we come together today and reflect on what we learned 
during the COVID-19 pandemic and what we accomplished through 
our COVID relief packages and in the bipartisan Infrastructure 
law, we have the opportunity to build on the promise and 
possibility of universal service and how these programs should 
be updated, improved and expanded to meet the needs of 
tomorrow.
    There's a growing pressure on universal service programs to 
continue to deliver connectivity that they originally promised 
in 1996 as a lot has changed over the last 30 years.
    For example, in 2023 we know that students often learn 
outside the classroom. They learn during time at home, during 
commutes, on the bus to school, and today E-Rate programs for 
the schools, libraries are restricted to connecting the 
physical school buildings or providing equipment within the 
classroom which significantly limits utilization.
    Two years ago, my guest at President Biden's first State of 
the Union was a student from the Cuba Independent School 
District, Ms. Helene Archlita. Before the pandemic, Ms. 
Archlita lacked power at home, let alone access to broadband. 
Her commute include hours on a bus across roads that disappear 
in heavy rains.
    E-Rate helped her classroom in the past but it took a 
global pandemic and the Emergency Connectivity Fund to provide 
connectivity where she did much of her learning at home and on 
the bus.
    Unfortunately, the Emergency Connectivity Fund is about to 
run out of funding. Wi-Fi on school buses is still ineligible 
for E-Rate which means that students like Ms. Archlita will not 
be able to use their valuable time to study.
    There are other simple comments and solutions to improve 
the Universal Service Program. For example, give schools the 
cybersecurity tools they need to make students and teachers 
safe online, review the rural health care statute to prioritize 
connectivity for patients at home, work to ensure that 
connectivity for low-income families is secure, provide stable 
funding so that families and businesses can rely on those 
resources as they make long-term decisions.
    There is much work for us to get to. We appreciate the 
panel being here. I do want to take a moment to introduce them.
    Mr. Tim Chavez, Technology Director for the Cuba 
Independent School District, who I am proud is joining us today 
to share the importance of the E-Rate Program on students in my 
home state of New Mexico and across the country.
    Ms. Angie Kronenberg, President of INCOMPAS, who can speak 
to both the history of the Universal Service Fund and share 
ideas on what we can do to improve.
    Mr. Daniel Lyons, Professor and Associate Dean of Academic 
Affairs at Boston College Law School, who has studied Lifeline 
and Universal Service Fund contributions models.
    Mr. Denny Law, the CEO of Golden West Telecommunications in 
South Dakota, and a Member of NTCA, who will share the 
importance of the High Cost Program to reach the most rural and 
hard-to-serve areas in Ranking Member Thune's state.
    I also want to recognize Mr. Greg Guice, Director of 
Government Affairs at Public Knowledge, who has been a strong 
advocate for increasing affordability and accessibility.
    I want to say thank you to everyone for being here. I look 
forward to hearing from you, and with that, I want to turn to 
Ranking Member Thune for his opening statement.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA

    Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome to all 
our panelists.
    The bipartisan Principle Universal Service has been a 
bedrock of our Nation's communications policies for nearly 50 
years. I take that back. For nearly 90 years. And programs that 
efficiently and effectively further the goal of universal 
service have contributed to advancements in health care, 
education, and economic development.
    As a member who represents a rural state, I remain 
committed to ensuring Americans in all parts of the country 
have access to communication services comparable in quality and 
price to those in urban areas.
    The High Cost Program within the FCC's Universal Service 
Fund has been critical in delivering broadband services to 
rural areas, like those in my home state of South Dakota.
    Over the years the FCC has taken meaningful steps to reform 
the High Cost Program. Under then Chairman Pai in 2018, the FCC 
unanimously took action to provide long-term sufficient and 
predictable funding to rural carriers. By doing so, rural 
carriers were provided certainty when planning deployment and 
maintenance of rural broadband networks.
    Today, the FCC can and should take steps to update high 
cost programs like the Alternative Connect America Cost Model 
and the Connect America Fund. Updating each of these programs 
will play a crucial role in getting high-speed broadband 
services to high-cost areas.
    Despite several reforms to the USF, challenges exist today. 
While the biggest challenges threatening the sustainability of 
the USF is the assessment on voice service providers that is 
passed on to consumers as a fee in their monthly telephone 
bill, known as the contribution factor, today the contribution 
factor is a staggering 29 percent which is simply 
unsustainable.
    I've recently joined Senators Klobuchar, Moran, and 
Hickenlooper in reintroducing legislation to require the FCC to 
update the contribution system.
    Fixing the contribution factor is much needed. However, any 
update to the contribution factor should not be viewed as 
giving the FCC a blank check to unnecessarily expand the USF 
Programs.
    It is equally important to address the inefficiencies 
within each of the programs, a challenge that has been well 
documented since the program's creation.
    The goal of the E-Rate Program is to connect America's 
schools and, by and large, today they are connected, but yet 
there have been calls to expand E-Rate for uses outside of 
Congress's clear direction that funding be used for 
``services'' to ``classrooms,'' and GAO has recently found that 
the FCC has not comprehensively assessed the E-Rate Program's 
fraud risk.
    In addition to E-Rate, GAO has documented the FCC's failure 
to properly oversee the Lifeline Program which has been riddled 
with waste, fraud, and abuse.
    Much attention has been focused on the rampant fraud within 
the Lifeline Program, but the FCC has largely ignored the 
fundamental question of whether or not the program is 
increasing telephone subscribership among low-income consumers.
    This has resulted in the Commission having limited insight 
on what the program is actually accomplishing despite millions 
of dollars being disbursed every year.
    It's long overdue for the FCC to undertake a fundamental 
analysis of the Lifeline Program, and, unfortunately, similar 
to the FCC's Lifeline Program, the Affordable Connectivity 
Program at the Commission appears to be plagued with many of 
the same inefficiencies due to the FCC's longstanding failure 
to make performance goals a priority.
    So I would caution against dumping billions of additional 
funding into this untested program. Let me put it this way. I 
have no doubt the Affordability Program is providing much-
needed service to many low-income Americans, but we need an 
honest assessment of how to best deliver service to those 
actually in need. Without such assessment, the FCC is failing 
to meet its obligations to American consumers.
    In addition to addressing the numerous challenges that 
persist within the USF, it's important to note that Universal 
Service cannot be achieved without proper oversight of the FCC 
and the numerous other agencies that have been tasked with 
deploying rural broadband services.
    At the end of the last Congress, I began an oversight 
effort to review the numerous Federal broadband programs and 
I'll be continuing my work to hold agencies accountable and 
ensuring that broadband funding goes to truly unserved areas.
    Just last month, Chairman Lujan and I requested GAO conduct 
a review of the effectiveness of Federal, state, and local 
broadband programs following a report that broadband funding is 
spread out over 15 separate agencies and 133 programs, and I'm 
pleased that GAO will begin working on that particular request.
    As I said earlier, I remain committed to ensuring that all 
Americans have access to next generation broadband services and 
look forward to hearing from our panel today as we review the 
state of universal service.
    Chairman Lujan, before I close, I'd like to add that I'm 
looking forward to working with you on additional hearings and 
issues of importance before this subcommittee.
    Senator Lujan and I have partnered on several legislative 
efforts over the last several years in both the Committee, this 
committee, I should say, and the Ag Committee from efforts to 
free up additional mid-band spectrum to improving rural 
broadband programs and disaster assistance programs over at 
USDA.
    So I'm optimistic about our continued collaboration on 
matters before the Senate and within this subcommittee's 
purview.
    So, Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thank our panelists, and, 
as always, great to have Denny Law, General Manager and CEO, 
Golden West Telecommunications, in front of this committee.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Senator Thune.
    Mr. Chavez, as we go to you first, I wanted to share that 
this morning I'm also proud to join with Senator Thune to 
announce a bipartisan Universal Service Working Group which is 
a group of six Senators from both sides of the aisle who are 
going to work together to explore these issues and hopefully 
find a sustainable path forward that delivers for the American 
people and this will serve as one of the first fact-finding 
gathering conversations of that group, as well.
    So with that, Mr. Chavez, I want to turn this over to you. 
Again, Tim Chavez, Director of Technology, Cuba Independent 
Schools, Cuba, New Mexico.
    Mr. Chavez, the floor is yours for 5 minutes.

     STATEMENT OF TIM CHAVEZ, DIRECTOR OF TECHNOLOGY, CUBA 
            INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT, NEW MEXICO

    Mr. Chavez. Chairman Lujan, Ranking Member Thune, and 
Members of the Committee, good morning. It's an honor to be 
here to testify in front of you today.
    My name is Timothy Chavez. I have served as the Technology 
Director of Cuba Schools for the last 22 years. I'm a native of 
Cuba. I grew up in Cuba, New Mexico, USA, and I graduated from 
Cuba High School.
    After high school, I left to attend college in Albuquerque. 
I was blessed to return to the community that helped shape me.
    For those of you that don't know, Cuba Schools is located 
in Sandoval County in the northern part of the county and it's 
about an hour and a half north of Albuquerque.
    The district covers a huge region made up of 120 square 
miles. Many of the students live on the Navajo Nation and they 
are bused to Cuba Schools over long distances each day.
    The remainder of the students that make up the student body 
come from the surrounding Cuba area which is off reservation 
and they live in rural local mountainous areas.
    Most families in the Cuba area have lived there for 
hundreds of years. The roots of these communities run deep but 
so do some of the barriers they face accessing basic 
necessities. One of those necessities is broadband.
    Cuba was a prime example of a rural community stuck on the 
wrong side of the Digital Divide. Fortunately, the Universal 
Service Fund, in particular E-Rate and the ECF Programs, 
through those we have made life-changing impacts to our 
students through the broadband availability that we have 
provided.
    We fully support the Universal Service Fund. The dollars it 
provides allows communities like ours to survive in the 21st 
Century.
    Many Native American students and their families do not 
have access to necessities, like electricity, water, and 
internet. The unique checkerboard area which means sections of 
land divided between BLM, Navajo Trust land, and private land 
make it very hard for easements to get through for traditional 
solutions like fiber optic.
    During the COVID-19 pandemic, the school district took on 
the challenge of getting Internet to every single household 
with support of Universal Service Funds, the local school 
board, and Dr. Karen Sanchez Diego.
    Starlink owned by SpaceX provided us with an Internet 
solution that avoided the easement issues common to New Mexico. 
We installed some equipment on the poles in the grounds and 
other units were installed on rooftops, believe it or not, to 
keep them safe from sheep and goats and other livestock that 
run freely in the Eastern Navajo Nation.
    Putting them on poles and on top of rooftops ensured that 
the equipment would be safe and would be functional for long 
periods of time.
    Our technology staff at the school were the ones that went 
out and actually installed the equipment to every single 
household and we got every single student connected within the 
last school year.
    All students of the Cuba District, like I said, now have a 
Starlink satellite system. It runs high-speed internet, 230 
megabytes download and 25 megabytes upload, which means you 
could have multiple students on a Zoom session learning 
remotely at a time. That also means that Cuba students can 
learn from home on remote days which consists of weather 
cancellations due to bad roads, snow, and other things that 
happen in that area that are unique to specifically that area 
that would affect the roads and then also pandemic 
restrictions.
    So our students are now connected socially, emotionally, 
and hopefully in the future financially as we close the Digital 
Divide and open up opportunities here, at home, and across the 
world to our students.
    The Starlink project will continue as the school district 
enrolls new students and continues to grow. Federal funding is 
critical to providing the resources needed to continue this 
project, one that is vital to the education of impoverished 
students of Cuba, New Mexico.
    We support growing and expanding the Universal Service Fund 
and E-Rate so that other school districts like ours can access 
the resources needed to meet modern challenges that give our 
students the education they deserve.
    I've also provided some pictures and we're going to put 
those on the slide show. I can explain.
    So right there, that first picture that comes up is of a 
pre-K student excited about Starlink. She's dragging a stick 
through the ground. You can kind of see the landscape of the 
area.
    Next slide. OK. So this next picture is one of my staff 
members setting up the Starlink on a pole. If you look in the 
background, you can see a corral. You can see a fence, the 
livestock. The sheep and the goats are held in the back. We put 
it up on the pole so they wouldn't get trampled. You can see a 
trench where the cabling running into the house would be 
providing that Internet service.
    Next one is my staff trenching. You can see one of the 
homes. You can see the side of the home, the stucco peeling 
off. This is one of the homes that does not have running water 
or sewage but they do have internet.
    The next picture is a picture of the staff running the 
cables. So trenches were dug in all these homes to run the 
cables into the house.
    This is a home that did not have electricity. Part of the 
district's goal was to get electricity so that they could at 
least run the Starlink system. It doesn't use a lot of power, 
but we were able to provide two panels and a battery pack and 
that was enough to keep the Starlink up and running, especially 
during afterhours for homework and overnight.
    This is one of our students asleep on the bus. Once again, 
one of our bus routes is over 2 hours. One of the bus routes 
has 47 miles of dirt road and that's just one way. That's a 
student sleeping there.
    These are students actually doing homework on the bus. Some 
of the buses have been equipped with Kajit Wireless Systems. 
Wherever there's cell service, they can actually get online and 
do homework before they get home.
    This is an on-campus picture of students learning. We have 
the 120 Initiative which was started before the pandemic where 
every student received a laptop, like as if it was a book, and 
it's made a huge difference for our students.
    The next picture is a picture of one of our typical 
classrooms. You can see a camera that actually follows, auto-
tracks teachers while they're teaching, and then interactive 
board where they run the Zoom sessions so students can be 
either on campus or at home and they're getting the same lesson 
plan that's happening within the classroom.
    That's it. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Chavez follows:]

    Prepared Statement of Timothy Chavez, Technology Director, Cuba 
           Independent School District, Cuba, New Mexico, USA
    Chairman Lujan, Ranking Member Thune, and Members of the Committee:
    My name is Timothy Chavez. I have been an employee of the Cuba 
School District for 22 years. I grew up in Cuba and graduated from Cuba 
High School.
    Located in Sandoval County, Cuba Independent School District (ISD) 
is approximately one and a half hours north of Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
The District covers a total of 120 square miles and has three schools: 
Cuba Elementary, Cuba Middle, and Cuba High School. The district 
enrollment has increased greatly from 489 students in 2019 to 769 
students in 2023, and the District draws most of its funding from state 
and Federal sources. Many students are Native Americans who live on the 
Navajo Nation and are bused to school over long distances each day. The 
remainder of students live in the Village of Cuba or the surrounding 
areas.
    I'm proud to say that our graduation rate was 95 percent in 2021, 
significantly higher than the national average.
    After high school, I left to attend college, but returned to my 
home in rural Northern New Mexico to give back to the community that 
helped shape me. The Cuba School District comprises 72 percent Native 
American students from the Eastern Navajo Nation and 25 percent 
Hispanic students from Northern New Mexico. Most of these families have 
lived there for hundreds of years. The roots of these communities run 
deep, but so do some of the barriers they face accessing basic 
necessities--including broadband. Cuba is a prime example of a rural 
community stuck on the ``wrong'' side of the digital divide. 
Fortunately, the Universal Service Fund--in particular, the E-Rate 
program--has allowed us to make real progress to close that divide. 
With these dollars, and others from the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
(ECF) and Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER) 
Cuba Schools has made an enormous, life-changing impact through 
broadband availability. We fully support the Universal Service Fund, 
and recognize that the support it provides allows communities like ours 
can survive in the 21st Century.
    Providing a fiber infrastructure to the Eastern Navajo Nation has 
been a topic of discussion for years. Building a traditional fiber 
infrastructure in these areas seemed impossible because of easement 
barriers, existing infrastructure challenges, and high costs that the 
community could not afford on our own.
    However, leaders at Cuba School District knew that the only way to 
ensure our students received the high-quality education they deserve 
was to ensure their homes were fully connected. There is no reason
    our students should not have all of the resources and opportunities 
that students have in wealthy areas and in big cities. That's why our 
Superintendent Dr. Sanchez Griego didn't take no for an answer, and 
pushed forward to make 100 percent connectivity for our student body a 
reality.
    The COVID-19 pandemic only served to worsen the many challenges 
faced by those in my community. Many Native families still do not have 
access to basic necessities like electricity, sewage lines, and 
Internet. The unique checkerboard of land-ownership and trust lands in 
the area makes it so there is no one easy solution. Every small town--
every household--needs a unique solution to bring these necessities to 
every family. The school district took on the challenge to get Internet 
to every household, because in the 21st century, our students cannot 
get the education they need to come out of school prepared without it. 
Cuba Schools is part of the landmark, Yazzie/Martinez case in which 
equitable funding for students in New Mexico was found to be required 
by the State constitution. The State was not funding some students at 
an appropriate level, particularly for technology in areas like our 
District.
    In 2019, Superintendent Dr. Karen Sanchez Griego, a major advocate 
of equity in education, proposed narrowing the Digital Divide by 
providing one-to-one solutions for students. This means that every 
student attending Cuba Schools would receive a laptop. Dr. Sanchez-
Griego's next goal was to bring Internet to students' homes. This would 
be the beginning of the Cuba School District Starlink project.
    In 2020, the pandemic provided a new urgency to her project. 
Starlink provided a solution that avoided many of the easement issues 
common to New Mexico. We installed some equipment on the ground, but 
other units were put on rooftops to keep them safe from sheep and goats 
that could trample the hardware. Preventing livestock damage is just 
one of the many unique challenges faced in the deployment of broadband 
networks in rural communities like Cuba. And we didn't have big crews 
of professionals at our disposal to install this infrastructure--staff 
at the school went out to each and every household and did it 
ourselves. Every single one of us, from our most senior administrators 
down, rolled our sleeves up, drove out to our students houses, and took 
the time to get them connected.
    As we began directly connecting students' residences, I was shocked 
at how bad the conditions were for so many students attending the Cuba 
School District. Growing up in Cuba, I always knew that conditions like 
these were present, but I was heartbroken to see just how many of our 
students were living in homes lacking the things that many of us take 
for granted, such as a steady source of electricity and a means to heat 
the home. The consequences of extreme poverty negatively affect these 
families and drive them into a continuous cycle of struggle, conditions 
that make learning difficult, if not impossible, for Cuba students.
    Cuba Schools cannot independently address all these issues, but 
with the assistance of critical E-Rate dollars and the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund, we have been able to decrease the impact of the 
Digital Divide and have brought our students and families into the 21st 
Century. All students of the Cuba School District have now received a 
Starlink Internet satellite system which runs at 230Mbps download and 
25Mbps upload speeds. Cuba students can still learn during remote days, 
whether due to pandemic restrictions or other issues unique to rural 
areas like Cuba. For example, due to the poor condition of roads in the 
area, heavy rain and intense weather can make it impossible for school 
buses to bring our students to school. On those days, we still utilize 
the technology and methods we relied on during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
to ensure our students are not missing out on crucial days of their 
schooling due to the poor infrastructure around them. . With this 
technology, our students are now a part of a global, interconnected and 
digitally-literate society. They are connected socially, emotionally, 
and in the future financially as we close the digital divide and open 
up opportunities here at home and across the world to our students.
    This project will continue as the school district enrolls new 
students and continues to grow. Federal funding is critical to 
providing the resources needed to continue this project, one that is 
vital to the education of impoverished students of the Cuba Independent 
School District. We have used every dollar of E-Rate we can get, as 
well as funding from the Emergency Connectivity Fund and from the 
Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, to meet our 
technology needs. We support growing and expanding E-Rate, so that 
school districts like ours can access more resources to meet modern 
challenges and give our students the education they deserve.
    While Cuba Graduation rates were 62 percent in 2019, they have 
risen substantially to 95 percent in 2021 as a result of the strategic 
goals and initiatives implemented by the district with the help of 
Federal funds. I believe that our situation is not unique, I know there 
are many other communities throughout the U.S. that struggle with 
similar issues and I hope that we can provide an example of what is 
possible.

    Senator Lujan. Thank you for your time today.
    Next we'll hear from Ms. Angie Kronenberg, President of 
INCOMPAS.
    The floor is yours for 5 minutes.

       STATEMENT OF ANGIE KRONENBERG, PRESIDENT, INCOMPAS

    Ms. Kronenberg. Good morning, Chairman Lujan, Ranking 
Member Thune, and Members of the Subcommittee.
    My name is Angie Kronenberg, and I'm the President of 
INCOMPAS, the Internet and Competitive Network Association.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the importance 
and future of the Universal Service Fund, the Nation's critical 
connectivity program.
    I have had the honor and privilege to work on the USF for a 
significant portion of my career, including at the FCC.
    INCOMPAS is the leading trade association in advocating for 
competition and innovation in the communications marketplace. 
We represent competitive broadband companies that are building 
the networks of the future and the leading Internet companies 
who are driving consumer and business demand for more robust 
broadband.
    Our members are bringing more choice and innovation, better 
customer service, lower prices, and faster speeds to customers 
across the Nation.
    The USF is extremely important to INCOMPAS's members. The 
majority of INCOMPAS's network providers participate in at 
least one USF program and they have a strong interest in 
ensuring that the Fund can meet its goal to ensure affordable 
broadband across the Nation.
    Our members are also required to contribute to the USF 
based on their telecom revenues and have had to deal with the 
increasing contribution factor. While the USF is critical for 
connectivity, millions of Americans remain unconnected and too 
many Americans have limited or no choice for their home 
service.
    Consumers want more competition. Competition is the law and 
it is key to meeting our connectivity goals. We need an all-of-
the-above approach and support from both the public and private 
sectors to get every consumer and business connected.
    INCOMPAS recognizes the importance of the USF, 
congressional funding, and private investment to do so, and I 
want to thank Congress for its commitment to closing the 
Digital Divide by appropriating billions of dollars.
    The technology companies that INCOMPAS represents are also 
investing heavily in the networks. In the last decade, the 
world's largest tech companies invested almost a trillion 
dollars in global digital infrastructure and each year tech 
companies are investing over $120 billion.
    This is in addition to the billions of dollars they invest 
in online content services and applications. These investments 
support delivery of their own content which drives higher 
demand for broadband and saves broadband providers over $5 
billion each year.
    Now that Congress has allocated funding for broadband 
deployment and affordability, some are questioning whether we 
still need the USF at all and the short answer is yes. Most 
congressional funding is targeted for broadband deployment. Yet 
three of the four USF programs focus on affordability. We must 
continue to ensure that communities can afford to subscribe to 
these essential services.
    However, when we are dealing with taxpayer dollars and the 
USF fee on customers, we must also be responsible. There are 
certain USF programs that have overlapping goals with the 
recent congressional funding and so it will be important for 
the FCC to do a deep dive analysis into each USF program to 
find efficiencies. It has committed to do so and we're pleased 
that you're starting a working group to do the same.
    INCOMPAS is committed to supporting and assisting you and 
the FCC in your efforts.
    While the USF remains vital, it is in serious jeopardy. 
Telecom revenues have declined dramatically. As a result, the 
contribution factor has increased to a historic high of about 
30 percent. Without intervention, the factor is predicted to 
rise to 40 percent by 2025, putting the stability of the fund 
at risk.
    Historically, the USF contribution base includes all the 
services that are supported by the fund but it has not been 
modernized to do that for broadband. INCOMPAS has been working 
with the U.S. Forward Coalition which consists of over 340 
diverse organizations, including civil society, trade 
associations, and broadband providers, that agree with the 
recommendation by former FCC Official and USF Expert Carol 
Maddy that the FCC should expand the contribution base to 
include broadband Internet revenues.
    She estimates that doing so would bring the contribution 
factor down to less than 4 percent and is a logical, easy, and 
equitable solution that the FCC has the authority to implement.
    In conclusion, Congress gave the FCC the statutory 
responsibility to ensure that the USF is predictable and 
sufficient.
    INCOMPAS stands ready to work with Congress and the FCC to 
ensure that the USF is sustained and advanced in our Nation's 
pursuit of Internet for all.
    Thank you and I'm very happy to answer any of your 
questions.

      Prepared Statement of Angie Kronenberg, President, INCOMPAS
Introduction
    Good morning, Chairman Lujan, Ranking Member Thune, and members of 
the Subcommittee. My name is Angie Kronenberg, and I am the President 
of INCOMPAS--the Internet and competitive networks association. Thank 
you for the opportunity to testify on the importance and future of this 
Nation's critical connectivity program, the Universal Service Fund 
(``USF''). I have had the honor and privilege to work on USF for a 
significant portion of my career, including as an advisor to former FCC 
Commissioner Mignon Clyburn when she was Chair of the Federal-State 
Joint Board on Universal Service and when the FCC modernized the USF to 
support broadband network availability and affordable service in its 
USF programs.
    INCOMPAS is the leading trade association advocating for 
competition and innovation in the communications marketplace. We 
represent new network builders, Internet innovators, and the world's 
leading companies offering video streaming, social media, cloud 
services, and data centers.\1\ Our competitive broadband \2\ companies 
are building networks of the future, including fiber, fixed wireless, 
mobile (5G), and satellite networks that connect homes, businesses, 
government agencies, and community anchor institutions. Our leading 
streaming and Internet innovators are investing in network 
infrastructure and producing new creative content, online services, and 
applications, which are driving consumer and business demand for more 
robust broadband networks. In addition to building fiber to some of the 
most rural corners of America, our members' achievements include 
providing business service to 75 percent of Fortune 500 companies, 
building the fastest speed network on record, and being awarded the 
number one ranking for customer service in America. Our members help 
deliver better services resulting in more choice, lower prices, and 
faster broadband speeds that also attract new jobs and private sector 
investment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ See INCOMPAS' Website, available at https://www.incompas.org/
memberlist.asp.
    \2\ For purposes of this testimony, the term ``broadband'' means 
all broadband services and/or infrastructure that is used to deliver 
advanced services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background and Importance of the USF
    While universal service has long been a principle of the 
Communications Act of 1934, it was a bipartisan Congress that created 
the USF in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to help ensure that basic 
and advanced telecom services (voice and broadband) are available and 
affordable throughout the United States.\3\ As a result, the USF has 
become one of our Nation's most critical connectivity programs. Since 
its creation, the USF has become a program that millions of families, 
community anchor institutions, and small businesses rely on to get 
connected. It has been especially valuable for families and businesses 
that rely on it for work, school, and telehealth.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ The implicit subsidies to promote universal service had to be 
made explicit once local competition was permitted in the 
telecommunications market as a result of the 1996 Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The USF spends about $8.5 billion annually to help fund affordable 
connectivity in rural and urban communities across the Nation. It is 
comprised of four programs:

  (1)  The High-Cost Fund helps support connectivity in rural areas by 
        offering subsidies to providers. This is the largest of the USF 
        programs, and approximately 1.2 million households are in the 
        geographic areas served by these providers. In 2021, over $5.1 
        billion was spent on this program.

  (2)  Lifeline helps low-income households purchase connectivity 
        services by supporting a monthly subsidy of less than $10 per 
        month. Over seven million low-income households use this 
        subsidy, and over 90 percent of them use it to purchase mobile 
        connectivity. In 2021, $724 million was spent on this program.

  (3)  E-rate offers affordable broadband service for schools and 
        libraries. There are over 128,000 schools and libraries in the 
        E-rate program. In 2021, the USF spent $2.1 billion on this 
        program.

  (4)  Rural Health Care keeps rural hospitals and clinics connected 
        and serves over 9,000 rural health care facilities. In 2021, 
        $557 million was spent on this program.

    Today, the USF is working to make high-speed broadband networks as 
ubiquitous as telephone service, and broadband is the essential 
communications technology the USF now supports in all four USF 
programs--as was recommended by the National Broadband Plan in 2010.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \4\ See Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan, at 147 
(2010) (``the FCC should identify near-term opportunities to shift 
funding from existing programs to advance the universalization of 
broadband''), available at https://transition.fcc.gov/national-
broadband-plan/national-broadband-plan.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The USF is extremely important to INCOMPAS' members. The majority 
of INCOMPAS' network provider members participate in at least one USF 
program--mostly E-rate and Rural Health Care--and so our members have a 
strong interest in the USF and ensuring that it can survive and thrive 
and meet its goal to ensure affordable broadband service across the 
Nation. In addition, our members are required to contribute to the USF 
based on their end user interstate and international telecom revenues. 
Like the vast majority of providers, most of our members pass through 
the USF fee to their customers. As such, our members and their 
customers have been dealing with the increasing contribution factor, 
which has been difficult for customer relations, but also is making the 
opportunities for arbitrage as customers are seeking non-assessable 
services to avoid the high fee of about 30 percent.
Connecting the Nation Will Require the USF, Congressional Funding, and 
        Private Investment.
    While the USF is critical to connecting this Nation in an ever-
increasing connected world, the digital divide still persists as 
millions of Americans remain unconnected to high-speed Internet or any 
connection at all.\5\ And too many Americans have limited or no choice. 
For example, the FCC's 2022 Communications Marketplace Report shows 
that most consumers only have one or two options of home Internet 
providers, and the higher the speed, the fewer the options.\6\ Be it 
for lower prices, better customer service, more innovation, or faster 
speeds--consumers want more competition. Competition is the law and is 
key to tackling our Nation's connectivity challenges as it is the 
leading driver for these consumer benefits.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ NTIA recently stated that there are 8 million locations without 
25/3 Mbps service. See Internet For All, How the FCC National Broadband 
Map Impacts the BEAD Program, Part 1 of 3: Allocation of Funds, 
available at https://www.internetforall.gov/blog/how-fcc-national-broad
band-map-impacts-bead-program-part-1-3-allocation-funds.
    \6\ See 2022 Communications Marketplace Report (Dec. 30, 2022), at 
50 (Fig.II.A.33).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Connecting the Nation will take an all-of-the-above approach with 
help from both the public and private sectors. INCOMPAS supports 
congressional funding that has been allocated for deployment and 
affordability because too many people are still not connected despite 
significant efforts and investment by both the public and private 
sectors.
    INCOMPAS recognizes the importance of the USF, congressional 
funding, and private investment all working together to achieve our 
Nation's shared goal of bringing high-speed Internet to everyone--what 
the Administration calls ``Internet for All''--and ensuring that 
everyone can access the lawful online content, services, and 
applications of their choice. I want to take the opportunity to thank 
Congress on behalf of INCOMPAS and our members for its focus and hard 
work to improve connectivity for today and the future. Congress wisely 
understood the significance of the Nation's connectivity gap, 
especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result appropriated 
tens of billions of dollars through the CARES Act, American Rescue Plan 
Act, and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This is once-in-a-
generation type funding for deploying broadband networks to all 
unserved and underserved locations as well as community anchor 
institutions, and Congress understood that competition in its funding 
programs is especially important in driving down costs for taxpayers 
and enabling the delivery of robust and scalable network capacity.
    INCOMPAS believes that we must be making these investments in 
robust, reliable, and scalable networks that can offer greater 
connectivity today and higher speeds in the future--this is important 
for our Nation to compete in the global marketplace as many countries 
around the world also are committed to universal connectivity to high-
speed networks. Such an approach will best meet consumer, business, 
community anchor institution, and government agency needs over time. 
Accordingly, congressional funding will work in conjunction with the 
USF and private sector investment to further connect families and small 
businesses to affordable, high-speed connectivity services.
    To that end, INCOMPAS and its members also have been actively 
working to address the numerous barriers to fast and affordable 
broadband deployment. INCOMPAS' member companies work directly with 
local communities to ensure that the infrastructure being deployed will 
meet their needs, yet in some situations our members face unreasonable, 
costly demands, and/or significant delays. There is no national 
framework that affords broadband infrastructure builders a uniform or 
standardized process, and as a result providers must often navigate a 
complex, time-consuming, and costly process to deploy their networks. 
These costs do not reflect rational and reasonable costs. Accordingly, 
INCOMPAS has advocated for lower costs to pole access, including 
unreasonable and costly pole replacements, and more affordable railroad 
crossings, among other issues.\7\ Without appropriate resolution, these 
issues distort the market and interfere with broadband deployment 
nationwide.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ See INCOMPAS, Leadership Blog (April 21, 2023), available at 
https://www.incompas.org/content.asp?admin=Y&contentid=767.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Online content and the large technology companies that INCOMPAS 
represents are also investing heavily in our communications networks to 
deliver a modern internet. Our members are investing billions of 
dollars each year in the global network to bring a better online 
experience to customers and providers. In fact, an Analysys Mason 
Report conservatively estimates that in the last decade the world's 
largest online content companies invested $883 billion in global 
digital infrastructure including hosting, transport, and delivery 
networks, and in 2018-2021, these companies increased their investments 
by over 50 percent and invested over $120 billion in digital 
infrastructure annually.\8\ This is in addition to the billions of 
dollars that these companies spend annually on content and applications 
for consumers. Their investments in global digital infrastructure not 
only support the delivery of their own content and services, which is 
driving higher demand for broadband, but it also supports the broadband 
providers' business case. In fact, these pro-consumer investments bring 
traffic closer to end users, improve quality of experience for 
broadband users, and save broadband providers over $5-6.4 billion 
annually in network and transit fees.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Even with Congressional Funding, We Will Still Need the USF.
    Now that Congress has allocated tens of billions of dollars for 
broadband deployment and affordability, some are questioning whether we 
still need the USF at all, and the short answer is ``Yes, we do.'' Most 
of the money recently allocated by Congress is targeted for broadband 
deployment, yet three out of the four USF programs focus on 
affordability of service to households and community anchor 
institutions. We must continue to ensure that communities can afford to 
subscribe to these essential services, and the FCC recently affirmed 
this in its recent Future of USF Report that it issued in response to 
the Infrastructure Act's requirements.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ See Report on the Future of the Universal Fund, Report (rel. 
Aug. 15, 2022), at para. 22 (``[w]e affirm that our universal service 
goals for broadband cannot be achieved without our existing USF 
programs'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    However, when we are dealing with taxpayer dollars and the USF fee 
on customers, we need to be responsible. As such, it is important for 
the FCC to do a deep-dive analysis into the four USF programs to see 
how much funding is still needed as a result. Essentially, the FCC 
agreed it should do this in its Future of USF Report.\10\ There are 
certain USF programs that have overlapping goals with recently 
allocated congressional funding--for example, the BEAD and High-Cost 
Programs both help with deployment in hard-to-serve areas, and the 
Affordable Connectivity and Lifeline Programs both help connect low-
income households to affordable broadband service. While the USF 
programs need further examination to properly consider whether the 
recent influx of congressional dollars requires modifications to the 
program to ensure improved efficiency and effectiveness, INCOMPAS 
believes that there will still be a role for the USF in the future, and 
we must secure it so that it can meet the long-term connectivity needs 
of the Nation.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ See id. at para 42 (``[w]e recommend, in parallel with the 
rollout and completion of BEAD-funded projects, that the Commission 
evaluate the funding needs of existing and future providers. . .'').
    \11\ INCOMPAS has provided the FCC its recommendations to ensure 
the USF is effective and efficient. See, e.g., INCOMPAS Comments, WC 
Docket Nos. 21-476 & 06-122 (Feb. 17, 2022), available at https://
www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1021789341563/1; INCOMPAS Reply Comments

at https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10622448730471/1 (discussing the 
lower operating costs of modern networks.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The USF is in a Crisis.
    While the USF remains vital in an ever-increasing connected world, 
it is in serious jeopardy of surviving. The telecom revenues that fund 
the USF have declined over 60 percent in the last two decades, and as a 
result the contribution factor has skyrocketed from 6.9 percent in 2001 
to a historic high of about 30 percent today. Without intervention, the 
contribution factor is predicted to rise to 40 percent by 2025.\12\ 
This is unsustainable and puts the stability of the entire USF at 
risk.\13\ Historically, services eligible to directly receive USF 
funding pay into the fund. Broadband Internet access service (``BIAS'') 
and the networks that deliver it are eligible to directly receive USF 
support, but in a break with historic practice the FCC has not yet 
modernized its funding mechanism to require BIAS to pay into the fund. 
The USF contribution factor would be more reasonable and sustain the 
fund for the future just by correcting this anomaly and following 
historic practice of assessing services eligible to receive support.

agree with the recommendation set forth in the USForward Report written 
by USF-expert Carol Mattey.\14\ The Report recommends that the FCC 
expand the contribution base to include BIAS revenues and estimates 
that doing so would immediately bring the contribution factor down to 
less than 4 percent. It also explains that assessing BIAS revenues is a 
logical, easy, and equitable solution that the FCC already has the 
authority to implement.\15\

Conclusion
    Congress gave the FCC statutory responsibility under Section 254 of 
the Communications Act to ensure that the USF is specific, predictable, 
and sufficient in order to preserve and advance universal service.\16\ 
As such, INCOMPAS stands ready to work with Congress and the FCC to 
ensure that the USF is sustained, preserved, and advanced in our 
Nation's pursuit of Internet for All.

  STATEMENT OF DANIEL A. LYONS, PROFESSOR, BOSTON COLLEGE LAW 
    SCHOOL, NONRESIDENT SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE 
                           INSTITUTE

    Mr. Lyons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman Lujan, Ranking Member Thune, and Members of the 
Committee, thank you for the chance to appear today to discuss 
the state of Universal Service.
    My name is Daniel Lyons. I'm a Nonresident Senior Fellow at 
the American Enterprise Institute, and a Professor at Boston 
College Law School, where I study telecommunications and 
Internet law.
    The basic tenet of Universal Service that the government 
should assist those who can't afford access to the network has 
long been a cornerstone of American telecom policy, and it's 
increasingly important as more of our lives migrate online.
    Unfortunately, it's hard to tell how well the fund's 
various programs actually achieve those goals and this is 
particularly true with regard to Lifeline, a service close to 
my heart as I grew up in the kind of family that lifeline seeks 
to serve.
    I spent my childhood in a trailer park and when I was 
admitted to Harvard, the first person I told wasn't my parents, 
it was my friend's mom, Mrs. Zarnick, because I had to call 
from her house. Our phone was turned off. So Lifeline seeks to 
address my lived experience.
    Unfortunately, Lifeline has been criticized as ineffective, 
incomplete, and unnecessarily paternalistic. Despite a decade 
of prodding by the GAO, the FCC has never evaluated whether the 
program is effective.
    A recent independent audit concluded that there's no 
evidence to support whether the Lifeline Program has improved 
access to voice and broadband services for low-income consumers 
and the problem stems from Lifeline's design.
    A proper broadband support program would begin by studying 
low-income families to understand which households are not 
subscribing to broadband and why and then develop a system that 
meets their needs in measurable ways.
    The FCC did none of this. Instead, the agency simply 
announced that the $9.25 monthly telephone subsidy could now be 
used for broadband instead.
    Even assuming that a $9.25 per month improved low-income 
telephone adoption and the FCC admitted that it did not know 
whether that was true, there's no reason to believe that the 
same amount would compel families to purchase broadband nor 
does the Lifeline's eligibility requirements specifically 
target households lacking broadband.
    Without studying the drivers of low-income broadband 
adoption rates, the FCC cannot say whether the broadband gap is 
better addressed by offering, for example, $9 a month to seven 
million households or $45 a month to 1.4 million households. It 
would be the same price. The subsidy does not address other 
drivers of low-income non-adoption.
    So, in short, Lifeline bets nearly a billion dollars every 
year that offering a small amount of money to millions of low-
income families will somehow reduce the broadband gap but with 
no proof that it does and despite evidence suggesting 
otherwise.
    Now in some ways the Affordable Connectivity Program is an 
improvement over Lifeline. It's far less paternalistic. It 
allows its recipients to use the subsidy on broadband plans of 
their choice, but it suffers from the same fundamental flaw. It 
gives a monthly subsidy to a wide range of participants without 
showing that this will improve broadband adoption rates.
    ACP's eligibility requirements are even broader than 
Lifeline and given an ACP majority of ACP eligible families 
already have broadband, it's likely that the taxpayers are 
spending significant amounts each month on households that are 
at no risk of losing their Internet connectivity.
    E-Rate, I think, suffers a similar lack of rigorous 
evaluation. The program was originally designed to connect 
America's libraries and schools but that goal was largely 
completed by 2006. So the key question now is whether and how 
additional spending on classroom technology can improve student 
learning outcomes.
    As a law school administrator, I can say there's 
significant debate in the educational community on this topic, 
and the academic literature shows mixed results.
    The few studies that have looked specifically at E-Rate 
show that there's no measurable impact on E-Rate spending on 
students' standardized test scores.
    Through its Office of Economic Analytics, the FCC has the 
capability to perform the analysis necessary to make these 
programs more efficient and effective. What it lack, it 
appears, is the will to do so.
    The High Cost Fund has seen a more rigorous transition to 
the broadband age and has yielded several significant insights. 
Through the Connect America Fund and RDOF, the agency has 
wisely focused on upfront network construction costs where one-
time investment will yield sustainable network growth.
    The use of reverse auctions has helped ensure taxpayers get 
the biggest bang for their buck in terms of wiring unserved 
areas and it's important that such funds are disbursed on a 
technology-neutral basis as unserved areas are geographically 
diverse and there's no one-size-fits-all design to connect the 
whole country efficiently.
    Finally, it's important to reform the fund's unsustainable 
funding mechanism. The simplest and most elegant solution to 
the contribution problem is to fund Universal Service through 
the appropriations process.
    Other proposed solutions, such as tax on broadband 
providers, suffer from the same problems as the current 
methodology. They're under-inclusive, they encourage strategic 
behavior, and they discourage the very services that the 
program seeks to subsidize.
    Paying through appropriations will improve transparency. It 
allows for greater congressional oversight of the program, and 
it also addresses concerns in some quarters about the role that 
USAC plays as the private administrator of a public fund 
scheme, an arrangement that has prompted legal challenges.
    Thank you.

 Prepared Statement of Daniel A. Lyons, Professor, Boston College Law 
    School; Nonresident Senior Fellow, American Enterprise Institute
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, Chair Lujan, Ranking Member 
Thune, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
appear before you at today's hearing on the state of universal service. 
I am a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute 
and a professor at Boston College Law School, where I teach and write 
about telecommunications and Internet law.
    I applaud the subcommittee's focus on this issue. The Universal 
Service Fund is an important program with a laudable mission. The basic 
tenet of universal service--that the government should assist those who 
struggle to access the network--has long been a cornerstone of American 
telecommunications policy. One of the Federal Communications 
Commission's (FCC) primary obligations is to ``make available, so far 
as possible, to all the people of the United States. . .a rapid, 
efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication 
service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.'' \1\ This 
mission takes on greater significance in the digital age, when Internet 
access is important for not just communication but also employment, 
commerce, education, and countless other activities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ 47 U.S.C. Sec. 151.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, while the Universal Service Fund's goals are sound, 
there is significant room for improvement regarding modernizing these 
programs for the digital age. This is particularly true of Lifeline, 
which has been repeatedly criticized as ineffective, incomplete, and 
unnecessarily paternalistic. The committee should also consider re-
evaluating E-Rate in light of the mixed evidence of its effectiveness. 
Through trial and error, the High Cost Fund has made a more successful 
transition to the broadband era and has yielded important lessons that 
the program should retain going forward.
Lifeline
    Lifeline is a program near and dear to my heart, because I grew up 
in the kind of family it is designed to serve. I spent my childhood in 
a trailer park. When I was admitted to Harvard University, the first 
person to find out wasn't one of my parents, but my friend's mom, Mrs. 
Ziarnick. I had to call the admissions office from her house because 
our phone had been turned off. Of course, that was in the era before 
the broadband revolution moved disclosures like these to the web. As 
more of our daily lives moves online, it becomes increasingly important 
to make sure that low-income families are not shut out of the 
information revolution.
    The purpose of Lifeline is clear. In a 2012 reform order, the 
Commission identified three goals for the Lifeline program: (1) ensure 
the availability of voice service for low-income Americans, (2) ensure 
the availability of broadband for low-income Americans, and (3) 
minimize the Universal Service Fund contribution burden on consumers 
and businesses.\2\ In other words, Lifeline's goal is, and should be, 
to help low-income families who would otherwise lack access get voice 
and broadband service in a cost-efficient fashion.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25 (2012).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Unfortunately, it is far from clear whether Lifeline actually helps 
achieve that goal. Despite a decade of prodding by the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO), the FCC has not developed metrics to 
evaluate whether the program is effective. A recent independent audit 
by Grant Thornton concluded that while the broadband gap is declining, 
``there is no evidence to support whether or not the Lifeline program 
has improved access to voice and broadband services for low-income 
consumers.'' \3\ Other data suggest that much of Lifeline's spending is 
likely wasted on households that are at little risk of dropping off the 
network.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Evaluation, at 20.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Part of the issue lies with the way the program was repurposed from 
a telephone-era subsidy to a broadband program. Historically, Lifeline 
typically offered eligible households $9.25 per month toward their 
monthly telephone service. As the FCC began updating the program for 
the digital age, the GAO recommended that the agency study low-income 
households' telecommunications needs, to ``effectively target funds 
based on data-driven information.'' \4\ But the agency declined to do 
so. Instead, it simply extended the existing Lifeline program so the 
same $9.25 subsidy could now be used for voice or broadband service. 
Even assuming that a $9.25 per month subsidy had an appreciable effect 
on telephone penetration rates--and the FCC admitted that did not know 
whether this was the case \5\--there is no reason to believe that the 
same amount would compel unconnected homes to purchase broadband 
service, which is a more expensive and complex product. Without 
conducting a study to determine the factors driving low adoption rates, 
the FCC cannot conclude that offering $9.25 per month to 7 million 
households will boost adoption rates more than offering a larger amount 
to a smaller number of households would: for example, $46.25 per month 
to 1.4 million recipients, which would cost the same amount of money.

    \5\ General Accountability Office, FCC Should Evaluate the 
Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Lifeline Program, GAO-15-335, at 14 
(2015) (``According to FCC officials, the commission has not evaluated 
the extent to which Lifeline has contributed to the narrowing of the 
gap in penetration rates and at what cost. As a result, FCC does not 
know the extent to which the narrowing of the penetration rate is 
attributable to the Lifeline program.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In fact, the limited data suggests that small stipends are unlikely 
to affect low-income broadband adoption rates. From 2012 through 2014, 
the Commission conducted several pilot programs to test broadband 
subsidies.\6\ While the agency estimated that 74,000 consumers would 
sign up for these trials, the pilot ultimately drew only a tenth of 
that amount--even after extensive promotion. The small sample size and 
various methodological flaws limit the conclusions that can be drawn 
from this data, especially since the pilot programs occurred nearly a 
decade ago. But recognizing these limitations, the pilots suggested 
that low-income households are most likely to respond if the subsidy 
made the plan free or close-to-free. This is consistent with the 
Commission's earlier experience with wireless voice service, which saw 
significant growth once TracFone and other wireless innovators figured 
out how to deliver a product at no additional cost to Lifeline 
families: free wireless service was seen as a bigger draw than 
discounted landline service.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to being potentially ineffective, Lifeline is 
incomplete, since it does not address the other potential drivers of 
broadband non-adoption. According to the most recent Pew Research data, 
those households that do not subscribe to home broadband service cite a 
variety of reasons.\7\ While the monthly cost of service is the most 
often mentioned factor, at 20 percent, some households are uninterested 
because a smartphone meets their connectivity needs. Others cite 
availability, the cost of a computer, and disinterest in Internet 
access as rationales. This suggests that a comprehensive approach to 
low-income non-adoption would encompass not just monthly plan 
subsidies, but also an equipment subsidy and funding to promote 
broadband availability and digital literacy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research Center, June 3, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Lifeline also reflects unnecessary paternalism that limits 
recipients' choices and distorts telecommunications markets. Lifeline 
households cannot use their subsidy toward a plan of their choice. 
Instead, they may select from a limited menu of companies that have 
been certified as meeting the FCC's minimum service criteria. 
Admittedly, there are good reasons why the FCC enforces these criteria, 
to make sure carriers adhere to Lifeline rules. But the effect is to 
steer millions of customers and nearly a billion dollars annually 
toward a limited set of government-approved service providers that 
differ significantly from the brand-name providers that most Americans 
choose. This makes it harder for Lifeline recipients to discipline 
carriers that provide poor service by switching providers; there are 
fewer options to choose from, and the administrative costs associated 
with shifting the subsidy to a new carrier may be a barrier.
    In some ways, the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) represents 
a significant improvement over Lifeline. ACP offers a $30 per month 
stipend to eligible households, which is likely a more significant 
enticement to get low-income non-adopters online. It includes a one-
time equipment subsidy, to help mitigate this separate driver of non-
adoption. And it jettisons many of Lifeline's restrictions, instead 
allowing recipients to use the subsidy toward any commercially 
available broadband program. This gives low-income households greater 
freedom to choose the plan that best fits their family's needs.
    But at the ACP's core, one finds the same fundamental flaw that 
infects Lifeline: It gives a monthly subsidy to a wide range of 
recipients based on income or participation in other Federal programs, 
on the unproven assumption that these payments will improve broadband 
adoption rates among low-income families. Like Lifeline, ACP's 
proponents have not studied the relevant population to determine the 
drivers of low-income non-adoption. Instead the program paints with a 
broad brush, offering the stipend to any family that meets its 
eligibility criteria. But according to recent surveys, among families 
earning less than $30,000 per year (a good proxy for ACP eligibility), 
57 percent subscribe to home broadband, and 76 percent have a 
smartphone.\8\ This suggests the eligibility criteria are broader than 
necessary to achieve the program's goal--or to put it a different way, 
it is likely that significant sums of money are distributed to 
households that are not at risk of canceling their broadband service 
absent the subsidy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ Andrew Perrin, Mobile Technology and Home Broadband 2021, Pew 
Research Center, June 3, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Of course, there are certainly households that are dependent on 
Lifeline and/or ACP to maintain network connectivity. As the initial 
ACP appropriation approaches exhaustion, it makes sense to provide 
additional funding as a bridge to a more sustainable and responsible 
low-income support program going forward.
    But policymakers should use that interim period to adopt a data-
driven approach to Lifeline and ACP reform. Rather than simply offering 
an arbitrary amount of assistance to anyone who qualifies for other 
forms of government assistance, the Commission should identify and 
survey low-income households that currently lack broadband, to identify 
the characteristics of these families and ascertain the barriers to 
adoption. With the results of this study, the agency then could design 
eligibility criteria that targets low-income non-adopters in 
particular, rather than continuing Lifeline's scattershot program of 
aiding all low-income households broadly. A data-driven, narrowly 
tailored set of eligibility criteria could go far to reduce perhaps the 
most significant criticism of Lifeline and ACP, namely the risk that 
large amounts of subsidy dollars will be spent in ways that do not 
actually narrow the digital divide.
    Armed with study results that can better identify which families 
are offline, why, and how much it would take to get them online, the 
Commission could then design an effective subsidy mechanism. The 
overarching goal of a low-income subsidy should be consumer 
empowerment, to narrow the purchasing power gap to allow low-income 
families to participate as consumers in broadband markets. To achieve 
this goal, the subsidy should be competitively neutral, direct, and 
portable. While ACP is a remarkable improvement from Lifeline on this 
score, ideally the subsidy would be issued directly to consumers in the 
form of a voucher, rather than being sent directly to the service 
provider. A direct voucher enhances the dignity of low-income 
assistance recipients by empowering them to choose the services they 
want, and to switch more easily if they decide a competitor is better.
E-Rate
    Like Lifeline, E-Rate is a program with good intentions but whose 
original purpose has been somewhat eclipsed by technological 
development, and which would benefit from additional study of its real-
world effect. Originally, E-Rate sought to bring connectivity to the 
Nation's libraries and schools, at a time when only 14 percent of 
schools had Internet access, and most of those were via dial-up.\9\ But 
by 2005, the FCC reported that nearly all schools, and 94 percent of 
instructional classrooms had Internet access, and by 2006, 98 percent 
of libraries offered public Internet access to patrons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ Modernizing the E-Rate Program for Schools and Libraries, 29 
FCC Rcd. 8870, 8875 (2014).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Given that this buildout mandate has largely been completed, the 
key question going forward is whether and how E-Rate's additional 
spending on technology can improve student learning outcomes. And 
unfortunately, the limited academic literature on this topic show mixed 
results. A 2019 study by economists Thomas Hazlett, Ben Schwall, and 
Scott Wallsten shows that E-Rate spending had no measurable effect on 
student SAT scores in North Carolina from 1999 through 2013.\10\ These 
findings are consistent with an earlier California study showing that 
E-Rate spending increased the number of connected classrooms but did 
not translate into higher state achievement test scores.\11\ While it 
seems self-evident that investment in classroom technology would yield 
educational improvements, further study is necessary to determine how 
and to what extent--and to assure that E-Rate spending is not merely 
displacing state or local spending that would occur even without the 
program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
High Cost Fund
    By comparison, the High-Cost Fund has navigated a more successful 
transition from the telephone to the broadband era. Through trial and 
error, the FCC has learned important lessons about the best way to 
subsidize network construction to unserved areas. In 2010, the National 
Broadband Plan recommended that buildout subsidies should focus on 
upfront network construction costs, where one-time investment would 
yield sustainable network growth.\12\ Through the Connect America Fund, 
the FCC largely reoriented the High-Cost Fund in this direction and 
established several corollary principles that the Fund should continue 
to recognize going forward.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ Federal Communications Commission, Connecting America: The 
National Broadband Plan, xiii.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Perhaps most significantly, the Commission adopted a reverse-
auction mechanism to disburse funds. This helps assure that taxpayers 
will get the biggest bang for their buck by awarding funds to projects 
that will connect the most households using the least amount of money. 
Then-Commission Chairman Ajit Pai explained that this design sparked 
competition that improved the overall efficiency of the program: during 
Phase II of the auction, areas that the Commission estimated would cost 
$5 billion to serve were ultimately covered by a $1.5 billion 
subsidy.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ Wolters Kluwer, ``Pai Announces Plan to Create Rural Digital 
Opportunity Fund,'' April 12, 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Similarly, the Commission adopted a norm of distributing funds a 
technology-neutral basis, without favoring one method of broadband 
delivery over another. This is crucial, as unserved areas exhibit 
significant geographic diversity, making a one-size-fits-all plan 
difficult. A wireless solution may work well on the Kansas plains but 
not in the mountainous terrain of West Virginia. Traditionally, most 
consumers receive fixed broadband by wire. But there are natural limits 
on the effectiveness of wired deployment: A recent study of the history 
of telephony, electricity, and cable shows that wired deployment 
typically plateaus at roughly 70 percent of the country, which implies 
significant subsidies to close the remaining gap.\14\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In the pay television market, satellite providers such as Dish 
Network and DirecTV closed the gap through intermodal competition. In 
the broadband context, Connect America Fund Phase II's commitment to 
technology-neutral solutions prompted many nontraditional bidders to 
compete for funds, including satellite companies, wireless carriers, 
and electric utilities.\15\ This intermodal competition increases the 
chances of finding the most efficient way of serving individual pockets 
of unserved consumers. And the benefits of intermodal competition are 
likely to increase as companies push the technological envelope through 
5G development, satellite deployment, and other innovations.

Contribution Reform
    Finally, any review of the Universal Service Fund must encompass 
the prospect of contribution reform. While the Commission has taken 
steps over time to arrest the growth of USF disbursements, the 
declining pool of available revenue has caused the USF surcharge to 
rise, from 3 percent in 1998 to 29 percent last quarter. There is a 
consensus that the current approach is unsustainable. The bigger 
question is how to replace the current contribution mechanism.
    The simplest and most elegant solution to the contribution problem 
is simply to fund universal service through the appropriations process. 
Other proposed solutions, such as a tax on broadband or edge providers, 
suffer from similar problems as the current methodology: they are 
underinclusive and encourage strategic behavior by consumers, while 
discouraging the very services the program seeks to subsidize. Paying 
for universal service from the general treasury would improve the 
transparency of the program and improve opportunities for congressional 
oversight to review program operations and minimize program 
inefficiencies.
    Madame Chair and members of the committee, this completes my 
testimony. I look forward to answering any questions you may have.

 STATEMENT OF DENNY LAW, CEO AND GENERAL MANAGER, GOLDEN WEST 
          TELECOMMUNICATIONS COOPERATIVE, SOUTH DAKOTA

    Mr. Law. Thank you, Chairman Lujan, Ranking Member Thune, 
Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for this opportunity to 
participate in today's hearing on the State of the Universal 
Service.
    I'm Denny Law, CEO of Golden West Telecommunications, based 
in Wall, South Dakota.
    Golden West has operated in Rural South Dakota for over a 
century and today we connect more than 32,000 locations across 
24,500 square miles. We serve a geographic area larger than 
Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Delaware combined but 
with fewer than two customers per square mile.
    Despite such distances and density, Golden West and other 
community-based providers have led the charge in deploying 
rural broadband. This work highlights the powerful mix of 
community commitment, entrepreneurship, private capital, and 
effective programs, like the Federal Universal Service Fund or 
USF.
    I'm proud of the unparalleled work of Golden West and its 
fellow rural broadband providers, but there are customers in 
outlying rural areas that still need better broadband and in 
other rural areas not fortunate enough to be served by 
community-based operators, the connectivity gap is much 
greater.
    Finally, even where rural networks exist, we must sustain 
and upgrade them to keep pace with demand and deliver 
affordable services.
    If there's one point that I hope this subcommittee might 
take away from my testimony, it's that the mission of Universal 
Service is not accomplished merely when a network has been 
built. Universal Service is evolving and it's ongoing and it's 
a mission that requires renewed focus and attention every day.
    I think it's helpful to view the USF Program as aiming 
toward not just one goal of deployment but, rather, four more 
comprehensive goals. The first is availability. While not 
providing upfront construction capital, the High Cost USF 
Program makes the business case for rural investment possible. 
It provides a more reasonable assurance of the ability to 
recover both capital and operating expenses.
    The second is capability. We've seen USF programs in the 
past aimed for incremental goals that create the need to 
reinvest only a few years later. We need to learn from the 
lessons of the past and aim higher and more efficiently with 
our USF resources over time.
    The third is affordability. The statutory goal of Universal 
Service is that rural customers pay rates reasonably comparable 
to those paid by urban users. The High Cost USF promotes this 
outcome by helping to cover some of the difference in cost 
between serving rural and urban communities.
    The fourth is sustainability. The High Cost USF Program 
aims not only to make sure that customers are connected 
initially but that they stay connected. Even in the wake of 
substantial broadband grant funding, Congress explicitly 
directed the FCC to carry on the mission of Universal Service.
    Several High Cost USF programs offer an effective roadmap 
to achieve these goals. The CAF BLS and ACAM Initiatives and 
the Alaska Plan have all helped small providers lead the charge 
for rural broadband. We should enhance and expand such efforts 
to address remaining broadband availability challenges.
    Moreover, continuing to support these programs is essential 
to sustain the work that is already done and to keep service 
rates affordable. Completing upgrades to these USF programs 
will promote more effective coordination with NTIA's BEAD 
Program.
    We are grateful that many Members of Congress have long 
supported these USF programs and we hope the FCC will complete 
much-needed updates to these programs soon.
    We must also tackle how we pay for Universal Service. In 
establishing a contribution mechanism, Congress rightly 
recognized specific, predictable, and sufficient support could 
not be ensured if Universal Service programs were subject to 
annual appropriations.
    We're grateful for the increasing focus of Congress on this 
issue.
    Golden West is a member of NTCA, the rural broadband 
association, and NTCA has endorsed the Reforming Broadband 
Connectivity Act, introduced by Senators Klobuchar, Thune, 
Hickenlooper, and Moran, which directs the FCC to reform the 
USF contribution system within 1 year.
    NTCA has also endorsed the Fair Contributions Act, 
introduced by Senators Wicker, Lujan, Young, and Kelly, to 
direct the FCC to study certain demands and costs on rural 
broadband networks.
    The FCC should ensure that all who use or benefit from 
networks and services contribute to their availability, 
capability, affordability, and sustainability. As outlined 
further in my testimony, two specific steps would help.
    First, the FCC should use existing authority to include 
broadband revenues within the contribution base. This would 
stabilize the base and properly reflect that programs 
supporting broadband should in turn be supported by it.
    Second, the FCC should ensure that large internet-centric 
firms whose business model depends on networks to deliver 
content contribute in an equitable and non-discriminatory way 
to support those networks.
    I applaud the creation of the USF Working Group and I thank 
you for this opportunity to appear today and I look forward to 
your questions later.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Law follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Denny Law, Chief Executive Officer, Golden West 
                  Telecommunications Cooperative, Inc.
    Chairman Lujan, Ranking Member Thune, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's 
hearing focused on the state of universal service.
    I am Denny Law, Chief Executive Officer of Golden West 
Telecommunications Cooperative, Inc. in Wall, South Dakota. For over a 
century, Golden West and its subsidiaries have provided communications 
services to rural South Dakota, starting in 1916 with the stringing of 
a telephone line along fence posts. Today, Golden West provides service 
to over 32,000 locations across 24,500 square miles--a geographic area 
larger than the states of Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut and 
Delaware combined--which equates to fewer than 2 customers per square 
mile. In addition to robust service for consumers and businesses within 
our territory, we serve numerous anchor institutions, including 73 K-12 
schools, 56 health clinics and hospitals, 19 libraries, six Veterans 
Administration facilities, and five Public Safety Answering Points.
    While Golden West's service area may be relatively larger and more 
sparsely populated than the geographies served by most other providers, 
there are many other small community-based companies and cooperatives 
like Golden West serving the most rural and remote parts of America. 
For example, Golden West is a member of NTCA-The Rural Broadband 
Association (``NTCA''), which represents more 850 rural, community-
based broadband providers like Golden West that have deployed cutting-
edge networks and offer advanced communications services in deeply 
rural spaces. These operators collectively serve less than five percent 
of the population of the United States but nearly one third of its 
landmass--including more than 54 percent of the geography of New Mexico 
and more than 80 percent of South Dakota. We operate in rural areas 
left behind decades ago when then-voice telephone networks were first 
being built out by other service providers because the markets were too 
sparsely populated, too high cost, or just too difficult to serve in 
terms of terrain. Many of these areas remain just as challenging to 
serve today and, in most of these rural areas, companies like Golden 
West offer the only full-service fixed communications networks 
available.
    Despite the challenges of distance and density, Golden West and its 
fellow small broadband providers have led the charge in deploying 
advanced communications infrastructure that responds to consumer and 
business demands and connects rural America with the rest of the world. 
For example, in its most recent survey of the broadband deployment 
efforts of rural community-based operators, NTCA found that nearly 80 
percent of its members' customers on average are connected by fiber-to-
the-premise (``FTTP'') networks and that more than 80 percent of those 
customers on average can receive at least 100 Mbps broadband 
service.\1\ This progress far outpaces the work of other providers in 
connecting other parts of rural America--and, as I will discuss further 
below, it highlights how a mix of community commitment, 
entrepreneurship, and effective programs like the Federal Universal 
Service Fund (``USF'') can overcome connectivity obstacles even in 
areas where the average density is only a few households per square 
mile and the drives for service calls alone are measured in hours 
rather than minutes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Yet, for all this progress to date, we still have much more work to 
do in deploying and operating this critical infrastructure and 
delivering robust services at affordable rates. Even as I am proud of 
the work that Golden West and its fellow rural broadband providers have 
done in connecting vast swaths of the most rural parts of America with 
the best possible broadband, the figures above cited for this success 
also indicate that, on average, we still need to connect the remaining 
20 percent of customers to better broadband--with many of these 
customers located in the hardest-to-serve pockets of outlying rural 
areas. And, in other rural areas not fortunate enough to be served by 
community-based operators, the connectivity gap is far greater and more 
widespread in terms of the numbers and percentages of locations still 
needing just basic connectivity. Finally, even where robust and capable 
networks exist, operators face the challenges of sustaining and 
upgrading them to keep pace with user demand and delivering affordable 
services that rural Americans can rely upon to participate in today's 
increasingly online world.
    Indeed, if there is a singular point that I hope this Subcommittee 
will take away from my testimony today, it is this last one--that the 
mission of universal service is not accomplished merely when the 
network has been built. The objective of universal service is not 
defined as the one-time act of network construction. Instead, Congress 
rightly defined universal service by law as an ongoing state of 
affairs; it is described by reference to both ``access'' and 
``services.'' Specifically, universal service is described as ``an 
evolving level of telecommunications services,'' and Congress directed 
the Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'') in creating the USF to 
ensure ``access to telecommunications and information services. . .that 
are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and 
that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates 
charged for similar services in urban areas.''
    Network deployment is an essential goal and a condition precedent 
to achieving national connectivity objectives. Golden West expends 
substantial amounts of time, energy, and resources to building networks 
in some of the most challenging parts of rural South Dakota, including 
the Black Hills. And the USF is critical to making the business case 
for such deployment as I will describe further below. But, as 
community-based providers like Golden West and other smaller rural 
broadband providers know all too well, the job is just starting when 
network construction is ``done.'' Living in the communities we serve, 
we see firsthand how the decisions we make and the measures we 
implement affect our neighbors, friends, and family, and we therefore 
have substantial incentive to do what we can to make sure they have 
ongoing access to the best possible communications services. It is 
essential therefore that the comprehensive mission of universal service 
and the job of the USF is not lost in the race to connect all 
Americans. If we only get Americans connected and neglect the ongoing 
responsibility to keep them connected, this effort will ultimately be 
for naught in many rural places--and the mission of universal service 
will fail.
What Universal Service Means--and What its Objectives Should be
    Connecting every American is not an easy challenge to overcome, but 
it is not terribly hard to identify the primary barrier to rural 
broadband--the economics of deploying and sustaining broadband are 
difficult, if not impossible, in many rural markets. The rates that 
rural consumers pay are rarely sufficient to cover even the costs of 
operating in rural areas, much less the upfront capital expenditures 
required to deploy reliable, high-speed broadband in rural America. To 
be sure, there are other issues that affect the economics of rural 
broadband, such as obtaining permits to build or upgrade infrastructure 
and navigating complex bureaucratic application processes, and I will 
discuss some of these later in this testimony. But it is clear 
nonetheless that the single biggest challenge to connecting rural 
America and keeping it connected is simply making the business case to 
build any broadband at all. Put another way, permitting barriers and 
other impediments to construction are no barriers at all if one cannot 
justify even building a network in the first place.
    Without a reasonable business plan, providers are hard-pressed to 
justify borrowing funds or using their own capital to build, and then 
harder-pressed still to sustain networks in areas where densities are 
low, distances are great, and terrain and topography complicate 
operations. This is where the Federal high-cost USF program makes its 
mark--ongoing support from the high-cost USF initiatives overseen by 
the FCC are critical for providers like Golden West to make the 
business case for investing in and then sustaining broadband for the 
benefit of rural communities. The high-cost USF programs help providers 
to keep rates more affordable and to justify either use of a provider's 
own cash or obtaining financing from the few lenders that tend to serve 
rural Internet service providers on a widespread basis--the Department 
of Agriculture's Rural Utilities Service (``RUS''), the Rural Telephone 
Finance Cooperative, and CoBank. It should also be noted that most of 
the fiber already connecting wide swaths of South Dakota and rural 
areas served by community-based providers today as described earlier in 
my testimony was not grant-funded. Rather, these investments were 
propelled by private capital and loans that must be repaid. The 
recovery of this capital would be at substantial risk, along with the 
ongoing delivery of high-quality services at affordable rates, if high-
cost USF support were cut or eliminated.
    Even where grants are available, most of these programs include 
matching requirements, meaning providers still must borrow or bring 
their own capital to the table. Moreover, there are some places so 
deeply rural and with populations so sparsely scattered that, even if a 
grant were to cover 100 percent of initial construction costs, the 
costs of operations alone still deter investment without ongoing USF 
support. At times, some confuse the roles of, and the interplay 
between, various grant programs and the high-cost USF program, thinking 
of them repetitive or redundant. But this reflects a fundamental 
misunderstanding of the unique and distinct role each type of program 
has played and continues to play. Unlike grant or loan programs, USF 
does not provide upfront capital or finance networks. On the other 
hand, grant programs like ReConnect at RUS, the various Treasury 
broadband funding initiatives, and the upcoming Broadband Equity, 
Access, and Deployment (``BEAD'') program will neither sustain networks 
nor make services atop them affordable for consumers. BEAD will not 
cover the costs of hours-long ``truck rolls'' or cover the portion of 
investment that still must be covered by matching funds. ReConnect by 
itself will not assure that rural customers pay rates that are 
affordable and roughly equivalent to what urban communities pay. While 
incredibly valuable to promote network deployment, these grant programs 
in the end typically presume and expect a self-sustaining business case 
after networks are built and provide no support for ongoing operations 
or affordability measures.
    The Federal high-cost USF program is therefore essential to ensure 
that every consumer can obtain reasonably comparable services at 
reasonably comparable rates atop rural networks once built. In other 
words, USF is the linchpin of making the business case in the first 
instance to obtain and use financing from any source--whether grants, 
loans, or private capital--to build networks in rural areas. To be 
clear, there are places where a grant alone can make all the difference 
in the business case for investment. But this is not the case 
throughout rural America, and these are the places where the high-cost 
USF program still makes a critical difference. Indeed, Congress itself 
recognized this dynamic in creating the BEAD program in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, directing the FCC to prepare a 
report on the ``future of universal service'' and further stating 
affirmatively that the call for a report and the creation of BEAD 
should not be read to ``in any way reduce the congressional mandate to 
achieve the universal service goals for broadband.'' \2\

Sec. 60104(c).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Against this backdrop, I submit that the objectives of the high-
cost USF can rightly be summarized as four essential components, 
reflecting the uniquely comprehensive role that USF plays as compared 
to one-time grant or other capital programs in promoting universal 
connectivity:

  <bullet> Availability--As discussed above, while not providing 
        upfront capital for the construction of networks, the high-cost 
        USF program unleashes investment by making the business case 
        possible in rural areas; providers can seek and use investment 
        capital with reasonable assurance thereafter of recovery of 
        capital costs and the ability to recover ongoing costs without 
        needing to charge rates that consumers would find utterly 
        unaffordable.

  <bullet> Capability--Rather than investing resources in ``barely 
        broadband''--cheaper networks that provide initial coverage but 
        struggle to keep pace with evolving consumer demand--the high-
        cost USF program should require and enable delivery of services 
        that are and will remain ``reasonably comparable'' to those 
        available in urban areas, meaning that rural Americans can 
        participate meaningfully in today's and tomorrow's online 
        world. One can clearly see the difference that the high-cost 
        USF makes in promoting more efficient long-term investments and 
        better networks in rural areas when one compares: (1) the 
        levels of service available in areas where community-based 
        providers have leveraged a mix of private capital, loans, and 
        USF support as described earlier in this testimony; and (2) the 
        levels of service available (or utter lack thereof) in other 
        rural areas lacking a similar mix of provider commitment and 
        well-designed USF support mechanisms that promote scalable 
        investments. It is essential that we avoid ``incrementalism'' 
        in setting goals for universal service; we must not aim merely 
        to meet current expectations and we should instead plan for the 
        evolution of demand and need over the life of the supported 
        networks.

  <bullet> Affordability--It is far too often overlooked that the high-
        cost USF is an affordability program. While so much focus is on 
        deployment and availability of services (and the high-cost USF 
        program enables these too as discussed above), the ultimate 
        statutory goal of universal service is that rural customers pay 
        rates that are ``reasonably comparable'' to those paid by urban 
        users. It is the high-cost USF that ensures this happens by 
        helping to cover some (but not all) of the difference in costs 
        between serving rural and urban communities.

  <bullet> Sustainability--By covering ongoing costs of maintaining and 
        upgrading networks in deeply rural areas, the high-cost USF 
        program aims not only to make sure that customers are connected 
        in the first instance, but that they stay connected and that 
        the services they receive are ``reasonably comparable'' in 
        price and quality both on the day that the network is turned on 
        and over the life of that network.\3\ As Congress itself 
        recognized in directing the FCC to develop a report and 
        admonishing the agency to carry on the mission of universal 
        service even in the wake of substantial broadband grant funds 
        being appropriated, the act of connecting customers takes 
        ongoing effort. Indeed, as stated earlier in this testimony, 
        this work is just starting when the network is ``done.'' The 
        USF is essential to support this continuing work.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Specific Recommendations Regarding Universal Service Programs
    If one is looking for a proven roadmap for success in rural 
broadband, there is no better template than three specific high-cost 
USF initiatives overseen by the FCC: (1) the Connect America Fund-
Broadband Loop Support (``CAF-BLS''); (2) the Alternative Connect 
America Cost Model (``ACAM''); and (3) the ``Alaska Plan.'' If one 
looks to see where broadband has made the greatest strides in deeply 
rural areas--not just in the small town centers where some density 
exists but for the farms, ranches, and other homes and businesses 
scattered across rural America--a common thread is that the vast 
majority of these well-served rural places are served by providers 
receiving one of these three kinds of high-cost USF support. While 
there is often an inclination to focus on creating new things and to 
solve problems through the creation of new programs from whole cloth, 
the track record of success is already there. We should be looking to 
build upon, enhance, and expand such efforts as we consider how to 
address remaining broadband challenges. Moreover, as discussed above, 
continuing to support these programs will be essential to sustain the 
good work already done and to keep rates affordable for services on 
these networks.
    The FCC has been considering for some time now how to update these 
three programs and ensure they are coordinated effectively with grant 
programs already in place and the BEAD program still to come. Over the 
course of more than a year, a robust record has been developed 
indicating how specific updates would both help achieve this objective 
of interagency coordination and better promote the four core universal 
service objectives noted above. We are deeply grateful that members of 
this Subcommittee and other leaders in Congress have long been 
supporters of and advocates for these three programs, and we are 
hopeful that the FCC will respond to the continuing interest of 
Congress and other stakeholders by completing the updates to these 
programs in coming weeks and months.
    In particular, it is important that the FCC update these mechanisms 
as soon as possible to reflect the levels of service that customers 
expect from their broadband services. Even as community-based providers 
like Golden West have surpassed 100 Mbps or even Gigabit service for 
many of their rural customers, the high-cost USF programs currently 
have stated performance objectives for only 25/3 Mbps speeds as set in 
2018. Meanwhile, the BEAD program will aim to fund deployment of 
networks in underserved areas that lack 100/20 Mbps access or where 
there is no enforceable commitment by a provider to deliver at least 
that level of service in the future. If the FCC can soon complete 
updates to these three high-cost USF programs that demand delivery of 
higher speeds and provide predictable and sufficient support to do so, 
this will ensure effective coordination between BEAD and the high-cost 
USF mechanisms--allowing BEAD funds in turn to go further in serving 
areas in greater need. Such an outcome would represent effective 
coordination and efficiently leverage existing networks and high-cost 
USF programs to realize the comprehensive mission of universal 
connectivity and universal service for millions of Americans in rural 
areas.
    For these reasons, I would ask this Subcommittee and other leaders 
in Congress to encourage the FCC to finish the work to update these 
high-cost USF programs as soon as possible by: (a) identifying where 
support is needed under these programs based upon realistic, 
engineering-backed assessments of where reliable voice and broadband 
services can in fact be delivered today by a competitor at reasonably 
comparable rates; (b) identifying what levels of support are needed to 
deploy higher speed broadband than the programs currently require, to 
sustain broadband where it has been deployed, and to keep rates 
affordable for rural consumers in those areas where support is 
warranted; and (c) providing recipients of high-cost USF support under 
these programs an option to commit to serve every location in the areas 
for which they receive such support such that BEAD grant funds can be 
directed to aid other areas instead.
    Finally, I recommend that Congress continue to work with the FCC to 
ensure that the ongoing mission of universal service is fulfilled 
throughout rural America--including in those rural areas where CAF-BLS, 
ACAM, and the Alaska Plan are not applicable and in effect. 
Specifically, in its report to Congress regarding the ``future of 
universal service,'' the FCC highlighted that, even in some areas where 
grants are awarded, there may be a need for ongoing USF support:

        We recommend, in parallel with the rollout and completion of 
        BEAD-funded projects, that the Commission evaluate the funding 
        needs of existing and future providers that have already 
        deployed high-speed broadband networks and consider the 
        creation of new support processes. For example, the Commission 
        could consider the creation of a process to support operating 
        costs that are not recoverable from revenues earned when prices 
        are set at just, reasonable, and affordable levels and from 
        other sources of income, e.g., governmental grants. Such an 
        approach is consistent with the universal service principles in 
        section 254 of the Communications Act which requires that the 
        Commission ensure continuing access to advanced 
        telecommunications services that meet or exceed evolving 
        consumer needs.\4\

No. 21-476, Report to Congress (rel. Aug. 15, 2022), at  42.

    The FCC should be encouraged not to await the ``rollout and 
completion'' of BEAD to begin (or complete) this process. In fact, 
there are areas right now where providers have used their own capital 
or have taken out loans to build broadband-capable networks that need 
ongoing USF support to help sustain those networks and keep rates for 
services affordable for customers served over them. Moreover, it will 
take time for the FCC to conduct the kind of analysis needed to 
identify those areas where such ongoing support is needed and to 
establish what level of support is necessary to recover capital 
expenses not already covered by grants as well as ongoing operations 
and maintenance costs. The work to examine these questions should not 
await the ``rollout and completion'' of BEAD, but should instead begin 
now.
Paying for Universal Service
    All four critical USF programs--the high-cost mechanisms, Lifeline, 
E-Rate, and the Rural Healthcare program--are paid for by contributions 
from certain service providers based on interstate and international 
telecommunications service and telecommunication revenues as directed 
by Congress in 1996 when it codified the mission of universal service 
in law. Congress rightly recognized that specific, predictable, and 
sufficient support would be difficult, if not impossible, to ensure if 
universal service programs were subject to the twists and turns of 
annual appropriations processes.\5\ Indeed, one now can see the 
prudence of Congress' vision when considering the status of the 
Affordable Connectivity Program (``ACP''). Even as there appears to be 
nearly universal consensus that a program like this is needed and must 
be sustained to achieve important adoption goals, the ACP is at risk of 
running out of funding in short order. If one is looking for ``a canary 
in the coal mine'' when it comes to the perils of attempting to carry 
out a USF-style mission without a stable USF contribution mechanism to 
back it, there may unfortunately be no better case study than the ACP.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(b)(5).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At the same time, the contribution mechanism itself unfortunately 
faces significant challenges, having failed to keep pace with the 
evolution of the communications marketplace. Specifically, the 
``contribution base''--the pool of revenues that are assessed a fee to 
pay for the various USF programs--continues to dwindle over time as 
consumers migrate from traditional telecommunications services (which 
are assessable under the current regime) to other services (such as 
broadband) that are not assessable today. Put another way, the 
contribution crisis is not one of demand in the USF programs, since the 
overall level of funding distributed through them has not increased 
substantially over the past decade-plus. Rather, the problem is one of 
supply, with the contribution base failing to match shifts in how 
consumers use the very networks and services that are supported by the 
USF.
    To ensure that statutory mandates for universal service are met, 
and to comply with the directive by Congress that contributions be 
equitable and nondiscriminatory, updates are badly needed. We are 
grateful therefore for the increasing focus of Congress on this issue. 
NTCA has endorsed the ``The Reforming Broadband Connectivity Act'' 
introduced by Senators Klobuchar, Thune, Hickenlooper, and Moran and 
the House companion bill introduced by Representatives Neguse, 
Fletcher, Craig, Rogers, Grothman, and Gallagher to direct the FCC to 
reform the USF contribution system within one year by expanding the 
contribution base. NTCA has also endorsed ``The FAIR Contributions 
Act'' introduced by Senators Wicker, Lujan, Young, Kelly to direct the 
FCC to study the current and projected data transmission demands on 
rural broadband networks and the costs to rural broadband providers for 
transmitting data.
    Ultimately, in addition to consideration and passage of legislation 
like that described above, I would urge action consistent with 
recommendations that have been previously made by NTCA with respect to 
contribution reform. These recommendations proceed from the singular 
premise that all of those that use or benefit from advanced 
communications networks and services should contribute in some manner 
to ensure their availability, capability, affordability, and 
sustainability. For this reason, NTCA has taken what might be 
considered a ``middle ground'' or ``all of the above'' approach between 
those that look to reform contributions only to assess one group of 
users or another group of beneficiaries. We submit that this 
comprehensive perspective best tracks to the congressional directive to 
ensure that contributions are equitable and nondiscriminatory by 
including all potential users and beneficiaries, and would promote 
``broadening the base'' in a more resilient way that minimizes the 
likelihood of facing another contribution crisis in short order based 
upon future evolutions in the communications marketplace. Specifically, 
NTCA has recommended taking two steps to update the contribution 
mechanism:

  1.  Include Broadband Internet Access Services Within the 
        Contribution Base Now--NTCA helped to lead more than 330 
        parties in submitting a ``Call to Action'' to the FCC in 
        February 2022, urging the FCC to use its existing statutory 
        authority to update the contribution mechanism to include 
        broadband Internet access service revenues within the 
        contribution base.\6\ As that letter and the associated 
        USForward Report explained, such reforms would reduce the 
        contribution factor from a figure that hovers currently around 
        30 percent to less than 4 percent--substantially broadening the 
        base of contributors. Moreover, as several economic reports 
        filed with the FCC have detailed, an assessment at this 
        approximate level would have no material impact on broadband 
        adoption or retention; in other words, customers would be 
        highly unlikely to cancel 100 Mbps broadband service simply 
        because they might face the prospect of a $3 contribution fee 
        attached to that purchase.

Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket Nos. 21-476 and 06-122 
(filed Feb. 14, 2022) (submitting Mattey Consulting, FCC Must Reform 
USF Contributions Now: An Analysis of the Options (Sept. 2021)) 
(``USForward Report'').

     The USForward Report also highlighted several other policy 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        justifications for adopting such reform, including:

      a.  All four programs in the USF promote universal broadband. The 
            revenues from broadband Internet access services should 
            therefore contribute to the USF programs that support the 
            expansion of such services to all. This will better reflect 
            the value of broadband Internet access service in today's 
            marketplace for both consumers and businesses.

      b.  Broadband Internet access service revenues are expected to be 
            stable in the future, with the potential for some modest 
            growth. This would stabilize the funding mechanism and stop 
            the death spiral in the current USF contribution 
            methodology.

      c.  This solution can be implemented quickly under existing 
            authority even as other measures are explored as well by 
            Congress and the FCC.

      d.  Assessing broadband revenues would provide a greater degree 
            of transparency and minimize incentives currently in place 
            for providers to allocate revenues from ``bundled'' 
            offerings between assessable and non-assessable categories.

  2.  Include Other Beneficiaries of Robust Broadband Networks Within 
        the Contribution Base as noted above, NTCA has expressed 
        support for the overarching proposition that all users and 
        beneficiaries of our Nation's broadband networks and services 
        should contribute to the mission of universal service, and this 
        should include large Internet-centric firms whose business 
        model depends heavily upon the networks used to deliver content 
        to users. To be clear, NTCA has never indicated that these 
        entities should bear the cost of this mission solely, nor has 
        NTCA expressed support for unilateral assessment of fees by 
        individual broadband network operators upon such firms. But it 
        is clear that these ``edge providers'' benefit from being able 
        to transmit content and data without having to pay for the full 
        costs of delivery, and they should at the very least be called 
        upon in the public interest to share in the support of these 
        networks and services through equitable and nondiscriminatory 
        contributions to universal service in a manner established by 
        the FCC. We therefore appreciate the attention of Congress as 
        to how this might be achieved and the FCC's authority to do so, 
        and we likewise hope the FCC itself will build upon its initial 
        discussion of these issues in its report to Congress to examine 
        these matters further.
Other Factors that Can Affect the Mission of Universal Service
    While high costs represent the most imposing obstacle to deploying 
and maintaining reliable broadband in rural areas, and while the high-
cost USF program is the linchpin to overcoming this obstacle, other 
factors affect the mission of universal service as well. Several of 
these are discussed below.
Permitting Delays
    Infrastructure investment depends on prompt acquisition or receipt 
of permissions to build networks. Roadblocks, delays, and increased 
costs associated with permitting and approval processes are 
particularly problematic providers of service in rural areas. The 
review procedures can take substantial amounts of time, undermining the 
ability to plan for and deploy broadband infrastructure--especially in 
those areas of the country with shorter construction seasons due to 
climate. Moreover, in some areas of the country, obtaining reasonable 
terms and conditions for attaching network facilities to poles that are 
owned and operated by other entities or crossing railroads can result 
in long delays and costly fees charged to providers seeking to build 
out networks to rural communities lacking service. These can all affect 
both the timing for and economics of deploying networks and ultimately 
delivering on the mission of universal service.
    Navigating complicated application and review processes within 
individual Federal land-managing and property-managing agencies can be 
burdensome for any network provider, but particularly for the smaller 
network operators that serve the most rural portions of the country. 
The lack of coordination and standardization in application and 
approval processes across Federal agencies further complicates the 
deployment of broadband infrastructure. We have seen much agreement for 
some time now on solutions to simplifying the administrative barriers 
to deployment, and we were pleased by discussions at a recent hearing 
before this Subcommittee's counterpart in the House of Representatives 
regarding a variety of draft legislative measures that would look, 
among other things, to streamline environmental and historical reviews 
and establish more meaningful ``shot clocks'' when review is needed.\7\ 
Such measures are critical to the timely and cost-effective deployment 
of networks in rural America, and these therefore should be seen as a 
critical component along with a well-functioning high-cost USF program 
in a comprehensive national universal service strategy.

Broadband Deployment, Hearing before the Subcommittee on 
Communications. & Technology, U.S. House of Representatives (April 19, 
2023) (available at: https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/chairs-
rodgers-latta-announce-legislative-hearing-on-unleashing-u-s-
communications-innovation).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACP
    The Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), which was created and 
funded by Congress to address affordability barriers to broadband 
adoption, is a critical component to help low-income users in rural and 
urban areas alike adopt--and keep adopting each month--broadband 
service. Affordability, however, can be a special challenge--one that 
ACP cannot solve by itself in high-cost areas.
    As previously stated, in rural America, it is often far more costly 
to deploy networks and deliver services, making it harder to deliver 
service that is affordable even to the average consumer, never mind for 
a low-income consumer. For this reason, even as ACP is a critical part 
of the affordability puzzle in rural areas, the Commission's high-cost 
universal service initiatives are important as well in ensuring that, 
as a baseline matter, the average price in rural areas more closely 
resembles those in urban areas-such that ACP can better help solve 
challenges for rural low-income consumers specifically. In this regard, 
the high-cost USF program and programs to address low-income challenges 
are complementary, and we therefore encourage Congress to find ways to 
sustain funding for ACP as well to address the multi-faceted barriers 
to universal service in rural areas.
    On the other hand, while some may claim we should scrap the high-
cost USF program altogether and simply move to a system of distributing 
consumer vouchers or subsidies exclusively, this would undermine the 
comprehensive mission of universal service. Indeed, the idea of 
distributing high-cost USF support via vouchers has been raised 
repeatedly over many years, and at every turn Congress has wisely 
rejected such arguments.\8\ There is no business case to be made for 
millions of dollars of network deployment in areas like those that 
Golden West serves based upon the hope that individual customer 
vouchers will be available and used to pay for service. The high-cost 
USF program, in its fundamental design, provides the kind of 
predictable support necessary for any operator to build networks in 
deeply rural areas, just as Congress intended in first directing its 
creation.

CONCLUSION
    Community-based providers like Golden West are deeply committed to 
the customers we serve and, given our experience and track record of 
success in serving the most rural areas, small community-based 
providers should be seen as critical components of any strategy seeking 
to achieve universal broadband in the United States. We look forward to 
working with policymakers and other stakeholders to ensure that all 
Americans will experience the many benefits of broadband over the best 
possible networks both today and for decades to come.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify, and for the 
Subcommittee's commitment to universal service.

    Senator Lujan. Mr. Law, thank you very much for your 
testimony.
    And next we hear from Mr. Guice, Director, Public 
Knowledge.
    The floor is yours for five minutes, sir.

STATEMENT OF GREG GUICE, DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, PUBLIC 
                           KNOWLEDGE

    Mr. Guice. Chairman Lujan, Ranking Member Thune, thank you 
for inviting me to testify on the State of Universal Service.
    Promoting access for all people to robust affordable 
communications is at the core of Public Knowledge's mission and 
at the core of my 25-year career in this space.
    I want to commend the committee and the Senate for coming 
together on a bipartisan basis to advance our Nation's 
commitment to ensuring all Americans have access to broadband.
    These investments are historic but more remains to be done 
because like our networks, the mission of Universal Service 
continues to evolve.
    We are pleased to learn about the committee's work on a USF 
Working Group, but the FCC, the expert agency Congress has 
charged by Congress with ensuring Universal Service must also 
begin working to meet the goals it laid out in the future of 
USF report.
    Those call for promoting universal deployment, 
affordability, adoption, availability, and equitable access to 
broadband throughout the United States. We could not agree 
more.
    My testimony will focus on three areas: affordability, 
deployment, and funding reform.
    Regarding affordability, the Reagan Administration created 
the Lifeline Program to connect low--income families to the 
phone system because ``access to telephone service has become 
crucial to full participation in our society and economy.'' 
Wow! That sounds really familiar.
    Over the years, the FCC has expanded the program to support 
mobile service and broadband and it's taken concrete steps to 
help ensure those enrolled are eligible. However, the support 
amounts in Lifeline are simply not enough.
    The Affordable Connectivity Program, which Congress 
established in the Infrastructure Act, promotes access to 
broadband for low-income people through a $30 a month subsidy 
amount.
    It's a huge success serving over 17 million families. ACP 
enjoys broad bipartisan support from people in rural, suburban, 
and urban communities, and, interestingly, states represented 
by this committee make up approximately 50 percent of the 
recipients of ACP.
    On the graphic here on the screen, these are the top 10 
states by enrollment numbers. We have another graphic that we 
can put up and it shows the top 10 states by percentage of 
eligible households enrolled in ACP. What these show is this 
program enjoys broad bipartisan take rates across our country.
    But, importantly, ACP promotes benefits for all of us 
because it drives economic opportunity and lowers cost of 
services, such as health care, which, by the way, can help save 
Federal dollars spent on programs, like Medicaid and VA care.
    The ACP is a model for how Lifeline could be recalibrated. 
It provides expanded eligibility and a level of support that 
helps to meaningfully offset the current market price of 
broadband of $45 to $75.
    It also expands opportunities for eligible providers so 
low-income consumers have more choices and it creates stability 
for low-income families, something Dr. Lyons references in his 
remarks.
    At its core, ACP strikes at the Number 1 barrier to 
adoption and that's price. Low-income families will subscribe 
if they have the opportunity to cover those costs.
    Lifeline should be modified and the FCC should start a 
proceeding so that we don't lose the momentum from ACP and 
backslide.
    Regarding High Cost funding, Congress, as I mentioned, 
provided significant funding to reduce the cost of deploying 
networks. It's important to remember, though, that networks are 
not perpetual motion machines. They do require people, 
equipment, maintenance, and upgrades, and the High Cost Program 
must continue to support those expenses.
    There will, however, likely be cost savings, but we should 
use those to meet delayed public interest objectives. For 
example, Public Knowledge has long stressed the need to make 
today's networks more resilient in the face of disaster, 
something I know you care deeply about, Chairman Lujan.
    Unlike the old phone network, today's broadband networks 
shut down when the power grid goes dark. Long-term funding is 
needed to ensure that providers' networks are hardened against 
disasters and that consumers have sufficient backup power to 
get through those power outages.
    In the past, the FCC has used funding to help communities 
ravaged by natural disaster. We would call on the Commission to 
initiate a proceeding to determine how to promote more network 
resiliency.
    Obviously this is a long list and I promise I'm wrapping up 
here. We are more connected than ever but the revenues used to 
meet our critical USF mission are declining and that's because 
they rely on a base of revenue that they've relied on for over 
17 years.
    As others have mentioned, the contribution factor currently 
stands around 30 percent and that makes these disbursement 
challenges even harder. That's why we joined with the 340 
organizations and companies calling for FCC to reform the 
contribution mechanism and include broadband revenue in the 
base. This would lower the factor to 4 percent, potentially 
saving the average consumer that has a VoIP, mobile, and 
broadband connection between $2.60 and $4.50 a month.
    In closing, since Congress originally created the FCC, it 
has always charged it with the Universal Service mission. That 
mission continues to evolve as our networks evolve.
    Closing the Digital Divide is not a one and done effort. It 
takes ongoing work and that ongoing work is the mission of 
Universal Service.
    Thank you and I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Guice follows:]

   Prepared Statement of Greg Guice, Director of Government Affairs, 
                            Public Knowledge
    Chairman Lujan, Ranking Member Thune: Thank you for inviting me to 
testify on the future of universal service. My name is Greg Guice and I 
am the Director of Government Affairs for Public Knowledge, an 
organization that is dedicated to promoting freedom of expression, an 
open internet, and access to affordable communications tools and 
creative works. Over the course of my 24 years of working on 
telecommunications and technology issues, the unique challenge of 
preserving and advancing universal service has always been a part of 
that work and a real passion. Whether it has been helping get broadband 
to our rural and tribal communities, figuring out ways to provide 
telehealth services to families and veterans living in areas that lack 
clinics, helping low-income families get and stay connected or helping 
ensure kids and adults have access to educational resources in their 
schools and libraries, I can say that it is a wonderful career to wake 
up each day knowing that the work you are striving to achieve is trying 
to make people's lives a little better by ensuring they can fully 
participate in our digital society.
    I want to take this opportunity to thank the members of this 
Committee that over the last few years really came together on a 
bipartisan basis to advance our Nation's commitment to ensuring all 
Americans have access to broadband. Congress rightly determined that 
funding to ensure not only broadband access to promote deployment in 
rural and tribal communities was important, but also broadband 
affordability was critical because broadband is an essential 
service.\1\ Congress also included one-time support for digital equity, 
which are designed to ensure that individuals and communities have the 
digital skills to fully participate in the digital economy.\2\ It was 
historic but there is more to do. I am optimistic that working 
together, we can help the universal service mission evolve, as Congress 
acknowledged it must, to meet the new challenges we face.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As we move to the next phase in which broadband funding provided by 
Congress is in the implementation phase, now is the right time to think 
about the current state of the universal service program, the interplay 
between the Congressional funding and USF, and what that might mean for 
potential reforms to ensure that USF adapts to the new changes. Public 
Knowledge believes that there is an important role for Congress to play 
and there is critical work for the FCC to undertake as the expert 
agency charged by Congress with ensuring we achieve the objectives of 
universal service. Today my testimony will focus on three areas, but 
acknowledge that the important work of USF in promoting access for 
schools and libraries as well as rural health care remains vital and 
know other panelists intend to address those programs. We will focus 
on:

  1)  Affordability: The Affordable Connectivity Program has 
        demonstrated how a well crafted program focused on assisting 
        low income families get connected can help meaningfully close 
        the affordability divide. With 17 million families enrolled, it 
        is a huge success. The USF equivalent program, Lifeline, does 
        not come close to that level of adoption. The FCC should 
        consider structural changes to the Lifeline program to ensure 
        that it is better serving low-income families, as the ACP is.

  2)  Deployment: The historic investment and support Congress made in 
        broadband deployment through the IIJA, the ReConnect program, 
        and the Capital Projects Fund will help promote the deployment 
        of robust broadband across the country. The USF equivalent 
        program, the High-Cost program, provides support for costs 
        associated with initial deployment (cap expenditures or capex) 
        and the ongoing costs of maintaining and upgrading networks 
        (operating expenses or opex). The capex support provided by 
        Congress, will, therefore, have an impact on the High-Cost 
        program, but the capex support will not make the High-Cost 
        program irrelevant as it should be available to provide ongoing 
        opex support will still be needed, and the FCC and Congress 
        will need to determine if and where additional capex support 
        that will still be needed. Savings from the reduction in capex 
        could be used to support funding for hardening networks to make 
        them more resilient against ever-increasing natural disasters.

  3)  Funding reform: Of course all of this depends on stability in the 
        funding base for USF. Appropriations can play an important 
        role, but given their temporary nature, they are not a good fit 
        for the long term investments that are needed to advance 
        universal connectivity. Instead, a structure like the one 
        established by Congress for ongoing support that is 
        ``predictable and sufficient,'' is what is needed. That is why 
        it is also important that the USF funding mechanism, which is 
        in dire need of reform, needs to be addressed. At a time when 
        people are more connected than they have ever been, our 
        universal service program is seeing a decline in the 
        communications revenues it relies on to advance this critical 
        mission. That fact alone should be enough to demonstrate the 
        contribution mechanism is broken. If we do not fix the 
        contribution mechanism, ``preserving and advancing universal 
        service'' as Congress has directed is an infinitely harder 
        task.
Low Income Families Need A Program that Provides Assistance with 
        Obtaining Broadband
    The Affordable Connectivity Program established by Congress and 
administered by the Commission is a huge success, serving 40 million 
individuals representing 17 million families.\4\ In fact, the states 
represented on this Committee account for almost 50 percent of 
enrollments with an almost even split amongst the two parties--
Republican represented states having slightly more families enrolled 
with 4.5 million families than Democratic represented states, which 
have 3.9 million families enrolled. ACP is a program that enjoys broad 
public support in rural, suburban and urban areas across the country. 
We also know from data that ACP is having a meaningful impact on those 
families, increasing employment rates and creating economic benefits of 
$2,200 annually and helping lower the cost of healthcare by as much as 
$141 per visit, which should help save Federal dollars for health care 
provided through Medicaid.\5\ Unfortunately, the ACP was funded with 
limited resources and recent projections have the program running out 
of funding by this time next year.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This is why reforming the Lifeline program is so important. The 
Communications Act provides the Commission with great flexibility in 
developing the Lifeline program and the ACP provides clear lessons for 
the reforms to the program that Public Knowledge and others support. 
Section 254(h) provides that ``[n]othing in this section shall affect 
the collection, distribution, or administration of the Lifeline 
Assistance Program provided for by the Commission under regulations set 
forth in section 69.117 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, and 
other related sections of such title.'' \7\

Conference Report, 104th Cong, 2nd Sess., S. Rept. 104-230 at 134.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The adoption of the ACP lays out for the Commission a renewed model 
for how low-income support could be recalibrated. It provides for 
expanded eligibility, including a higher 200 percent or below Federal 
poverty guideline and a broader list of other eligible assistance 
programs than allowed under the existing Lifeline program. It provides 
a level of support that is equivalent to about half of the current 
market price of service ($61.07) and provides flexibility for 
recipients to determine the level of broadband connectivity that suits 
their needs.\8\ It also expands opportunities for eligible providers 
that are not designated as eligible telecommunications carriers, so 
low-income consumers may have more choices in markets where there are 
options. What ACP has demonstrated is something we have all known, 
price is a major barrier to broadband adoption and once given the 
support they need, low-income families will subscribe.\9\

Research Center (2021) (finding that 20 percent cite cost as the 
primary reason for not having broadband and 45 percent citing it as a 
reason for not having broadband).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As we consider the future of Lifeline, the Commission should 
consider initiating a proceeding focused on modifications to the 
Lifeline programs to more closely match the ACP. The Commission should 
consider expanding Lifeline's eligibility so low-income families that 
are eligible under ACP but not Lifeline can continue to subscribe to 
and receive support for broadband service at the level provided under 
the ACP. Additionally, the Commission should continue to work to ensure 
that the enrollment process is as streamlined as possible. As the GAO 
found, nearly 68 percent of consumers required to go through the manual 
process of verification abandon that process.\10\ In the IIJA, Congress 
acknowledged the need for data matching to occur and included 
provisions that direct certain Federal agencies to enter into memoranda 
of understanding with the Universal Service Administration to 
facilitate the sharing of data through the National Verifier.\11\ That 
work is underway by the Commission and it should help the Commission 
effectuate the transition from ACP.

Connectivity Program, WC Docket No. 21-450
    \11\ Infrastructure Act Sec. 60502(e).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Public Knowledge acknowledges that this would be a substantial 
increase to the current Lifeline budget and the Universal Service fund 
as a whole, but we firmly believe that given the broader economic 
benefits connectivity promotes for lower-income families, this is a 
step the Commission should consider taking to ensure the strides made 
through ACP remain as such and we do not backslide on getting more 
people connected. Affordability will remain a persistent challenge for 
low-income consumers and our universal service programs must address 
affordability.
Infrastructure Funding Takes Some Pressure off the High-Cost Program, 
        But Maintenance, Upgrades and Other Operating Expenses and 
        Other Potential Opportunities Should be the Future Focus
    The work Congress did in the IIJA and in other bills last Congress 
represents a substantial step forward in addressing the access 
challenges that have plagued our country for decades. Congress 
allocated $42.5 billion in the IIJA, $1.9 billion for ReConnect, and a 
portion of the $10 billion allocated for broadband as part of the 
Treasury Department's Capital Projects Fund. Funding provided through 
these and past efforts by the Commission do not mean that the need for 
the High-Cost program has ended. There will likely be gaps where 
deployment funding will be needed and those will need to be completed. 
As those areas reduce, however, the Commission should transition the 
High-Cost program to address current needs, upgrading and maintaining 
networks and expanding the funding to include hardening networks to 
make them more resilient against ever-increasing natural disasters.
    Networks do not run themselves; they require people, equipment, 
maintenance, and upgrades. These are the operating expenses a provider 
will incur in delivering service to their community. These expenses 
will still play a critical role in ensuring rural and Tribal 
communities remain served. As the Commission looks at reforming the 
High-Cost fund, it should take these substantial expenses into account. 
The capital expenditures for many providers may indeed decline as a 
result of the funding provided through the IIJA and as with the 
Lifeline program reforms recommended above, the Commission should 
consider using savings from that capital infusion to achieve other 
public interest objectives.
    As Public Knowledge has urged at the Commission and before this 
Subcommittee, the decentralized, low-cost, and competitive broadband 
infrastructure using Internet protocol that comprise our networks means 
that hundreds of millions of Americans no longer have access to 
communication services that can operate when their provider experiences 
an outage or the power grid goes dark. When a consumer's provider loses 
service or access to power today, communications--and their life-saving 
messages--cease. The IIJA provides for some opportunity to build 
resiliency, but the Commission's High-Cost program could be the type of 
long-term funding source needed to ensure that providers' networks are 
hardened against disaster and that consumers have backup power 
sufficient to get them through power outages often associated with 
disasters. The FCC has dispersed USF funds on an ad hoc basis to help 
communities particularly ravaged by natural disasters, such as 
Hurricane Maria.\12\ The Commission should consider initiating a 
proceeding to determine how best to account for upgrading our 
communications networks through USF high-cost reforms to promote more 
resilient networks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ See Press Release, ``FCC Advances Up to $76.9 Million to 
Restore Communications Networks in Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands 
Devastated By Maria,'' released October 4, 2017. Available at: https://
docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-347069A1.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The High-Cost program should be viewed as the means by which the 
Commission delivers the robust, reliable networks needed in those high 
cost communities across the country. It will remain an ongoing and 
vital component to achieving our universal service objectives.
Contribution Reform is Essential to Achieving Universal Service
    Of course any expansion like the ones outlined above, and those 
that should be part of updating the Schools and Libraries program and 
Rural Health Care program, are contingent on a USF contribution 
mechanism that provides policymakers the sufficiency to make those 
determinations. Unfortunately, that is not the case today. The USF 
contribution mechanism still relies on revenue from the same base of 
telephone and related telecommunications services that it relied on for 
the past 17 years. That source of revenues has declined by almost 50 
percent since 2011, according to revenue data submitted to the FCC. 
Think about that, during the ``information revolution'' and surge in 
our ``connected economy,'' the USF has been supported by the one 
segment of that revolution that is declining, while communications 
service revenues overall have been increasing. The impact of that 
reverberates throughout the programs USF supports. With a current 
contribution factor exceeding 30 percent, making any modifications to 
update the various disbursement programs to better reflect today's 
challenges to achieving universal service are unthinkable if it would 
require any increase in funding.
    As outlined above, today's efforts of USF are focused on providing 
access to affordable, ubiquitous broadband, the essential 
communications service of our time. Many programs intended to promote 
broadband deployment and adoption could be sustainably funded through 
USF, if that fund expanded its base and decreased the contribution 
factor. For example, if the Commission expanded the base of assessable 
revenues to include broadband revenues, it could reduce the 
contribution factor from the more than 30 percent level it is at today 
to under 4 percent. Such an expansion is supported by a broad array of 
stakeholders as demonstrated in the letter Public Knowledge, INCOMPAS, 
NTCA and over 332 organizations filed with the FCC last year.\13\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Commission could also take a look at services that are 
substitutes for traditional telecommunications services to see if they 
should be assessed to ensure competitive neutrality. As the Commission 
explained in the Order back in 2006 that expanded the base to include 
interconnected VoIP services in the USF contribution base, 
``competitive neutrality means that universal service support 
mechanisms and rules neither unfairly advantage nor disadvantage one 
provider over another, and neither unfairly favor nor disfavor one 
technology over another.'' \14\ Where a service is a substitute to a 
traditional telecommunications service and it nonetheless is not 
considered assessable under the existing contribution mechanism, the 
Commission should conduct a proceeding to consider including those 
revenues in the base. Such a step can reduce distortions in the 
offering of services, particularly a number of business services where 
these distortions can reflect significant reductions in revenue to the 
fund.

    The mission of universal service is far too important to continue 
to hold its funding mechanism hostage to gamesmanship. Further delay 
robs the Commission of a critical tool in helping to close the digital 
divide. As the letter referenced above demonstrates, while there may be 
a handful of companies that do not want the Commission to move forward, 
there is a diverse and overwhelming majority of stakeholders calling 
for the Commission to undertake this reform.
CONCLUSION
    The Commission, as noted above, has since its inception had a 
universal service mandate from Congress. Before the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996, that system was an accounting mechanism within the 
monopoly Bell system. Funding needed to pay for the cost was made 
through access charges paid by long distance companies to local 
companies for originating and terminating calls on the local provider's 
network. In its effort to promote competition while also advancing 
universal service, Congress rightly concluded that the system for 
advancing universal service must be one based on explicit support 
mechanisms instead of implicit support mechanisms. From that directive 
came the modern USF programs. A codification of the mission and 
principles the FCC is to follow in advancing universal service, as well 
as a means by which the Commission, as the expert agency and as it had 
always done, would go about funding and achieving that mission.
    As the Commission assured Congress in its USF report, the 
Commission's duty for the future of the USF is ``maintaining new and 
existing networks, promoting equitable access in underserved 
communities and populations, and ensuring sufficient support for the 
ever-expanding broadband needs of schools, libraries, and health care 
providers.'' Closing the digital divide is not a one-and-done effort; 
it takes ongoing work and that work is the work of the USF.
    Thank you. I am pleased to answer any questions you may have.

    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Mr. Guice. I appreciate that very 
much.
    My allergies are having their way with me this morning. I 
apologize.
    We'll now go to questions from members, as well, and I'll 
start by recognizing myself for 5 minutes.
    I want to start with a yes or no question to the panel. Yes 
or no, is preserving the Universal Service Fund important? Mr. 
Chavez?
    Mr. Chavez. Yes, it is. Without the Universal Service Fund, 
students like ours wouldn't have connectivity and would never 
be able to be part of the 21st Century. Along with that, there 
are other struggles but at least this is that first step to 
getting our students on track with other students in the 
Nation.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you.
    Ms. Kronenberg?
    Ms. Kronenberg. Yes, it is absolutely necessary to continue 
USF.
    Senator Lujan. Appreciate that.
    Mr. Lyons?
    Mr. Lyons. Yes, I think it absolutely is, and I think 
that's part of the reason why it's important for us to study 
the Universal Service Program to make sure that it's following 
through on its promises.
    Senator Lujan. Mr. Law?
    Mr. Law. Yes, absolutely.
    Senator Lujan. Mr. Guice?
    Mr. Guice. Absolutely.
    Senator Lujan. Well, I very much appreciate that and that's 
certainly a shared goal that we all have and I'm excited to 
hear that.
    Mr. Chavez, one, thank you for the work that you've done 
for the school district, for the students and the faculty 
there, as well, and really for the betterment of the community.
    You've shared how crucial E-Rate funding is and what a 
difference it made and how innovative you're able to be around 
the school district.
    Mr. Chavez, Cuba's graduation rate increased from 70 
percent in 2019 to 95 percent in 2021, is that right?
    Mr. Chavez. That is correct.
    Senator Lujan. At the same time the number of student 
nearly doubled to 750 students, is that correct?
    Mr. Chavez. That is correct.
    Senator Lujan. And do you attribute part of that increase 
to the E-Rate at the FCC?
    Mr. Chavez. Yes, with both questions, the money provided 
through ECF especially during the pandemic led students to 
being engaged even while they were off campus and remote and 
the money has just really made a huge impact on our students.
    Senator Lujan. I very much appreciate that. I think that's 
significant evidence to the importance of these programs and 
especially in a rural school district, not just in New Mexico 
but throughout America.
    Thank you for that.
    Mr. Guice, I want to turn to you to talk about the 
importance of the Rural Health Program across America. Today 
marks the official end of the Public Health Emergency due to 
COVID-19, but this program remains vital to ensuring that our 
rural health providers can serve their patients remotely.
    Mr. Guice, why is remote access to health care service so 
vital even as we come out of the COVID-19 pandemic?
    Mr. Guice. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    You know, in Rural America and tribal areas, we're losing 
our hospitals. We're losing our health clinics. Telehealth is 
literally a lifeline to allowing those folks to stay in their 
communities and even without a pandemic, we need to recognize 
that telehealth is a great way for people to ensure that they 
get the health care that they need.
    It also has the benefit of saving costs. So that's a good 
thing for our Federal programs, as well. But, yes, this remains 
a vital program. I would say, you know, if you look for 
success, Alaska has been one of the largest recipients of the 
Rural Health Care Program and the connectivity and telehealth 
that's been afforded in that state has truly saved a lot of 
those very remote tribal communities.
    Senator Lujan. And, Mr. Guice, as a follow up, I'm curious 
with the way you described that.
    Do you think that there should be funding to expand 
connectivity in patients' homes, given what we've learned 
during COVID, especially in the area of mental health?
    I've really been pleasantly surprised at the increase in 
patients that kept their appointments or were able to speak to 
a specialist as a result of these investments.
    Mr. Guice. Absolutely. I think the efficiencies for doctors 
to have appointments that aren't missed, those can't go 
unstated, and as you know in your state and other states and in 
the Southwest, people literally have to drive like a hundred 
miles just to get to an appointment and if they had 
connectivity in their home, imagine the time savings and the 
cost savings of those sorts of trips. I think it's absolutely 
something that should be expanded.
    Senator Lujan. Appreciate that.
    Ms. Kronenberg, many of your members provide broadband 
access and service to low-income customers. Some of these 
Americans may depend on Lifeline for connectivity. Others may 
already have broadband services but instead go without other 
necessities, like healthy food, in exchange for connectivity.
    Ms. Kronenberg, can you briefly describe how affordability 
fits into the mission of Universal Service?
    Ms. Kronenberg. Thank you so much for that question.
    Yes, this isn't just about deploying networks to make sure 
that every customer can access a network. We also need to 
address the affordability issue.
    There are a couple of ways that the USF already encourages 
such affordability. We've talked a little bit about them. 
Lifeline is one of them, but Lifeline was devised during the 
Reagan Administration to be a voice subsidy and it did a very 
good job in meeting that need and over time the FCC did evolve 
that program, but what we have seen is that it wasn't really 
sufficient to ensure that consumers who are low-income could 
get on to a robust broadband service to really meet their 
family's needs.
    Congress addressed this. This really came to light during 
COVID-19. So Congress set first the Emergency Broadband Benefit 
and then a longer-term program, the Affordable Connectivity 
Program. That is separate and apart from what USF is already 
doing to address the affordability.
    It is needed and what we know is that customers are taking 
it. Close to 18 million households are in the ACP Program as 
compared to around seven million households who still take the 
Lifeline Program. Lifeline is 90 percent mobile connectivity. 
The ACP we're seeing more consumers take the home product, 
something that is more robust, gives them more speed, allows 
their kids to do their homework, allows them to do telehealth 
from home.
    So it is really important and I just want to warn you all 
that what we're seeing with this current take rate is that the 
ACP funding may run out by the first half of next year. So 
we've been working with the Significantly Sized coalition to 
bring light to the good that the ACP is doing and then the need 
for Congress to act to provide additional funding to assure 
that these low-income consumers won't get disconnected.
    Thank you.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Ms. Kronenberg.
    I have other questions, but I'll try to get to them later 
in the hearing.
    Next, we're going to hear from Senator Wicker. Senator 
Wicker, pleasure, sir.

                STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER, 
                 U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI

    Senator Wicker. Thank you very much.
    There seems to be unanimity among the panel that we can't 
do without the USF. I think the question is how will we put the 
money in the USF? Is that formula that was enacted before our 
current era, is that still fair?
    So let me ask this. Big tech is a primary beneficiary of 
where we are now in the Internet and that's an alphabet. Apple, 
Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix account for over 56 percent of 
all global data traffic over the past year.
    In addition, traditional beneficiaries of the USF Programs 
are just five video streaming entertainment providers, Netflix, 
YouTube, Amazon Prime, Disney+Hulu, and Microsoft Xbox. They 
drive 75 percent of the total network traffic.
    I think I'm correct on those facts, but correct me if I'm 
wrong and yet a disproportionate amount of the contribution to 
USF comes from land-lined-owned users.
    So, you know, probably most of my staff back in their 
condos and apartments and homes don't have a landline any more, 
but grandma and grandpa out on Route 3 New Albany, Mississippi, 
still have a landline.
    Is it time to ask the question and is it fair for grandma 
and grandpa to be paying a disproportionate amount of the 
contribution to USF when so many other people benefit? Mr. 
Guice, you seem to want to jump in there, and then we'll let 
other people volunteer.
    Mr. Guice. Senator, you have made the exact right point. 
The current contribution mechanism is burdening the very people 
that we should not be burdening, our older Americans.
    We haven't reformed the mechanism to account for new 
technologies that have come online since we last updated it 17 
years ago. So right now we have older people who are larger 
subscribers to home phone service bearing the burden of this 
program.
    Senator Wicker. What's the solution?
    Mr. Guice. So what we've suggested and agreed with 340 
organizations on, at least part of that solution involves 
including broadband Internet access service revenues in the 
base, and what that has the benefit of doing, Senator, is 
lowering the current contribution vector from 30 percent to 4 
percent.
    What it would do for that older American family, if you 
look at their bill, if they take VoIP, let's say, and they pay 
$30 a month, they pay approximately $6 for USF. This would 
lower that down to pennies and so that's a significant saving 
if all they do is take phone service.
    Senator Wicker. So who would like to take Mr. Guice on? Ms. 
Kronenberg, perhaps you'd like to supplement what he said.
    Ms. Kronenberg. I was going to supplement, but if you would 
want----
    Senator Wicker. No, please go ahead, yes.
    Ms. Kronenberg. Thank you so much, Senator, because I think 
that this is a really important issue.
    The contribution factor is incredibly high today and we 
have been working with Public Knowledge and NTCA and Golden 
West on bringing a solution to the FCC that it currently has 
the ability, the jurisdiction to address this issue so that 
those who are facing this high contribution factor will see it 
lowered.
    Carol Maddy, a former FCC official and USF expert, has 
recommended that we expand the base to include broadband 
Internet revenues.
    USF is being used largely to support the business case for 
broadband providers and affordable broadband service. 
Historically, the USF has always been paid for based upon the 
services that it supports.
    Senator Wicker. And your position is that this can be done 
without a statutory change?
    Ms. Kronenberg. That's correct.
    Senator Wicker. In 30 seconds, who wants to jump in? Mr. 
Lyons?
    Mr. Lyons. I'll take the bait. Thanks.
    Yes. So I think you're exactly right that the existing 
funding mechanism is unsustainable, but I think that simply 
adding to the denominator is like rearranging the deck chairs 
on the Titanic. It doesn't solve the larger problem, the 
structural problems with the Universal Service that lead to a 
growing numerator over a denominator that changes on a regular 
basis.
    I think whether you're talking about just adding broadband 
providers or adding edge providers and how you define that, I'm 
not entirely sure, once you start taxing those services, you 
create structural incentives that rearrange the way the 
Internet works and ways that we can't predict in advance.
    I think it's much cleaner to simply make the Universal 
Service Program an on budget program like through 
appropriations. That would subject the program to a hard budget 
oversight from Congress and reign in some of those structural 
incentives that have led the contribution factor to explode to 
where it's at today.
    Senator Wicker. Ms. Kronenberg?
    Ms. Kronenberg. I would just like to supplement the answer 
that was provided. It is important to look at the current 
statute.
    The FCC is actually required to have sufficient and 
predictable support for USF. So a change to appropriations 
likely is going to require a change in their statute and we 
have been working with a very large coalition to drive more 
consensus for an approach for the FCC to move forward.
    I'm really happy to say we have so many stakeholders that 
do agree the FCC can move forward and we think this is largely 
going to address the problem that you so well identified.
    Senator Wicker. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, we're at 6 
minutes. So I want to thank you for your indulgence.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Senator.
    Next, we're going to hear from the Chair of the Full 
Committee, Senator Cantwell.

               STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding 
this subcommittee hearing, and I wanted to ask Mr. Guice about 
spectrum in general, about Public Knowledge's letter to the FCC 
expressing concern over the delay in issuing the 2.5 gigahertz 
licenses.
    What is the--how does this affect customers and rollout of 
wireless broadband?
    Mr. Guice. Senator, thank you for the question. We did 
recently file with the FCC on this very issue because the 
impact to consumers on not issuing these licenses is real.
    T-Mobile, who is the winner of the auction that gets these 
licenses, is relying on these to build out its 5G network in a 
lot of small and rural markets. So as an initial matter, this 
really helps get connectivity to our rural communities.
    But, second, it's also going to be used to help them better 
compete in a market where we have just a handful of providers. 
So these licenses are critical to making certain that T-Mobile 
is a solid competitor in our wireless space.
    The Chair. So we're basically hurting our own process of 
getting spectrum out because of this?
    Mr. Guice. Yes, absolutely.
    The Chair. Well, thank you for your letter. I also wanted 
to ask you about Middle Mile. Last October NTIA announced it 
received 235 applications, nearly 5.5 billion in Middle Mile 
requests.
    As you know, we've all been working, the Chair of the 
Subcommittee, our colleague, Senator Rosen, and many others on 
expanding Middle Mile. The demand, in my opinion, is not 
surprising. We should be doing more. There are numerous 
examples of partnerships I think all over the United States 
between utilities and broadband providers and there are places 
from Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, West Virginia, Mississippi, and 
my home state of Washington. I love the example of people 
working together up on Orcas Island.
    So you could see that there are people that want to have 
service. I introduced legislation with Senator Capito that 
would leverage the existing grid to produce cost-efficient 
resilient fire--proof Middle Mile broadband networks and this 
legislation, I think, would create thousands of jobs.
    It's kind of what I think most of our colleagues didn't 
quite understand when we were doing the broadband--well, let's 
just say it's one of the hazards, I think, when people try to 
look at this in an isolated way. So so glad the Chairman is 
having this broader hearing.
    So what additional investments do you think we need to open 
up Middle Mile and how can this help us build out faster the 
services that we want to build?
    Mr. Guice. Senator, you've rightly described the 
oversubscription and the applications on Middle Mile to the 
NTIA.
    You know, Middle Mile is one of those critical elements of 
a network that is expensive and is not covered by USF, except 
in Alaska where they do cover it given the unique high cost 
there.
    So what I would--you know, one of the things that we've 
talked about--you know, our tribal communities where they have 
to literally go through various permitting processes to build 
that line, plus the rugged terrain, plus every factor that 
results in tribal and rural areas, these are critical 
investments that we need to make, recognizing that the last 
mile doesn't work unless the middle mile is present.
    And so I don't know a specific dollar amount, but what I do 
know is that we need to do more. We supported your legislation 
just as we would support USF being expanded to try to address 
some of the tribal middle mile challenges that are particularly 
holding back those communities from getting connectivity.
    The Chair. How do you think this is going to be a solution 
in urban areas, too, where people haven't provided--I mean, to 
me,--well, I'll let you answer the question.
    Mr. Guice. In our urban environments, you know, we need--
middle mile can also be a competitive choke point and so having 
more competition and more access to middle mile, more choices 
for providers so that they can serve their customers with those 
choices is also a way to foster competition in those 
environments and so, look, we're supportive.
    You know, I think in terms of support amounts with Federal 
dollars, it might be a little bit more of a difficult challenge 
to say that we need to fund those in urban environments, but it 
is a piece of the competition equation.
    The Chair. Can you describe what is needed in the urban 
area because I think I can, but could you--do you think you 
can?
    Mr. Guice. So oftentimes we think of urban as fully 
connected and the truth of the matter is when we look down at a 
more granular level, our urban communities often suffer from 
similar problems as rural communities.
    There are lower-income neighborhoods that simply are built 
to--are still relying on an old copper network to bring them, 
you know, slow broadband and without those upgrades that are 
necessary, you know, those communities suffer just as much as 
residents in rural areas.
    The Chair. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Next, we're going to hear from Senator Vance. Senator 
Vance, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

                STATEMENT OF HON. J. D. VANCE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Vance. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thanks to the Ranking 
Member and to everybody else.
    This is a great set of information and obviously I think 
all this care about the Universal Service Program and we all 
believe in it and certainly it's very important to the people 
of Ohio.
    I want to pick up where Senator Wicker left off because I 
think he raises a number of really interesting questions and, 
you know, as he's pointed out, others I'm sure will point out, 
Universal Service Fund is simply not on the sustainable fiscal 
trajectory for a simple reason. It taxes an ever-shrinking base 
of legacy technologies to subsidize the growth of newer and 
more popular technology.
    It's like taxing horseshoes to pay for the highway system, 
right, and the results are disastrous. Americans, especially 
older and lower-income consumers, are paying more for their 
phone bills, even as the fund grows less solvent.
    Now I'm new to this committee. So I come at this with a 
fresh set of eyes, but I think it's fair to say the time to 
fiddle with the program is behind us. We should actually think 
for a much more significant overhaul. We in Congress should 
give FCC guidance to update and overhaul the antiquated funding 
scheme.
    Now I'm very interested in FCC Commissioner Carr's proposal 
and Senator Wicker has talked a bit about this. He's outlined a 
proposal that strikes me as common sense and the basic idea, as 
we've just heard, is to tax the edge companies, sort of the 
newer technology providers, the people who benefit the most 
from the expansion of broadband, that is, the big tech firms 
who've enjoyed a free ride on the rural broadband so far. They 
should pay their fair share and contribute to the USF.
    I know, Mr. Lyons, you have some concerns with that and I 
know others on the panel are supportive of that.
    So maybe where I'd start here is before getting into 
whether we think that's a good idea and what the downsides of 
it are, I'm actually interested in a slightly different angle 
on this because Senator Wicker has unpacked some of that.
    So if the rules and fees were set up in such a way that the 
edge companies were paying for broadband deployment, would they 
not then have basis to require that the broadband provider 
carry their traffic neutrally and so a lot of the questions 
that we talk about and the concerns that we have about big tech 
censorship and whether they're more biased toward one political 
movement or another, I wonder if this is actually the basis of 
a slightly broader bargain here where, look, if they're taxed 
to pay for this fundamentally important service, we should 
expect them not to discriminate against the various providers 
and people who use that service.
    I'm just curious. I ask sort of that question first to Ms. 
Kronenberg and then I'd love, Mr. Lyons, to get your thoughts, 
too.
    Ms. Kronenberg. Thank you so much for that question, 
Senator.
    I think it's important to recognize the significant 
investment that tech is making to bring global connectivity. 
They invest in data centers, submarine cables, the 
interconnection points with the ISPs, and the notion that 
they're not paying into a system that supports global 
connectivity to all of these customers, whether they're 
residential or business customers, is really incorrect.
    None of the investments that tech is making every year gets 
support from the Universal Service Fund. We think that you need 
to really scrutinize the ideas that have been coming because 
there could really be ill effects and unknown problems.
    I'm going to give you one example.
    Senator Vance. Please.
    Ms. Kronenberg. Today the FCC doesn't have authority over 
edge providers and changing the statute to give them such 
authority really, I think, could open a Pandora's box.
    It also potentially could long delay the much-needed USF 
reform, even when we have so many who agree with what the FCC 
could do to stabilize the program. So that's a problem.
    But I also wanted to point out one more problem to you and 
that is this. What we're seeing is that there are a number of 
pro-innovative services and applications that are being 
delivered online.
    This is why people want broadband service, right?
    Senator Vance. Sure.
    Ms. Kronenberg. That's why they're willing to purchase it 
because they want all of these great applications and you know 
what? It's saving them money. Here's an example. More people 
are adopting video streaming services today than ever before, 
myself included, right?
    But they're competing in a highly competitive video 
marketplace. Netflix competes for the eyeballs against 
traditional cable service, broadcasters and direct broadcast 
satellite service, and no one's talking about how potential USF 
fee on these streamers is going to tilt the marketplace in a 
way that's going to make it less attractive for customers to be 
willing to take that streaming service.
    Senator Vance. Thank you, Ms. Kronenberg.
    Mr. Lyons, we're short on time, but I'd love to get 30 
seconds of thoughts from you, as well.
    Mr. Lyons. Yes. I want to second the point that edge 
providers aren't free riding on the network in the sense that 
they pay transit fees to the networks that carry their traffic 
through to consumers.
    `We learned that with Comcast/Netflix dispute in 2014-2015 
when Comcast changed the fees they were charging to Netflix and 
in exchange Netflix just created its own private network. They 
set up data centers closer to home and rerouted around the 
public internet.
    That's the kind of unintended consequences I was referring 
to earlier.
    Senator Vance. Sure.
    Mr. Lyons. When you start taxing one part of the network 
and not another, there are unintended consequences that can be 
efficient or may be inefficient, but you want it to be driven 
by the economics, not by regulatory policy.
    Senator Vance. Yes. That's fair. I appreciate that, Mr. 
Lyons. I take to heart your point that this can be under-
inclusive and maybe it's sort of a broader way to do this that 
actually is responsive and accurately characterizes what the 
market looks like, but I kind of like taking the fundamental 
structure of the old program, applying it to the new 
technologies.
    The question of how to do that is sort of an open one, but, 
Mr. Chair, thank you.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Senator Vance.
    Senator Peters, you're cleared for 5 minutes.

                STATEMENT OF HON. GARY PETERS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN

    Senator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to each 
of our witnesses for being here today.
    Mr. Law, as you're aware from your experience and certainly 
I hear from Rural Michigan providers regularly, especially from 
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which is extremely rural, the high 
cost of broadband deployments also necessitate ongoing support 
to maintain those networks. So that means our investment in 
building out rural broadband is only the first step to ensuring 
that these communities have service into the future.
    So I know you spoke about this in some of your testimony, 
but I'd like you to expand on why ongoing maintenance of 
broadband networks is especially critical in extremely rural or 
hard-to-build areas and how essential it is that the USF can 
continue to play a role in supporting that type of network 
sustainability.
    Mr. Law. Thank you, Senator Peters.
    You've hit on really a key foundation I think of what 
Universal Service helps accomplish for rural providers, such as 
Golden West, which is the initial act of deploying the network. 
It's great. It's a lot of fun to bring improved services to 
customers.
    However, the economies that come with that when you're 
dealing with in my example, in Golden West's case, the 
economies that come with the customer density of one and a half 
customers per mile of facility, and our network in South Dakota 
spans roughly 14,000 network miles, route miles.
    So one and a half customers per mile of network, there are 
higher maintenance costs. There are not customer revenues to 
support those ongoing maintenance costs as well as there will 
be components in the network that will need to be upgraded over 
the years, not every year but over the years. The electronics 
and the other items over the life of that network and again 
there are not sufficient customer revenues, particularly in 
rural areas, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Rural South 
Dakota, where we are predominantly rural consumers, not large 
business, not large business customers. It's consumers, whether 
it be farms or small communities don't generate the type of 
revenues that will ever be able to sustain that USF fills that 
key role.
    Senator Peters. You're right. Thank you.
    Mr. Chavez, thank you for your testimony here today and as 
you may have seen, in September 2022, the FBI, the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and multistate 
Information-Sharing and Analysis Center released a Joint 
Cybersecurity Advisory Warning that a group known as the Vice 
Society are targeting the education sector with ransomware 
attacks and the agencies anticipate that these attacks are only 
going to increase through this year and years forward.
    In November of last year, a ransomware attack in Michigan 
forced schools in Jackson and Hillsdale Counties to close for 3 
days. That's why I passed the K-12 Cybersecurity Act in the 
last Congress to direct Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agencies to seek out solutions to this very 
significant problem.
    Mr. Chavez, my question for you is how has your school 
district moved to tackle cybersecurity concerns and what 
additional help can the Federal Government do to aid the 
efforts for districts like yours?
    Mr. Chavez. My school district has combated ransomware and 
other viruses with antivirus software. Currently, there is a 
program rule that does not in any way allow for school 
districts to purchase antivirus software, firewalls or allowed, 
which is part of the security and content filters, but the 
actual software that is installed on all the end user units is 
in a fundable piece of E-Rate.
    So if that rule change could be made and schools would be 
able to purchase antivirus software, like Sofos, which is the 
one we use, that would make a huge impact on school districts.
    Senator Peters. Right. Thank you.
    Ms. Kronenberg, with funding projects to run out by the 
middle of next year, the Affordability Connectivity Program, 
ACP, is top of mind for many folks in my state.
    Overall, Michigan's enrollment rate at ACP is at almost 44 
percent of eligible households and due to the tireless efforts, 
I will say, of our state agencies and local organizations, like 
Connect 313, Detroit actually has one of the highest rates of 
enrollment in ACP of any metro area in the Nation with 61 
percent of eligible households.
    So my question for you is can you describe how your members 
have benefited from ACP alongside underserved communities and 
do you think a sustainable USF fund could be used to help fund 
the Affordable Connectivity Program in the long term?
    Ms. Kronenberg. Thank you so much for that very important 
question.
    Yes, INCOMPAS' competitive network provider members, they 
are using the ACP to better meet their customer needs in their 
communities.
    What we have heard from them is that this is operating 
expenses that they can now use to pay for the debt that they 
have on the networks that they built.
    They also are looking at it from the context of how they're 
going to participate in the upcoming Capital Projects Fund and 
BEAD. So those are the deployment programs that Congress has 
funded.
    I think it's really important to note a study that recently 
came out from BCG. They were looking at the impact of ACP and 
they've concluded that it reduces the necessary subsidy to 
deploy networks in rural areas by 25 percent per household.
    So what does that mean? We spend $360 per year in ACP per 
household. That's a savings of $500 per location in deployment. 
So this is another reason why we think it's really important 
for Congress this year to be looking at funding the ACP Program 
more long term because it likely will run out the first half of 
next year.
    With respect to your second question, is it possible we 
could fold the ACP into the USF system, we think it may be 
possible? We also think it's very important that the FCC move 
forward on contribution reform before it did that because there 
would be an exponential increase in the contribution factor if 
they had not addressed contribution before reform before 
putting ACP into the program.
    There may be some legal issues that also need to be worked 
through since it was Congress that created the ACP, not the 
FCC, through the USF. So I think we'll need to be consulting 
with lawyers and talking about what congressional legislation 
might be necessary in order to do that.
    Senator Peters. Right. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Lujan. We'll hear from Senator Moran. You're 
recognized for 5 minutes.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Chairman, thank you, and thanks to our 
witnesses for being here.
    I've worked to try to make certain that we don't duplicate 
in geographic areas the dollars that are coming from a variety 
of now Federal programs. NTIA, Rural Utility Services at USDA, 
FCC.
    What's the circumstance that is out there, Mr. Law perhaps 
and Professor Lyons? Is there enough coordination or do we see 
continued evidence that we might be duplicating programs?
    Mr. Lyons. I think you can never have too much 
coordination, Senator. I think that it is incumbent on both the 
governing entities that are distributing those funds as well as 
outreach to potentially local providers or others in those 
areas to determine what is and isn't available.
    So I would say there continues to be, I'll say, issues that 
arise from different funding programs and I would hope there 
would be more coordination in the future and certainly not 
less.
    Senator Moran. Professor, anything to add?
    Mr. Law. Yes. You're exactly right. There's a wide range of 
these particular programs that we've adopted piecemeal since 
2010, all of which are getting at the right answer. There's a 
lot of right hand/left hand issues and so at least anecdotally 
we've seen an awful lot of situations where two different 
providers are being subsidized to build in unserved areas 
simultaneously because one's being funded by one program, one's 
being funded by another.
    More coordination is necessary to limit the instances of 
that happening and the other concern I have is not just 
competition between two subsidized entities but also between 
one subsidized entity and one unsubsidized entity in the same 
space.
    Senator Moran. We've worried and tried to impress upon the 
agencies here and in the appropriations process that you could 
have an entity that's already received money just recently from 
one Federal program and the other Federal program be 
duplicating it, not knowing the dollars have come. It's not 
just geographic, it could be also just layering programs, and 
the reason this matters, I mean, is because we have so many 
places that need service to begin with that if we're 
duplicating one place, we are damaging somebody else.
    Let me ask. I think this is a professor question. I 
joined----
    Mr. Law. I'll try to give you a professor answer.
    Senator Moran. I joined with Senators Klobuchar and Thune 
and Hickenlooper in legislation trying to enforce, encourage 
the FCC to make decisions about the USF contribution factor.
    What are the consequences for telecommunications providers 
and end users if USF contribution factor is not stabilized? 
There's kind of a related question. So if we're putting all 
these dollars out there, does the USF support system, does it 
ever go away?
    Mr. Law may have answered that in his response to my 
colleague about the need for continued support for maintenance 
and ongoing programming.
    Mr. Law. Yes, I would say I don't think there's any 
question that the existing contribution mechanism's 
unsustainable. I remember speaking about this five or 6 years 
ago when the rate hit like 18 percent and I was pointing out 
that was the level of the sucker's tax that hotels put on out-
of-town visitors in order to pad the local revenues and now 
it's almost double that, right.
    So I don't think there is a question that the existing run 
rate is not working. The question is how do you fix it, and our 
discussion around the table today is largely focused on the 
denominator, right. What's the base of revenue that we're going 
to use to try to fund going forward, but one piece of the 
solution also has to be the numerator problem, right.
    How do you control the actual spending and make sure that 
the spending that the surcharge is funding is actually going 
toward programs that are going to close the Digital Divide?
    Senator Moran. Mr. Law, I talk to my providers all the 
time, but you're on my list of most talked to providers in this 
setting.
    Senator Thune has you as a regular feature of our hearings 
and it's good to see you one more time.
    Let me--I got just 35 seconds. I'll direct this to you, Mr. 
Law. Updates needed to certain High Cost USF Programs. I've 
heard complaints about how difficult it is to deliver in our 
most rural challenged places.
    What would your suggestion be with the need to update both 
the BLS and the ACAM Programs to meet that particular 
challenge?
    Mr. Law. Thank you, Senator. I think the FCC has a good 
record in front of them for activities over the last year to 
update both the ACAM and the CAF BLS Programs with a couple of 
things.
    One is adjust the ACAM Program for, I'll say, today's speed 
requirements. When ACAM was deployed in 2018, it was based on a 
lower speed requirement. I think it's time to bring that up to 
speed as well as give providers that subscribe or participate 
in the ACAM Program the opportunity for extended funding over a 
longer period of time with an increased speed commitment over a 
broader area and I think the FCC has an ample record to act on 
that and I hope they do soon.
    As it relates to the CAF BLS Program, I think a couple of 
things. One is there continues to be an annual budget control 
mechanism that comes into play. I think it is very evident that 
the budget that was set for that very vital program is just 
clearly too low and instead of trying to address it on an 
annual basis, I would encourage the FCC to retarget that budget 
to the current level, continue to have a budget control 
mechanism in place.
    I'm not suggesting unlimited. Continue to have a budget 
control mechanism in place but reset it to target it to today's 
budget.
    Those would be the two immediate things I would suggest.
    Senator Moran. Thank you for your suggestions.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Moran.
    Next up is Senator Rosen virtually.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Thank you for holding the hearing. If 
Chairman Lujan's there, I can't see him since I'm remote. Thank 
you to him, too, and the witnesses, of course, for being here 
today.
    And so I'm just going to get right into it as one of the 
authors of the Broadband Section of the bipartisan 
Infrastructure law. I was proud to help create the Affordable 
Connectivity Program or the ACP, which provides support to 
working families so they can access and afford critical 
broadband services and devices they need for work, for school, 
for telehealth, and for so much more.
    So in my home state of Nevada, over 201,000 households are 
currently enrolled in ACP. That's why I recently led my 
colleagues in a letter to Senate appropriators requesting 
robust funding for ACP In Fiscal Year 2024 so that the people 
in Nevada and the over 17 million households across the U.S., 
including 252,000 tribal households,--well, we just don't want 
them to lose access to their broadband services when the 
funding for this program runs out.
    So, Ms. Kronenberg, I have two very important questions for 
you.
    How important is ensuring continued funding and support for 
ACP, and what can we learn from ACP implementation that can 
help us improve other affordable broadband programs, like 
Lifeline, which provides nearly $7 million to Nevada to 
increase broadband affordability for working families?
    Ms. Kronenberg. Thank you so much, Senator, for your 
commitment to ACP and we really do appreciate the opportunity 
for our Member companies to be able to better serve all of 
their customers in a local community and making sure that they 
can get connected when they haven't been able to afford 
broadband service until the ACP existed.
    We think it is vital that it continue not just so that no 
one gets cutoff but also because it's very important operating 
expense revenue that the companies receive in order for them to 
pay for the debt that they took on to build the networks and 
it's also important as they look ahead at participating in the 
Capital Projects Fund and the BEAD Program to build more 
broadband.
    I had mentioned the study earlier and in my testimony that 
shows that it is significantly less expensive to build when you 
know the customers can sign up for the service. So ACP is 
critical from that aspect, as well.
    Thank you so much.
    Senator Rosen. Well, thank you, and you really set me right 
into my next question because it is important that we have all 
of these.
    Our rural connectivity or broadband mapping, the BEAD 
Program, I mean, I've made it my mission in Congress to ensure 
that it receives their fair share of the Federal funding, 
especially in our rural communities, and it's why I've been so 
concerned that the funding through broadband equity, access, 
and deployment or what's been referred to as BEAD , that might 
be distributed based on the FCC's flawed--they're very flawed 
broad maps, but they show constituents in Nevada's rural 
communities having access to high-speed Internet when they 
simply do not.
    It's why I introduced with Ranking Member Thune the 
Accurate Map for Broadband Investment Act so that the FCC has 
time to update the maps before NTIA allocates funding based on 
them.
    But these maps are also used for initiatives under the USF 
Connect America Fund, like the 5G Fund for Rural America, and 
they're really aimed at modernizing and expanding broadband 
services across our rural communities in America.
    As it stands, Nevada receives over $22 million from the 
Connect America Fund but I'm concerned about the impact that 
flawed FCC maps could have on future funding.
    So I'd like to ask Mr. Guice and Ms. Kronenberg what impact 
could inaccurate broadband maps have on our efforts to close 
the Digital Divide, and what are your concerns for future 
funding under these key programs might not go to the areas that 
need it most?
    Mr. Guice. Thank you, Senator Rosen, for the question.
    The challenge presented by inaccurate maps is this. This is 
historic funding that Congress has allocated to address the 
broadband gap. If communities show up as served that are 
unserved, they miss out on that opportunity and that's just 
unfair to those communities.
    Now we understand the FCC is working through a challenge 
process and trying to get these maps more accurate in a 
timeline that allows NTIA to move forward by June 30th and we 
hope and we've suggested that maybe there continue to be 
flexibility even after that date to update the numbers that 
each state gets.
    But I think you've highlighted a real concern and 
demonstrated that in Nevada the map isn't accurate and so those 
updates are essential. We hope that the FCC and NTIA will 
continue to work together to try to increase that accuracy.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. I only have 4 seconds, a few 
seconds left.
    Do you have anything important to add or we can take your 
response off the record, Ms. Kronenberg?
    Ms. Kronenberg. Thank you. I'd be happy to do that.
    Senator Rosen. Written response. Thank you very much. I 
yield back, Mr. Chair.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Senator Rosen.
    Senator Thune. Mr. Law, at the same time community-based 
providers like Golden West have leveraged the resources 
provided by the FCC's High Cost Program, Congress has allocated 
billions of dollars to other agencies, like NTIA, USDA, and 
Treasury, to support the build-out of broadband services.
    Unfortunately, many Federal agencies, like NTIA, seem 
intent on including extraneous requirements, such as net 
neutrality, open access, and burdensome labor requirements in 
the respective broadband programs.
    I recently led the majority of my Republican colleagues on 
this committee requesting NTIA remove these unnecessary 
requirements from the $42.45 billion Broadband Equity, Access, 
and Deployment Program or the BEAD Program.
    So my question really is two parts, and the first is what 
do you see as the role and key function for the High Cost 
Program and statutory mission going forward as these grants 
from other Federal agencies are being distributed?
    Mr. Law. I think, first and foremost, for the Universal 
Service Fund is the backstop it plays in Rural America to 
ensure reasonable and comparable, sufficient and predictable, 
all of those things based really back in the 1996 Act in terms 
of the services that shall be provided to rural or remote 
communities, such as those that Golden West serves in South 
Dakota.
    So I think even in the face of, you know, a one-time 
massive effort of deploying, you know, billions, $42+ billion 
in capital into the broadband market to serve rural areas.
    USF and the High Cost Fund has been the underpinnings of 
successful deployment sustainability and affordability programs 
for really, in my opinion, the last 20+ years and I hope and 
anticipate that it will be for the next 20+ years, irrespective 
of BEAD or I'll say one-time shot funding programs.
    Senator Thune. Second question on that is can you speak to 
the effects these extraneous requirements from other agencies 
on providers like Golden West? For example, does it affect your 
decision as to whether or not to apply for those types of 
grants?
    Mr. Law. Absolutely. In terms of--you know, I'll say 
obviously we're in the broadband business. So we have a good 
idea of what it will take to deploy broadband to specific 
areas, including areas in many parts of this country can't 
imagine traveling to, and we'll work to get broadband there.
    However, what we are not experts on are, I'll say, 
necessarily parameters of programs in terms of guidance for 
different requirements brought along that come with those 
specific grants and potentially with those grants.
    So it necessitates either adding additional expertise 
within our firm, within our company, or hiring it. All of those 
items or either of those items layer costs.
    The other is the compliance risk that comes with it. I 
would like to think Golden West would never put itself, I'll 
say, at risk in terms of any type of compliance item. If 
there's a rule or something that comes along with receiving of 
funds, we wish to follow that and that would be our intent to 
do that.
    At the same time, the forward-looking risk of what if, you 
know, the what-ifs for the many requirements that come with 
some of these grant funds make it questionable for smaller 
providers, if we'll be really willing to participate. Certainly 
that's for Golden West.
    Senator Thune. Thank you.
    Professor Lyons, in your testimony, you discussed some of 
the shortfalls in the Lifeline Program, particularly around the 
lack of developed metrics by the FCC to know whether or not the 
program is effective in getting broadband services to low-
income Americans.
    For years I've called upon the Commission, both under 
Republican and Democrat leadership, to undertake a fundamental 
analysis of the program to determine if the program has been 
effective means of increasing subscribership among low-income 
consumers.
    To date, has the FCC conducted this sort of analysis and, 
if they have, what are the practical effects on actually 
closing the Digital Divide?
    Mr. Lyons. No, it hasn't, and I think that's a big issue 
that goes all the way back to the telephone era of Lifeline.
    The GAO has consistently asked the FCC to do a study to 
show that the dollars that they're spending are actually 
reaching families that would otherwise be at risk of losing 
service.
    When the GAO prompted the FCC in 2015, the FCC responded 
with two studies, private studies, that in fact one of which 
indicated that up to 88 percent of Lifeline money was being 
spent on families that were at no risk whatsoever of dropping 
off the network. That study had a few problems, but it points 
out the fact that it's quite possible the vast majority of that 
spending is being wasted in the sense of it is not in pursuit 
of the goal of closing then telephone penetration rates, not 
broadband adoption rates.
    Senator Thune. And are you similarly concerned that the 
Affordable Connectivity Program has not been an effective means 
of closing the Digital Divide?
    Mr. Lyons. I am or at least I'm concerned that we haven't 
studied whether it is or not.
    So the Affordable Connectivity Program's eligibility 
requirements are even broader than Lifeline and includes any 
family that's earning over 2X the Federal poverty line.
    The most recent Pew Research data shows that within 
families who earn less than $35,000 a year which I think is a 
good proxy for that, 57 percent have home broadband and 76 
percent have a smart phone at home.
    So that suggests that the majority of those who are 
eligible already receive funding. Now we've heard quite a bit, 
I think, about ACP's burn rate, the fact that the initial 
allocation is starting to run out.
    I don't know whether it's true or not, but to the extent 
that it is a concern, it's an argument in favor of, I think, 
tightening up the eligibility requirements to make sure that 
the money that's been allocated and being spent is going to 
those families that are either unconnected or at severe risk of 
losing their connectivity absent the subsidy.
    Senator Thune. OK. My time is up. I think we've got Senator 
Tester on remotely. I've got another question for the panel and 
then I'd like to direct it to Mr. Law, but if I don't get a 
chance to do that, I'll submit it for the record.
    Senator Tester.

                 STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Tester. Thank you, Senator Thune.
    So I just want to tell you where my world is and I want to 
ask Mr. Guice about the business model and if anybody else 
wants to respond can.
    Some would say I'm on my farm on the other side of the 
Digital Divide. My cell phone works but it depends on what 
direction you're standing. It depends on how you hold your 
mouth and drop calls happen with regularity.
    The broadband service I get is fine, but it's not good 
enough to where I could actually get on, say, a news program 
and have it be dependable that I would not break up or actually 
go away.
    I spend a fair amount of money on those services, even by 
my standards, because I make a decent wage here as a United 
States Senator. It still costs a noticeable amount for those.
    I was one of 10 people that helped build the bipartisan 
Infrastructure bill, the one that's known as IIJA. Where we put 
forward the I think $65 billion in total and that has a 75 
percent government share, 25 percent non-government share for 
those dollars. These are taxpayer dollars. That's significant 
dollars. It's for a good reason because I think you know 
broadband in 2023 is like electricity in the 1940s. If you 
don't have it, you're seriously set back.
    But can you tell me why we have the kind of costs we do for 
broadband service and cellular service which I have been told 
are very much connected when in fact the Federal Government is 
paying this kind of money out and the localities are on it, and 
I would direct this to Mr. Guice. Anybody else can respond to 
that, but I'd ask to be very pointed and get it done quick 
because I got some other things I want to talk about.
    Mr. Guice. Senator, thank you so much for your work on the 
IIJA.
    You know, as you identified on a bipartisan basis, this was 
a huge success and it is a historic commitment by this country 
to ensure that the essential service of our time is available 
to all Americans.
    Regarding price, it's a complicated question. We know that 
these markets are not super competitive and in rural areas 
there might be reasons for that. In urban areas, those are 
challenges that we should as a country just face up to and 
start trying to address.
    We've allowed a little bit too much consolidation and that 
ultimately harms consumers and so if we have a more competitive 
market, we can then facilitate price competition which should 
be a goal for all of us because consumers at the end of the day 
deserve that from us.
    I hope that answers your question, Senator.
    Senator Tester. Is there anybody else that would like to 
respond to that?
    Ms. Kronenberg. Senator, this is Angie Kronenberg, and I 
would like to respond to that.
    Thank you for your support in the Infrastructure Act. I 
know that was a lot of hard work by many.
    INCOMPAS recommends that as we are funding new networks 
with Federal Government dollars, that we do more to enable and 
promote competition. One recommendation that we have had and 
NTIA is encouraging this that when there are other providers 
who show up and want to get access to the network that's being 
built by government funds, that the provider who won the 
funding cannot turn them away.
    It needs to be reasonable wholesale pricing. We think this 
is going to bring better prices to the retail customers, more 
innovation and more investment in the communities.
    We were so pleased to see that the NTIA did include that 
encouragement to the states and we've been going state to state 
taking to them about the benefits of again promoting 
competition with these government-funded dollars.
    Senator Tester. I want to talk, I mean, just from my cell 
phone from the standpoint. There are a lot of folks that claim 
they have service in my area, but there's really only one, a 
handful, that has service and, quite honestly, as I said 
before, it really depends on, I don't know, where the sun is or 
where the moon is whether it's going to work or not.
    I don't know who to direct this question to, but I hear 
regularly about low orbital satellites being able to furnish as 
good a service as the landlines.
    Could somebody talk to that? Is that true? Are we wasting a 
bunch of money filling fiber in the ground when actually 10 
years from now it's all going to be done in space? Could 
somebody talk to that?
    Mr. Law. Senator Tester, this is Denny Law with Golden 
West. Thank you for your question.
    So the low earth orbit satellites present an interesting 
question and that is I do think that it at times may present an 
option for connectivity in certain areas.
    However, I think when you start to look at it as a solution 
instead of just an option, I think you may be stretching the 
reaches of what's technically possible.
    The thing you need to determine is what is its performance 
during, I'll say, load which is how's it do every night from 6 
to 11 o'clock because that's when most broadband providers see 
the largest amount of load. How does it do under adverse 
situations?
    Certainly in Montana, as we see in South Dakota, with 
weather and other atmospheric things, and then the last item is 
how does it scale because it's all, you know, a good discussion 
to have in terms of what is something in peak technical form 
capable of doing today, wonderful. Tell me what it can scale to 
do a year from now, 5 years from now, 10 years from now because 
I believe that's the networks we should focus on in terms of 
investment from a Federal policy perspective.
    Senator Tester. Appreciate that. Thank you all very much. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Tester.
    Next up is Senator Fischer. I believe she's on.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA

    Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    At high level I want to start by touching on a measure that 
I passed in the [audio glitch.] It would create a unified 
mapping tool for broadband funding known formally as Broadband 
Deployment Locations Map.
    The purpose of this new map is to combine data and identify 
where each Federal agency awards funds for broadband deployment 
projects and that includes the FCC, USDA, and NTIA, Treasury, 
and a lot of other agencies out there.
    I am eagerly awaiting the FCC's launch of this 
comprehensive interagency map and the deadline for that is next 
week.
    Mr. Lyons, given that so many agencies have funding 
programs for broadband build-out, do you agree that this map 
will be a critical tool to minimize wasteful spending between 
different agency programs?
    Mr. Lyons. Yes. I think it's absolutely right that one of 
the biggest difficulties we had in creating a comprehensive 
broadband deployment mechanism nationwide is the lack of 
adequate mapping.
    I think everybody's been onboard with the idea of creating 
good maps. It's just that the challenge is how to do it and so 
I applaud any effort to advance the ball on that topic.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you.
    Ms. Kronenberg, you mentioned the tens of billions of 
dollars that have been appropriated for broadband deployment 
through the CARES Act, American Rescue Plan Act, and the 
Infrastructure law.
    Do you believe interagency coordination through the 
deployment locations map would help ensure that all of the 
taxpayer funding is maximized so that we are expanding that 
work to as many households as possible?
    Ms. Kronenberg. Yes, so much, and thank you for your 
leadership on this issue. We think it is critical for us to be 
able to evaluate the areas that are getting the funding, who is 
getting it, and which locations still need service.
    We have one more recommendation and that is it would be 
great to have this new map also overlay with the national 
broadband map that the Commission has that shows the unserved 
and underserved locations.
    I know they're working hard to meet the deadline next week 
and as soon as they're done and they have the maps ready to go 
for June 30, we would love to see them go another step further 
so that we can see an overlay of the programs that are being 
funded with the unserved and underserved map.
    Thank you.
    Senator Fischer. That is a great idea. My focus has been 
and the focus of the law is that unserved areas need to be 
prioritized and so it is extremely important that we have that 
information, the companies have that information, as well.
    Mr. Law, it is so good to see you again. Do you think that 
having this centralized map up and running on time also would 
prevent the risk that your networks could be over-built by 
other agencies, broadband programs?
    Mr. Law. Thank you, Senator Fischer. I agree a hundred 
percent. I think that that type of coordination is absolutely 
vital as we move forward.
    Golden West, for example, and our activities in South 
Dakota, we have plans that we are working on for 2024, 2025, 
2026 that are all part of our construction plans that we would 
be able to identify in that situation to properly flag that, 
hey, we are a Federal Universe Service support recipient. Here 
are our network either as it exists today or what it will be 
this year, the end of next year, and prevent duplicity and 
really needless spending so that we can focus first--all 
programs can focus first on the most important item, which I 
believe to be unserved locations.
    Senator Fischer. Totally agree with you, totally agree, and 
as you know, the Universal Service Fund makes valuable 
investments in that work in the rural high cost areas. 
Otherwise, it just wouldn't be commercially viable to serve 
both.
    I know that you mentioned the successes of ACAM and CAF 
Broadband Loop Support in sustaining reliable broadband in 
deeply rural areas, such as farms, ranches, homes, businesses, 
that are found all across America.
    In terms of the proposed rulemaking pending before the FCC 
to extend support for these two high cost funding mechanisms, 
could you explain how it would help preserve the Universal 
Service Fund investments into the future?
    Mr. Law. Thank you. Yes, I think a couple of things. I 
think it would both, I'll say, reset for those companies the 
necessary speed requirements to bring them, I'll say, more up 
to date both in alignment with other programs as well as, you 
know, based on customer demands from when those CAF BLS and 
ACAM Programs were begun in 2018.
    The other is, and you touched on, the sustainability in 
terms of the networks that are built and designed utilizing 
those funds. I think we have a laudable track record over the 
last 20 years and I'm confident small rural providers, 
including Golden West, those in Nebraska, have a great track 
record of showing that those networks will stand the test of 
time.
    Senator Fischer. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, 
Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Fischer.
    Next up is Senator Markey.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Thank you so much, and thanks to this great 
panel.
    The E-Rate, the Education Rate, 1996, we passed a big bill. 
I was the Democratic co-author. Not one home had broadband. Not 
one home in America. Boom. Four years later, Google, eBay, 
Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, boom, the revolution is on, but we knew, 
which is why I included this provision, that we had to make 
sure that kids in America could be part of it. We didn't have 
to worry about rich kids. We didn't have to worry for the most 
part about suburban kids, but we did have to worry about poor 
kids, blue collar kids in the country.
    That's where the E-Rate came from and so far it's been $60 
billion to make sure that kids get connected. It's the first 
time that the educational technology got deployed at the same 
rate for poor kids as for rich kids in our country's history. 
That was the policy.
    So, Mr. Guice, do you agree that the E-Rate Program has 
been a huge success and is a critical part of the Universal 
Service Fund?
    Mr. Guice. Absolutely. It's been a great investment in our 
future.
    Senator Markey. And the pandemic helped to expose the holes 
in the fabric of our digital infrastructure. E-Rate helps 
students connect to the Internet at schools, and libraries, but 
not at home, and at schools around the country, as they closed 
in 2020, 2021, 2022, millions of kids lacked the devices and 
the connectivity needed to continue their education and the 
homework app is an opportunity gap which ultimately becomes a 
job gap.
    So, Mr. Chavez, do you agree that every child in our 
country should have the connectivity they need to receive a 
21st Century education?
    Mr. Chavez. Yes, I do agree.
    Senator Markey. Thank you, sir. I appreciate that.
    In fact, last week the Department of Education released new 
data demonstrating that students with access to laptops and 
high-speed Internet at home score higher on tests than their 
classmates without those resources which only makes sense and 
that's why I fought so hard to create the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund, a $7 billion program that has provided 
laptops, tablets, and Internet services to 17 million students 
or, to put it another way, to black and brown and poor kids all 
across the country just so they have their devices and those 
resources are very, very important in our society at this time 
because they disproportionately lack access to broadband 
Internet services.
    17 million kids got access as a result of that provision. 
Unfortunately, the Emergency Connectivity Fund is rapidly 
running out of money.
    Mr. Guice, can you briefly explain what the impact would be 
if the Emerging Connectivity Fund Program ends for those kids?
    Mr. Guice. Well, thank you, Senator, and, you know, as you 
noted, as the founding father of E-Rate and the Senate's 
Homework Gap Hawk, it's hard for me to tell you what the 
challenge would be, but I will try. I'm sure you know more than 
me.
    But what we did with the ECF was to help close that gap for 
America's schoolchildren when they leave the building and 
return to their home and that was significant. In the pandemic 
it was necessary and vital, but what we learned from that is 
these new innovative uses can actually be a way to modernize E-
Rate Program that you have rightly identified that's been 
critical to ensuring our schoolchildren are well educated and 
suited for the job market in the future.
    Senator Markey. Yes. And I think it's a terrifying 
possibility, both in the short term and in the long term, in 
terms of the harm to children's learning if this fund expires.
    In the short term we need to provide additional money to 
the programs, like the Emergency Connectivity Fund, so we don't 
abandon those millions of students across the country, and in 
the long term we need to ensure that the Universal Service Fund 
effectively supports student learning at home and at school.
    Mr. Guice, do you agree that any updates in the Universal 
Service Fund must protect and expand upon our hard-fought gains 
on student connectivity?
    Mr. Law. Senator, yes. We can't have our children back in 
the parking lot of fast food restaurants.
    Senator Markey. Yes. And again we know we have a crisis in 
the country. One in three teenage girls contemplated suicide 
last year. One in 10 teenage girls actually attempted suicide 
last year. Young boys are even harder to keep in school in this 
era.
    So, yes, social media is a part of it. The pandemic is a 
part of it, but having access to the tools they need to be 
successful is a part of the mental health of children in our 
country and we know what is needed because if you put these 
devices in the hands of poor kids, they have the same aptitude 
as the middle class kid. They're just as obsessed. They're just 
as good at it, but if they don't have it, they also know they 
don't have it. They also know they don't have access to it and 
that's a contributing factor to their overall mental well-
being, much less their long-term prospects for being fully 
integrated into our society.
    So I'm going to continue to focus on the Universal Service 
Fund, you know, targeting these kinds of programs to make sure 
kids get what they need.
    Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Thune. Thank you, Senator Markey.
    Next up is Senator Blackburn. Senator Blackburn, could you 
hit your on button? There you go.

              STATEMENT OF HON. MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE

    Senator Blackburn. Mr. Lyons, I want to talk with you. 
Looking at the $42 billion that came under the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act and we're looking at how this money is 
going out in grants to states to distribute for broadband 
deployment, this is very similar. We tried this before. We've 
had it with BTOP. BTOP turned into a slush fund and it really 
didn't move the needle on closing the Digital Divide.
    So I want to hear from you how do we make certain that we 
do not go back down that road with BTOP, how do we make certain 
that this money that is going to grantees is going to end up 
going for deployment, and that you're not going to see people 
coming back later as has previously happened and trying to get 
money from the USF so they can pay back loans or pay for the 
ongoing operational expenses?
    Mr. Lyons. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    I think it's super important because it gets to the need 
for upfront thinking about the design of the distribution 
mechanism in order to make sure that the taxpayers are getting 
the best bang for their buck.
    I've highlighted some of the lessons that we learned from 
the Connect America Fund and the RDOF Projects which is that 
reverse auctions increase the likelihood that the build-out 
that the Congress is funding is actually going to happen in a 
way that is at a minimum expense to taxpayer dollars.
    I think one of the difficulties with structuring the 
auction correctly is making sure you get the qualifications 
correct so that the companies that are bidding on the auction 
are actually able to do the work that they're professing that 
they're able to do along the time table that they're 
suggesting.
    But I think you're exactly right that it's important to 
favor one-time build-out over ongoing sort of optic expenses 
and I think the way you do that is by requiring bidders to 
build sort of a net present value of their expected ongoing 
optics needs into their initial subsidy request, right.
    So when we talk about a rural broadband problem, sort of 
two rural broadband issues, there are areas of the country 
where it's uneconomical to build a work but if you gave them a 
network, then the ongoing operational expenses would be covered 
by subscribers and there's a second area where even if you gave 
somebody a network for free, there are still not enough 
subscribers in the area to be able to sustain the network 
without subsidies.
    I think it's important to focus primarily on the former to 
get the best bang for the buck and in the areas of the latter 
that the subsidy bid builds in sort of an expectation of that 
ongoing need.
    Senator Blackburn. Yes. Let me also ask you about this. The 
GAO did a report that we got in May of 2022 and it was pretty 
much an inventory of programs that exist. They found 133 
Federal funding programs in 15 different agencies that are 
supporting broadband deployment and access, and the FCC alone 
distributed seven billion last year for its four USF fund 
programs, four billion of which was for network deployment in 
rural areas, and on top of this, Congress authorized more than 
$400 billion in funding, including the $42 billion in Bead 
money, to be used for broadband deployment.
    So I'd love to ask you, Mr. Lyons, do you think it is 
important that we stop, that we enter, that we inventory these 
programs, that we look at the effectiveness of this, the 
utilization of the dollars before we say we're going to put 
more money into different programs?
    I think that what we're running into and what I hear from 
people in Tennessee, there is now confusion over what program 
they can qualify for and which program requires the match and 
how those dollars can be used, particularly in unserved areas 
which are essential if we are ever going to close this Digital 
Divide.
    Mr. Lyons. Yes. I think you're absolutely right. I think 
particularly with regard to the plethora of projects that we 
have for building out unserved areas. It's incredibly important 
that we figure out a mechanism to coordinate better than we are 
now how the spending projects are occurring to make sure that 
we're not engaging in duplication.
    If each of these projects is a limited amount of money, 
right, then two projects spending on one area means there is 
fewer actual areas being covered. So coordinating among the 
various initiatives to make sure we're minimizing the incidence 
of two subsidized providers building in the same area is 
incredibly important.
    Senator Blackburn. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Markey. Thank you, Senator, so much.
    Other Senators on the line who want to be recognized? 
Hearing none, the Chair will recognize himself for additional 
questions.
    Congress has made historic investments in broadband. Mr. 
Guice, do you agree that we will only make good on those 
investments if we ensure that the Internet remains free and 
open with values of non-discrimination?
    Mr. Guice. Senator, thank you so much for raising this. 
Yes, the Internet has to remain a free and open space for 
exchange of ideas. Non-discrimination is the bedrock to that. 
That's grounded in the FCC's Title 2 authority.
    Senator Markey. Yes. Beautiful. Mr. Chavez, can you explain 
some of the specific improvements that the E-Rate and the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund allowed you to fund as part of your 
program?
    Mr. Chavez. So in my school district, we would not have 
been able to connect students at their homes and develop the 
network that we did that allows our students, like you said 
before, Senator, brown students to connect and be part of this 
modern global society and be able to learn on the same playing 
field as other students in the country. Without the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund, none of that would have happened and we 
would still be struggling and trying to figure out how we're 
going to get funding to provide Internet to our students which 
is absolutely necessary these days.
    Senator Markey. Thank you so much.
    There's nothing ultimately more important than 
democratization of access to opportunity through broadband 
access and what would happen if the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
expired, Mr. Chavez?
    Mr. Chavez. I can't imagine it expiring. I can't see us 
going back at this point. We provided Internet access, high-
speed Internet access to all students and to go forward and 
say, well, next year there's no more money, we're stopping the 
program, I just can't see that. I can't imagine that ever 
happening and it cannot happen. We do need that funding for our 
youth and we do need to continue moving forward with that 
technology piece as being a critical piece of their education.
    Senator Markey. Thank you so much.
    Professor Lyons, I went to Boston College Law School where 
you are a professor and I appreciate your great work, as well.
    Mr. Lyons. Very kind of you to say.
    Senator Markey. When I started here in Congress 47 years 
ago, and I joined the Telecommunications Committee on the House 
side, President Carter had three graduates of Boston College 
Law School on the Federal Communications Commission 
simultaneously as the Commissioners, three Boston College Law 
School graduates, and I'm on the Committee on 
Telecommunications and what was fascinating is we didn't have a 
course on telecommunications law at Boston College Law School 
which just showed how adaptable we were after getting that 
superior education at Boston College Law School but having 
somebody like you there, you know, will now give all these 
young people a running head start. So I thank you so much.
    Mr. Lyons. Very kind of you to say and I'm aware that I 
stand on the shoulders of giants.
    Senator Markey. Well, I wouldn't say that but I would say 
that the students today are being trained by giants and we 
thank you for providing that service.
    So thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you.
    Next, we'll hear from Senator Klobuchar. Senator Klobuchar, 
you're recognized for your five minutes.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you so much, Senator Lujan. 
Thank you for also allowing me to get in at the end here. We 
had a major lengthy Judiciary hearing and you know how much I 
care about this and I want to thank you for your leadership.
    So I guess I'll start out with Mr. Guice and Mr. Chavez. We 
made sure the bipartisan Infrastructure law included funding 
for the FCC's Affordable Connectivity Program.
    Can you speak to the effectiveness of the program, Mr. 
Guice, and how important it is to make sure the support doesn't 
run out?
    Mr. Chavez, just what more needs to be done to broaden 
inclusion, especially in rural and tribal communities? So go 
ahead.
    Mr. Guice. Thank you, Senator. The program that you and 
others worked on to create here at the Congress demonstrates 
that if we provide the right level of support, low-income 
families will not only get connected but they will maintain 
that connection which is critical to getting the economic and 
other benefits of connectivity.
    It has over 18 million household subscribing across the 
country. You know, states, Minnesota, Ohio, Texas, all are 
having huge subscription rates and thus enjoying the benefits 
of that connectivity.
    The program is a victim of its own success in some ways. 
The funding that Congress provided that was supposed to last 
for a number of years looks to be running out potentially next 
year and as early as May.
    Senator Klobuchar. Thank you.
    Mr. Guice. Thank you.
    Senator Klobuchar. I understand. Go ahead, Mr. Chavez.
    Mr. Chavez. So last year when we started this project, I 
attended a chapter house meeting on the Navajo Nation and I was 
kind of surprised that leaders said we don't want this to be 
another program where you guys come in, meaning from the 
outside, give us something and then just stop it and leave us 
hanging.
    I think it's critical that we keep the funding going, 
flowing through, especially for like these Native American 
communities. After all, they are the first inhabitants of this 
great country and it's just sad to see how dire the situation 
is for them just to get the basic necessities.
    So this is an absolute must for our school district and at 
this point it's just keeping us caught up with the rest of the 
world. We're not asking to produce money that's going to make 
us advance more than anybody else. We're just trying to keep up 
at this point.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you. I know how important it 
is. That's why we work so hard to include that funding from the 
beginning.
    Ms. Kronenberg, you included in your written testimony that 
over 9,000 rural hospitals and clinics use the Rural Health 
Care Program. Talk about why that's so important.
    Ms. Kronenberg. Thank you so much, Senator, for the 
question.
    We can do a lot to build networks to reach customers, but 
we need to be sure that they can afford the service. What we 
know is that rural health care hospitals and clinics are in 
dire need of being able to reach their customers and to do so 
so they can provide telehealth services.
    The Rural Health Care Program is absolutely important to 
meeting the needs across the U.S. If we were to see that 
funding go away, this means that the rural health hospitals and 
clinics, we're going to have to find another funding source 
which is difficult these days for these hospitals already. 
They're already in jeopardy.
    So INCOMPAS supports the continuation of that program and 
we also support it because it does provide competitive 
opportunities in communities for competitive providers. That 
and the E-Rate Program have done a lot to bring new 
connectivity options and lower prices from competitors.
    So thank you for your support of that program.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes. Do you also agree that the current 
9-1-1 infrastructure is in dire need of modernization? Senator 
Cortez Masto and I lead a bill to upgrade it.
    Ms. Kronenberg. Yes, absolutely, and I know that many are 
also working on the equipment that needs to be changed out that 
has issues with respect to older technology. So we need to be 
able to fund the evolving networks, the new technologies so 
that we can better serve all Americans.
    Thank you.
    Senator Klobuchar. Very good. And last, Mr. Law, broadband 
data, just strengthening broadband access and improving 
deployment by requiring updates that show not where the--not 
just where the providers currently serve but also where 
providers have received Federal, state, or local funding to 
build out broadband when their work is expected to be 
completed, that is a bill that I led with Senators Wicker, 
Peters, and Thune to improve that access to data.
    Could you talk about how important it is to have the boots 
on the ground, knowledge to make our maps better?
    Mr. Law. Thank you, Senator, and thank you for that 
legislation, introducing that legislation.
    Network infrastructure is a multiyear process and so the 
boots on the ground in terms of forward-looking for Golden West 
in our case, we have a commitment, an enforceable buildout 
commitment through the ACAM Program at the Universal Service 
Program that stretches through 2028.
    We have percentage metrics to build, but we haven't 
completed it yet. So we may have something on task for 2023, 
2024, 2025, 2026. They're all planned out, but if we're not 
asked that question first by the proper folks administering the 
funds, you run the risk of duplicative Federal funds trying to 
raise to save the unserved people there were already funds 
allocated for.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you very much, and thank you 
again, Chairman, for holding this hearing and allowing it to 
keep going so I could ask some questions. Thank you.
    Senator Lujan. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
    Next, we'll hear from Senator Lummis for five minutes.

               STATEMENT OF HON. CYNTHIA LUMMIS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Lummis. Mr. Chairman, I, too, want to thank you for 
allowing those of us who had other obligations this morning to 
testify, I appreciate my dear colleague from New Mexico.
    Mr. Law, in Wyoming, like South Dakota, the High Cost 
Program has been essential to making the business case for 
voice and broadband service in some cases in very remote and 
hard-to-reach parts of the state.
    In your testimony, you discussed how roadblocks in the 
permitting process can negatively impact the mission of the 
Universal Service Fund.
    Can you provide more detail about the unique permitting 
challenges you face operating in a Western state?
    Mr. Law. Thank you, Senator Lummis. Yes, as with Wyoming, 
South Dakota has a large proportion of lands owned by other 
entities, primarily the Federal Government, and that represents 
significantly the most barrier for deployment in certain rural 
areas and it could be that consumers are located on those 
Federal lands or we have to pass through those Federal lands to 
reach the consumers, I'll say, on the other side.
    The permitting, I strongly encourage this committee and I 
have encouraged other committees in prior testimony to take a 
strong look at the Federal permitting process and I have really 
kind of three very quick suggestions that would be, I think, 
relatively simple solutions to at least begin.
    The first would be put a shot clock on the respective 
agency when an entity was just to disturb previously disturbed 
rights of way. In other words, if there's already a road going 
through a particular piece of Federal land and we're going to 
follow that land, I think there's a different level of scrutiny 
that needs to be needed and a shot clock should be put in 
place.
    Second, agencies should designate within themselves who are 
the proper contacts for an entity like a Golden West to contact 
if we wish to go through Forest Service, BLM, Park Service, all 
of those different things. It varies by agency and it can be 
very time-consuming for an entity like Golden West.
    And last, I would encourage any future legislation or 
guidelines from this body to include words like ``shall, or 
mandates'' for Federal agencies and not merely guidelines or 
suggest because I have learned that agencies will interpret 
that differently.
    Thank you.
    Senator Lummis. Indeed, they do, and those are great 
suggestions. Thanks for those.
    Again, Mr. Law, in your testimony you also mentioned that 
many of the customers that have yet to be connected by 
broadband are in the hardest-to-reach locations with some of 
the most difficult geographies for deploying broadband 
infrastructure.
    What difficulties have you encountered in connecting these 
areas, and then, most importantly, here's the question, do the 
High Cost Program and other Federal broadband programs 
currently contain roadblocks that prevent you from addressing 
these challenges?
    Mr. Law. Thank you. I think the biggest challenge is our--
it often comes back to the economic side and the High Cost 
Program, I'll say, does a great job of helping companies like 
Golden West or a Silver Star or a range in Wyoming address the 
lack of ever having an economic case in some of those 
situations, but that's not the whole part of the equation in 
terms of economics, difficulty in terrain, maintaining, 
replacing over the years, all of those different items.
    I think the biggest barriers that companies in a Universal 
Service High-Cost Fund face are two things right now. On the 
CAF BLS side of the program, there have been budgetary 
constraints applied to that that I think the FCC should look 
and it was recommended when they adopted the current budget 
that they look in 2023 for 2024 what is an appropriate budget 
for CAF BLS recipients and that's due.
    We appreciate the budget control mechanism waivers that the 
FCC has done in prior years, greatly appreciated, but doing 
that on an annual basis is not the greatest way to incent 
network deployment.
    Secondarily, I think they should reset the targets for the 
other High Cost Programs, including the Alaska Plan as well as 
the ACAM Plan, to set higher speed targets, perhaps consider 
lengthening the term of the commitment for carriers that are 
willing to accept that. What that does for companies like 
Golden West is we continue to push and extend our network on an 
annual basis is if we know we have some foundational funding 
available, we'll be willing to make that investment to reach 
those hardest of the hardest to reach, such as those in South 
Dakota or Wyoming.
    Senator Lummis. Your brain is well organized. You laid that 
out in a way that I could take notes and have some very 
concrete recommendations. So I appreciate your testimony. I 
appreciate all of the panelists today and again, Mr. Chairman, 
thank you so much.
    Senator Lujan. Well, Senator, thank you very much, and 
again thank you so much to the panel, as well.
    I want to thank each of the witnesses for providing 
testimony today on the importance of the programs under 
Universal Service and about some of the changes that are going 
to be necessary, as well.
    I look forward to working with each and every one of you, 
as well.
    With that, I will close the hearing. Should members have 
additional questions for the witnesses for the record, I ask 
that they submit them to the Committee within two weeks and 
witnesses will have an additional two weeks to respond.
    Thank you, everyone.
    [Whereupon, at 12:13 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                               Tim Chavez
    Question 1. In your testimony, you stated that satellite technology 
provided a solution that overcame the barriers to building wired fiber 
infrastructure and was able to achieve 100 percent connectivity for 
your student body. Please provide additional information on why 
satellite was the best option for your community.
    Answer. 1.) Due to easement barriers, Starlink was the best and 
only solution to handle multiple Zoom sessions at a time. Our team 
tested other solutions like hotspots and HughesNet Satellite service; 
however, those options returned poor results. Buffering with these 
solutions did not allow students to learn in a real-time interactive 
environment.

    Question 2. Mr. Chavez, you stated that with Starlink, students in 
your school district had access to 230/25 Mbps speeds. What kinds of 
applications were your students and teachers able to use with this 
level of service?
    Answer. 2.) Students could utilize several online applications, but 
for remote learning sessions, both teachers and students used the Zoom 
application. Teachers and students still use Zoom for every class since 
the District has moved into a hybrid teaching environment (this is 
where most students attend in person, and some others attend via Zoom)
    Question 3. According to your testimony, your school district has 
continued to have remote learning during bad weather, but according to 
the school calendar, the district has also continued to have regularly 
scheduled remote learning days on Mondays this school year. Further, 
your school district's board meeting minutes for the April 19, 2023 
meeting (approved in the May 18, 2023 meeting) state that the ``Option 
A'' school calendar was selected for next school year (2023-2024). The 
selected school calendar has planned remote learning on every Monday 
that is not a holiday for the school year.
    a. Why is your school district continuing to schedule remote 
learning days--irrespective of weather--despite the harmful record of 
remote learning on kids and the pandemic being long-over?
    Answer. 3a.) Cuba Schools continue to do remote learning days to 
support students' work in the 21st-century arena and support online 
learning within the overall learning system (in which both the U.S. and 
other countries work). Many of today's jobs require remote and onsite 
work. In addition, many educational institutions and career prep 
deliver services online. Research and participation with family members 
are needed. Remote learning also allows schools to help students within 
their environments, working on PBL (Project-based learning scenarios 
that factor in where students live. 76 percent of our students live 
within a 120-mile radius and are on buses for 3 to 4 hours a day). The 
remote setting also allows us to provide more teaching experiences with 
guest speakers and other professionals in math, science, and STEM that 
cannot travel to rural NM, so our students get to participate in many 
online experiences with this education that is not only onsite. 
Research does show that when online 21st-century learning occurs 
correctly, students are more successful, not less. Remote learning also 
allows students to do Dual credit opportunities and much more.

    b. According to your school district's April 2023 meeting agenda, 
the school board discussed what would happen to its federally-
subsidized Starlink services if it returned to full-time in person 
learning--according to the agenda, there was concern that the subsidies 
would go away. With respect to the decision to maintain regularly 
scheduled remote learning days next school year, the board meeting 
minutes state: ``With the approval of the calendar we might be able to 
maintain the use of Starlink, but it is costing the district.'' \1\

go.boarddocs.com/nm/cisd/Board.nsf/vpublic?open Meeting May 18, 2023 as 
agenda item 1.5 ``Approval of Special Board Minutes from April 13, 
2023''.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Answer. 3b.) The District does not receive subsidies for Starlink; 
USAC ECF reimbursed the District for support during the pandemic, and 
that only. There is a high cost to the District to maintain a 21st-
century online education and access to the Internet for all things in 
education that support students on the reservation and rural 
mountainous areas. We have had to look at all our funding and 
prioritize the needs of a 21st-century education for our kids using 
operational dollars and Indigenous funds. Having this connection is 
just like having books, and the government needs to prioritize this for 
the kids, especially in homes and schools where low-income families 
cannot do this for their children. Not having this leaves them far 
behind.

    i. Please explain what is meant by this statement in the meeting 
minutes (``With the approval of the calendar we might be able to 
maintain the use of Starlink, but it is costing the district.'').
    Answer. 3i.) (See comments above.)

    ii. Yes or no: Is the school's decision to maintain scheduled 
remote learning days next school year related to concerns over the 
school district's ability to maintain use of Starlink services? If yes, 
how?
    Answer. 3ii.) NO, our decision to keep and have remote learning is 
not tied to Starlink.

     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to 
                               Tim Chavez
    Question 1. In the state of South Dakota alone, the high-cost 
program has enabled broadband services to over 115,000 locations, 
including the most rural and remote areas of the state. As I mentioned 
in my opening statement, the FCC has taken meaningful reforms to update 
the high-cost program to ensure predictable and sufficient support to 
providers.
    Are there additional reforms Congress or the FCC should take as it 
relates to the high-cost program today?
    Answer. Utilizing new technologies like Starlink will lower the 
cost of providing broadband to rural and underserved areas. Traditional 
broadband, like fiber, is very costly, and with easement barriers, 
these types of projects could be years out from being completed. 
Finding more innovative ways of providing these services is the key to 
cost-effectiveness and completion.

    Question 2. There are a number of permitting barriers that slow 
down the deployment of broadband networks. What measures should 
Congress take to address these concerns?
    Answer. A bill giving carriers open access to install mandatory 
utilities would resolve decades of slow progress.
                                 ______
                                 
    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to 
                               Tim Chavez
    Question. Following the recent historic funding made available for 
broadband deployment, there are important discussions to be had on 
reforms to USF--including contribution reform, improving transparency, 
and ensuring the programs are efficient and effective--but this is also 
an opportunity to discuss potential reforms to the broader ecosystem of 
Federal broadband programs. A GAO report from last year found that 
there are currently at least 133 programs across 15 different agencies 
that could be used for broadband.
    The report highlighted numerous concerns with this fragmented 
approach to Federal broadband policy, including varying project 
criteria, challenges with agency coordination, and administrative 
complexities for applicants. The report concluded that ``this patchwork 
of programs could lead to wasteful duplication of funding and effort''. 
This patchwork of Federal broadband programs identified by the GAO 
could be diverting funding and focus away from truly unserved areas 
like in Alaska.
    How should Congress be looking more comprehensively at all of these 
programs across agencies to look for potential redundancies and areas 
for alignment in order to maximize effectiveness for the unserved?
    Answer. Ensuring appropriate utilization is crucial to the 
program's success. Program managers of the USF must keep track of where 
the money is being used and stop funding to areas that have already 
been served. Also, budget limitations on projects categorized by areas 
and/or regions would deter the misuse of funds and ensure they are 
available to places like Alaska and New Mexico. Finally and most 
importantly, site visits by USAC employees would ensure the proper use 
of funding.
                                 ______
                                 
      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                            Angie Kronenberg
    Question 1. At the hearing, you stated that you were opposed to 
assessing the Universal Service Fund (USF) tax on Big Tech and 
streaming services. You stated: ``no one's talking about how a 
potential USF fee on these streamers is going to tilt the marketplace 
in a way that's going to make it less attractive for customers to be 
willing to take that streaming service.'' At the same time, you have 
advocated in support of assessing the USF tax on broadband service.

    a. Imposing a USF tax on broadband service would make broadband 
more expensive, particularly for lower-and middle-income consumers. 
Moreover, it would involve taxing the very service the subsidies are 
meant to promote. Yes or no: Doesn't your argument about a USF fee on 
streamers tilting the marketplace also apply to broadband service? If 
no, why?
    Answer. No. The argument about tilting the marketplace does not 
apply to assessing broadband Internet access service (BIAS) revenues 
because assessing BIAS revenues for purposes of USF means that every 
provider offering BIAS service would be required to contribute to USF 
based on their revenues--as is done for interstate telecom services 
today. The proposal to assess BIAS revenues does not target certain 
providers based on their size or business model, unlike proposals that 
argue for certain tech and streaming companies to be assessed. For 
example, one paper seeks to impose a fee on only certain streamers, and 
another seeks a fee only on two companies' advertising revenue.
    There are serious competitive risks associated with targeting 
specific online content or edge companies in the context of USF. For 
example, assessing a USF fee on certain streaming companies, but not on 
all streaming companies, would be unfair and harm a competitive 
streaming market. In addition, assessing streamers, but not their video 
market competitors--cable, broadcast, and direct broadcast satellite 
(DBS)--would skew the video market as consumers could avoid the USF fee 
by choosing services that do not have USF obligations. Moreover, every 
consumer and business use their broadband connection for different and 
often multiple reasons, and charging only some online companies but not 
others could impact which online services are used as well as interfere 
with the free market to determine which online services succeed. It 
also potentially leads to discrimination by the government with respect 
to some online services.
    One reason INCOMPAS supports expanding the USF contribution base to 
include BIAS revenues is that doing so does not impact how consumers/
businesses may use their connection--whether it is to stream video, 
cloud compute, play video games, or have a video conference call. The 
USForward Coalition's proposal for USF reform to include BIAS revenues 
will not skew the online marketplace in unfair and uncompetitive ways. 
In fact, capturing the value of broadband at the network access point 
via BIAS revenues is fairer and more predictable than targeting 
particular online companies.
    We also have a concern that the USF contribution reform needs to be 
sustainable for the long term, and BIAS revenue is expected to be very 
stable over time. Broadband subscriber growth has been strong in recent 
years, which is not surprising, and the expectation is that it will 
continue to grow slightly over time. However, it is not predictable as 
to which online services may be used over time which could destabilize 
the base of revenue for the USF in the future if the services assessed 
lose users (i.e., if popular services today are not popular in the 
future). Moreover, the FCC has diverged from its practice of including 
all revenue for every type of service that is supported by USF. BIAS 
providers receive direct support from the USF, but BIAS revenues are 
currently excluded from contributing.
    Assessing BIAS revenues would increase the pool of revenues to USF 
and would bring the USF fee down to less than 4 percent. This means 
that assessing BIAS revenues would significantly decrease the cost for 
individuals who only subscribe to voice services, including elderly 
Americans. These individuals are currently paying around 30 percent on 
a portion of their telephone bills each month (for interstate service). 
If the FCC includes BIAS revenues in the USF contribution base means 
they would instead pay less than 4 percent, resulting in significant 
savings for these consumers. And as noted above, it will make the USF 
system fairer and more consistent with the FCC's USF practices.
    Any resulting price increase for BIAS service would be nominal--$2-
$3 for broadband in the $50-$70 subscription range. BIAS prices are 
also expected to decrease over time, which potentially could lower the 
USF fee in the future. The FCC can also exempt low-income customers 
from paying a USF fee on BIAS just as it does today for voice services 
in the Lifeline program. In addition, an NTCA Report (and recent 
update) show that expanding the contribution base would not impact 
broadband adoption. Thus, FCC action to expand the contribution base to 
include BIAS revenues is the best path forward for addressing the high 
contribution factor, and many diverse stakeholders agree.
    You stated that according to Carol Mattey's USForward report that 
expanding the contribution base to include broadband revenues would 
bring the contribution factor down from almost 30 percent to 4 percent.

    b. Do you agree that a 4 percent tax is contingent on FCC forecasts 
of USF program demand, and that the burden would increase if the FCC 
decided to expand its current USF programs or USF spending levels?
    Answer. The USF fee calculated in the USForward Report written by 
USF-expert Carol Mattey is based on the FCC's ten-year forecast, which 
keeps the program demand consistent and stable (page 11, Table 1.1). 
This also is consistent with the USF program demand over time. If you 
consider the Universal Service Monitoring Report, the USF spending has 
been very stable in the last decade (page 23, Table 1.10).
    INCOMPAS is not aware that the FCC plans to expand its total 
current USF spending levels, and INCOMPAS has advocated that the FCC 
must reform the contribution system so that the contribution factor 
does not continue to skyrocket and that the FCC should not expand total 
spending in the USF without first doing so.
    It is difficult to determine the exact impact on the contribution 
factor should the FCC increase its spending in the USF without knowing 
(1) how much the spending increase is and (2) whether the FCC expands 
the contribution base to include other revenues beyond BIAS (which some 
have proposed in the docket). Keeping in mind that if the expansion 
only includes adding BIAS revenues to the contribution base--that 
revenue is expected to continue growing; thus, it is not necessarily 
the case that you would see significant changes in the contribution 
factor should USF spending increase. It will depend on how much 
spending increases and how much USF-assessed revenue increases.

    c. You do not state how many customers would go from paying 0 
percent to 4 percent. How many additional customer payments are needed 
to bring the contribution factor from 30 percent to 4 percent?
    Answer. In the USForward Report, Carol Mattey estimates the 
contribution factor if BIAS revenues were assessed based on data from 
several sources as there is no single authoritative source for the 
revenues derived from the sale of BIAS (pages 14-16). These sources 
include Raymond James, New Street Research, and the FCC's Form 499-A 
(where companies report their non-telecom revenues). These are 
conservative estimates as they are based on reported and projected 
revenues of the larger publicly traded companies and do not capture 
revenues from numerous smaller potential contributors. Based on these 
inputs, Mattey estimates that between fixed and mobile broadband 
revenues, the total assumed assessable BIAS revenues in 2023 would be 
$250 billion and in 2024 would be $260.6 billion (page 16, Table 5). 
Including the BIAS revenues along with the current telecom revenues 
would then bring the contribution factor down to less than 4 percent.
    Unfortunately, we do not have estimates of the number of customers 
(residential or business) who purchase only BIAS service and who 
therefore contribute nothing to USF today because they do not purchase 
any interstate telecom services. However, given that most consumers and 
businesses have a mobile or fixed phone service in the U.S. that 
contributes into the USF, we expect that the number of new USF payors 
would be minimal.

    Question 2. In response a question during the hearing, you stated 
that ``the FCC doesn't have authority over edge providers and changing 
the statute to give them such authority really, I think, could open a 
pandora's box.''

    a. Can you please expand on the unintended consequences of giving 
this additional authority to the FCC?
    Answer. While the USF contribution factor continues to skyrocket 
(it is currently about 30 percent), the FCC has the jurisdiction to 
follow its historic precedent of expanding the contribution base to 
include services that receive direct subsidies from the USF, which 
includes BIAS. Accordingly, the FCC can act with its authority today 
and expand the base to include BIAS revenues, which would bring the 
contribution factor down to less than 4 percent. However, the FCC has 
concluded that it does not have the authority over online companies 
(which it calls ``edge providers''), and so it would need to get the 
authority to assess these companies from Congress. INCOMPAS believes 
that requiring this type of act from Congress would result in 
significant delays, while the USF fee on consumers and businesses 
continues to increase. (We cannot stress enough that a 30 percent fee 
on any service is really unreasonable.) And opening up Section 254 of 
the Communications Act to give the FCC new regulatory authority over 
edge providers would also open up the foundational statute of the FCC 
to potentially creating a ``pandora's box'' with unintended expansive 
regulatory consequences. Granting the FCC authority through legislation 
over edge providers would vastly expand FCC power and regulation over 
all online content services. Today we are talking about USF reform, but 
it is unclear how the FCC would use this new regulatory power in the 
future--potentially creating a ``pandora's box'' filled with unintended 
consequences.
    Nearly every consumer and business today has an online presence. 
Determining which online companies' revenues are subject to assessment 
would be a monumental task and nearly impossible. And as described 
above in response to question 1, targeting certain online companies 
could invite opportunistic arbitrage and risks skewing online 
competition in unfair and harmful ways. Thus, the FCC would have to 
ensure that it is not advantaging some services over others so as not 
to skew competition in markets unfairly by imposing the USF fee on some 
and not on others.
    Another unintended consequence may be potentially increasing the 
size of the USF. Given that the USF traditionally has supported 
services that are assessed--it could be the case that the FCC could 
consider expanding the USF program to support edge provider services 
and investments. This could mean an expansion of USF in spending and 
reach that is much greater than its current mission.
    There is also a global perspective that is critical in this context 
as well. If certain online content companies are required to subsidize 
BIAS providers' business models through the USF, we can expect that 
other countries around the globe will follow, and U.S. companies will 
be asked to subsidize broadband providers around the world.

     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to 
                            Angie Kronenberg
    Question 1. In the state of South Dakota alone, the high-cost 
program has enabled broadband services to over 115,000 locations, 
including the most rural and remote areas of the state. As I mentioned 
in my opening statement, the FCC has taken meaningful reforms to update 
the high-cost program to ensure predictable and sufficient support to 
providers.
    Are there additional reforms Congress or the FCC should take as it 
relates to the high-cost program today?
    Answer. Under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the FCC 
was required to conduct an analysis of how the recent congressional 
funding for broadband will impact the USF and whether the USF programs 
will need to be modified as a result. We agree with this approach. With 
the recent congressional funding allocated for broadband deployment, is 
important for the FCC to do a deep-dive analysis into the USF programs 
to see how much funding is still needed as a result, especially for the 
High-Cost program.
    Unlike the other USF programs, the High-Cost program focuses mostly 
on deployment costs versus affordability. The High-Cost program has 
overlapping goals with much of the recent congressional funding to help 
with deployment in hard-to-serve areas, including the BEAD Program. As 
such, no new funding should be committed in the High-Cost program for 
new broadband deployment before the FCC analyzes whether and where 
there are remaining gaps once all the Federal grants have been awarded 
for new builds.
    For providers that receive ongoing High-Cost support, it is time 
for the FCC to comprehensively evaluate whether such support will need 
to continue. The FCC should no longer assume providers require 
additional funding to operate without a demonstration that this is the 
case. Many of the companies receiving High-Cost support have deployed 
fiber to the home. The most expensive part of running a broadband 
network is deployment, not operations, and fiber and all IP networks 
are cheaper to operate. The FCC can better understand the economics of 
networks in high-cost areas by conducting a first-of-its-kind analysis 
of network operating costs and revenues.

    Question 2. There are a number of permitting barriers that slow 
down the deployment of broadband networks. What measures should 
Congress take to address these concerns?
    Answer. As the leading trade association for innovation and 
competition, INCOMPAS recognizes that broadband deployment is a 
necessary investment now and for our country's future to help Americans 
stay connected. To close the digital divide, deploying broadband 
infrastructure is needed now and should be expedited to ensure 
availability to all consumers and businesses in the United States.
    With our membership consisting of competitive network companies who 
are building the next generation of communications networks across the 
country using fiber, fixed wireless, mobile, and satellite broadband 
networks, we encourage Congress to keep pushing for state and local 
review guidelines that enable faster processing that will allow the 
deployment of broadband infrastructure more quickly, including small 
cells and other wireless equipment and fiber that is used by both fixed 
and mobile providers to connect their networks.
    It is also important for Congress to ensure that both utility 
commissions and state governments encourage local jurisdictions to 
expedite permitting, allow for batch permitting, keep permitting and 
franchise fees low, and require that these fees be publicly disclosed, 
competitively and technology neutral, and non-discriminatory based on 
actual and direct costs.
    To help resolve barriers to deployment, INCOMPAS supports 
legislative measures that would:

  <bullet> Implement certain timing standards and flexibility on 
        waivers for how long state and local governments have for 
        processing applications and permits in gaining access to public 
        rights-of-way and for deploying broadband to their communities.

  <bullet> Extend rights-of-way protections to other entities including 
        pole attachments, highways, and railroad crossings that manage 
        rights-of-way that providers must access to deploy their 
        infrastructure, as well as offer protections to those providers 
        who only offer broadband Internet access service so they can 
        have the same rights as cable providers and telecommunications 
        carriers.

  <bullet> Promote new construction technologies that speed deployment 
        and to allow for simpler, more transparent, and fair 
        engineering standards to be established by utility commissions 
        and/or state and local governments.

  <bullet> Use the Federal funding being allocated for infrastructure 
        and broadband investment to help incentivize local 
        jurisdictions to streamline permitting and/or franchise 
        requirements to speed broadband deployment. Local jurisdictions 
        may need funding assistance to hire, train, and/or expand their 
        capability to process broadband infrastructure permitting and 
        approval processes.

    <ctr-circle> INCOMPAS endorses Rep. Lizzie Fletcher's Broadband 
            Incentives for Communities Act.

    If INCOMPAS and our members can be of any future assistance or a 
resource in helping your office by providing examples or sharing their 
experiences on broadband deployment, please let us know.

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to 
                            Angie Kronenberg
    Question. Following the recent historic funding made available for 
broadband deployment, there are important discussions to be had on 
reforms to USF--including contribution reform, improving transparency, 
and ensuring the programs are efficient and effective--but this is also 
an opportunity to discuss potential reforms to the broader ecosystem of 
Federal broadband programs. A GAO report from last year found that 
there are currently at least 133 programs across 15 different agencies 
that could be used for broadband.
    The report highlighted numerous concerns with this fragmented 
approach to Federal broadband policy, including varying project 
criteria, challenges with agency coordination, and administrative 
complexities for applicants. The report concluded that ``this patchwork 
of programs could lead to wasteful duplication of funding and effort''. 
This patchwork of Federal broadband programs identified by the GAO 
could be diverting funding and focus away from truly unserved areas 
like in Alaska.
    How should Congress be looking more comprehensively at all of these 
programs across agencies to look for potential redundancies and areas 
for alignment in order to maximize effectiveness for the unserved?
    Answer. The GAO Report made a number of recommendations which would 
potentially help guide Congress in further understanding where there 
are redundancies for broadband programs and potentially where the 
programs and agencies could be better aligned to meet the mission of 
connecting consumers and businesses to affordable broadband service. 
The GAO Report recommended that the Administration take a lead role in 
coordinating and setting forth a broadband strategy for the Nation. It 
has been over a decade since the FCC first set forth a National 
Broadband Plan as required by Congress. That Plan has been instrumental 
in the progress made for the last decade; however, a new mandate from 
Congress for the FCC or NTIA to set forth a new broadband strategy may 
be in order. Other nations have engaged in similar efforts to ensure 
that their nation is connected to high-speed broadband networks in the 
near future.
    In the meantime, the current coordination that the agencies are 
engaging in for the deployment programs is a very good start. But it 
also is important for the agencies to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
programs and advise Congress concerning the potential adjustments that 
are needed, and where the agencies already have authority to make 
adjustments, to do so in consultation with Congress. For example, the 
FCC's authority to ensure universal service under Section 254 of the 
Communications Act has allowed it to modify the programs by moving from 
support of phone service to broadband service (per the National 
Broadband Plan's recommendations) and to create several new programs to 
deliver broadband networks to unserved locations in rural America, 
among other broadband-centric modifications. INCOMPAS believes that the 
USF programs have been critical to delivering affordable broadband 
connectivity, but their future is in jeopardy without the FCC moving 
forward on contribution reform. I recently published an expert piece on 
the importance of the agency moving forward on reform. It will provide 
you with further explanation of why USF contribution reform is 
necessary and additional information on the path forward recommended by 
the USForward Coalition, which consists of a diverse set of 
organizations across the Nation.
    INCOMPAS also supports adding the inter-agency Broadband Funding 
Map as a layer to the FCC's National Broadband Map, which shows the 
Federal programs that are funding deployment of broadband networks. We 
believe it is important to closely track the funding amounts, entities 
funded, and when locations are served by the funding. Improving on the 
FCC's mapping efforts would help address the concern that the various 
funding programs for deployment are coordinated, better ensure they are 
not duplicative, and lend further insight into areas that lack adequate 
network deployment and may still need funding.
    The Commission may not need to go through a rulemaking process to 
implement this proposal. It could add a layer to its broadband maps, 
reflecting those areas that are being built with broadband funding that 
has already been allocated through the various programs funding network 
deployment. Doing so would potentially address any concern that the 
various funding programs for deployment be coordinated, better ensure 
they are not duplicative, and lend further insight into areas that lack 
adequate network deployment and still need funding. And increased 
transparency--including sharing grant information among the Federal 
agencies--will help ensure that Congress, the FCC, and the other 
Federal agencies know exactly where Federal funding is going and be in 
the position to better assess where funding is still needed. 
Transparency is very important for the public and for policymakers, and 
requiring that the broadband map include this layer in the broadband 
map would enable more transparency in the deployment funding programs.

    Question. Do you see a reason to favor fiber providers in the 
Universal Service Program or other programs, like the Broadband Equity, 
Access, and Deployment program? Or should these be technology neutral?
    Answer. INCOMPAS believes it is important for our Nation's 
competitiveness to be striving towards high-speed, affordable broadband 
to every location in the U.S. Investing and deploying networks that can 
meet our needs today and in the future is critical, and Americans need 
access to both high-speed fixed and mobile 5G networks. INCOMPAS is a 
proponent that fiber serves as the foundation because every technology 
in the broadband ecosystem needs access to fiber--including fixed 
broadband, cable, cellular (mobile & 5G), fixed wireless, and 
satellite. Building more fiber helps all, and fiber densification 
throughout the U.S. is critical for winning the race to 5G. INCOMPAS 
also acknowledges that fiber may not be technically and geographically 
possible in certain locations. As such, INCOMPAS supports encouraging 
recipients to prioritize investments in fiber infrastructure wherever 
feasible. In those situations where fiber is not practicable to deploy 
because of the extremely high cost of the project, geography, or 
topography of the area to be served, projects must reliably meet or 
exceed 100/20 Mbps as the standard and be scalable to a minimum of 
symmetrical 100 Mbps download and upload speeds. INCOMPAS has 
encouraged agencies that are funding new broadband networks to reach 
unserved/underserved locations to set speeds at a level that spurs 
competition specifically by retaining the standard set of at least 100/
20 Mbps while also encouraging scalability up to 100/100 Mbps to help 
deliver reliable home broadband in a time-efficient way that does not 
leave Americans on the wrong side of the digital divide in the future.
    Congressional appropriated funding represents a historic 
opportunity to provide every American with reliable, affordable 
broadband, and INCOMPAS has encouraged states to set their state-
specific ``Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold'' judiciously in 
order to guarantee that the allotted BEAD funds are going towards the 
appropriate mix of fiber and other cost-effective alternative 
technologies--such as next generation Fixed Wireless Access solutions--
to ensure that all the unserved and underserved families and 
communities are granted access to high quality broadband.

    Trusted Communications. Congress and the U.S. Government have taken 
strong actions to reduce the threat posed by equipment manufactured by 
Huawei or ZTE. In 2019, the FCC unanimously voted to ban the use of 
Universal Service Fund dollars to purchase Huawei or ZTE equipment due 
to threats posed to our national security. The Secure and Trusted 
Communications Networks Reimbursement Program now faces a program 
shortfall of over $3 billion. In September 2022, Sen. Fischer (R-NE) 
and I led a letter with 34 Senators total to support closing the 
program shortfall. Sen. Fischer and I also introduced the bipartisan 
Defend Our Networks Act to promptly close this program shortfall.

    Question. Could you discuss the importance of removing risky 
equipment from U.S. networks and the need to build a reliable domestic 
vendor base?
    Answer. Both Congress and the FCC have expressed concern that 
Huawei and ZTE equipment may pose a national security threat to the 
United States. The Secure and Trusted Communications Networks 
Reimbursement Program is an important initiative to address those 
concerns, as it provides crucial funding for smaller companies to 
remove that equipment and replace it with hardware that does not pose 
similar risks to the security of our communication networks. Those 
smaller companies are both more likely to have relied on Huawei and ZTE 
equipment and less likely to be able to afford these network upgrades 
without assistance.
    These concerns are reasonable. China is rapidly becoming a 
geopolitical foe whose policies--from human rights abuses in Tibet to 
the crackdown on Hong Kong democracy and threats to freedom of 
navigation in the South China Sea--are often at odds with basic 
American principles. It's not hard to imagine that the Chinese 
government might use its window into our communications networks to 
gain an upper hand in that geopolitical struggle. Similar issues 
animate the growing concern over TikTok, where we know at least one 
instance where Chinese investigators accessed TikTok data from American 
journalists to identify the source of certain press leaks. I'm not 
convinced that we must guarantee that sensitive network equipment must 
be sourced domestically, it would certainly help, and at a minimum we 
should make sure such equipment is not sourced from companies 
susceptible to governmental pressure from non-allies.

    Question 1. You mentioned in your testimony that the Universal 
Service Fund (USF) should be appropriated rather than a fee on 
consumer's bills. This is a valid point, especially since USF fees are 
regressive in nature. Another way to inject fiscal restraints on the 
program is by setting an overall budget cap. I know this has been 
proposed and considered by the FCC in the past. Former FCC Commissioner 
O'Rielly has written, ``budgets [] help drive out program waste, fraud, 
and abuse by encouraging those running up against a cap to eliminate 
inefficiencies that detract from achieving the program's mission and 
value. At a minimum, budgetary restrictions generate necessary debate 
about overall priorities before increased spending is authorized.'' If 
USF continues to receive funding through a consumer fee rather than the 
appropriations process, what are your thoughts on an overall USF budget 
cap?
    Answer. I have long been a supporter of a hard cap on annual USF 
expenditures, and discussed this at some length here: https://
www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/telecommunications/universal-
service-fund-budget-cap-promotes-efficiency-sustainability/. While the 
FCC has adopted soft caps on some USF programs, the lack of an overall 
budget cap is one of the reasons the fund has grown so large, as each 
program has pursued its mission with little consideration of cost. An 
overall budget cap would force the agency to wring inefficiencies out 
of its programs, so the fund achieves its overall objectives with the 
best possible ``bang for the buck'' to taxpayers. It would also force 
the agency to think more carefully about the costs and benefits of 
repurposing legacy programs such as E-Rate, which long ago achieved its 
original purpose of providing connectivity to America's libraries and 
schools. And it would promote sustainability by making annual fund 
expenditures transparent and predictable, thus limiting the growth of 
the USF surcharge.

    Question 2. I have been a big supporter of the Internet Tax Freedom 
Act and I am concerned by efforts to assess USF taxes on broadband 
without taking a serious look at the consequences. Several witnesses 
highlighted a report that found that if the FCC expanded the 
contribution base to include broadband revenues, the contribution 
factor would decrease from 30 percent to 4 percent. However, I fear 
that broadening the base will only keep the factor below double digits 
if we provide fiscal restraint to the USF programs, rather than write 
another blank check to the FCC.

    a. Are you concerned that if the USF revenue bases were expanded, 
the FCC would gravitate towards expanding USF spending and adding new 
USF programs?
    Answer. Yes, I am. It is vital that USF reform address both the 
numerator and denominator. As noted above, I think the primary driver 
of USF growth is structural: each program is instructed to pursue its 
mission with little concern about cost, which leads to growing expenses 
and insufficient attention to program efficiency. Lifeline is an 
excellent example: as I indicated in my opening remarks, the FCC spends 
nearly a billion dollars each year but has never measured whether these 
expenditures have actually narrowed the low-income digital divide. 
While the current 29 percent USF surcharge rate is absurd, that 
absurdity itself is one of the few factors pushing for fiscal 
responsibility within the program--even though its power is mostly 
rhetorical. While it would be good for consumers to reduce the overall 
surcharge rate, it is vital that Congress couple any expansion of the 
contribution base with binding limits on program expenditures.

    b. If so, would you be concerned that the contribution rate again 
would yet again increase over time to rival the current burden?
    Answer. Yes, for the reasons described above. USF reform must 
include basic changes to the program's structure to ensure fiscal 
responsibility and accountability.

    c. Do you agree that no matter how we decide to address the base, 
we must first ensure that each program is effective and constrained so 
we don't have another contribution factor crisis a decade from now?
    Answer. Yes. As I indicated in my opening remarks, and as Grant 
Thornton made clear in its independent audit of Lifeline, the FCC 
should establish measurable goals for each of the four USF programs, 
and regularly assess how effective the program is at achieving those 
goals.

    Question 3. In your testimony you suggested that expanding the base 
of those who contribute to the contribution factor would discourage the 
very services the program seeks to subsidize. Can you talk more about 
that?
    Answer. Many commentators have noted the regressive effect of the 
existing USF contribution mechanism. The purpose of universal service 
is to improve access to communications services. But the surcharge 
effectively places a 29 percent tax on the interstate and international 
telecommunications component of those services, which raises the 
overall price to consumers and thus at the margin discourages use. The 
same incentives would apply if the contribution base was expanded: it 
would increase the cost of the very services the program seeks to 
promote.
    Use taxes are generally deployed to put the costs of a program on 
the program's users rather than the general public. Consider toll 
roads, for example, which assure that the road's users fund much of its 
upkeep and deters overconsumption. But universal service is a public 
goal whose costs should be borne by the public. Taxing broadband to 
support broadband adoption is counterproductive, as it raises the cost 
of the very product the program seeks to subsidize. This increased cost 
can deter consumer broadband adoption, particularly by low-income 
consumers. And in the long run, it could also adversely impact 
carriers' network investment. Expanding the contribution base to 
include edge providers has a similar distortive effect: it can cause 
providers to reduce the quality of service they offer to consumers and 
to make strategic investment decisions to minimize their contribution 
burden.
    When Google Fiber was first deployed, the company offered broadband 
and cable service but not basic telephone service. The company had the 
capability to do so; many speculated at the time that it chose not to 
offer the service so it would not be subject to the panoply of 
regulations placed on telephone providers, including the requirement to 
contribute to the universal service fund. Expanding the contribution 
base could have a similar deterrent effect on the broader Internet 
ecosystem in ways that are hard to anticipate in advance.
    Question 4. I am concerned that the FCC's sub-delegation of USF 
administration to the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) 
has compromised the FCC's accountability, inhibited oversight over USF 
management, and resulted in widespread waste of American consumers' 
hard-earned dollars and recently sent a letter to the GAO requesting a 
review of USAC's role administering USF.

    a. In your view, are these concerns well-founded? Are USAC's 
operations sufficiently transparent and accountable?

    b. Should we be thinking critically about how USF is managed and 
whether USAC's role needs reform before expanding USF?
    Answer. Because USAC is a private non-profit organization, there is 
little visibility into the key decisions it makes regarding 
administration of the USF program. The GAO has long criticized the FCC 
for insufficient oversight of the fund, particularly the Lifeline and 
E-Rate programs, and much of that insufficiency can be traced to the 
ease with which the agency can leave decision making in USAC's hands. 
There have been numerous challenges recently to the legality of USAC, 
and while those courts have largely decided that the organization's 
mostly ministerial responsibilities do not cross the line into illegal 
delegation, the issues raised in those cases suggest at a minimum that 
it's bad policy for so much money to be distributed outside the public 
eye. Moving more of the fund's operations within the FCC--or subjecting 
it to the appropriations process--would increase visibility and 
accountability.

    Question 1. In the state of South Dakota alone, the high-cost 
program has enabled broadband services to over 115,000 locations, 
including the most rural and remote areas of the state. As I mentioned 
in my opening statement, the FCC has taken meaningful reforms to update 
the high-cost program to ensure predictable and sufficient support to 
providers.
    Are there additional reforms Congress or the FCC should take as it 
relates to the high-cost program today?
    Answer. Thank you for the question. I agree that the FCC has made 
meaningful reforms to bring the high-cost fund into the broadband era, 
one of the most significant of which was executing on the National 
Broadband Plan's recommendation to focus on one-time network 
construction costs to wire unserved areas as quickly as possible. I am 
concerned that the current wave of federally-subsidized network 
construction projects could lead to growth in the number of companies 
seeking high-cost fund assistance for ongoing operating expenses. This 
could cause the High-Cost Fund to balloon and threaten the commitments 
that the program has made to legacy carriers. To safeguard against this 
possibility, I recommend that Congress or the FCC clarify that high-
cost fund assistance will not be available to help fund networks built 
with BEAD or other broadband subsidies. If a company anticipates that 
it will need ongoing assistance with general operations, it should 
calculate the net present value of its expected need and include that 
amount in its initial subsidy request. This would also assure that 
subsidy requests are evaluated on an apples-to-apples basis, so one 
bidder cannot undercut another by relying on future high-cost support 
to make up the difference.

    Question 2. There are a number of permitting barriers that slow 
down the deployment of broadband networks. What measures should 
Congress take to address these concerns?
    Answer. Permitting issues can be a significant stumbling block to 
rapid broadband deployment. Projects that are otherwise dig-ready can 
languish for months or years awaiting various permitting approvals. In 
places where weather limits the working season, even minor permitting 
delays can have an outsized effect on project timelines. But the issue 
is also nuanced--many permitting procedures reflect state and local 
values, so Federal preemption raises important federalism questions. 
One area of low-hanging fruit could be congressional action to 
streamline permitting issues on Federal land. In the electricity 
industry, utilities have found it valuable to route high-voltage 
transmission projects on Federal land because having one permitting 
authority is preferable to negotiating with a patchwork of state and 
local processes. Of course, broadband deployment is very different from 
transmission lines. But Congress could simplify these permitting 
processes to create similar success stories in the broadband space, and 
use deployment on Federal lands as a way to show state and local 
officials that streamlined permitting does not pose significant risks 
to the public. Congress might also consider other ways to facilitate 
deployment by minimizing the need for permitting. For example, the FAIR 
POLES Act would require electric co-ops that want to receive broadband 
subsidies to subject their utility poles to the FCC's pole attachment 
framework, facilitating above-ground deployment.
    It's also important to recognize that BEAD and other Federal 
programs are significantly increasing the workload for resource-limited 
state and local permitting authorities. One solution to this problem 
could be federally mandated shot clocks, which force permitting 
authorities to triage projects in the pipeline for more careful review. 
But another could be to provide Federal resources to aid state and 
local permitting processes, such as through grants to staff up, or 
investment in technological solutions that could facilitate permitting 
review.

                            Daniel A. Lyons
    Question 1. Following the recent historic funding made available 
for broadband deployment, there are important discussions to be had on 
reforms to USF--including contribution reform, improving transparency, 
and ensuring the programs are efficient and effective--but this is also 
an opportunity to discuss potential reforms to the broader ecosystem of 
Federal broadband programs. A GAO report from last year found that 
there are currently at least 133 programs across 15 different agencies 
that could be used for broadband.
    The report highlighted numerous concerns with this fragmented 
approach to Federal broadband policy, including varying project 
criteria, challenges with agency coordination, and administrative 
complexities for applicants. The report concluded that ``this patchwork 
of programs could lead to wasteful duplication of funding and effort''. 
This patchwork of Federal broadband programs identified by the GAO 
could be diverting funding and focus away from truly unserved areas 
like in Alaska.
    How should Congress be looking more comprehensively at all of these 
programs across agencies to look for potential redundancies and areas 
for alignment in order to maximize effectiveness for the unserved?
    Answer. The GAO is absolutely correct about this. While NTIA and 
others have tried to improve communication and coordination among these 
programs--and they deserve credit for those efforts--the fact remains 
that the multitude of programs accomplishing similar objectives brings 
a serious risk of duplication. And subsidizing multiple companies to 
build out one area diverts scarce resources from other areas in need.
    Congress can play an important role by adopting an overarching set 
of principles to guide these myriad programs, something like a national 
broadband strategy. There are a wide range of principles that such a 
strategy could encompass, many of which are derived by lessons learned 
during the past half-decade of experiments with broadband buildout. At 
a minimum, these principles should include

  <bullet> prioritization to unserved areas that do not currently have 
        broadband access;

  <bullet> a commitment to distribution on a technologically neutral 
        basis;

  <bullet> distribution of subsidies via a reverse auction mechanism 
        with agreed-upon minimum qualifications for parties to bid; and

  <bullet> adoption of activity-based minimum speed requirements, where 
        minimum speeds are determined by the bandwidth necessary to 
        engage in an identified bundle of important tasks, rather than 
        by arbitrary Mbps thresholds that can inadvertently exclude 
        competitive options from the auction.

    Question 2. Our broken permitting system in America stifles many of 
our infrastructure projects, including broadband deployment. Permitting 
delays can be especially detrimental in areas like Alaska (and South 
Dakota) where there are shorter construction seasons.

    a. Can you discuss in a little more detail how the Federal 
permitting process has undermined the ability for network operators to 
serve rural America?

    b. What sorts of permitting reforms should Congress prioritize in 
the pursuit of Universal Service?
    Answer. Permitting issues can be a significant stumbling block to 
rapid broadband deployment. Projects that are otherwise dig-ready can 
languish for months or years awaiting various permitting approvals. In 
(often rural) places where weather limits the working season, even 
minor permitting delays can have an outsized effect on project 
timelines. And rural buildout often requires coordination among several 
different permitting authorities, which compounds the potential delays.
    But the issue is also nuanced--many permitting procedures reflect 
state and local values, so Federal preemption raises important 
federalism questions. One area of low-hanging fruit could be 
congressional action to streamline permitting issues on Federal land. 
In the electricity industry, utilities have found it valuable to route 
high-voltage transmission projects on Federal land because having one 
permitting authority is preferable to negotiating with a patchwork of 
state and local processes. Of course, broadband deployment is very 
different from transmission lines. But Congress could simplify these 
permitting processes to create similar success stories in the broadband 
space, and use deployment on Federal lands as a way to show state and 
local officials that streamlined permitting does not pose significant 
risks to the public. Congress might also consider other ways to 
facilitate deployment by minimizing the need for permitting. For

local permitting processes, such as through grants to staff up, or 
investment in technological solutions that could facilitate permitting 
review.

    Question 3. USAC, the entity responsible for administering USF 
subsidies, is notorious for its lack of transparency and 
responsiveness. Shouldn't we be thinking critically about how USF is 
managed and whether USAC's role needs reform?
    Answer. Absolutely. Because USAC is a private non-profit 
organization, there is little visibility into the key decisions it 
makes regarding administration of the USF program. The GAO has long 
criticized the FCC for insufficient oversight of the fund, particularly 
the Lifeline and E-Rate programs, and much of that insufficiency can be 
traced to the ease with which the agency can leave decision making in

    Permitting Process and Impact on Rural and Tribal Connectivity. In 
your testimony and during the subcommittee hearing itself you spoke 
about the permitting delays and roadblocks that negatively impact 
Universal Service Fund (USF) programs. As you know, these consequences 
are particularly pronounced when it comes to rural and Tribal 
communities. As you also know, much of my home state of Arizona 
consists of rural and Tribal communities. Therefore, similar to South 
Dakota, much of the land where broadband buildout must occur is owned 
by other entities, including the Federal government.

    Question 1. In your testimony you specified three suggestions to 
ease the permitting burden on these communities: (1) placing a ``shot 
clock'' on respective Federal agencies for acting on whether and what 
particular review is needed under the circumstances; (2) having 
agencies designate personnel for providers to contact; and (3) imposing 
congressional mandates rather than suggestions to ensure consistency 
across agencies. Could you provide further detail about how you 
envision Congress acting on these suggestions and how these reforms 
would ultimately ease the permitting burden and help advance the goals 
of the USF program, particularly for rural populations?
    Answer. Despite repeated inquiries by providers and their engineers 
and contractors, small rural broadband providers all too frequently 
encounter a lack of clear, consistent, and frequent communication with 
permitting offices and agencies, particularly when it comes to 
determining whether an application is deemed complete, identifying 
those items that are found still to be missing or lacking, and sharing 
the status otherwise of processing permit applications. The use of a 
shot clock and a designated agency official point of contact would help 
add more predictability and accountability, and it is essential as well 
that agencies have the staffing resources in place to process such 
requests in a timely and effective manner.
    We have seen a great deal of consensus for some time now on 
potential solutions to mitigate administrative barriers to deployment, 
including calls by the Administrator of the National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration for states to accelerate broadband 
permitting processes prior to the distribution of Federal grant funds. 
Similarly, we were particularly pleased by recent passage of the 
American Broadband Deployment Act by this Committee's counterpart in 
the House of Representatives. This legislation as voted out of the 
House Energy & Commerce Committee should help greatly in facilitating 
the timely and cost-effective deployment of networks in rural America. 
While no one should overlook that the economic barriers to deployment 
and the ongoing provision of broadband services are far greater than 
just permitting barriers alone, streamlining environmental and 
historical preservation reviews, providing more reasonable capability 
for the upgrading and replacement of facilities in previously disturbed 
rights of way, and establishing more meaningful ``shot clocks'' for 
review of applications can all help in making the business case for 
investment as well and in delivering services more rapidly to consumers 
and communities in need.
    In the end, recipients of Federal USF support are subject to 
deployment obligations that include time-sensitive milestones for the 
delivery of services at a certain level by certain deadlines. If these 
providers cannot meet their milestones because they are awaiting 
permits, this puts the integrity of the program at risk, places these 
providers at risk of failing to comply with their obligations, and 
ultimately harms the consumers and communities that are the 
beneficiaries of those universal service programs and efforts.

    Question 2. Looking beyond these suggestions, are there additional 
things Congress or Federal agencies should be looking at to streamline 
the review and permitting process, whether through USF programs or 
otherwise, that can help expand affordable connectivity to rural and 
Tribal communities?
    Answer. Referring back to my prior answer, I would urge Congress 
first and foremost to take up legislation like the American Broadband 
Deployment Act. This will not in itself ``solve'' permitting 
challenges, but it builds upon prior work and lessons learned in this 
area and should help address some of the key shortcomings in current 
permitting processes as explained above. I would also encourage 
Congress to pay close attention to staffing issues--if a permitting 
office does not have sufficient human resources to review and respond 
to applications, process improvements will only help so much. Finally, 
it is important that federal, state, and local agencies carry out the 
mandates in legislation such as the American Broadband Deployment Act 
effectively and that the answer the call of policymakers like the NTIA 
Administrator to take steps now to expedite and accelerate permitting 
procedures--and Congress should stand ready to engage in further 
oversight to ensure that process improvements lead to concrete results.

    Supply Chains. The pandemic highlighted how delicate our critical 
supply chains are--including for telecommunications equipment. 
Disruptions to supply chains can impact the timely completion of 
broadband projects funded by the Universal Service Fund's High-Cost 
Program. Last Congress, this Committee unanimously passed our 
bipartisan Network Equipment Transparency (NET) Act, which creates a 
periodic requirement for the FCC to notify Congress of supply chain 
disruptions delaying the completion of broadband projects.

    Question. How would you describe the health of our supply chains 
needed to construct new broadband infrastructure projects?
    Answer. This Committee is rightly focused on supply chain issues, 
which are a concern for small rural providers that continue to see 
significant delays and cost increases for certain kinds of equipment 
necessary to deploy communications infrastructure. The current state of 
the broadband and telecommunications supply chain could undermine the 
timeliness, reach, and overall effectiveness of key infrastructure 
funding initiatives.
    Against this backdrop, I urge congressional leaders to prompt key 
Federal agencies to provide greater flexibility and clearer guidance 
with respect to Build America Buy America requirements, to promote 
increased domestic production of critical communications supplies, and 
to engage in a comprehensive evaluation of the state of supply chains 
especially as they affect smaller broadband providers.

    Question 1. While this hearing importantly looked at the four 
spending programs within the Universal Service Fund (USF), I don't 
think we can buy our way out of this problem. There are many regulatory 
barriers, such as permitting, currently preventing the deployment of 
broadband. For example, the National Environmental Permitting Act 
(NEPA) and other laws and executive orders make infrastructure projects 
cost more and take longer. President Biden has been removing Trump-era 
NEPA rules reforms that had streamlined and limited the scope of the 
NEPA process and limited the scope of what must be considered for 
permitting processes.
    In fact, by NTIA's estimates the best-case scenario for a broadband 
project is 4-7 months of waiting, and that's only if the project is 
lucky enough to receive a categorical exclusion. If a project needs an 
environmental assessment, it is looking at ``6-12 months or more.'' If 
it needs an environmental impact statement it is looking at ``12-24 
months or more.'' \1\

    In your written testimony you mention how these permitting delays 
have impacted your company: ``Navigating complicated application and 
review processes within individual Federal land-managing and property-
managing agencies can be burdensome for any network provider, but 
particularly for the smaller network operators that serve the most 
rural portions of the country.'' You also discuss obstacles related to 
pole access and railroad crossings: ``obtaining reasonable terms and 
conditions for attaching network facilities to poles that are owned and 
operated by other entities or crossing railroads can result in long 
delays and costly fees charged to providers seeking to build out 
networks to rural communities lacking service.''

    a. Given the tens of billions of additional broadband dollars going 
out the door soon through BEAD, what administrative and regulatory 
burdens should this committee focus on removing to reduce inefficiency?
    Answer. We have seen a great deal of consensus for some time now on 
potential solutions to mitigate the administrative barriers to 
deployment, including calls by the Administrator of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration for states to 
accelerate broadband permitting processes prior to the distribution of 
Federal grant funds. Similarly, we were particularly pleased by recent 
passage of the American Broadband Deployment Act by this Committee's 
counterpart in the House of Representatives. This legislation as voted 
out of the House Energy & Commerce Committee should help greatly in 
facilitating the timely and cost-effective deployment of networks in 
rural America. While no one should overlook that the economic barriers 
to deployment and the ongoing provision of broadband services are far 
greater than just permitting barriers alone, streamlining environmental 
and historical preservation reviews, providing more reasonable 
capability for the upgrading and replacement of facilities in 
previously disturbed rights of way, and establishing more meaningful 
``shot clocks'' for review of applications can all help in making the 
business case for investment as well and in delivering services more 
rapidly to consumers and communities in need.
    Furthermore, laws that permit railroads to act as unconstrained 
``gatekeepers'' with respect to railroad crossings that intersect with 
public rights-of-way can severely hinder broadband deployment. This 
Committee should focus on actions that do not interfere with state or 
local laws, but move to ensure a reasonable fee for access to railroad 
crossings and/or to set reasonable timelines for the processing of 
requests for such access as it pertains to broadband deployment.

    Question 2. In your testimony, you advocated assessing USF taxes on 
broadband service, claiming: ``customers would be highly unlikely to 
cancel 100 Mbps broadband service simply because they might face the 
prospect of a $3 contribution fee attached to that purchase.''

    a. Is your estimate of a $3 fee based on current USF spending 
levels or FCC-forecasted spending levels?

    b. Without a cap on overall USF spending, do you agree that this 
fee would increase if the FCC decided to expand its current USF 
programs or USF spending levels?
    Answer. a. The example of a $3 fee in my testimony was premised 
upon an estimated 4 percent contribution assessment for broadband 
service that costs $75 per month. In fact, as the USForward Report 
cited and discussed in my testimony indicated, it is quite possible 
that the assessment percentage could be less than 4 percent. Moreover, 
as also noted in my testimony, this amount could be materially smaller 
still if all of those that use and benefit from broadband networks--
including large Internet-centric businesses--were to contribute their 
fair share. Nonetheless, in estimating that the contribution factor 
could fall from 30 percent to less than 4 percent by including 
broadband revenues in the contribution base, the USForward Report 
presumed that USF distributions could be as high as $9.7 billion--
although the FCC's most recent USF Monitoring Report indicated that USF 
distributions in 2021 were less (approximately $8.55 billion). Thus, 
the sample of a fee in my testimony is likely higher and more 
conservative (from the perspective of the potential burden on the 
consumer) in assuming a fund that is more than $1 billion greater than 
the FCC's most recent reported distributions.
    b. The contribution factor is mathematically driven by two 
factors--demand on the USF (spending) and contributions to the fund 
(supply). Over the past decade, the spending appears to have remained 
relatively stable--the FCC's USF Monitoring Report indicates that 
spending has ranged in magnitude from a high of $8.9 billion in 
disbursements in 2017 to a low of $7.9 billion in 2014. By contrast, 
contributions to the fund have steadily eroded over the past decade. 
Thus, if USF spending were to increase or the supply were to continue 
to decrease, the contribution factor would increase.

    Question 3. GAO has found that the Federal government runs more 
than 130 broadband funding programs administered by at least 15 
agencies. Not only are the USF programs duplicative with other programs 
at other agencies, but there also appears to be duplication within the 
USF. For example, the E-Rate program continues to fund broadband 
buildout, even though there are multiple programs, including the USF's 
own high-cost program that do the same thing. Moreover, E-Rate 
continues to fund broadband in schools even though, by Education 
Superhighway's own admission, virtually every school has access to 
high-speed broadband and ``the classroom connectivity gap has been 
closed.''

    a. Are you concerned that E-Rate funding for broadband deployment 
is duplicative with other broadband funding programs?
    Answer. Since its establishment, E-Rate has had the core mission of 
ensuring schools and libraries have access to affordable connectivity. 
There is no question that every school and library should have 
sustainable access to robust and affordable broadband. However, it 
remains vital to focus on that core mission and, if a school or library 
already has connectivity in place, consistent with the initial 
fundamental purpose of the E-Rate program, we should using E-Rate 
resources to make sure the institution can afford to buy service over 
that existing network rather than conceiving of ways to build redundant 
or duplicative connections.

    b. Given that classroom broadband is virtually universal, do you 
believe it is necessary for E-Rate to continue to fund broadband 
buildout or ``special construction''? Is this a wise use of taxpayer 
dollars?
    Answer. As previously stated, E-Rate should maintain its focus upon 
ensuring that schools and libraries have access to robust and 
affordable broadband. It is not an effective use of Federal resources 
under any program to fund the deployment of duplicative networks 
through ``special construction'' or other measures..

    c. Should E-Rate funds be used to overbuild high-speed broadband 
networks? How can E-Rate overbuilding affect rural broadband access?
    Answer. No Federal program, including but not limited to E-Rate, 
should be used to overbuild networks that are already delivering high-
speed broadband services. Overbuilding in the E-Rate program risks 
consuming program resources that could be used by rural schools or 
libraries that need help in paying for better connections, and it also 
could put at risk the viability and sustainability of community-wide 
access in rural areas specifically if some of the larger anchor 
institutions have dedicated networks while neighboring residential 
areas remain unserved.

     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to 
                               Denny Law
    Question 1. Given that there are over 130 broadband programs spread 
out across 15 agencies, I've been concerned about the issue of 
overbuilding--meaning one or more Federal broadband programs providing 
taxpayer dollars to deploy broadband services to the same location. 
Have we seen existing broadband service be overbuilt by other Federal 
funds and if so, what does this mean for truly unserved areas?
    Answer. On June 25, 2021, the Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration's (NTIA) entered into 
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to increase interagency 
coordination as each agency, as directed by Congress, distributes funds 
for various broadband deployment programs. This MOU was required by the 
Broadband Interagency Coordination Act and established terms and 
procedures to consult and work in concert with respect to the 
distribution of funds for broadband deployment. Moreover, on May 9, 
2022, the FCC, USDA, NTIA, and the U.S. Department of Treasury entered 
into a separate memorandum for the sharing of information related to 
their administration of broadband programs.
    While these represent good faith efforts to avoid conflict between 
programs and ensure funding decisions are made based upon more complete 
information, it is not clear that they are working in all cases or 
being applied to all programs. In particular, it appears that certain 
NTIA programs have in certain instances accepted self-certification of 
need by entities and communities with respect to broadband access 
without taking account of either the availability of networks and 
services already in those areas (as reported in the FCC's Broadband 
Data Collection) or enforceable commitments already in place under 
other agencies' programs that compel delivery of high-speed broadband 
service in those areas by a date certain. It is unclear why certain 
programs do not operate under the same ``guardrails'' as others, but it 
is clear that coordination should apply consistently across all 
programs without exception, the same maps should be used in making 
awards as directed by Congress, and a failure to do so both expends 
resources that could be used to address truly unserved areas and puts 
at risk the sustainability and viability of existing networks and the 
integrity of these various Federal programs.

    Question 2. In the state of South Dakota alone, the high-cost 
program has enabled broadband services to over 115,000 locations, 
including the most rural and remote areas of the state. As I mentioned 
in my opening statement, the FCC has taken meaningful reforms to update 
the high-cost program to ensure predictable and sufficient support to 
providers.
    Are there additional reforms Congress or the FCC should take as it 
relates to the high-cost program today?
    Answer. Proposals for enhancements and updates to the Alternative 
Connect America Cost Model (ACAM) and the Connect America Fund 
Broadband Loop Support (CAF-BLS) mechanism high-cost programs have been 
in front of the FCC for at least a year. As billions of dollars are set 
to go out the door from the National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration's (NTIA) Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) 
program, updates to these mechanisms are essential for effective 
interagency coordination and to realize the most and reach the farthest 
leveraging these various programs. With proper planning and reforms, 
these universal service programs can complement BEAD and promote more 
effective use of resources in reaching unserved Americans. We therefore 
urge the FCC to act as soon as possible on reforms regarding the ACAM 
and CAF-BLS programs and pending Alaska Plan reforms as well.

    Question 3. There are a number of permitting barriers that slow 
down the deployment of broadband networks. What measures should 
Congress take to address these concerns?
    Answer. We have seen general consensus for some time now on 
potential solutions to simplify administrative and regulatory barriers. 
Congress should focus on streamlining federal, state, and local 
broadband deployment permitting processes particularly pursuant to the 
National Environmental Protection Act (``NEPA'') and National 
Historical Preservation Act (``NHPA'') reviews. Establishing shot 
clocks for permitting reviews, providing deemed granted remedies for 
missed shot clocks, and exempting deployments over certain previously 
disturbed lands from NEPA and NHPA reviews are among a few of the 
solutions we would recommend Congress focus on. We were particularly 
pleased by recent passage of the American Broadband Deployment Act by 
this Committee's counterpart in the House of Representatives. This 
legislation as voted out of the House Energy & Commerce Committee 
should help greatly in addressing the kinds of issues noted above. 
While no one should overlook that the economic barriers to deployment 
and the ongoing provision of broadband services are far greater than 
just permitting barriers alone, streamlining environmental and 
historical preservation reviews, providing more reasonable capability 
for the upgrading and replacement of facilities in previously disturbed 
rights of way, and establishing more meaningful ``shot clocks'' for 
review of applications can all help in making the business case for 
investment as well and in delivering services more rapidly to consumers 
and communities in need.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to 
                               Denny Law
    Question 1. Following the recent historic funding made available 
for broadband deployment, there are important discussions to be had on 
reforms to USF--including contribution reform, improving transparency, 
and ensuring the programs are efficient and effective--but this is also 
an opportunity to discuss potential reforms to the broader ecosystem of 
Federal broadband programs. A GAO report from last year found that 
there are currently at least 133 programs across 15 different agencies 
that could be used for broadband.
    The report highlighted numerous concerns with this fragmented 
approach to Federal broadband policy, including varying project 
criteria, challenges with agency coordination, and administrative 
complexities for applicants. The report concluded that ``this patchwork 
of programs could lead to wasteful duplication of funding and effort''. 
This patchwork of Federal broadband programs identified by the GAO 
could be diverting funding and focus away from truly unserved areas 
like in Alaska.
    How should Congress be looking more comprehensively at all of these 
programs across agencies to look for potential redundancies and areas 
for alignment in order to maximize effectiveness for the unserved?
    Answer. Over the past decade, Congress and various administrations 
have created a wide range of grant programs at various agencies that 
are either intended for or can be used for broadband deployment. If 
coordinated carefully, these programs can address discrete needs and 
work in concert to deliver broadband where it is lacking. While there 
are many smaller programs that look to tackle particular broadband 
deployment challenges, there are a few that are clearly the largest in 
terms of resources and reach, and it would seem prudent and most 
important to target attention and oversight upon these--the American 
Rescue Plan Act initiatives under the purview of the U.S. Department of 
Treasury (i.e., the State & Local Fiscal Recovery Funds and the Capital 
Projects Fund), the ReConnect program overseen by the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, and a few programs overseen by the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration (i.e., the Broadband 
Infrastructure Program, the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Fund, and the 
upcoming Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program). Although 
others may distribute some funds for broadband deployment as well, I 
would submit that focusing upon these will capture the vast majority of 
funds that will be spent for broadband deployment and the vast majority 
of projects for this purpose. I would also submit that Congress should 
let these programs ``run their course'' and complete their work before 
introducing additional grant programs for network construction.
    With these programs already in place or soon to be launched, I 
would submit that the key role now for Congress is to ensure that: (a) 
each program is spending its dollars efficiently and effectively; and 
(b) each program is coordinating, rather than conflicting, with the 
others. For example, where one grant program awards funds to build a 
network in an area where another program is already supporting 
deployment (or certainly in an area where a network already exists 
capable of delivering robust broadband), this is a potential waste of 
resources that undermines the integrity of such efforts and could leave 
other areas lacking for better broadband. The agencies have undertaken 
efforts through coordination agreements and a map setting forth 
``enforceable commitments'' under their various programs--and Congress 
and the agencies should make sure now that these resources are used to 
avoid conflicts in all circumstances, without exception and without 
distinction as to any of the programs identified earlier.
    Finally, it is worth noting the unique role that the FCC's 
universal service programs play. As I explained in my testimony, the 
USF programs are not grant programs. They enable deployment by helping 
to make the business case better for doing so, but they do not provide 
upfront capital. Moreover, they primarily aim to provide ongoing 
support that is critical to ensure that networks are sustainable and 
services are affordable in rural areas. For this reason, while it is 
important that the FCC's programs be coordinated with the other efforts 
identified above, it is equally important that the materially different 
and distinct (and more comprehensive) purpose of the FCC's universal 
service fund initiatives not be lost or overlooked as part of a process 
of thoughtful coordination.

    Question 2. Our broken permitting system in America stifles many of 
our infrastructure projects, including broadband deployment. Permitting 
delays can be especially detrimental in areas like Alaska (and South 
Dakota) where there are shorter construction seasons.
    a. Can you discuss in a little more detail how the Federal 
permitting process has undermined the ability for network operators to 
serve rural America?
    Answer. Working with Federal agencies to navigate the 
environmental, historic preservation, and tribal consultation process 
and receive permits necessary to begin network construction is a major 
impediment to deploying broadband infrastructure in rural America. 
While important, the process is often expensive, arduous, complex, and 
duplicative. Given the nature of the areas they serve--especially in 
Alaska and many western states in the lower 48--rural operators often 
have no choice but to construct networks that cross Bureau of Land 
Management, Forest Service or other federally-owned land--and thus to 
obtain permits and permissions necessary for deployment within and 
across such areas. Rerouting even a small portion of the project to 
avoid such requirements is typically impossible due to the substantial 
distances involved, impassible terrain, or the inability to obtain 
easements on adjacent privately held land (if any exits). As you 
alluded, construction seasons are short and even permitting delays of 
just a few months can have profound consequences. Engaging experts to 
conduct environmental and historical preservation reviews is expensive 
and these costs must be incurred even when an installation is in a 
previously disturbed right-of-way. Inconsistency from agency to agency 
as it relates to permitting greatly increases delays as operators sort 
through the burdensome bureaucratic red-tape. It is the sum of these 
broken processes that undermine the ability of network operators to 
serve rural America.

    b. What sorts of permitting reforms should Congress prioritize in 
the pursuit of Universal Service?
    Answer. We have seen general consensus for some time now on 
potential solutions to simplify administrative and regulatory barriers. 
Congress should focus on streamlining federal, state, and local 
broadband deployment permitting processes particularly pursuant to the 
National Environmental Protection Act (``NEPA'') and National 
Historical Preservation Act (``NHPA'') reviews. Establishing shot 
clocks for permitting reviews, providing deemed granted remedies for 
missed shot clocks, and exempting deployments over certain previously 
disturbed lands from NEPA and NHPA reviews are among a few of the 
solutions we would recommend Congress focus on. We were particularly 
pleased by recent passage of the American Broadband Deployment Act by 
this Committee's counterpart in the House of Representatives. This

for the upgrading and replacement of facilities in previously disturbed 
rights of way, and establishing more meaningful ``shot clocks'' for

investment as well and in delivering services more rapidly to consumers 
and communities in need.

    When carriers like Golden West look at deploying the networks that 
are funded by the Universal Service Fund and other broadband subsidy 
programs, there are often slowdowns in the process that stop fiber from 
getting placed in the ground. For example, permitting delays from both 
the Federal government and states and localities, as well as railroads 
and even landowners at times, might mean that dollars go out the door, 
but broadband is not reaching consumers.
    Can you discuss how permitting and other conditions on broadband 
deployment funding are causing problems for companies like yours?
    Answer. Roadblocks, delays, and increased costs associated with 
permitting and approval processes are particularly problematic for 
broadband providers in rural areas. For broadband construction projects 
in rural areas, it is common to deal with dozens and perhaps hundreds 
of different landowners to complete a single project. The review 
processes can take substantial amounts of time, undermining our ability 
to plan for and deploy broadband infrastructure--especially in parts of 
the country where construction seasons are shorter due to inclement 
weather.
    We have seen a great deal of consensus for some time now on 
potential solutions to mitigate the administrative barriers to 
deployment, including calls by the Administrator of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration for states to 
accelerate broadband permitting processes prior to the distribution of

    Rural and Tribal Connectivity. During the subcommittee hearing you 
referred to Alaska as a ``success'' in terms of both the funding it has 
received and the consequent gains in connectivity, particularly 
regarding telehealth services, through the Rural Health Care Program. 
Other witnesses spoke to the positive impact the Federal Communication 
Commission's (FCC) Alaska Plan has had on small providers extending 
their rural broadband service. In my home state of Arizona there are 
many remote communities, Tribal communities, and other underserved 
populations far from major urban or commercial centers. This is true 
throughout much of the Southwest and in other areas of the country as 
well. The need for affordable connectivity, both for healthcare and for 
other essential services, is perhaps most vital to these communities.

    Question 1. Are there lessons for the FCC to learn from the 
``success'' in Alaska, particularly for states like Arizona with large 
populations of Tribal communities? If so, how can those lessons be 
applied successfully when addressing needed changes to Universal 
Service Fund (USF) programs, including the Rural Health Care Program?
    Answer. What the FCC was able to achieve through the Alaska Plan 
was a tailoring of USF support to meet the specific needs of Alaska and 
its 228 tribal organizations. Whereas USF often must take a ``one-size-
fits-all'' approach to its program rules, as it relates to Tribal 
lands, such an approach can result in severe challenges that hinder 
advancing broadband connectivity. Be it terrain like the thick calcium 
carbonate deposits (``caliche'') throughout Arizona, the extreme 
temperature changes that occur in a day in many of the desert tribal 
lands, or the remoteness of the tribal reservations, there are factors 
that need specific focus with targeted solutions.
    The tailoring of support to meet the unique needs of tribal 
communities is the key lesson to be learned from the Alaska Plan. By 
tailoring support, tribal areas like those in Arizona could use greater 
broadband connectivity and expanded access through the Rural Health 
Care program to overcome the vast distances between residents and these 
services. The FCC, in consultation with tribal communities, could 
better coordinate strategies to take limited USF resources to ensure 
they maximize their potential for assisting tribal governments and 
providers serving tribal lands to ensure that residents on these lands 
have access to the full benefits.
    Middle-mile and Permitting Issues. You also discussed the 
difficulties that Tribal communities face when providers attempt to 
build out cost-effective, resilient middle-mile broadband networks. 
These difficulties include rugged terrain and permitting processes on 
top of the difficulties that other rural communities may face.

    Question 2. Could you expand upon the particular difficulties that 
Tribal communities face in building out their middle-mile networks? How 
specifically would the expansion of USF funding to Tribal middle mile 
challenges ultimately help with affordable connectivity? Are there 
additional reforms to USF that could have a particularly outsized 
positive impact on these communities?
    Answer. Middle mile scarcity on Tribal lands is well-documented, in 
fact the Government Accountability Office did a report in 2016 that 
outlined the challenges of delivering broadband to tribal lands. (GAO 
16-222). And more recently, funding requests far exceeded funding 
available for the NTIA's programs that support middle mile, the 
Enhancing Middle Mile Program funding and the Tribal middle mile 
funding opportunity that was part of the Tribal Broadband Connectivity 
Fund. Tribal lands often have rights of ways that are held by various 
government agencies and combined with rugged terrain, the remoteness of 
many reservations and the fact that they are sparsely-populated, cost 
and potential return on investment present real barriers to deployment 
of middle mile. The expansion of USF to cover middle mile costs to 
reach and serve Tribal lands can help address the higher costs and aid 
with ensuring affordable access to broadband for Tribal communities.
    In addition, the FCC may want to consider how it could reform USF 
generally to better serve the needs of Tribal communities by, for 
example, bundling the funding that is available through the four USF 
programs into one package of funding that the Tribal government could 
use to address these needs. Tribes are sovereign nations with sovereign 
governments that serve close-knit communities. Their governments often 
provide their residents with housing, schools, libraries, health 
clinics, and public safety services within the boundaries of their 
reservation. By aggregating their funding into one pool, Tribal 
governments may be able to either build and serve their communities 
themselves or demonstrate to providers the opportunity that would be 
available if they were to serve the Tribal community. The NCAI has 
suggested that the FCC could establish a Tribal Broadband Fund as part 
of the USF program and fund it with $1 billion per year. What underpins 
these and other ideas to better serve Tribal communities is an 
understanding that they are unique communities and as such they will 
need focused efforts to address the challenges of delivering broadband 
service to their communities.

    USF Contribution Reform. We joined Sens. Klobuchar (D-MN) and Thune 
(R-SD) to introduce the bipartisan Reforming Broadband Connectivity 
Act. This bill directs the FCC to expand the contribution base for the 
Universal Service Fund (USF) within statutory authorities. USF is a key 
program for communities across Colorado. If the USF contribution base 
is expanded to apply to websites and social media platforms, Congress 
should first amend the Communications Act to do so.

    Question. How should Congress harmonize the legacy programs under 
USF within the sister programs created under the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law or during the pandemic?
    Answer. Public Knowledge believes that the reform of the FCC's 
universal service contribution mechanism is well past due. Congress, 
through the 1996 Act, directed the FCC to establish a ``specific, 
predictable, and sufficient mechanism . . . to preserve and advance 
universal service.'' 47 U.S.C. Sec. 254(d). The Reforming Broadband 
Connectivity Act, which enjoys bipartisan support, would be a good 
first step. It would require the FCC to help inform Congress by 
conducting a study, within 120 days, to assess the need for expansion 
of the contribution base. In addition, it would direct the FCC to 
conclude a proceeding within one year from the date of enactment to 
expand the contribution base, while retaining the FCC's expert 
discretion on how best to move forward. I would note, the FCC has 
current authority that it could and should exercise to stabilize the 
contribution base. It has been reluctant to do so. But as the 
bipartisan Reforming Broadband Connectivity Act calls for, the FCC 
needs to act.
    Contribution reform is critical work for the FCC to undertake 
because the answer to your question is highly dependent on a universal 
service program that has a stable contribution base. Absent 
stabilization in the USF base, the one-time temporary support provided 
by Congress through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other funding 
vehicles will not sustain the advances that support has generated in 
helping to further close the digital divide. The four universal service 
programs focus on broadband access and affordability for low income 
consumers and ensure the key anchor institutions (schools, libraries, 
and rural health care facilities) have the affordable connectivity 
needed to assist their constituencies. Congress over the last three 
years has provided one-time funding for each of these areas. But one-
time funding, like the funding provided by the Broadband, Equity, 
Access and Deployment (BEAD) program and the Capital Projects Fund, is 
not sufficient to ensure networks that are built in unserved areas 
where the costs remain high will be maintained and upgraded. One-time 
funding will not ensure that the millions of low-income families helped 
through the Affordable Connectivity Program (and its predecessor the 
Emergency Broadband Benefit program) will be able to reliably maintain 
their service month after month. One-time funding will not maintain the 
advances that were achieved by providing greater connectivity for 
schoolchildren and library patrons. And one-time funding will not 
sustain the life-saving benefits from increased telehealth access.
    In short, Congress made great strides in ensuring all the benefits 
that flow from broadband access were realized during the pandemic and 
set a path for seed funding to help close the digital divide, but the 
long term, sustained funding that is necessary to build on those gains 
will be the work of the universal service programs. The USF must 
continue to play a significant role in our Nation's efforts towards 
closing the digital divide and that means we need the FCC to ensure the 
program is providing sufficient, sustainable support so that it 
achieves the objectives Congress charged it with achieving. USF should 
remain the foundation of our Nation's commitment to ensure ``consumers 
in all regions of the Nation, including low-income consumers and those 
in rural, insular, and high-cost areas, should have access to 
telecommunications and information services.'' 47 U.S.C.

      Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ted Cruz to 
                               Greg Guice
    Question 1. In your testimony, you stated: ``With 17 million 
families enrolled, [American Connectivity Program (ACP)] is a huge 
success.''

    a. Yes or no: Do you believe the ACP's enrollment levels are ipso 
facto proof of the program's success?
    Answer. Yes

    b. If yes, why?
    Answer. ACP is a success in Texas where over one-third of the 
households that are eligible for the program have enrolled. That is 
1.35 million households receiving ACP, making Texas the second largest 
recipient of funding. As Texas Governor Greg Abbott explained 
``reliable, high-speed Internet is an essential part of providing 
world-class education, healthcare, and business opportunities to 
hardworking Texans across the state.'' He went on to note that 
``[t]hrough programs like the Affordable Connectivity Program, more 
families and businesses will be able to afford high-speed Internet as 
we continue shrinking the digital gap so that every Texan--and 
American--has the opportunity to succeed.'' I agree.
    The overwhelming participation numbers (now more than 18 million 
households representing about 60 million Americans) and good 
participation rate (now about 36 percent) are certainly indicators of 
the need for support amongst low-income American families who are faced 
with difficult choices each month (food, medical bills, clothing, 
transportation, utilities) that may force them to forgo broadband 
connectivity in any given month.
    Simply put, the ACP is doing for over 18 million households what it 
was designed to do--providing a means by which qualifying low-income 
households are able to afford broadband service month after month 
meaning they have a steady connection to broadband so they can reap the 
economic and educational benefits that flow from stable connectivity.

    Question 2. While the ACP presumably exists to promote broadband 
adoption among low-income Americans, data so far suggests that most of 
the subsidies have gone to those who already subscribed to broadband. 
According to studies of ACP's predecessor Emergency Broadband Benefit 
(EBB) program, only five to 10 percent of subsidized participants did 
not subscribe to broadband prior to receiving the benefit. Moreover, 
the FCC's own surveys of ACP participants confirm that only 16 percent 
of respondents did not have broadband prior to subscribing to the ACP. 
This fact has been confirmed by telecom companies participating in the 
programs, as well. As has been reported in the press, the largest 
recipient of both EBB and ACP funds recently stated, ``[t]he vast 
majority of the [ACP] customers we have were already existing customers 
who are now benefiting from that benefit.''

    a. Do you believe ACP subsidies should be targeted to low-income 
households that do not already subscribe to broadband?
    Answer. ACP should target low-income households that have not 
already subscribed as well as low-income households that have 
subscribed but in any given month may have to make the decision that 
due to adverse circumstances they can no longer afford the service. 
This is not a hypothetical situation. In fact, the Federal Reserve's 
2022 annual report on Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households notes 
relatively small, unexpected expenses of $400 present a real hardship 
for more than 32 percent of all adults.
    In addition, the premise of the question misses the mark as to the 
mission of ACP. The bipartisan members of both chambers of Congress 
that adopted the structure and rules for ACP and its predecessor the 
EBB did not limit the program to new enrollees. In fact, the design of 
the EBB was both to enhance broadband adoption and to keep those who 
had lost their jobs or otherwise had difficulty affording their 
broadband connection online. The ACP continued that mission by ensuring 
that broadband was an affordable part of a low-income family's budget. 
Moreover, there is nothing in the legislative history of either the EBB 
or the ACP that suggests the sole purpose of the programs were to 
merely increase adoption, though that is certainly an expected outcome.
    As a policy matter, such an approach would be inconsistent with 
helping low income households get and/or stay connected. Just as we do 
not require a low-income family to demonstrate that they lack water or 
electricity before assisting them with paying for those essential 
services, the bipartisan Congress did not require that low-income 
families demonstrate they lacked connectivity to enroll in ACP.
    Moreover, it would be interesting to see how such a gating 
requirement would work in practice. For example, if we assume that the 
ACP limited enrollment to only those that do not currently have 
broadband, then a person that gets connected through ACP would have 
broadband at the moment service is initiated. So, the next month when 
the provider is considering whether a person can continue to receive 
their ACP benefit, would the provider have to cut that household off 
because they now have service? ACP is a month-to-month payment after 
all. And if not, we would need to define some period of time in which 
that person would be able to be enrolled, which presents another set of 
issues. All to say, designing a program to provide monthly discounts to 
only those that do not subscribe (however that is defined) would be 
untenable. There is no viable way for the National Verifier to verify 
non-adopter status. And self-certification likely would lead to 
inefficient and ineffective outcomes. The ability of low-income 
Americans to afford broadband communications each and every month is an 
issue akin to food, water, heat/cooling, healthcare--it is too 
expensive for our society to have members in it who are forced to 
choose to make due without any of these things in a given month.
    As noted above, signing up first time enrollees is one part of the 
mission and people that lack any broadband access are the hardest to 
reach. Fortunately, there are targeted efforts that are just beginning 
that will seek to make more people aware of the availability of the 
ACP. This is being done through the grant program the FCC was directed 
to administer as part of the bipartisan infrastructure act. Those 
efforts will put people on the grounds in local communities throughout 
the country who will seek to help those that lack broadband but want it 
to get connected. We expect those efforts will help increase the number 
of new broadband subscribers in the program.

    b. Are you concerned that the vast majority of tax dollars have 
gone to those who already subscribed to broadband, and have been poorly 
targeted to bringing non-adopters online? Do you believe this is an 
efficient use of taxpayer dollars?
    Answer. I am not concerned that the vast majority of tax dollars 
are being used to ensure low-income families have a steady connection 
to broadband. To me, and as noted above, this means the program is 
achieving its Congressionally-designed mission.
    And I do believe it is an efficient use of taxpayer dollars. After 
all, the economic and educational benefits that flow from connectivity 
are not achieved when a family lacks a steady connection. Additionally, 
we all benefit from greater connectivity across the population. Such 
connectivity, for example, allows state services such as license 
renewal, payment of local and state taxes, enrollment in social 
services, and other government services to move more heavily to the 
online space instead of having to rely on in-person interactions. Being 
able to log onto a county website and pay taxes or parking tickets, for 
example, instead of standing in line for hours produces both 
efficiencies for the county by reducing its workforce demands and the 
individual by reducing the amount of time lost performing the 
transaction. A single emergency room visit that happens because a 
broadband enabled telehealth visit was possible, easily saves more than 
twice as much as a year's worth of monthly ACP discounted service 
support benefits.

    c. GAO has criticized the FCC for its failure to develop specific 
goals and metrics to track ACP's effectiveness and progress over time. 
Do you agree with these concerns?
    Answer. Yes. The GAO's January 2023 recommendations include 
offering better outreach efforts for consumers to be made aware of ACP, 
a better translation process to ensure non-English speaking consumers 
are aware of the program, and the adoption of controls to prevent 
fraud. These will be valuable enhancements to the ACP. But, just as we 
cannot expect the FCC's outreach efforts to reach 100 percent of 
eligible households, we must realistically expect that the FCC will not 
be able to prevent 100 percent of fraud. Fly-by-night companies who 
dupe people for their own advantage exist in every facet of our 
economy, unfortunately. When the FCC finds these companies in the ACP 
program, we support full disgorgement of the gains in addition to the 
imposition of the maximum penalties provided under the applicable laws.

    Question 3. In your testimony, you stated: ``The [FCC] should 
consider expanding Lifeline's eligibility so low-income families that 
are eligible under ACP but not Lifeline can continue to subscribe to 
and receive support for broadband service at the level provided under 
the ACP.'' Eligibility criteria for the ACP are estimated to sweep in 
40 percent of U.S. households, over 70 percent of whom were already 
broadband subscribers prior to the ACP.

    a. Do you believe 40 percent of the country needs the ACP subsidy 
to access broadband?
    Answer. I believe the ACP that was created through bipartisan 
efforts in Congress is well-designed, effective and efficient. I 
believe that there is a point at which American families struggle to 
find in their household budgets the means to put enough healthy food on 
the table, keep the car in working order, keep the children clothed and 
prepared for school, keep the house warm or cool--and stay connected to 
broadband solutions that allow their households a decent chance of 
participating in our society and economy in a net positive way. Our 
goal as a country should be to make certain this essential service, 
like other essential services, is not something they are forced to do 
without. As noted above, over 32 percent of Americans would struggle to 
find $400 to pay for an unexpected expense. When compared to that 
statistic, the eligibility criteria seems very close to hitting the 
bullseye.

    b. Do you believe that a subsidy that sweeps in 40 percent of the 
country, 70 percent of whom already subscribe to broadband, is an 
efficient subsidy?
    Answer. As stated above, I do believe it is an efficient use of 
taxpayer dollars. After all, the economic and educational benefits that 
flow from connectivity are not achieved when a family lacks a steady 
connection. Additionally, we all benefit from greater connectivity 
across the population. Such connectivity, for example, allows state 
services such as license renewal, payment of local and state taxes, 
enrollment in social services, and other government services to move 
more heavily to the online space instead of having to rely on in-person 
interactions. Being able to log onto a county website and pay taxes or 
parking tickets, for example, instead of standing in line for hours 
produces both efficiencies for the county by reducing its workforce 
demands and the individual by reducing the amount of time lost 
performing the transaction.

    Question 4. In your testimony, you stated: ``The FCC should 
consider structural changes to the Lifeline program to ensure that it 
is better serving low-income families, as the ACP is.'' Given the 
duplicative nature of Lifeline, should the program be phased out? Or do 
you believe the FCC should continue to administer both programs?
    Answer. In the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, Congress concluded 
that both programs should continue to exist and gave the FCC the 
responsibility to administer both. Lifeline is an integral part of the 
Universal Service Fund, but it has not kept pace with the needs of low-
income families. What I was suggesting in my testimony is that the FCC 
may want to modify Lifeline to better reflect the ACP in the event that 
the ACP should exhaust its funding and Congress fails to renew funding 
through the appropriations process. As I stated in my testimony, we 
need to ensure the strides made through ACP remain and we do not 
backslide. A modified Lifeline program could serve as a sustainable 
long-term solution for the broadband affordability needs of Americans.

    Question 5. In your written statement, you also said that ``closing 
the digital divide is not a one-and-done effort; it takes ongoing work 
and that work is the work of the USF.'' Angela Seifer, Executive 
Director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, recently testified 
that the digital divide will never end.

    a. Yes or no: Do you agree with Ms. Seifer?
    Answer. Yes. Networks will need to be maintained and upgraded. Low-
income and affordability of broadband will persist. Schoolchildren and 
library patrons will continue to need access and telehealth will 
continue to improve our healthcare outcomes. Those all will need 
ongoing support. So, while the digital divide may never end, we have at 
this moment made substantial investments and put in place structures to 
ensure we are addressing the divide. As I stated in my testimony, 
closing the digital divide is not a one-and-done effort; it takes 
ongoing work and that work is the work of the USF.

     Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to 
                               Greg Guice
    Question 1. In the state of South Dakota alone, the high-cost 
program has enabled broadband services to over 115,000 locations, 
including the most rural and remote areas of the state. As I mentioned 
in my opening statement, the FCC has taken meaningful reforms to update 
the high-cost program to ensure predictable and sufficient support to 
providers. Are there additional reforms Congress or the FCC should take 
as it relates to the high-cost program today?
    Answer. The high cost program as it exists and is administered in 
the USF today will likely need to undergo modifications after the 
funding that is slated to be provided through the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Act, the Treasury's Capital Funds Program, and other 
broadband-focused programs begins to flow into these providers. The 
high cost fund could potentially allow the high-cost program to reduce 
its capital expenditures for new deployments and focus funding instead 
on maintenance and upgrades, and also on hardening of networks so they 
are more resilient during times of disaster and are more reliable. The 
high-cost program should be viewed as the means by which the Commission 
delivers the robust, reliable networks needed in those high cost 
communities across the country. It will remain an ongoing and vital 
component to achieving our universal service objectives.

    Question 2. There are a number of permitting barriers that slow 
down the deployment of broadband networks. What measures should 
Congress take to address these concerns?
    Answer. This question requires a nuanced approach by Congress. 
While permitting can be used by incumbents to slow deployment or 
otherwise contribute to cost and delay, we must recognize that these 
procedures also have important functions. These functions include 
protecting local health and safety, ensuring that all members of the 
community have equal access to broadband services by preventing 
``cherrypicking'' or digital redlining, conserving scarce local 
resources by ensuring that applicants have necessary resources to 
complete the proposed project, protecting historic landmarks and 
environmental resources such as watersheds, and other important issues 
for which state and local governments are held accountable by their 
citizens. As a general matter, Congress should begin with the 
assumption that states and localities as sovereign entities accountable 
to their local citizens are best able to balance the interest in speedy 
deployment against other interests protected by permitting. However, 
because of the national importance of ensuring timely universal 
deployment, and the importance of promoting competition, Congress 
should have guardrails to prevent unreasonable delay or the addition of 
prohibitive costs.
    Congress should therefore employ a flexible approach rather than 
absolute preemption. Congress should also avoid inflexible ``shot 
clocks'' that may impose undue burdens on small communities with 
insufficient resources or which applicants can use to withhold 
necessary documentation to complete review. Instead, Congress should 
consider the following steps. Congress should allow states and 
localities to use Federal broadband grant money for permitting or to 
pay directly for other local expenses (such as safety inspection). 
Congress should provide clear guidance to state and local authorities 
on the boundaries of permissible permitting restrictions similar to the 
guidance Congress provided in Section 332(c)(3) and 332(c)(7). Congress 
should also provide an expedited complaint process to the FCC or 
Federal district court so that providers can seek quick and affordable 
relief in cases where state and local governments impose unreasonable 
delay or excessive costs. Congress should expressly permit states and 
localities to use the permitting process to ensure universal deployment 
and prohibit cherrypicking and digital discrimination.

    Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to 
                               Greg Guice
    Question 1. Following the recent historic funding made available 
for broadband deployment, there are important discussions to be had on 
reforms to USF--including contribution reform, improving transparency, 
and ensuring the programs are efficient and effective--but this is also 
an opportunity to discuss potential reforms to the broader ecosystem of 
federal broadband programs. A GAO report from last year found that 
there are currently at least 133 programs across 15 different agencies 
that could be used for broadband.
    The report highlighted numerous concerns with this fragmented 
approach to federal broadband policy, including varying project 
criteria, challenges with agency coordination, and administrative 
complexities for applicants. The report concluded that ``this patchwork 
of programs could lead to wasteful duplication of funding and effort''.
    This patchwork of Federal broadband programs identified by the GAO 
could be diverting funding and focus away from truly unserved areas 
like in Alaska.
    How should Congress be looking more comprehensively at all of these 
programs across agencies to look for potential redundancies and areas 
for alignment in order to maximize effectiveness for the unserved?
    Answer. This is a very important question because as GAO testified 
regarding the report, ``broadband Internet has become critical for 
daily life as, increasingly, everyday activities occur online, 
including job applications, work, school and homework, health care 
appointments, and shopping. Broadband that is widely accessible, 
affordable, and high quality is also essential for the competitiveness 
of the U.S. economy.'' So we need to get this right.
    The assessment performed by GAO is for the period of 2015-2020, so 
it is worth noting that the guidance in the report pre-dates the 
implementation of programs such as Broadband Equity, Access, and 
Deployment (BEAD), Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), Digital 
Equity Grant program (DEG), the Enhanced Middle Mile Program, the 
Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, the Treasury Capital Projects 
Fund, and others that were part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure law 
passed by Congress in November of 2021, so it is not specific to those 
programs, it is instructive. GAO notes, for example, that inter-agency 
meetings, information sharing, aligning programmatic rules, and 
streamlining to make programs complementary where possible are all 
steps agencies have taken to control for the potential inefficiency 
that could occur. (GAO 23-106818 at 5-6). Congress could help ensure 
agencies are rigorous in these efforts. Additionally, Congress can help 
agencies identify aspects of the various programs where the statutory 
language is creating the conflict and seek to provide alignment where 
possible.
    We believe the funding programs offer an outstanding opportunity 
and funding of support to unserved and underserved areas throughout our 
Nation. We support efforts and oversight by Congress to foster better 
coordination and transparency. As you are aware from meeting with 
residents throughout your state, the digital divide is a muli-faceted 
set of challenges. Just as people can be ``unserved'' because they lack 
access to broadband, people that cannot afford the broadband that 
passes in front of their home or do not know how to use the Internet 
are ``unserved.'' BEAD, the ACP, DEG and other funding mechanisms are 
meant to meet these multiple needs of communities like those in Alaska 
where these challenges are acute and where the potential economic, 
educational and health benefits are critical to ensuring these 
communities can thrive.
