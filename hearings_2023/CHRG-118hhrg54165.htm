                        Friday, November 3, 2023

                          House of Representatives,
                      Committee on Foreign Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.

    The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 11:43 a.m., in 
room 210, House Visitor Center, Hon. Michael McCaul (chairman 
of the committee) presiding.
    Chairman McCaul. The Committee on Foreign Affairs will come 
to order. The purpose of this hearing is to hear from Members 
of Congress on bills that have been referred to this Committee.
    I'll recognize myself for a very brief opening statement. 
During the first session of each Congress, the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee holds a Member Day to provide our colleagues 
an opportunity to present their legislative ideas on matters 
under this Committee's jurisdiction.
    I do not have to tell anybody in this room that the world 
is on fire. We've witnessed Russia's war of aggression, the 
largest land invasion in Europe since World War II, the 
increasing rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific, intensified 
hostilities and aggression from the CCP, as well as a full-
scale war in the Middle East that threatens to destabilize the 
entire region. Not since my father's war have we seen such a 
rise in malign nation States seeking to upend the global 
balance of power.
    This Committee deals with issues of war and peace. 
Diplomacy should always be the first recourse. But, as history 
has taught us, what's past is prologue, and weakness only 
invites aggression.
    This Committee has also held a long tradition of 
bipartisanship. As former Chairman Ingle often stated, when it 
comes to foreign policy, partisanship stops at the water's 
edge.
    I'm honored to work with my good friend, Ranking Member 
Meeks and today Ms. Manning, to advance this bipartisan policy 
agenda that not only protects our national security interests, 
but those of our allies across the globe.
    So, I want to thank all the Members for being here today to 
testify on your respective bills. And, I now recognize the 
Acting Ranking Member. Ms. Manning?
    Ms. Manning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I welcome our 
colleagues to the Foreign Affairs Committee. The House Foreign 
Affairs Committee works to oversee and strengthen America's 
international presence and ensure our Nation's core interests 
and values are represented in our foreign policy.
    The jurisdiction of this Committee is crucial to our 
national security. I know that all of us in this House, whether 
on the Committee or off the Committee, have an interest in 
sustaining America's global leadership.
    Your engagement and perspective informs how we achieve that 
goal. We are grateful to have this opportunity to hear from 
every one of you.
    We are living in a pivotal time. Our security, the security 
of our allies and partners, the strength of global stability, 
hinges on the leadership and the unity of nations that share 
our values and commitments.
    Israel is responding to Hamas's horrific October 7 
terrorist attack. Ukraine continues to bravely fight back 
against Putin's unprovoked invasion.
    In the Indo-Pacific, our allies and partners are resisting 
coercion by the People's Republic of China. In our own 
hemisphere, we are deepening our partnerships to counter rising 
levels of violence and the grip of gangs that terrorize 
communities and weaken the rule of law.
    And, we cannot forget that the climate crisis is an 
existential threat to the entire planet. All are reminders that 
our interests are global and interconnecting.
    America is called to lead every region of the world and 
fight back against terrorists. We can rise. We can best rise to 
that call with broad, bipartisan support for diplomacy and 
assistance whenever and wherever we can advance those 
imperatives.
    We must demonstrate how foreign policymakes a difference in 
our constituent's daily lives and keeps America safe and 
secure. The perspectives each of you bring from the communities 
you represent or from the expertise you've developed in other 
committees of the House, is critically important to our work.
    Again, I thank you for sharing that with us today.
    Chairman McCaul. Thank you, Ranking Member. I want to thank 
the Members for appearing here today. Your full statements will 
be made part of the record.
    And, I'll go to each Member for 5 minutes to give your 
remarks. I first recognize my dear friend from Texas, Austin 
where I live as well, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Doggett, 
for his opening statement.
    Mr. Doggett. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, 
Ranking Member, and colleagues. And, thank you for your 
leadership on so many critical issues that our country and the 
world face right now.
    I want to touch just briefly on two measures that have not 
been introduced, but I believe do fall well within the 
jurisdiction of this Committee. Mr. Wilson is one of the 
bipartisan cosponsors, co-original authors when we introduced 
the legislation. We've continued to work with your staff to try 
to iron out some of the specifics and make them work as 
effectively as possible.
    You, Mr. Chairman, of course, are the author of the REPO 
Act, of which I'm a cosponsor. I believe we need to do all we 
can to push back against Russian aggression and to prepare for 
a day when Ukrainians have an opportunity to engage in 
reconstruction of the immense damage that Russian war crimes 
have caused.
    I have what I believe is a companion piece of legislation. 
There are Russian government assets here in the United States 
and scattered across the EU. There has been discussion in 
recent weeks about how to handle those assets.
    I believe that your proposal would allow the President to 
seize some of the assets, which I fully support. My proposal is 
aimed at the earnings from those assets.
    Secretary Yellen recently visited in Europe with the 
European Allies and seemed to endorse the concept of a, what I 
call a War Crimes tax.
    And, the legislation as I propose it, would have a 100 
percent War Crimes tax on any earnings the Russian government 
has had in the United States since the invasion. And then, 
would give this Committee authority over a fund to help the 
Ukrainians in their rehabilitation efforts.
    So, that quite simply is the approach. I believe that it's 
complementary. And, it would be mandatory that all of those, 
all of that income would flow through this Committee, 
eventually to the Ukrainians.
    The second bill, Mr. Chairman, concerns legislation that I 
was the sponsor of in the last Congress that established the 
ban on the import of Russian oil and gas into this country. 
That is the law today. There's an executive order as well.
    However, there is a possibility that we did not really 
consider at the time, of how the Russians can circumvent that. 
And, they circumvent it by sending oil to third countries, 
having it refined, and then the refined products can come into 
the United States.
    This bill would ban us importing oil or gas from countries 
that are--refined products from refineries that are processing 
Russian oil. It basically prevents the laundering of Russian 
oil through a third country and to ensure that our ban is 
complete.
    And, I would invite the continued input from you and other 
Members of the Committee on both these bills. We're hoping to 
file them next week.
    And, we will continue working with your Committee. I 
recognize that the most important thing is to get the 
Ukrainians all of the military support that they need to 
prevail over Putin.
    But, I think it's important to plan for the future and to 
do all we can to continue to boycott and prevent the Russian 
economy from fueling the Russian war machine.
    And, I thank you very much.
    Chairman McCaul. And, thank you, Mr. Doggett. These are 
both excellent bills. Great ideas. I always think that Russia, 
they should pay for their war crimes, not the American 
taxpayer.
    I think both of our bills were designed and targeted toward 
that. And, when it comes to the--where we're seeing not only 
Russia and we're seeing Iran evade sanctions as well on energy. 
And, I think that second proposal is excellent as well.
    And, I would like to--well, the Committee is going to need 
some time to look at these bills. But, I would like to get them 
on the December markup schedule. That would be the next 
available markup.
    But, these are both excellent ideas.
    Mr. Doggett. Thank you very much. And, we'll appreciate the 
continued advice from you and from your staff.
    Chairman McCaul. Well, thank you so much. And, safe travel 
back to Austin.
    Mr. Doggett. Thank you.
    Chairman McCaul. OK.
    Ms. Manning. Can I just add my thanks to my good friend, 
Representative Doggett, for his very creative ideas. And, I 
look forward to seeing those bills, because we all want to do 
everything we can to support our democratic ally, Ukraine in 
its fight against Putin and his country members.
    Mr. Doggett. Thank you, very much.
    Chairman McCaul. Mr. Wilson?
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Indeed, Congressman 
Doggett, thank you for the bipartisan leadership on these 
issues. And, it just is really outrageous, war criminal Putin 
to go around the legislation that we have to finance their 
activities.
    And, it should be noted that indeed, the invasion of 
February 24, 2022, of Ukraine, the mass murder conducted at 
that time. But, it should also be noted that indeed, on October 
7, the second invasion by a dictator, with the invasion into 
Israel that--by Hamas, it was clearly coordinated with war 
criminal Putin.
    We had Hamas representatives go to Moscow last March, or 
this March. Can you imagine, there were Hamas delegations in 
August to meet in Moscow with top leaders of the Putin regime.
    And then, also just this week, if people cannot connect the 
dots, they need to look and really understand that indeed, a 
delegation of Hamas and simultaneously the Deputy Foreign 
Minister of Iran were there to meet with the Putin regime and 
with the Russian Federation.
    And, in the meantime, the Iranian regime had been providing 
drone capability to the Russian Federation to kill Ukrainian 
citizens. And, this is all being done so clearly and with Hamas 
that's to be real too.
    What we're talking about, the terminology really is 
somewhat disarming when people talk about Hamas, Hezbollah, 
Houthis as Iranian proxies, they're puppets. The correct 
terminology, I would hope, and Congressman Mike Gallagher was 
on television earlier today, identifying that the proxies of 
Iran are really puppets.
    We are dealing with a regime that has every intent, despite 
how people may look at it and it's provocative by them of death 
to Israel and death to America. It just cannot be any clearer.
    And hey, we have to give recognition that they actually 
chant death to Israel, death to America in English for the 
benefit of the American people and around the world.
    I yield back.
    Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields. And, I would like to 
also add to that, that in our briefings yesterday, we were told 
that Hamas actually visited Mr. Putin at the Kremlin.
    And, that he's actively working with not only Iran, but 
Hamas and Hezbollah, who have perpetrated these other war 
crimes in my judgment.
    So, with that, Mr. Doggett, thanks so much. And, I'll see 
you back in Texas.
    Mr. Doggett. For sure. Thank you for your hospitality.
    Chairman McCaul. And, we now recognize the gentlelady from 
Florida, a woman that I came into Congress with almost 20 years 
ago, Ms.--it's hard to believe that, isn't it? Ms. Debbie 
Wasserman-Schultz.
    Ms. Wasserman-Schultz. Mr. Chairman, I think we're getting 
a little long in the tooth here. Maybe we do not want to talk 
about how long that we've served together.
    And, it's really an honor to join you and to see your 
ascendency as one of our classmates and appreciate the work 
that you do every single day. You and the Ranking Member, Mr. 
Meeks.
    I've seen the bipartisan work of this Committee and it's 
really, it's really so hopeful to strengthen the United States' 
position around the world. And, I appreciate the opportunity to 
join you for this Member Day.
    I want to thank you and the Ranking Member and the standing 
in Ranking Member, my dear friend, Ms. Manning, for the 
opportunity to testify today and amplify the voices of my 
Venezuelan-American constituents.
    As Co-Chair of the Venezuelan Democracy Caucus, I urge my 
colleagues to join me in support of the AFFECT Human Rights in 
Venezuela Act and the VOICE Act. Venezuela has suffered a lost 
decade under the dictatorial rule of Nicolas Maduro.
    Nearly eight million Venezuelans have fled their homes, a 
third of the Nation's 2014 population. Countless others have 
been displaced internally by State backed collectivos, illegal 
mining and violent drug cartels.
    Maduro's autocratic regime has systematically destroyed 
traditional and electoral independence, hijacked State 
institutions, and drained the country's wealth for personal 
gain. Once he's succeeded in stealing everything his people 
had, including their boats, he sold access and allegiance to 
the world's leading despots, Russia, China, Iran, Cuba, who now 
provide him valuable resources to prop up his corrupt regime.
    The international fact-finding mission on Venezuela has 
documented Maduro's flagrant violation of human rights, 
torture, political imprisonment, surveillance, extrajudicial 
murder and countless other charges. I'm grateful for 
President's Biden's moral clarity and resolve in his efforts to 
promote a peaceful and democratic transfer of power in 
Venezuela.
    But, considering these unforgivable abuses of power by the 
Maduro regime, we must start to plan for the day after. That 
starts with ensuring the fact-finding mission and other 
international mechanisms put in place have unceasing support 
from the United States.
    I was proud to sponsor the AFFECT Human Rights in Venezuela 
Act for this very purpose alongside three Members of the 
Committee, Joaquin Castro, Maria Salazar, and Mike Waltz. This 
bipartisan bill which this Committee passed unanimously last 
Congress also provides for enhanced cooperation between the 
U.S., global institutions, and NGO's to ensure that 
humanitarian assistance reaches those in need, including 
Venezuelan refugees and migrants.
    The bill opens new pathways for promoting free media, 
protecting human rights, and securing the release of political 
prisoners, including wrongfully detained Americans. I urge the 
Chairman and Ranking Member to report this bill to the House 
floor. I'm confident it will receive bipartisan support.
    Despite the ruthless efforts of the Maduro regime, 
Venezuela's democratic opposition has found new purpose and 
unity with the support of the Biden Administration. In addition 
to securing an agreement that allowed Maduro's sanctioned 
assets to be distributed as humanitarian aid to Venezuelans, 
President Biden has been clear that sanctions on Venezuela's 
captors will only be lifted if the regime allows free 
elections, releases prisoners, and respects human rights.
    The opposition overcame significant obstacles to organize 
an independent Presidential primary election, mobilizing more 
than 2.3 million voters, a landmark accomplishment.
    This resulted in the nomination of Maria Corina Machado, a 
fierce champion for human rights, who has unified and 
galvanized Venezuela's democratic movement. This week I spoke 
with Ms. Machado to congratulate her on this achievement and 
promised that Congress would do everything possible to support 
a free and fair election.
    However, in a clear breach of their agreement with the 
opposition, the Maduro regime has decided that Ms. Machado 
should not be allowed to run. The will of the people be damned 
and the votes cast would be negated.
    Worse yet, following her overwhelming victory of 92 percent 
in the primary, the regime's kangaroo court double-downed on 
her baseless disqualification and suspended the election 
results. The criminalization of this legitimate political 
process reflects a well-established pattern of disdain for 
genuine electoral independence and repression of political 
opponents.
    The most terrifying demand is the regime's order to turn 
over documents identifying Venezuelan voters, considering the 
regime's history of retaliating against dissent through 
intimidation and denial of social services.
    As a representative of a vibrant Venezuelan community, I'm 
horrified by the prospect that my constituents could become 
targets for the simple act of voting. Because of our complete 
and warranted distrust of the Maduro regime, I foresaw this 
outcome when I introduced the VOICE Act with Congresswoman 
Salazar.
    This legislation draws a red line when it comes to Maduro's 
desperate attempts to cling to power. The VOICE Act expresses 
the consensus view that Venezuelans deserve support in their 
efforts to advance democracy.
    It takes direct aim at those who are enabling Maduro's 
tyranny by punishing individuals who are complicit in excluding 
Ms. Machado from the election and delegitimizing the 
opposition.
    Our bill lays out clear conditions for what a resolution of 
the crisis looks like, along with clear actions to achieve 
them. It also prescribes a broader U.S. role in ending this 
crisis, including a new special envoy tasked with preserving 
humanitarian access, managing political negotiations, and 
returning American hostages like Evan Hernandez.
    The situation in Venezuela is dire. But, Venezuelans are 
strong. Two weeks ago, I stood alongside tens of thousands, 
including many of my constituents who lined up to participate 
in the primary.
    From Austin, to Manhattan, to Broward County, Venezuelans 
stood in solidarity, some in joyful tears to cast their 
ballots. They told the dictator, you may have our homes, our 
livelihoods, and our freedoms, but you will not take away our 
voice.
    So, I ask you to join me in support of the VOICE Act, Mr. 
Chairman and the AFFECT Human Rights in Venezuela Act so we can 
put an end to Venezuela's current State of criminality and 
corruption and initiate a new era of prosperity, democracy, and 
hope.
    Thank you for the opportunity. I yield back.
    Chairman McCaul. I thank the gentlelady. This is an 
excellent bill. I, you know, I've been down to the border of 
Colombia and Venezuela to see all the refugees coming out.
    It's very sad, the human suffering imposed by the dictator, 
Maduro, in Venezuela. And, we need to do everything we can to 
help these innocent victims who are--many of whom have fled to 
Colombia and many of whom are on their way up to here.
    And, I would be right, I see you have both Mr. Castro, 
Salazar, and Mike Waltz as cosponsors.
    Ms. Wasserman-Schultz. Right.
    Chairman McCaul. And, I would recommend that our urge Mr. 
Castro, and I would urge yourself, to appeal to Mr. Meeks to 
put it on the next markup.
    Ms. Wasserman-Schultz. Happy to.
    Chairman McCaul. We get to balance the Republican and 
Democrat bills and I think this would be a great Democrat bill 
to put on the markup.
    Ms. Wasserman-Schultz. Thank you very much. I'll do that.
    Chairman McCaul. I'd like to recognize the Ranking Member.
    Ms. Manning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank my 
dear friend, Representative Wasserman-Schultz and 
Representative Castro for staying steadfast in your leadership 
on the AFFECT Human Rights in Venezuela Act.
    As we all know, the Venezuelan people have been confronting 
an historic crisis since 2014 that includes failures in 
governance, economic access, security, and a worsening human 
rights emergency.
    I commend regional leaders that continue to seek ways to 
provide humanitarian assistance for Venezuelans. The 
international community must never lose hope that the 
Venezuelan--in the Venezuelan people and in the notion that 
there can be a democratic resolution to this crisis.
    I remain hopeful that the talks in Barbados between Maduro 
and the opposition and the Administration support for rolling 
back global sanctions in Venezuela are steps that can support 
reaching free and fair elections in 2024 and 2025.
    At the heart of the matter, these restrictions only hurt 
the people of Venezuela, adding pressure and desperation to an 
increasingly difficult situation. I support the AFFECT Bill 
because we aim to keep our focus and priority on the plight of 
the people of Venezuela during these challenging times.
    The independent international fact-finding mission on 
Venezuela, it was initiated by the U.N. Human Rights Council, 
has played a key role in uncovering the truth and keeping the 
international community informed.
    When we supported the renewal of its mandate in 2022, we 
were able to show support for the much needed U.N. mechanisms 
and multilateral cooperation that developed responses to 
challenges we face in the region and around the world.
    And, I thank you again for your testimony. And, I yield 
back.
    Ms. Wasserman-Schultz. Thank you so much.
    Chairman McCaul. Mr. Wilson?
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and thank you, Ranking 
Member. And, Congresswoman Wasserman-Schultz, thank you and 
Congresswoman Salazar for working together, it's bipartisan.
    And, it particularly is important to me in that as I was 
growing up and we would celebrate Pan-American Day at Memminger 
Elementary School in Charleston, South Carolina and every year 
we would have a parade where you could take the flag of the 
country of your choice and I always had the flag of Venezuela 
as we had the parade, because my family had hosted people from 
Venezuela with Creole Petroleum Company to come and visit in 
Charleston, South Carolina with the refining capability we had.
    And then, I'm grateful too, how significant this can be for 
the people of Colombia. My wife and I have been the co-chairs 
to the Partners of the Americas Program with Southwest 
Colombia. We've hosted students from Colombia. Two of my sons 
actually were exchange students to Colegio Bennett in Cali.
    And so, the northern part of South America is just so 
critical. And, it's particularly gruesome that Venezuela was 
one of the wealthiest countries in the world with great 
opportunity for people to succeed. And so, this is particularly 
sad.
    I also want to commend you, I join with you and 
Congresswoman Schneider--Congressman Schneider on Saturday, a 
joint letter urging the funding of the war, which we did not 
choose, the dictators with a gun opposing democracy's rule of 
law, to support the people of Israel, to support the people of 
Ukraine, Taiwan, and the southern border.
    And, it's just so critical that we indeed address all four. 
And, I am really hopeful that we can continue that. And, it's 
become particularly sad that over 110 times I have warned on 
the House floor that the global war on terrorism is not over.
    With the safe haven of Afghanistan, the war is coming to 
America. And, this week, of course, we have seen Presidential 
candidates announce that we could have an attack in our country 
imminent with the open borders that President Biden is 
allowing.
    And then, sadly, the Director of the FBI has said indeed 
that our country is at risk. So, we all need to be working 
together, Republican and Democrat. And, I want to commend you 
on your efforts. Thank you.
    Ms. Wasserman-Schultz. Thank you very much.
    Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields. If the gentleman 
would be, honor us by bringing in one of the photographs of you 
as a child with the Venezuelan flag, I would be happy to enter 
that into the record.
    And, with that----
    Mr. Wilson. I'll have to see if I can try to find it.
    Chairman McCaul. OK. With that, Ms. Wasserman-Schultz, 
thank you so much.
    Ms. Wasserman-Schultz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chairman McCaul. All right. I now recognize the gentleman 
from Hawaii, Mr. Case, for his opening statement.
    Mr. Case. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Ranking Member, colleagues. 
We of course, face so many critical issues around the world 
today.
    But, today I'd like to focus with you on the enduring 
significance of the Indo-Pacific and particularly the Pacific 
Islands region of the Indo-Pacific. A region where if we do not 
get it right, there will be very severe consequences down the 
road. Even more severe than what we face today.
    This region is not only, of course, the roots of much of 
our country, including my own Hawaii. But, we have been a 
Pacific power now for over two centuries. People tend to forget 
that.
    Countless service members, of course, lost their lives in 
World War II, defending freedom and security and the post-war 
order, which has been beneficial to the Indo-Pacific. And, our 
country itself administered in the post-war period the trust 
territory of the Pacific Islands, which included the three 
freely associated States of Palau, the Federated States of 
Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands.
    But, unfortunately our engagement waned over time and 
suffered from decades of insufficient attention, a situation 
that the pacing challenge of China Pacific power, Russia, and 
others have been only too willing to exploit.
    In 2019 I co-founded the bipartisan Pacific Islands Caucus 
with many members of this Committee and others to lend specific 
focus in Congress to the Pacific Islands. We have worked to 
include the Pacific Islands in our overall approach to the 
Indo-Pacific across all efforts.
    And, we have produced legislation such as our Blue Pacific 
Act to integrate the region in our overall strategy for Indo-
Pacific engagement. Through these and other efforts, we have 
made promising strides toward bolstering our presence in the 
region and reestablishing our relationships with our island 
nations.
    This Administration, following constructive initiatives by 
its predecessor, has now hosted two U.S./Pacific Islands 
Foreign Summits in Washington, DC. And, begun efforts to open 
embassies in Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, and Kiribati in 
addition to diplomatic presence elsewhere.
    However, we have a limited window of time in which to make 
a new impression and again, prove ourselves to be steadfast 
partners. To this end, I'd like to focus on three particular 
areas.
    No. 1, renewing the compacts of free association. No. 2, 
bolstering our diplomatic presence in the region. And No. 3, 
passing measures such as the Blue Pacific Act.
    First, on the compacts of free association, which are our 
treaties, our agreements with the compact countries of Palau, 
Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands. These 
have been referred to as the bedrock of our role in the Pacific 
by the 2020 Indo-Pacific Strategy.
    The State Department and the Department of the Interior 
under the able direction of Special Envoy Joseph Yun, worked 
tirelessly to negotiate these agreements to extend the compacts 
for another 20 years.
    The Administration has submitted those agreements in 
Congress. And, it is essential that we act swiftly to pass them 
into law.
    Chair, you and other Members of your Committee, as well as 
the Committee on Natural Resources last night, introduced the 
renewal, which we really appreciate. We need to move on these 
immediately. A delay in passage of these new compacts will be 
seen as a failure to deliver for our closest partners in the 
Pacific and will undermine our efforts to prove that we are, in 
fact, a steadfast partner.
    No. 2, we must also ensure that our new diplomatic posts 
and other presence and outreach in the Pacific Islands are 
adequately resourced. The efforts to open new embassies are 
welcomed steps in a region where just showing up is central to 
building trust.
    While it is, of course, up to the Senate to ensure that 
Ambassadors to these new posts are confirmed in a timely 
manner, this Committee has an important role to play in 
overseeing the State Department and ensuring that the embassies 
are, in fact, established posthaste. And, are fully functioning 
consular service wise and otherwise.
    Finally, we must pass legislation like the Blue Pacific Act 
which would establish a whole of government strategy for 
engagement in the region. Our bill outlines areas of 
cooperation between our governments and the Pacific Island 
nations, allying our activities with the Pacific Island forums 
own 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent.
    It also codifies our Pacific partnership strategy and 
requires that it be updated every 4 years, assuring Pacific 
Island nations that we do offer a long term partnership. By 
passing the Blue Pacific Act, we can demonstrate that our 
commitment to the region is long term and sustainable.
    We have made great progress in the Pacific Islands along 
with the Indo-Pacific in recent years. However, now is the time 
that we must follow through on our commitments and ensure that 
our legislative efforts reflect the importance of our ties, not 
only just to the broader Indo-Pacific, but to the Pacific 
Islands themselves.
    I look forward to working with you on all of these efforts 
and thank you for your time and effort.
    Chairman McCaul. Thank you, Congressman Case. And, I agree 
with you. When I talked to the Asian Pacific Islands and the 
Asian Islands, it seems like after World War II, we almost 
forgot about them.
    And, I think China has become very aggressive in the South 
China Sea and certainly with Taiwan. And, we need to renew our 
commitment to those islands. It's in our national security best 
interest and in theirs as well.
    And, we just hosted, all of the Ambassadors came in, and I 
believe you were there as well, to host a reception with them 
to renew our support and our commitment to them. And, if you 
will allow my staff to have some time to look at the details of 
your legislation, we would be happy to consider that for markup 
as well.
    And, Ms. Manning?
    Ms. Manning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative Case, 
I want to thank you for your testimony today as well as your 
leadership on the Pacific Island issues.
    The Pacific Island Caucus, which you co-lead with Delegate 
Radewagen, a Member of this Committee, my good friends, 
Chairwoman Kim and Ranking Member Bera of the Indo-Pacific 
Subcommittee, as well as Representative Wagner and 
Representative Sherman, has played a critical role in restoring 
the Pacific Islands to their deserved place at the forefront of 
our discussions about foreign policy here in the House.
    I share your views about the importance of the Pacific 
Islands. Under President Biden's leadership, the United States 
has held multiple summits with the Pacific Islands, released 
the landmark Pacific Partnership Strategy, and as you 
mentioned, we are enlarging our diplomatic footprint in the 
region.
    It's important that we in Congress follow through with the 
support needed to realize that ambitious strategy. Some of the 
specific initiatives you mentioned are excellent ways to do 
that.
    I agree, COFA is critical. Yesterday, legislation was filed 
in the House and the Senate to implement the COFA agreements 
that were negotiated with the Federated States of Micronesia, 
Palau, and the Republic of Marshall Islands.
    Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks are both original 
co-sponsors and were deeply involved in the bipartisan, 
bicameral talks which produced the legislation. Their staffs 
have been in close touch throughout that process and we were 
all very glad that we were able to retain your bill with Mr. 
Womack, the Compact Impact Fairness Act in the introduced 
product.
    And, Mr. Case, Ranking Member Meeks was proud to include 
much of your Blue Pacific Act in his bill, the Eagle Act, last 
Congress to anchor the U.S. presence and leadership in the 
Pacific Islands.
    When Mr. Meeks visited Palau and Papua New Guinea last 
year, it became clear to him that we need to up our development 
investment, diplomatic engagement, and strategic presence in 
the Pacific Islands, to remain the partner of choice there in 
the face of the PRC's expansive campaign for influence.
    A significant part of your bill passed the House last 
Congress. And, we are all looking forward to working with you 
to move the bill this Congress.
    We look forward to our continued work together. We are very 
grateful for your testimony today. And, I yield back.
    Chairman McCaul. Thank you. Mr. Wilson, do you have any 
comments?
    Mr. Wilson. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And indeed, 
Congressman Case, thank you. And again, an example of 
bipartisanship.
    You cannot do any better than being with Congresswoman 
Amata Radewagen and Congressman of the American Samoa and 
Congressman Jim Moylan of beautiful Guam. And so, we look--I 
look forward to working with you in any way.
    But, I also want to let you know too, it was so impressive 
to me, in a sad way, on October 7, I was in Copenhagen, Denmark 
and the only television station that I could get in English was 
France24. And, as they were reporting the massacre in Israel, 
it was startling to me that it was Israel's Pearl Harbor is 
what they began with.
    And then, it was amazing too, the next day the Prime 
Minister of Denmark spoke to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly 
that I was attending, and he began his speech by pointing out 
that what occurred in Israel was Israel's Pearl Harbor and 9/
11.
    But, it was just so impressive to me that people around the 
world recognize how significant December 7, 1941, and how it 
must not be repeated. And, the way to do that, was we have 
dictators invading democracies, is truly through peace through 
strength.
    And so, with the Ronald Reagan provisions, we need to be 
again, working together to stop the invasion of Ukraine, stop 
the invasion of Israel, and deter an invasion of Taiwan.
    With this, I yield back.
    Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields. And, if I could 
followupon that. I've visited both of your, the Territory of 
Guam and Hawaii, beautiful, beautiful islands. And, it is 
historic. Just going to the U.S.S. Arizona to see, it's like a 
graveyard, a memorial site.
    And then, to see the U.S.S. Missouri, to see where World 
War II started and then where it ended, very historic. And then 
I got to do refueling in Guam with our base there, our B-52s, 
and just both, I'm envious.
    I live in a pretty nice town, Austin. But, you guys live in 
paradise. So, Mr. Case?
    Mr. Case. Thank you, Mr. Chair. We do, but we have to fly a 
long way there and back. So, you've got us on that.
    I thank you for your comments, all of your comments. I 
would be remiss if I did not thank you directly for including 
the Compact Impact Fairness Act that the Ranking Member 
mentioned in the Compact legislation.
    That's really, really critical to those jurisdictions in 
this country who bear the brunt of the compact residents in 
their communities without to date, Federal assistance for those 
communities.
    We essentially are hosting the residents as part of our 
country's international engagement, as part of our country's 
foreign policy, including what you noted, as security concerns. 
And, it is fair that the Federal Government undertake those 
undertakings.
    And, this bill would do that. It's a critical part of the 
compact. And so, I thank you for including that and for your 
efforts to hold it in throughout.
    Chairman McCaul. Thank you. And, that compact is just 
critically important right now, especially right now in this 
important time in history as we look at a more aggressive 
China.
    So, thank you so much, Mr. Case. We'll take a look at the 
bill and report back. And now, I recognize the gentleman from 
Guam, Mr. Moylan for his opening statement.
    Mr. Moylan. Thank you, Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member 
Manning, and Members of the Committee. I thank you for allowing 
me to testify before you today to speak about the importance of 
our maintaining close relations between the United States and 
the Philippines.
    As the Representative of the Island of Guam, I understand 
just how crucial it is for us to ensure our regional allies are 
confident that the United States will not abandon them or leave 
them to deal with the PRC alone.
    Guam relies heavily on international trade and diplomacy to 
succeed. With 90 percent of our feed on the island being 
imported within a three thousand mile radius from Guam, there 
are no States but plenty of poor nations whose bilateral 
relations are of critical importance to our Pacific strategy.
    I have come today to testify on House Resolution 837, 
reaffirming the ties between the United States and the 
Philippines. I introduced this Resolution yesterday with my 
colleague and fellow co-chair of the U.S. Philippine Friendship 
Caucus, Congressman Bobby Scott.
    The Chinese Communist Party has for decades attempted to 
bend countries bordering the South China Sea to their will by 
enforcing first their nine dash line, and now, most recently 
have unveiled their new ten dash line of lands that they claim 
as their own.
    This new map boldly claims multiple provinces in India. 
And, the islands are as far as one thousand miles away from 
China's mainland. All of us in the region have had enough with 
the CCP.
    And, as self-proclaimed protector of freedom, democracy, 
and liberty across the world, the United States must live up to 
our billing and play a role in helping our allies combat 
China's gray zone warfare. We must aid our allies in the 
Philippines in defending their sovereign territory and for that 
reason, this Resolution calls in the U.S. and the Philippines 
to begin joint patrols in the South China Sea.
    The Philippine Coast Guard and Navy have been victims of 
Chinese bullying. That ends now. This Resolution shows the 
world that the United States stands firmly with the Philippines 
and makes clear that we plan to adhere to our commitments to 
the Philippine people and to foster a free and open Indo-
Pacific for all.
    Let me be clear, aggression against the Philippines is 
aggression against the United States of America. I encourage my 
colleagues to support this Resolution and work for its swift 
adoption.
    While my Resolution does not call specifically for 
supporting the Philippines and the resupply efforts at the 
Second Thomas Shoal, I believe it is imperative that our Navy 
assets in the region assist their Philippine counterparts in 
escorting future supply runs in the Sierra Madre.
    This will project a clear message to anyone who would 
challenge the laws of the sea, the United States will not 
tolerate those who impede on freedom of navigation or abide by 
rogue nations claiming land that does not belong to them.
    I would like to thank the Committee again for allowing me 
to come here today and speak about my work on this issue. I 
hope to have the chance to work further with you all to combat 
Chinese aggression throughout the Indo-Pacific.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman and I yield back.
    Chairman McCaul. And, I thank you, Representative Moylan. 
And, I just recently, the B-52s, one of them from Guam, a 
Chinese fighter jet came within ten feet in a very aggressive 
posture.
    And, I know also, when it comes to the Philippines that a 
Chinese Coast Guard vessel rammed into a Philippine boat and 
almost sank it. And again, a very aggressive posture.
    I really like the idea of this bill. We need to reaffirm 
our ties with the Philippines. They have been generous to allow 
us to utilize the Philippines for purposes of force protection.
    And, I'd like to see maybe a basing opportunity as well in 
the future there. And, I think this would be a great step 
forward in achieving that.
    I know this was introduced November 1. So, we could 
consider this as December, in our December markup bill.
    And last, when I was in Taiwan, we were greeted by ten 
battleships and an aircraft carrier and seven fighter jets to 
show you how aggressive Communist China has become. And then, I 
personally was sanctioned the day I departed Taiwan.
    And so, I've been to your part of the world and I totally 
understand where you're coming from. And, I'd really be--I'd 
very much like to look at marking this up in December. And, 
thank you for bringing this to our attention.
    Ms. Manning?
    Ms. Manning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Representative 
Moylan, thank you so much for your testimony today and for 
raising issues that are so important to Guam, the people you 
represent, and to our national security as we see increasingly 
aggressive behavior from the CCP.
    Thank you again. And, I yield back.
    Chairman McCaul. Mr. Wilson?
    Mr. Wilson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, indeed it's such 
an honor to have Congressman Jim Moylan here. He's serving in 
the tradition of Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo.
    And so that, well, I cannot give a higher compliment. And, 
I also want our colleagues to know how much we appreciate where 
America's day begins, and that's Guam, U.S.A.
    We're also so grateful too, that if we look at the people 
of Guam having the highest percentage of participation in the 
military of any State or territory. And so, the patriotism of 
the people of Guam is to be always appreciated.
    And then, I was hoping that Congressman Case would stick 
around, because I wanted to point out that the beautiful hotels 
of paradise that the Chairman has identified, somehow Hawaii 
has copied Guam. And so, the beautiful hotels and beaches of 
Guam clearly have been copied by the people of Hawaii.
    And then, I want to point out too, how important that 
Anderson Air Force Base is for the security of the people of 
the Pacific, working with our new ally, Vietnam. But then, 
again, thank you for your recognition of the Philippines and to 
see a restoration of the warmest relationships that we've had 
for 125 years with the people of the Philippines.
    I know of it very personally, because in the midlands of 
South Carolina, an extraordinary Filipino-American community is 
there, who are so valued and so important as we all try to work 
for peace through strength.
    And, with that, I yield back.
    Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields back. Let me just 
also conclude by saying that despite one Member of Congress' 
testimony, there is no threat that the Island of Guam will tip 
over.
    So, do you have any further words, sir?
    Mr. Moylan. I do appreciate the opportunity once again. 
And, I look forward to continually working with this Committee.
    And, I please welcome you all to the beautiful Island of 
Guam. Thank you so much.
    Chairman McCaul. Thank you, sir. Thanks for being here 
today. And, I think that that concludes our testimony. I want 
to thank all of the Members for their valuable testimony.
    Pursuant to the Committee rules, all Members may have 5 
days to submit questions and any extraneous materials for the 
record. Without objection, the Committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:28 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
