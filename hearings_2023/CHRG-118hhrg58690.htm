    SUMMARY OF SUBJECT MATTER

    TO:      LMembers, Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
    FROM:  LStaff, Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
    RE:      LSubcommittee Hearing on ``Examining the 
Department of Transportation's Regulatory and Administrative 
Agenda''
_______________________________________________________________________


                               I. PURPOSE

    The Subcommittee on Highways and Transit of the Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure will meet on Wednesday, 
July 24, 2024, at 9:30 a.m. ET in 2167 of the Rayburn House 
Office Building to receive testimony at a hearing entitled, 
``Examining the Department of Transportation's Regulatory and 
Administrative Agenda.'' The hearing will provide Members the 
opportunity to hear from stakeholders on select regulatory and 
administrative actions taken by Modal Administrations under the 
Subcommittee's jurisdiction. At the hearing, Members will 
receive testimony from the American Road & Transportation 
Builders Association (ARTBA), the Steel Manufacturers 
Association (SMA), the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers 
Association (OOIDA), and Transportation for America (T4A).

                             II. BACKGROUND

    In 1946, Congress passed the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA) (P.L. 79-404), which defines a rule as ``the whole or 
part of an agency statement of general or particular 
applicability and future effect designated to implement, 
interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the 
organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency 
. . . .'' \1\ The APA laid out general terms and processes for 
Federal agency rulemakings.\2\ Generally, Congress passes 
legislation to provide statutory authority to direct Federal 
agencies to issue rulemakings.\3\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Agencies may issue different types of rules. ``Legislative 
Rules'' seek to carry out statutes as passed by Congress.\4\ 
``Non-legislative Rules'' may include ``interpretive rules and 
general statements of policy.'' \5\ For the last several 
decades, following the United States Supreme Court's decision 
in Chevron U.S.A, Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 
Inc., Federal agencies generally received deference to 
interpret laws passed by Congress and to issue regulations.\6\ 
In June 2024, the United States Supreme Court overruled the 
Chevron decision, in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo.\7\

    The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) announced the release 
of the Biden Administration's Spring 2024 Unified Agenda of 
Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions on July 5, 2024.\8\ 
Published twice a year, the agenda details near- and long-term 
rulemaking efforts being pursued across all Federal agencies, 
including at the Department of Transportation (DOT).\9\ While 
there are 222 total actions listed under DOT, within the 
Subcommittee's jurisdiction, the agenda includes, but is not 
limited to, 73 actions: 11 proposed rulemakings, and three 
final rules for the Office of the Secretary (OST); 16 proposed 
rulemakings and five final rules for the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA); two pre-rules, 16 proposed rulemakings, 
and six final rules for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration (FMCSA); six proposed rules and three final 
rules for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA); and three 
proposed rules and two final rules for the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).\10\ Following 
publication of the Unified Agenda, DOT typically publishes a 
Significant Rulemaking Report, which provides additional 
information regarding pending rulemakings.\11\ The most recent 
report was published in February 2024.\12\

    OIRA also maintains a dashboard of current regulatory 
actions under review by OMB.\13\ The dashboard provides a 
summary of information regarding proposed regulatory actions. 
The dashboard currently lists 139 total pending actions. DOT 
has seven proposed actions pending review by OMB, three of 
which are within the Subcommittee's jurisdiction: FHWA's 
Statewide and Nonmetropolitan Transportation Planning proposed 
rule; FHWA's Notice of Request for Information (RFI) on Medium 
and Heavy-Duty Electric Charging Technologies and 
Infrastructure Needs; and FMCSA's Motor Carrier Operation of

   III. ANALYSIS OF SELECT ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL 
                         HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION

GREENHOUSE GAS PERFORMANCE MEASURE

    On December 7, 2023, FHWA published a final rule to require 
states and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to 
establish a new performance measure with declining targets for 
carbon dioxide and to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions associated with transportation on the National 
Highway System.\15\ Congress included provisions to address 
climate change and transportation resiliency in the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (P.L. 117-
58).\16\ Although a rule requiring a new highway-related GHG 
performance measure was included in the House-passed H.R. 3684, 
the INVEST in America Act, it was considered and disposed of 
during IIJA negotiations.\17\ The Administration cites section 
150 of title 23 U.S.C. as the authority for its rulemaking.\18\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Several states have challenged FHWA's final rule on the 
basis that it exceeds the Administration's statutory authority. 
In December 2023, Texas filed a lawsuit challenging the rule, 
and separately, Kentucky led a group of 21 states in filing a 
lawsuit.\19\ Conversely, 15 states have written a letter to DOT 
in support of the measure.\20\ On March 27, 2024, the Northern 
District of Texas vacated FHWA's final rule, finding it 
unauthorized.\21\ In a different case challenging the rule, the 
United States District Court for the Western District of 
Kentucky issued an opinion on April 1, 2024, finding the rule 
exceeded FHWA's statutory authority and is arbitrary and 
capricious.\22\ The Biden Administration has filed notices of 
appeal in both cases.\23\

WORK ZONES

    On September 20, 2023, FHWA published a Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking (NPRM) and request for comments to update 
regulations pertaining to highway and street work zones.\24\ 
The NPRM seeks to make changes to many provisions addressed in 
a 2004 FHWA final rule intended to bolster work zone 
safety.\25\ Specifically, the NPRM proposes requiring states to 
``identify the safety and mobility performance measures that 
will be used to monitor and manage performance,'' as part of 
their work zone safety and mobility policy.\26\ It would also 
formally require states to ``develop and implement systematic 
procedures to assess work zone impacts in project development, 
and to manage safety and mobility during project 
implementation.'' \27\

    In January 1983, following enactment of the Surface 
Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) of 1982 (P.L. 97-424), 
FHWA issued a temporary public interest waiver of Buy America 
requirements for ``manufactured products.'' \28\ FHWA issued a 
Final Rule retaining this waiver for ``all manufactured 
products other than steel and cement manufactured products'' 
\29\ which went into effect on December 27, 1983. While Buy 
America requirements for FHWA Federal-aid highway programs have 
been amended through legislation and litigation--for instance, 
removing Buy America requirements for cement in 1984 and adding 
iron materials and manufactured products to Buy America 
preference requirements in 1991--the waiver for manufactured 
products has remained.\30\

BUY CLEAN INITIATIVE

    On December 8, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 
14057 to create a Buy Clean Task Force to prioritize low-carbon 
construction material in Federal procurement and Federally-
funded projects.\38\ The Task Force is co-chaired by the 
Federal Chief Sustainability Officer and the White House Office 
of Domestic Climate Policy, and has representatives from the 
Departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, 
Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, 
Interior, State and Transportation; the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA); the General Services Administration 
(GSA); the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; the 
Veterans Administration; the White House Domestic Climate 
Policy Office, Council on Environmental Quality, Infrastructure 
Implementation Team, Office on Clean Energy Innovation and 
Implementation, and Office of Management and Budget.\39\ 
Collectively, the agencies account for 90 percent of all 
Federally-funded and purchased construction materials.\40\

    The Task Force is charged with considering how the Federal 
Government can promote low-embodied carbon emissions in 
construction materials. Actions include identifying 
construction materials (steel, cement and concrete, asphalt, 
and flat glass) with the highest embodied carbon, increasing 
the use of Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), and 
establishing pilot programs for clean construction 
materials.\41\ On March 8, 2023, the Biden Administration 
launched the Federal-State Buy Clean Partnership.\42\ The 
partnership includes 12 states who work collaboratively with 
the task force to prioritize low-carbon construction materials 
in state-funded projects.\43\

  IV. ANALYSIS OF SELECT REGULATIONS UNDER THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER 
                         SAFETY ADMINISTRATION

    The FMCSA establishes the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Regulations (FMCSR), which set minimum safety standards for 
motor carriers and drivers.\53\ The Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) is the official publication containing the codification 
of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal 
Register.\54\ For FMCSA, under the CFRs, any interested person 
may petition the FMCSA Administrator to establish, amend, 
interpret, clarify, or withdraw a rule.\55\

SPEED LIMITERS

    On May 29, 2013, FMCSA initiated a rulemaking to require 
the installation of speed-limiters on commercial motor vehicles 
(CMVs) with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) greater than 
26,000 pounds.\56\ On September 9, 2016, a NPRM was jointly 
published between FMCSA and NHTSA to equip CMVs over 26,000 
pounds with a speed limiter, which, when combined with an 
electronic stability control system on an engine, can govern 
the maximum speed of a vehicle.\57\ The proposal considered 
setting the maximum speed at 60, 65, and 68 miles per hour.\58\

AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKES (AEBS)

    IIJA requires the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe 
a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) and performance 
requirements for Automatic Emergency Brakes on CMVs heavier 
than 26,000 pounds; to study equipping other CMVs with AEB 
systems, and, if warranted, to develop performance standards;

    OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ERIC A. ``RICK'' CRAWFORD OF 
    ARKANSAS, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HIGHWAYS AND TRANSIT

    Mr. Crawford. We are here today to examine the Department 
of Transportation's regulatory and administrative agenda with 
respect to the modal administrations under this subcommittee's 
jurisdiction.
    Since President Biden took office, we have heard frequently 
from stakeholders spanning all regions and industries about the 
burden of this administration's onerous regulatory agenda. An 
analysis by the National Association of Manufacturers found 
that across the board, Federal regulations cost the United 
States economy more than $3 trillion. Yet, the administration 
continues to march forward with crushing regulations, including 
those that exceed its statutory authority.
    The Federal Highway Administration continues to pursue its 
final rule to force a greenhouse gas performance measure on 
State departments of transportation and metropolitan planning 
organizations, despite lacking the statutory authority to do 
so. As I have said many times in this subcommittee, this policy 
was considered and disposed of during negotiations of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
    Two federal courts issued opinions earlier this year 
finding the rule exceeds the administration's statutory 
authority. The United States District Court for the Northern 
District of Texas went so far as to vacate the rule. Concerns 
have been repeatedly raised in this subcommittee about the 
administration's unauthorized actions, including concerns that 
this rule would put the thumb on the scale and potentially 
influence project selection.
    This rule would be particularly disastrous for rural areas 
whose communities can't build a subway or bike lanes to cut 
emissions. Yet, the administration is squandering valuable 
resources to appeal both rulings.
    Unfortunately, this isn't the only example we have seen of 
the Department using executive action to advance the 
progressive agenda it wishes had been included in IIJA. For 
example, in December 2021, the Federal Highway Administration 
released a policy memo, which, among other things, sought to 
encourage States to prioritize nonmotorized modes and transit, 
as well as update existing infrastructure over developing new 
capacity projects. Many called on Federal Highways to rescind 
that memo, specifically citing confusion as the memo ran 
counter to IIJA, as well as concerns with the administration's 
process and lack of public notice or comment period.
    Thankfully, after several members of this committee raised 
our significant concerns, Federal Highways did the right thing 
and superseded its own memo. Going forward, we must retain the 
ability of individual States to prioritize projects and address 
their wide-ranging and unique needs.
    Similarly troubling, we have heard concerns from businesses 
that they are being hamstrung by ambiguity and lack of clarity 
surrounding regulations.
    The so-called Inflation Reduction Act provided $4.5 billion 
for the Biden administration's Buy Clean initiative to allow 
the General Services Administration and Federal Highways to 
pilot low-embodied carbon programs. There has been confusion 
about the material requirement differences between GSA and 
Federal Highways, as well as a lack of transparency for the 
Environmental Product Declaration--or EPD--collection. I remain 
concerned that the Biden administration is pushing the market 
without considering the actual life cycle of the materials in 
construction projects.
    Likewise, rules and regulations continue to be considered 
that mandate certain technologies that may not be ready for 
mass adoption, particularly as it relates to the trucking 
sector. This can stifle the safe and efficient movement of 
freight, have safety implications on other roadway users, and 
may needlessly increase costs for consumers.
    I appreciate our witnesses being here to discuss their 
thoughts on the administration's regulatory agenda and look 
forward to hearing their perspective.

    Mr. Crawford. I now recognize Ranking Member Holmes Norton 
for 5 minutes for an opening statement.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON OF THE DISTRICT 
   OF COLUMBIA, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HIGHWAYS AND 
                            TRANSIT

    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank 
subcommittee Chair Rick Crawford for holding this hearing on 
transportation regulations.
    The Department of Transportation is a crucial partner to 
Congress in implementing the laws we write. The technical 
expertise within the Department educates and informs Congress 
in writing laws and fills in gaps through rules and guidance. 
The Department and its agencies are tasked with issuing rules 
to fight climate change, improve safety and air quality, 
provide transparency and reduce fraud in federally funded 
projects, and standardize the design of roads and bridges to 
ensure their structural integrity.
    In short, the Department's regulatory role is to ensure the 
safe and efficient movement of people and goods across our 
transportation systems.
    This is no small task. Roughly every 5 years, Congress 
gives the Department's agencies dozens of new rulemakings to 
develop and directs them to update or modify existing ones. 
Additionally, the agencies regularly accept petitions to 
develop rules from the public.
    This process is key to our democracy. It provides avenues 
for every citizen, lawmaker, and stakeholder to provide input 
into the rulemaking process.
    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act tasks the 
Department with several rulemakings of interest. I would like 
to speak today about those that will improve safety for all 
users of our roadways.
    The law required the Federal Highway Administration to 
update the standards for street design, which is particularly 
important as cities work to reduce pedestrian and bicyclist 
fatalities. The agency has also issued guidance to States on 
how to incorporate vulnerable road user safety assessments into 
their safety programs.
    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is 
required by the infrastructure law to develop regulations to 
ensure cars are equipped with impaired driving prevention 
technology to avoid fatalities from drunk driving.
    The infrastructure law also directed the Department to 
finalize several rules designed to improve safety in the 
trucking industry. Fatalities involving large truck crashes 
have risen 76 percent in the last 15 years. Since 2010, the 
number of trucks involved in fatal crashes on roads with speed 
limits of 75 miles per hour or more saw a 440-percent increase.
    The Department has already issued a final rule requiring 
truck trailers to have rear impact guards to provide protection 
to passenger vehicle occupants.
    The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is still 
working to finalize a rule to require automatic emergency 
brakes on heavy-duty vehicles. The administration's proposed 
rule regarding these brakes is projected to prevent nearly 
25,000 crashes and save 155 lives each year. I urge the 
administration to move forward to finish this rulemaking.
    Finally, I want to note the importance of Congress and the 
administration in hearing from multiple points of view when it 
comes to improving safety. Every road user cares about safety.
    Traveling by car, truck, bike, or foot remains one of the 
riskiest things we can do on a day-to-day basis. It is 
imperative that we address safety issues from all perspectives 
and listen to those impacted. No one person or stakeholder has 
all the answers, but I believe collectively we can take a 
stronger approach to reducing injuries and fatalities.
    I look forward to working with my colleagues on improving 
the safety of our transportation system, and I thank the 
witnesses for their testimony today.

regularly accept petitions to develop rules from the public.
    This process is key to our democracy. It provides avenues for every 
citizen, lawmaker and stakeholder to provide input into the rulemaking 
process.
    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act tasked the Department 
with several rulemakings of interest. I would like to speak today about 
those that will improve safety for all users of our roadways.
    The law required the Federal Highway Administration to update the 
standards for street design, which is particularly important as cities 
work to reduce pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities. The agency has also 
issued guidance to states on how to incorporate vulnerable road user 
safety assessments into their safety programs.
    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is required by 
the infrastructure law to develop regulations to ensure cars are 
equipped with impaired driving prevention technology to avoid 
fatalities from drunk driving.
    The infrastructure law also directed the Department to finalize 
several rules designed to improve safety in the trucking industry. 
Fatalities involving large truck crashes have risen 76 percent in the 
last 15 years. Since 2010, the number of trucks involved in fatal 
crashes on roads with speed limits of 75 miles per hour or more saw a 
440 percent increase.
    The Department has already issued a final rule requiring truck 
trailers to have rear impact guards to provide protection to passenger 
vehicle occupants.
    The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is still working to 
finalize a rule to require automatic emergency brakes on heavy duty 
vehicles. The Administration's proposed rule regarding these brakes is 
projected to prevent nearly twenty-five thousand crashes and save one 
hundred fifty-five lives each year. I urge the Administration to move 
forward to finish this rulemaking.
    Finally, I want to note the importance of Congress and the 
Administration in hearing from multiple points of view when it comes to 
improving safety. Every road user cares about safety.
    Traveling by car, truck, bike or foot remains one of the riskiest 
things we do on a day-to-day basis. It is imperative that we address 
safety issues from all perspectives and listen to those impacted. No 
one person or stakeholder has all the answers, but I believe 
collectively we can take a stronger approach to reducing injuries and 
fatalities.
    I look forward to working with my colleagues on improving the 
safety of our transportation system and thank the witnesses for their 
testimony.

    Mr. Crawford. I now recognize ranking member of the full 
committee, Mr. Larsen, for 5 minutes.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICK LARSEN OF WASHINGTON, RANKING 
     MEMBER, COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Chair Crawford and 
Ranking Member Norton, for holding this hearing today on the 
Department of Transportation's regulatory agenda.
    Members of Congress are motivated to serve on this 
committee for lots of reasons. Whether your interest in 
transportation includes reducing traffic fatalities, helping 
U.S. businesses compete in the global economy, combating 
pollution, creating jobs, or making transportation work for 
more communities, regulations do play a role in meeting these 
goals.
    While Congress writes the laws, Federal agencies turn these 
legislative proposals into the rules of the road that are to be 
followed and enforced.
    Federal agencies have professionals--engineers, planners, 
and economists--who bring their expertise to bear to make our 
transportation systems work seamlessly.
    This DOT, under the leadership of Secretary Buttigieg, is 
implementing policies to make our transportation systems 
cleaner, greener, safer, and more accessible. As the 
administration continues to implement the BIL, this committee 
will continue our oversight to ensure the regulations are 
consistent with the law and with congressional intent.
    We continue to have a roadway safety crisis, with a total 
of 42,795 people killed in traffic crashes on U.S. roadways in 
2022. Nearly 6,000 of those people were killed in crashes 
involving large trucks, including 85 people in Washington 
State.
    The BIL took steps towards ending these preventable 
fatalities, including by requiring rear underride guards and 
automatic emergency brakes for commercial motor vehicles.
    Today, we will hear testimony from the Owner-Operator 
Independent Drivers Association, whose members are frontline 
workers with a vested interest in safety, and it is critical we 
listen to the voices of those directly impacted by truck safety 
standards.
    It is equally important that we listen to those whose lives 
have been devastated by the loss of a loved one in a traffic 
crash.
    I applaud the tireless work of the transportation safety 
advocates who help hold Congress and the administration to 
account as we work to make our roadways safer.
    We continue to have a climate crisis, and transportation 
emissions are increasing. Transportation is the largest emitter 
of carbon pollution in the U.S., and 80 percent of those 
emissions come from cars and light-duty trucks. The Biden 
administration's greenhouse gas performance measure was a small 
but important attempt to address climate change. We cannot 
solve what we do not measure.
    While this particular rule has been struck down, asking 
States to track carbon emissions on their roadways and set 
nonbinding goals to reduce emissions is not an unreasonable ask 
as part of the system where States control hundreds of billions 
of dollars and have the flexibility to spend them however they 
see fit, including on highway expansions.
    Ignoring the link between transportation and climate change 
will not prevent roadways from being washed out during storms, 
pavements from buckling under extreme heat, or tunnels from 
flooding during a hurricane.
    I look forward to the testimony from Transportation for 
America on how we can chart a better path forward.
    Clear, consistent rules save time, save money, and 
certainly save lives. They underpin our ability to travel 
freely, for businesses to ship their goods to market, and for 
people with differing abilities to access the transportation 
systems that they need to get around.
    While we may differ on the details of individual rules, I 
hope we can agree that consistent, reliable funding for 
infrastructure and data-driven rules to guide the buildout and 
the use of that infrastructure is key to safety and the 
economy.
    So, with that, I will yield back. And I want to thank the 
witnesses for being here and look forward to our discussion.

 Prepared Statement of Hon. Rick Larsen, a Representative in Congress

    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Larsen. I now would like to 
welcome our witnesses and thank them for being here today.
    Before we get started, I want to take a quick minute to 
explain our lighting system. It seems pretty self-explanatory. 
Three lights, much like a traffic light, in front of you. Green 
means go, but unlike a stoplight, yellow does not mean slow 
down and proceed with caution as you might expect. It actually 
means hurry up because it is fixing to turn red.
    When it turns red, you might hear one of these little 
numbers [tapping gavel], which is a reminder to conclude your 
remarks quickly. So, when it does turn red, like I said, you 
might hear a little tap.
    I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statements 
be included in the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    I also ask unanimous consent that the record of today's 
hearing remain open until such time as our witnesses have 
provided answers to any questions that may be submitted to them 
in writing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    I also ask unanimous consent that the record remain open 
for 15 days for any additional comments and information 
submitted by Members or witnesses to be included in the record 
of today's hearing.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    As your written testimony has been made part of the record, 
the subcommittee asks that you limit your oral remarks to 5 
minutes.
    With that, Mr. Duit, you are recognized for 5 minutes for 
your testimony.

 TESTIMONY OF TIM DUIT, PRESIDENT, DUIT CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, 
INC.; ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ROAD & TRANSPORTATION BUILDERS 
  ASSOCIATION (ARTBA); PHILIP K. BELL, CAE, PRESIDENT, STEEL 
   MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (SMA); WILLIAM ``LEWIE'' PUGH, 
 EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, OWNER-OPERATOR INDEPENDENT DRIVERS 
ASSOCIATION (OOIDA); AND BETH OSBORNE, DIRECTOR, TRANSPORTATION 
                    FOR AMERICA (T4AMERICA)

 TESTIMONY OF TIM DUIT, PRESIDENT, DUIT CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, 
INC.; ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ROAD & TRANSPORTATION BUILDERS 
                      ASSOCIATION (ARTBA)

    Mr. Duit. Good morning, Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member 
Norton, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for inviting 
me to appear in my role as chair of the American Road & 
Transportation Builders Association.
    ARTBA's public- and private-sector members design, build, 
and maintain the Nation's transportation network. I am also 
president of Duit Construction, based in Edmond, Oklahoma. We 
are a family-owned, heavy highway concrete, asphalt, and bridge 
construction company with around 700 employees.
    Before I address the regulatory matters at the heart of 
today's hearing, let me note that the increased investment 
levels in the 2021 infrastructure law are supporting an overdue 
modernization of America's transportation network. States have 
initiated 75,000 improvements with at least 1 Federal-aid 
highway and bridge project in nearly every U.S. county. In 
Oklahoma, 1,600 projects are taking shape.
    The infrastructure law is also helping with job creation. 
Nationally, 43,000 new construction industry jobs have been 
added since 2021. Another key part of the infrastructure story 
is the Federal agencies implementing the maze of policy 
changes. Regulatory proposals that are clear and well-defined 
can achieve their intended purpose.
    For example, when the Federal Highway Administration 
recently proposed updates to its work zone regulations, we were 
pleased to see greater emphasis on the need for positive 
separation between workers and motorists. It will help improve 
safety for everyone. In other instances, however, while the 
road to regulation is paved with good intentions, the outcomes 
can cause uncertainty in the lack of clarity for the companies 
working on transportation projects.
    My written testimony addresses numerous areas for 
regulatory reform that are worthy of additional oversights by 
this subcommittee. In the interest of time, I will address four 
of them.
    The first relates to what constitutes ``waters of the 
United States.'' If a project includes a roadside ditch, is a 
Clean Water Act permit required? This should be an easy answer, 
but, unfortunately, it is not. The definition has bounced back 
and forth like a ping-pong ball with different proposals from 
the last three different Presidential administrations.
    Years of litigation led to a definitive clarification by 
the United States Supreme Court, but Federal agencies have not 
yet fully complied. So, more than a decade of uncertainty, 
confusion, and frustration continues for transportation 
builders.
    Second, ARTBA fully supports congressional intent to 
strengthen domestic manufacturing. However, we continue to see 
inconsistencies and uncertainties in the Buy American 
implementation. The Federal Highway Administration has proposed 
to roll back its Buy America waiver for manufactured products. 
This would require contractors to dissect electronic, 
mechanical, and other items incorporated into projects and 
document the origin of thousands of small inexpensive 
components. To prevent unnecessary cost increases and project 
disruptions, ARTBA supports continuation of the existing 
waiver.
    Third, while we work to comply with other IIJA changes, we 
are also contending with unexpected regulations that are not 
part of the law, like a rule requiring a greenhouse gas 
performance measure. This measure was debated and deliberately 
left out of the bipartisan IIJA, yet the current administration 
finalized their rule in December and now litigation is ongoing.
    Fourth, the Fish and Wildlife Service is preparing to 
tighten protections against accidental harming of migratory 
birds. While contractors aim to safeguard wildlife on or near 
project sites, a rule that imposes a rigid and unpredictable 
requirement could result in work stoppages every time these 
types of birds appear in the area.
    In closing, let me say that historic levels of 
infrastructure investment when accompanied by the harmonious 
regulatory environment intended by Congress can result in 
timely completion of transportation projects that move people 
and products safely and efficiently. We look forward to our 
continued collaboration with Congress to achieve this goal.
    Thanks again for the opportunity to be here today. I am 
happy to answer any questions.
    [Mr. Duit's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
 Prepared Statement of Tim Duit, President, Duit Construction Company, 
    Inc.; on behalf of the American Road & Transportation Builders 
                          Association (ARTBA)
    Subcommittee Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and members 
of the subcommittee, thank you for convening today's hearing.
    I am Tim Duit, president of Duit Construction, a heavy highway 
concrete and asphalt construction company with more than 700 team 
members that is based in Edmond, Oklahoma. I also serve as the current 
chair of the American Road & Transportation Builders Association 
(ARTBA).
    Established in 1902, ARTBA is the only national association 
representing all aspects of the U.S. transportation design and 
construction industry. Our 8,000 members, anchored by our 36 state 
contractor chapter affiliates, design, build, and manage the nation's 
transportation infrastructure.
    Today's hearing offers an opportunity to examine the balance 
between the work required to construct and maintain America's roads, 
bridges, and public transportation systems and the regulatory 
safeguards under which the transportation construction industry 
operates.
    These safeguards aim to protect workers and the traveling public, 
provide a level-playing field for businesses to compete, and ensure 
stewardship of the environment and national transportation system.
    A robust regulatory framework and a strong national transportation 
system are not mutually exclusive.
    The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provided a much-
needed boost in investment. to support modernization of the multi-modal 
U.S. transportation network. My company has already experienced the 
impacts of this investment, winning multiple bids for projects 
supported by the infrastructure law. Oklahoma has seen more than 1,600 
projects receive IIJA funding commitments, and Duit Construction has 
ramped up hiring and equipment purchases to accommodate the increase in 
activity for our company.
    At the same time as the infrastructure law's investments are 
supporting mobility and safety improvements, a maze of new and expanded 
regulations that govern the use of these funds is being advanced. The 
resulting uncertainty impacts how I hire, when my teams can begin 
construction, and where to purchase materials and equipment needed on 
jobsites.
    As I noted at the outset, state and federal regulations have always 
been part of public sector infrastructure endeavors. Our goal is to 
ensure that the regulatory environment has the same objectives as 
transportation investments--to help move people and products in the 
safest and most efficient manner possible.
                     The Infrastructure Law So Far
    A complex regulatory environment existed prior to the IIJA, and 
it's important to underscore that any rulemakings underway since 2021 
do not overshadow the significant impacts most states are seeing in 
work performed thanks to the law's investment increases.
    As the IIJA has crossed the mid-way point of its five-year 
authorization, its market impacts are evident at all stages of the 
highway and bridge construction pipeline, delivering safety 
improvements, upgrades, and enhancements that improve the quality of 
life for all Americans. There are very few government programs that 
have such a widespread and lasting impact on our country.
    The map below depicts the number of new federal-aid highway and 
bridge project commitments in the law's first two years--totaling more 
than 75,000 so far. 
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>


    Additional indicators of the law's progress since October 1, 2021, 
include:
    <bullet>  States have advanced at least one federal-aid highway and 
bridge project in nearly every county across the country;
    <bullet>  The value of state and local government projects breaking 
ground was up, year-to-year, 27 percent in 2022 and another 9 percent 
in 2023;
    <bullet>  The value of state and local government projects was 
nearly $114 billion in 2023, compared to $75 billion in 2019;
    <bullet>  Nearly 43,000 new construction industry jobs have been 
added since 2021; and
    <bullet>  The value of highway and bridge construction work is up 
over 18 percent in the beginning of 2024, on top of record levels of 
work in 2022 and 2023.

    Projects supported by the infrastructure law include repair and 
reconstruction work, new capacity, planning and design, right of way 
purchases, and other eligible activities under the federal-aid highway 
program, as depicted in the chart below. 
<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>


    The law also supports major projects with a regional impact, such 
as the Anzalduas International Bridge project in Texas or upgrades to 
the I-10 freight corridor in Mississippi, along with important 
improvements at the local level, such as the reconstruction of Cedar 
Falls Main Street in Iowa and safety improvements on South McGregor 
Avenue in Mobile, Alabama.
    Closer to home, Muskogee, Oklahoma, will see freight, safety, and 
community improvements thanks to a $74 million replacement of the east 
and westbound spans of the U.S. Highway 62 bridge over the Arkansas 
River. The 60-year-old bridge was showing major signs of wear and tear, 
and with the help of IIJA funding, the state is investing in the 
economic future of the region. Given the strength of leading indicators 
and stable funding, construction activity is expected to continue to 
grow in the next three years as highway and bridge improvements 
continue.
       Transportation Construction and the Regulatory Environment
    Federal regulations, when properly enacted, can foster market 
growth and competition, spur innovation, and ensure that safety and 
environmental stewardship run parallel with the cost-effective delivery 
of transportation infrastructure projects. However, when these 
regulations become overly burdensome, they have the potential to stifle 
infrastructure investment and shift costs from construction to 
compliance.
    Government wide, 2024 has been one of the most-costly years for 
federal regulations finalized to-date. And since the enactment of IIJA, 
there have been at least 50 new regulations affecting the 
transportation construction industry alone.
    Compliance costs such as rule familiarization, new paperwork, and 
recordkeeping requirements, as well as the need for increased staff and 
equipment, are exacerbated when businesses do not know how to comply 
with rules. As such, contractors competing to work on transportation 
improvement projects will often ``price'' the risk of new regulatory 
requirements--or uncertainty about them--into their bids, resulting in 
needlessly higher project costs for taxpayers.
    These rulemakings have generated new uncertainties for the industry 
as they seek to properly comply, threatening to delay projects and 
increase costs. A cycle of a proposed rule, finalization, and in some 
cases, litigation, creates significant challenges for businesses large 
and small.
    The following represents a cross section of recent regulatory 
activity in transportation construction that impacts how projects are 
delivered:
Contracting
    The transportation construction industry seeks to maximize safety, 
cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and environmental stewardship in 
building federal-aid projects. The federal regulatory regime should 
not--and need not--compromise those objectives. Regrettably, several 
recent regulatory changes or proposals threaten to undermine economic 
benefits from the IIJA's record investments.
    Here are current examples of regulations which, when improperly 
interpreted and implemented, threaten to dilute the value of federal 
investment.
            Build America, Buy America
    The ``Build America, Buy America Act'' (BABA), embedded in the 
IIJA, remains a significant implementation challenge as we approach 
three years since the law's enactment. ARTBA supports the clear 
congressional intent to grow domestic manufacturing capacity in the 
long-term. Our concern relates to the potential for project 
disruptions, given unrealistic market expectations and the time 
required for domestic manufacturing capacity to develop.
    For more than 40 years, Buy America has required a domestic 
manufacturing process for iron, steel and certain manufactured products 
permanently incorporated into federal-aid highway and transit projects, 
which ARTBA has supported. The IIJA expanded Buy America coverage to 
five categories of construction materials (non-ferrous metals, plastic 
and polymer-based products, glass, lumber, and drywall). The law also 
codified responsibilities for the Made in America Office (MIAO), part 
of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) which the Biden 
administration had created by executive order. The MIAO is charged with 
coordinating domestic preference programs and reviewing related waivers 
for the entirety of the federal government.
    ARTBA continues to see shortcomings and misplaced priorities in 
BABA's implementation. In February 2024, ARTBA joined three other 
national associations in filing a petition for rulemaking with OMB. Our 
coalition contends that MIAO has wrested numerous responsibilities for 
BABA implementation from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the 
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and others with decades of 
experience in applying Buy America to projects. In some cases, this has 
resulted in uncertainties or inconsistencies in current Buy America 
requirements across states. Additionally, the petition notes that the 
BABA waiver process, in which MIAO now plays a critical role, has 
proven to be inconsistent, opaque, and dysfunctional for several 
agencies.
    Also of great concern, FHWA has proposed rolling back its 
longstanding waiver for manufactured products. This action would result 
in significant administrative costs and delays, in part because 
contractors will need to document the origin of small, inexpensive, 
commercially available, off-the-shelf items that comprise various 
manufactured products.
    In a survey of contractors undertaken in response to FHWA's request 
for information on this topic, two-thirds of respondents anticipated 
the proposed rollback would require ``significant additional time and 
cost to document and certify the components within manufactured 
products.'' They also identified dozens of manufactured products--
including electrical, electronic, and mechanical items--that would be 
difficult or impossible to procure at a reasonable cost--or at all--
with enough domestic content to comply with FHWA's proposed rule 
change.
    We urge this committee to engage with OMB, MIAO, FHWA and FTA, and 
seek to minimize project cost increases and delays resulting from the 
BABA provisions.
            Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program
    In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released 
rule changes for its longstanding Disadvantaged Business Enterprise 
(DBE) program. Conducted over two years, the rulemaking addressed 
almost 40 aspects of the DBE program, yielding approximately 400 
comments to the docket.
    ARTBA supported some of the rule changes and appreciated FHWA's 
responsiveness to a number of our comments. However, since the May 9 
effective date, the association has heard significant concerns from 
members--including DBE firms--as to how various new requirements are 
being interpreted at the state level.
    This includes extensive data collection responsibilities, which 
some state transportation agencies appear poised to impose on 
contractors and subcontractors bidding on federal-aid projects. Some 
DBE firms have commented that these types of administrative mandates 
may drive them from the transportation construction market entirely.
    ARTBA recommends that this committee deploy its oversight 
responsibilities to review various aspects of DBE program 
implementation under the revised rule.
            U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), Davis-Bacon Act Regulations
    Last summer, DOL announced significant changes to the Davis-Bacon 
Act's regulations that govern the prevailing wage for federal 
contracting. While DOL was responsive to and specifically referenced 
ARTBA's comments, portions of the final rule remain problematic. 
Specifically, DOL's revisions concerning truck drivers and materials 
suppliers created significant confusion for transportation construction 
contractors. Furthermore, DOL regional offices have not reported 
consistently on the rules.
    Litigation has stayed the most problematic rule changes for the 
time being, but ARTBA notes that DOL's implementation guidance has not 
been sufficiently detailed or timely (including updates needed since 
recent court actions). Ensuring consistent application of the rule will 
alleviate unnecessary confusion. Non-compliance with these regulations 
can result in substantial penalties, including fines and potential 
debarment from future federal contracts, underscoring the importance of 
clear and uniform guidance for the industry.
    We have also seen systemic challenges in Davis-Bacon compliance 
unrelated to the recent rule changes. For about the past fifteen years, 
job classifications and territories for calculating prevailing wage 
rates in Oklahoma have grown steadily, adding administrative costs. 
Congress or DOL should seek to streamline this process, which will 
reduce project costs and lead to more economic benefits from federal 
transportation investment.
            Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
                    (MBTA)
    In a forthcoming proposed rule change, FWS is expected to further 
tighten penalties for accidental harm to migratory birds. While well-
intentioned, this approach does not recognize that these species' 
habitats can appear on transportation project sites (especially 
bridges) virtually overnight as birds build new nests. Broadening 
interpretation of the MBTA would likely require industry professionals 
to utilize extraordinary, costly and time-consuming measures to avoid 
accidental harm to, or takings of, any such birds, potentially 
requiring work stoppages. Moreover, if unintended incidents occur 
despite preventative steps, the contractor would be subject to an 
economic penalty. While contractors make significant efforts to protect 
wildlife on or near project sites, use of the MBTA in this way will 
diminish the predictability of workflow and costs.
Procurement
            Federal Highway Administration, Qualifications Based 
                    Selection Rule
    Contracts for architecture and engineering services that are 
related to a construction project and utilize federal funding must 
foster open competition under the 1972 Brooks Act. This is achieved 
through a current FHWA procurement process known as ``qualifications-
based selection'' (QBS), which assesses engineering design services 
based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for services being 
procured, all while ensuring a fair and reasonable price.
    FHWA proposed eliminating the requirement to use the QBS method for 
projects awarded directly to a non-state agency (e.g., local, or 
municipal agency). ARTBA strongly opposes this proposal, as it could 
lead to suboptimal project outcomes by prioritizing cost over quality. 
High-quality engineering and design services are crucial for ensuring 
the safety, durability, and efficiency of transportation 
infrastructure. ARTBA is also concerned FHWA's proposal would create an 
uneven playing field with QBS applying to some recipients and not 
others, without a substantive justification.
Project Delivery
    ARTBA members have consistently demonstrated innovation and 
environmental stewardship, with many achieving significant 
sustainability successes through environmentally conscious project 
delivery methods. However, agency overreach and policy ambiguity create 
significant obstacles, and jeopardize the certainty required to advance 
transportation improvement projects.
            Federal Highway Administration, Greenhouse Gas Performance 
                    Measure
    FHWA finalized a December 2023 rule requiring state departments of 
transportation (DOTs) and metropolitan planning organizations to 
establish greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets. While FHWA did not 
mandate specific targets, it required that emissions decline over time, 
as measured by tailpipe carbon dioxide data. This would apply to all 
mainline highways and public roadways.
    ARTBA is not opposed to the reduction of GHG emissions in 
principle, but believes FHWA lacks the statutory authority, 
environmental expertise, and enforcement ability to enact such 
regulations. In fact, Congress deliberately contemplated and excluded 
such provisions from the IIJA. Further, this rule could impinge on 
state flexibility to select projects.
    Twenty-two states challenged the rule in two federal district 
courts, and ARTBA filed an amicus brief in support of the challenge. 
Both courts ruled that FHWA does not have statutory authority, and the 
agency is now appealing, thereby prolonging the regulatory uncertainty 
under which ARTBA members operate.
            U.S. Environmental Protection Agency/Army Corps, Waters of 
                    the United States
    Determining what constitutes Waters of the United States (WOTUS) 
under the Clean Water Act (CWA) is a perennial dilemma in Washington, 
D.C., and on construction sites around the country, given the shifting 
definitions proposed in various rulemakings over the last few years. 
For transportation construction professionals, roadside ditches have 
historically been exempted under WOTUS, but recent U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) action has created ambiguity.
    The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. Environmental 
Protection Agency clarified the scope of the CWA and sought to reduce 
regulatory ambiguity by providing a clear standard. Despite the Court's 
directives, EPA finalized a new rule that made only marginal 
improvements, while perpetuating longstanding uncertainties in CWA 
jurisdiction.
    While the agency removed the term ``significant nexus'' as 
instructed by the Court, EPA failed to provide a clear standard for 
``relatively permanent'' water flow in the rule, leaving regulated 
individuals to determine this on their own and bringing in further 
compliance uncertainty. This resulting lack of clarity forces project 
proponents to determine WOTUS on a case-by-case basis, leading to 
delays and potential agency overreach.
    Given that CWA violations carry criminal penalties, it is crucial 
for all regulated parties to understand what constitutes a WOTUS. ARTBA 
has requested implementation guidance from EPA to help achieve greater 
clarity and urges this committee to press the agency to issue draft 
implementation guidance for public comment.
            Permitting and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) 
                    Regulations
    The IIJA introduced ``One Federal Decision'' (OFD) reforms, 
exemplifying a bipartisan spirit for improving and expediting 
environmental reviews. Currently, the approval process for new, major 
federal-aid transportation projects averages five to seven years, with 
some ARTBA members waiting as long as 14 years.
    OFD aims to improve environmental reviews by enacting page limits, 
setting a two-year goal, and allowing federal agencies to engage in 
concurrent review. The IIJA made OFD a goal, and 2023's Fiscal 
Responsibility Act strengthened OFD reforms into a requirement. To 
date, ARTBA cannot point to any tangible applications of OFD. Failing 
to implement these reforms can incur significant taxpayer costs, as 
projects take longer to move to the construction phase.
    Separately, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) 
earlier this year finalized phase two of its NEPA rulemaking. The rule 
was responsive to ARTBA's comments by excluding prior greenhouse gas 
emissions guidance, but unfortunately removed references to the 
procedural nature of NEPA permitting, allows for indefinite extensions 
and requires consideration of abstract, hard-to-measure factors. ARTBA 
members have concerns that these ambiguities may lead to extended 
project delays and increased spurious litigation risks from third 
parties.
    Efficient project delivery is vital to achieving the infrastructure 
renewal goals of the IIJA, and all parties must work in concert to 
achieve this, while protecting environmental safeguards.
Work Zone Safety
    Safety for workers and the public is the top priority for ARTBA's 
membership. ARTBA has a strong working relationship with the U.S. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and respects the 
core purpose of the agency to ensure the safety of workers and 
worksites.
    Regrettably, current regulatory policies from OSHA have expanded 
from its core objective. This is particularly concerning in the context 
of safety, where clear and effective regulations are crucial to 
protecting these vulnerable workers.
            Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Worker 
                    Walkaround
    Historically, an employee--and when necessary and justified a 
relevant expert--could accompany an OSHA inspector during jobsite 
inspections. Recently, OSHA expanded this rule, allowing any third 
party to accompany an inspector if deemed ``reasonably necessary,'' 
removing the requirements for good cause and specific expertise.
    The previous, longstanding rule enumerated examples of qualified 
individuals, such as industrial hygienists or safety engineers. 
Instead, a third party can join an inspection if deemed ``reasonably 
necessary'' by the inspector, who has broad discretion to decide based 
on factors like relevant knowledge and communication skills. This 
expanded eligibility also includes individuals with prior relationships 
with employees.
    In the transportation construction industry, the expanded rule 
could have several impacts. Union representatives might access non-
union worksites for unauthorized organizing. Employers may face 
increased risks and liabilities if a third party is injured on an 
active site, especially if they are unfamiliar with proper safety 
protocols.
    Third parties with ulterior motives might gather information for 
litigation, while their overall presence could distract employees and, 
once again, compromise safety. There are also privacy concerns about 
exposing proprietary information. Additionally, inspections could lead 
to operational delays and increased project costs.
    OSHA claims this rule provides clarity, but it opens a door to new, 
undefined individuals and may result in delays, complications, and 
legal risks. Congress should require OSHA to remove this recent update 
to its regulation.
            Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Heat Safety 
                    Standards
    OSHA announced a July 2, 2024, proposal to establish heat safety 
standards in indoor and outdoor settings. Despite comments from ARTBA 
and others urging OSHA not to enact a one-size-fits-all rulemaking, the 
agency is proposing to set nationwide heat triggers. ARTBA proposed 
OSHA adopt regional approaches, as workers in different settings are 
acclimatized to different temperatures.
    ARTBA urged OSHA to allow employers to continue to implement the 
practices that best suit their employees, rather than requiring broad, 
prescriptive methods to address potential heat illness issues. Heat is 
not a new hazard for the transportation construction industry, and 
OSHA's rule fails to account for the unique nature of the 
transportation construction industry, like the need for continuous 
activity during certain paving work. ARTBA members employ the most 
innovative and effective methods available to protect their workers, 
and OSHA's proposal may detract from jobsite safety and effective 
project delivery with its combination of prescriptive break times and 
burdensome recordkeeping.
            Federal Highway Administration, Highway Safety Improvement 
                    Program
    Approximately 900 fatalities occur in and around transportation 
construction worksites annually, and as many as 200 are roadway 
construction professionals. Ensuring a safe workplace for the thousands 
of professionals tasked with delivering mobility and safety 
enhancements envisioned by the IIJA is ARTBA's top priority.
    As thousands of new projects are initiated, there will also be an 
increased number of work zones, resulting in increased risk exposure 
for workers. The transportation construction community is committed to 
doing its part to mitigate an increase in the number of safety-related 
incidents.
    FHWA's Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) rule is a well-
meaning attempt to protect vulnerable road users but misses a key 
vulnerable group: roadway workers. The HSIP requires states to develop 
and implement strategic highway safety plans to reduce fatalities and 
serious injuries on all public roads. ARTBA has urged FHWA to 
explicitly recognize highway workers as vulnerable road users in all 
roadway safety initiatives. The health and well-being of workers who 
build and maintain transportation systems are not always fully 
considered by those who depend on them.
    Roadway construction workers are not discretionary system users. 
They are required to be in work zones to aid the traveling public and 
support their families. They deserve the same prioritization as 
pedestrians and bicyclists.
                         Looking Ahead to 2026
    Regulations should support, rather than hinder, the efficient and 
effective deployment of IIJA funds in the law's remaining years. In 
support of that, ARTBA offers the following recommendations:
    <bullet>  Pass H.R. 8204, the Bipartisan Regulatory Early Notice 
and Engagement Act of 2024--this bipartisan legislation would increase 
transparency and engagement in the rulemaking process.

    <bullet>  Continued congressional oversight--a constant dialogue 
with federal agency officials on regulatory proposals is a valuable 
tool to ensure the law is implemented as Congress intended. This 
committee should continue to request testimony and updates from 
administration officials.

    <bullet>  Pursue additional reforms to enhance project delivery--
the IIJA suggested a two-year goal for environmental reviews, which was 
strengthened in subsequent legislation to a requirement. Congress 
should consider additional policy reforms to streamline the permitting 
process and increase coordination among federal agencies.

    <bullet>  Provide agencies with clear directives in legislation--
the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of the Chevron doctrine spotlights 
the crucial role of congressional leadership in ensuring that 
legislation is unambiguous, preventing regulations from ending up in 
litigation. ARTBA looks forward to its continued partnership with 
lawmakers to ensure that federal regulations are consistent with 
congressional intent.

    <bullet>  Timely engagement on reauthorization--a key driver for 
transportation construction investment is funding certainty to help 
states plan long-term investments. With the authorization of core 
surface transportation programs expiring in nearly two years, Congress 
should begin assessing current law and identifying priorities for 
timely enactment of a new, five-year law by October 1, 2026, including 
enacting revenue solutions for solvency of the Highway Trust Fund.

    The federal role to develop and maintain a national transportation 
system is a responsibility enshrined in the U.S. Constitution that 
enables interstate commerce, supports the economy, and improves quality 
of life.
    Thank you for the opportunity to share some of the practical 
impacts that a complex regulatory environment can have on the 
fulfillment of this responsibility.
    ARTBA looks forward to collaborating with this committee to help 
ensure federal regulations work in concert with the delivery of a 
reliable and safe national transportation network for the nation.

    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, sir. Mr. Bell, you are recognized.

      TESTIMONY OF PHILIP K. BELL, CAE, PRESIDENT, STEEL 
                MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (SMA)

    Mr. Bell. Good morning, Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member 
Norton, and distinguished members of the committee. Thank you 
for the opportunity to share ideas with you today.
    My name is Philip Bell. I am president of the Steel 
Manufacturers Association. The SMA is the largest U.S. trade 
association for steel. Our members are investing in the future.
    Between 2022 and 2026, they will have invested more than 
$20 billion, leading the way in the electrification, 
modernization, job creation, and further decarbonization of 
America's steel industry, which is already the cleanest in the 
world. As the Federal Highway Administration implements its Buy 
Clean program, it must promote low-emission steelmaking and 
adhere to statutory requirements established by Congress.
    A little background might be helpful. There are currently 
two ways to make steel. The traditional blast furnace 
production method is a centuries-old, coal-based, high-
emissions way of making steel. By contrast, SMA members use 
recycling-based electric arc furnaces to manufacture steel with 
an emissions profile 70 percent lower than traditional 
producers.
    EAFs are inherently more efficient and lower emitting, 
which is why virtually every new U.S. steel mill built in the 
last 50 years has been an electric furnace. EAF production 
dominates the steel used in our Nation's infrastructure, 
including 99 percent of all domestic rebar, wire rod, light 
shapes, wire mesh, and structural beams. Electric furnaces and 
blast furnaces can make the same grades and types of steel. The 
finished products from either method are identical. From a 
customer perspective, the type of steel production process does 
not matter.
    America's reliance on EAF production gives us a significant 
carbon advantage over our global competition. In fact, the 
domestic steel industry emits 75 to 320 percent less carbon 
than global producers. So, why does this carbon emissions 
advantage matter?
    The IRA appropriated more than $4 billion to the GSA and 
Federal Highway Administration to purchase construction 
materials that have substantially lower levels of embodied 
greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA defines ``substantially 
lower'' to mean products with the lowest 20 percent of 
emissions.
    SMA believes that a well-designed Buy Clean program can 
meaningfully accelerate decarbonization and assist in securing 
a stable future for the American steel industry and its 
workers. However, we have serious concerns with the GSA's 
implementation of its Buy Clean program and their adoption of a 
dual emissions standard for steel. We urge that Federal Highway 
reject GSA's misguided approach.
    For multiple steel product categories, GSA has set separate 
emissions standards for steel products simply based on how they 
are made. Under this dual standard, steel produced from blast 
furnaces will be subject to more lenient requirements than 
those made in modern electric furnaces despite an identical end 
product.
    This is contrary to the Buy Clean statute, which requires 
that only materials with substantially lower emissions be 
purchased. This market-distorting action discriminates against 
companies and workers that have invested heavily and worked 
tirelessly to reach substantially lower emission levels. GSA 
justifies this dual standard by claiming that electric furnaces 
cannot produce all the same types and grades of steel and that 
there will be an insufficient supply of recycled scrap to 
support greater EAF production. Both claims are wrong.
    First, there is simply no dispute that electric furnaces 
can produce the grades and types of steel needed for 
construction projects and Government procurement.
    Second, recent data by the OECD shows that global scrap 
surpluses will exist through at least 2050. In fact, the United 
States has so much steel scrap that we are a net exporter. GSA 
did not have a legitimate reason to set two standards, and 
neither does the Federal Highway Administration.
    To conclude, a single standard is simple and transparent. A 
single standard is fair to all producers and encourages 
innovation and investment. A single standard results in the 
greatest emissions reductions and will further our global 
advantage on lower emission steel.
    And, finally, a single standard is the only way to comply 
with the statute.
    Thank you for inviting me to testify today, and I look 
forward to continued engagement with members of the committee.
    [Mr. Bell's prepared statement follows:]

      Prepared Statement of Philip K. Bell, CAE, President, Steel 
                    Manufacturers Association (SMA)
    Good morning, Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton and 
distinguished members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity 
to appear before you to discuss the Department of Transportation's 
regulatory and administrative agenda. As the Federal Highway 
Administration (``FHWA'') and other federal agencies implement Buy 
Clean programs, it is imperative that they are designed to promote low 
emissions steelmaking and adhere to the statutory requirements 
established by Congress.
                              Introduction
    My name is Philip Bell. I am a 35-year manufacturing industry 
veteran. I developed an interest in the steel industry in the 1980s 
while working in maintenance and operations at American Chrome and 
Chemicals Company in Corpus Christi, TX. Our plant made chromium 
coatings that are used in the electroplating of metal products. I have 
been president of the Steel Manufacturers Association (SMA) for over a 
decade. Prior to the SMA I held executive-level positions with Gerdau 
North America, the SGL Carbon Group, and Qualitech Steel Corporation. I 
am extremely proud to be a part of and represent an industry that is 
the backbone of our country. The steel industry is a wonderful and 
glorious industry that has built careers, companies, communities, 
cities and even civilizations.
    The SMA is the largest U.S. trade association for steel. SMA 
members are focused on safety, sustainability and innovation. Our 
members make essential products for America's infrastructure, national 
security, energy and manufacturing sectors. Between 2022 and 2026 our 
members will have announced, started or finished new capex projects 
worth more than $20 billion, leading the way in the electrification, 
modernization and further decarbonization of America's steel industry, 
which is already the cleanest in the world.
                         Modern Steel Industry
    There are currently two ways to make steel. The traditional blast 
furnace/basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) production method is a centuries 
old, extractive, coal-based, high emissions way of making steel. 90% of 
the steel made in China uses this carbon intensive process. By 
contrast, SMA members use recycling- and scrap-based electric arc 
furnaces (EAFs) to manufacture steel with an emissions profile 70% 
lower than traditional BF-BOF producers. EAFs are inherently more 
efficient and lower emitting, which is why virtually every new U.S. 
steel mill built in the last 50 years has been an EAF. As a result, 
EAFs currently account for 70% of the steel made in the United States. 
EAF production dominates the steel used in our nation's infrastructure, 
including 99% of the domestic rebar (structural integrity of bridges, 
highways, buildings and foundations), wire rod (reinforcement), light 
shapes (strength and elasticity for load-bearing structures), wire mesh 
(holds concrete in place) and structural beams (creates strong and 
stable structures). EAF steel also accounts for the vast majority of 
plate, sheet, and pipe products used in construction. EAFs and BF-BOF 
can make all the same grades and types of steel. The finished products 
from either method are virtually identical. America's reliance on EAF 
production gives us a significant carbon advantage over our global 
competitors. In fact, the domestic steel industry emits 75-320% less 
carbon than global producers.\1\

    \1\ CRU, Emissions Analysis Executive Summary (June 14, 2022)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       A Single Buy Clean Standard for Steel is the Only Solution
    SMA believes that well-designed Buy Clean programs have the 
potential to meaningfully accelerate decarbonization and assist in 
securing a stable future for the American steel industry and its 
workers. However, we have serious concerns with the General Services 
Administration's (GSA) implementation of its Buy Clean program and, in 
particular, the adoption of a dual emissions standard that favors 
integrated BF-BOF steel production over recycling based EAF production. 
We urge the FHWA and other agencies to reject GSA's misguided approach.
    The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) appropriated more than $4 billion 
to the GSA and the FHWA to purchase construction materials that ``have 
substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas emissions'' as 
determined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\2\ The EPA 
defined ``substantially lower'' to mean products with the lowest 20% of 
embodied emissions when compared to similar materials.\3\ There is no 
ambiguity in the requirement that purchases under these programs are 
limited to those with ``substantially lower'' emissions. However, the 
dual emissions standard adopted by GSA is inconsistent with this 
statutory requirement and harms the goals of Buy Clean policies.

mission
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Specifically, for multiple steel product categories, GSA has set 
separate emissions standards for steel products made by integrated BF-
BOF mills and those made by modern, efficient EAFs. Under this dual 
standard, steel produced in BF-BOF mills will be subject to more 
lenient emissions requirements than those made in EAFs. This means that 
a steel product made in a BF-BOF facility may be considered just as 
clean or cleaner than a steel product made in an EAF facility with much 
lower emissions. As a result, low emissions steel that would qualify as 
clean under a single standard may not qualify under a dual standard, 
while high emission steel that has substantially higher emissions, may 
qualify as clean. This is contrary to the statute, which requires that 
only materials with ``substantially lower'' emissions be purchased. It 
also discriminates against companies and workers that invested heavily 
and worked tirelessly to reach substantially lower emissions levels.
    Further, dual standards like the one adopted by GSA are bad climate 
policy. They will result in higher total emissions by creating a carve-
out for the highest emitting producers. By encouraging the continued 
acquisition of high emissions steel and not promoting purchases of the 
lowest emissions steel, the government will not put maximum pressure on 
the highest emitters to decarbonize. Transitioning towards low emitting 
technologies like EAFs is the quickest and most reliable way to 
significantly reduce the greenhouse gas (``GHG'') emissions associated 
with steelmaking in the United States and across the globe. Buy Clean 
policies that do not distinguish between production technologies or raw 
material inputs can help accelerate the decarbonization of the American 
steel industry and send the right signals to steelmakers globally.
    GSA justifies its dual standard by claiming that EAFs cannot 
produce the same types and grades of steel products as BF-BOFs (e.g., 
exposed automotive, advanced high strength, electrical, and tin mill 
steels) and that there will be insufficient scrap supply to support 
greater EAF production. Both claims are wrong and not supported by the 
market.
    First, EAFs can produce the same types and grades of steel as BF-
BOFs. Further, the products that integrated producers claim cannot be 
made by EAFs are not the types of construction products covered by Buy 
Clean programs. There is simply no dispute that EAFs can produce the 
grades and types of steel needed for construction projects and 
government procurement. Even for the most demanding steels, many of the 
BF-BOFs that are transitioning towards EAF production publicly 
acknowledge that their EAFs can produce the same types of advanced 
products as their BF-BOF operations.
    Second, the availability of scrap does not limit the ability of 
EAFs to supply a greater and significant percentage of steel demand. 
Recent data from the OECD show a global scrap surplus through at least 
2050. In fact, the United States is a significant net exporter of 
scrap. The availability of scrap is not a concern for construction 
grade products. And as far as automotive grades are concerned, recent 
technological advancements are increasing the available substitutes for 
prime scrap, and EAFs can produce high quality steel with little or no 
prime scrap.
    SMA appreciates FHWA's work in developing its Buy Clean program and 
its efforts to engage domestic steel producers in doing so. We 
encourage the agency to avoid the same misguided approach as GSA. 
Consistent with the IRA, FHWA should adopt a single emissions standard 
that applies equally to all products regardless of their production 
process or raw material inputs. All that should matter under FHWA's Buy 
Clean program are the actual embodied emissions of the products and 
that the production and use of materials with the lowest embodied 
emissions are encouraged.
    From the customer perspective, the type of steel production process 
does not matter. Steel is purchased according to industry grades and 
standards that do not distinguish based on production technology or raw 
material inputs. In this sense, an emissions standard that 
differentiates by production process, such as a dual standard, delays 
decarbonization by allowing the highest emitting producers to claim 
they are cleaner than their actual emissions. It also discourages 
recycling and penalizes companies for investing in circular 
steelmaking. Instead, there should be a single standard based on actual 
emissions.
    <bullet>  A single standard is simple and transparent. A single 
standard makes clear to customers, business partners, and governments 
who are the lowest and highest emitting producers based on total, 
actual emissions, without caveats based on production process. High 
emissions producers should not be allowed to conceal the significant 
gap between the dirtiest and cleanest producers. Put simply, if two 
steel products are identical, they should be held to the same Buy Clean 
emissions requirements.

    <bullet>  A single standard is fair to all producers and encourages 
innovation and investment. A single standard does not prioritize 
specific steel production processes or raw material inputs and, in 
doing so, it incentivizes investment in all production pathways, 
including the types of steel technologies that will be needed to 
achieve significant reductions in the future. There is no longer a 
clear divide between EAF and BF-BOF production, and the future of 
steelmaking will require a variety of technologies. Buy Clean policies 
should promote the development and adoption of all types of new and low 
emissions steelmaking processes, rather than locking-in old 
technologies and production routes.

    <bullet>  A single standard results in the greatest emissions 
reductions and will further our global advantage on low emissions 
steel. By applying equally to all producers and production 
methodologies, a single standard rewards those with the lowest embodied 
GHG emissions and promotes the fastest possible transition by companies 
who do not qualify for preferred government procurement under these 
programs.

    In short, FHWA and other federal agencies should not differentiate 
between steel products made in EAFs or BF-BOFs, but rather adopt a 
single emissions standard that applies the same requirements to all 
steel producers and steel products, regardless of their production 
technology or raw materials. Doing otherwise would create a Buy Clean 
program that disadvantages carbon efficient producers and workers, 
mislabels dirty steel as clean, and tempers our ambition to 
decarbonize.

                                 * * *

    Because of America's tremendous carbon advantage on steel, 
successful Buy Clean programs can be a powerful tool to meaningfully 
reduce emissions and support the American steel industry and its 
workers. A single standard that applies equally to all producers is the 
only way to comply with the statute, maximize emissions reductions, and 
incentivize investment in decarbonization. Thank you for inviting me to 
testify today. I look forward to continued engagement with members of 
this committee.

    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Bell.
    Mr. Pugh.

TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM ``LEWIE'' PUGH, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, 
     OWNER-OPERATOR INDEPENDENT DRIVERS ASSOCIATION (OOIDA)

    Mr. Pugh. Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Holmes Norton 
and members of the subcommittee, I am Lewie Pugh, and I am a 
proud trucker. I also serve as the executive vice president of 
the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. I laid out 
my career as a trucker in the United States Army. After that, I 
spent 23 years driving a truck as a small-business motor 
carrier, amassing 2.5 million safe miles across this country. I 
still hold my CDL today.
    OOIDA is the largest trade association representing small-
business truckers and professional drivers across the country. 
We have 150,000 members in all 50 States who operate 
collectively 240,000 pieces of equipment. OOIDA promotes and 
protects the interests of our members on issues impacting 
economic well-being, working conditions, and safe operation of 
a commercial motor vehicle.
    Small trucking businesses account for 96 percent of all 
registered motor carriers in the U.S., and they are undoubtedly 
the safest and most diverse operators on the road. Trucking is 
one of the most heavily regulated industries in America.
    From the number of hours you can drive to the color and 
width of tape that you must put on your trailer to even when 
you can go home, every element of trucking is controlled by 
regulation. Complying with existing regulations, many of which 
have no connection to safety, can be overwhelming even for the 
most experienced drivers. In some cases, it is damn near 
impossible.
    While compliance rates have never been higher, there are 
those, including large motor carriers, shippers, safety 
advocates, and elected officials, along with bureaucrats, who 
not only resist in modernizing or eliminating needless 
regulations but want to impose even more rules on the American 
trucker.
    Some folks want to mandate speed limiters on all commercial 
vehicles while dismissing the disastrous consequences and 
concerns of highway safety and supply chain issues. Others with 
no experience in a commercial motor vehicle want to mandate the 
use of unproven and cost-prohibitive equipment like side 
underride guards. Unfortunately, these examples only scratch 
the surface.
    If this is painting a picture of a dysfunctional regulatory 
environment where practical solutions have become secondary 
considerations, you are starting to see things like an OOIDA 
member. Let me be clear, OOIDA and our members are not anti-
regulation. We have a long history of supporting regulations 
that address critical needs in our industry and are backed by 
sound research and data.
    We have pushed for enhanced driver training requirements, 
improved broker transparency, stronger truck leasing rules, 
better driver pay, and a more accurate and reliable safety 
rating system. Unfortunately, Congress and DOT have an 
inconsistent record when it comes to crafting regulations.
    Even members of this subcommittee have demonstrated 
inconsistency when it comes to developing regulations that 
support truckers and highway safety. On a positive note, 
Ranking Member Holmes Norton has championed a bipartisan 
legislation to fight freight fraud, and Representative Van Drew 
has introduced a bipartisan bill to eliminate the overtime 
exemption to ensure drivers are paid for all the hours that 
they work.
    In contrast, other lawmakers, at the behest of trial 
lawyers, have continued to push a massive 500-percent increase 
in liability insurance minimums despite knowing the existing 
minimum covers the cost of 99 percent of crashes.
    Even the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided a

provisions to combat predatory leasing. On the other, the bill 
authorized an overly ambitious automatic emergency braking

by blatantly biased participants who failed in their mission to 
generate a consensus on the ways to reduce underride crashes, 
fatalities, and injuries.
    While Congress' record features positive and negative 
aspects, truckers are completely frustrated with DOT's 
regulatory actions, mostly concerning the Department's wildly 
unpopular and dangerous speed limiter mandate, its efforts to 
water down CDL requirements, the slow pace of addressing broker 
transparency, and improving the National Consumer Complaint 
Database.
    In the end, truckers want regulations that reflect their 
needs and the changing dynamics of their industry. It is time 
for Congress and DOT to help make trucking an appealing, safe, 
and sustainable career by listening to the people who make 
their living behind the wheel.
    Thank you for this opportunity.

                                 <F-dash>
Prepared Statement of William ``Lewie'' Pugh, Executive Vice President, 
         Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA)
    Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Norton, and members of the 
Subcommittee, my name is Lewie Pugh and I am the Executive Vice 
President of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association 
(OOIDA). Prior to working at OOIDA, I was a small-business trucker for 
nearly 23 years with 2.5 million miles of safe driving. Before 
operating my own trucking business, I drove a truck during my service 
in the United States Army. I still proudly hold a Commercial Driver's 
License (CDL). In short, I've been a trucker my entire career.
                              About OOIDA
    The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association is the largest 
trade association representing the views of small-business truckers and 
professional truck drivers. OOIDA has approximately 150,000 members 
located in all fifty states that collectively own and operate more than 
240,000 individual heavy-duty trucks. OOIDA's mission is to promote and 
protect the interests of our members on any issues that impact their 
economic well-being, working conditions, and the safe operation of 
commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) on our nation's highways.
    Small trucking businesses, like those we represent, account for 96 
percent of registered motor carriers in the United States, making them 
a key component of the nation's supply chain. We are undoubtedly the 
safest and most diverse operators on our nation's roads. Every region 
of our country and segment of our economy relies upon long-haul truck 
drivers. Our members are an integral part of the global supply chain 
and have a unique perspective on the many challenges our nation faces 
in moving freight in the safest, most efficient manner.
                              Introduction
    Trucking is one of the most heavily regulated industries in 
America. Federal regulations affect nearly every aspect of a 
professional driver's life. From the number of hours they can drive 
before taking a break or shutting down, to the color and width of tape 
they must use on their trailers, nearly every element of trucking is 
controlled by a regulation. Complying with existing regulations, many 
of which have absolutely no connection with safety, can be overwhelming 
for even the most experienced driver. In some cases, it can be damn 
near impossible.
    While compliance rates with this dizzying array of regulations have 
never been higher, there are those, including large motor carriers, 
shippers, safety advocates, elected officials, and bureaucrats, who not 
only resist modernizing or eliminating needless regulations, but want 
to impose even more impractical and ineffective rules on American 
truckers.
    Some of these entities want to go so far as mandating speed 
limiters on all commercial vehicles, which could force truckers to 
travel 20 mph below the posted speed limit. Supporters have dismissed 
concerns about the disastrous consequences this regulation would have 
on highway safety and the supply chain. Others, with no experience in 
the day-to-day operation of a CMV, want to mandate the use of unproven 
and cost-prohibitive equipment like side underride guards that would 
jeopardize the safety of drivers and the future of their businesses. 
There are even members of this Committee who want to dramatically 
increase the amount of liability insurance truckers must carry, knowing 
this increase is entirely unnecessary and will immediately destroy 
innumerable small trucking businesses.
    If this paints a picture of a dysfunctional regulatory environment 
where practical solutions have become secondary considerations, then 
you're starting to see things like an OOIDA member.
    Let me be clear, OOIDA and our members are not anti-regulation, as 
some would have you believe. In fact, the opposite is true. We have a 
long history of supporting regulations that address critical needs in 
our industry and are backed by sound research and data. For decades, we 
have pushed for enhanced driver training requirements to ensure the men 
and women behind the wheel of a CMV are prepared to operate at the 
safest level. We've also pushed for greater broker transparency, 
stronger truck leasing requirements, better driver pay, and more 
accurate and reliable safety ratings systems.
    Truckers believe Congress and the Department of Transportation 
(DOT) have inconsistent records when it comes to crafting regulations 
that support their needs. Even members of this Subcommittee have 
demonstrated inconsistency when it comes to developing regulations that 
advance our shared objective of improving highway safety and supporting 
those who make their living on the road.
    On a positive note, Ranking Member Holmes Norton and Representative 
Ezell have championed bipartisan legislation to fight freight fraud, 
which is destroying small trucking businesses every day, and Rep. Van 
Drew has introduced a bipartisan bill to eliminate the overtime 
exemption for truckers, ensuring drivers are paid for all the hours 
they work. In contrast, other lawmakers, at the behest of trial 
lawyers, continue to push for a massive 500% increase in liability 
insurance minimums that would immediately kill small trucking 
businesses, despite knowing the existing minimum of $750,000 covers 
costs in over 99% of crashes involving a CMV.
    Even the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) provided a 
mixed bag for truckers. On one hand, Congress included provisions that 
will combat predatory lease agreements that take advantage of truckers. 
On the other, the bill authorized an overly-ambitious automatic 
emergency braking (AEB) mandate that ignores known limitations and 
deficiencies with the technology. The Act also created an underride 
committee dominated by blatantly-biased participants who failed in 
their mission to generate consensus on ways to reduce underride 
crashes, fatalities, and injuries.
    While Congress's recent record features both positive and negative 
aspects, truckers have grown frustrated with the Biden Administration's 
regulatory steps initiated under their own authority. First and 
foremost is the wildly unpopular and dangerous speed limiter mandate 
proposed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), 
which should be withdrawn immediately. We are also concerned by FMCSA's 
efforts to water down commercial driver's license (CDL) requirements at 
a time when we should be enhancing driver training regulations. Even 
when moving in the right direction, such as working to improve broker 
transparency and enhancing the ability of truckers to report safety 
risks through the National Consumer Complaint Database (NCCDB), the 
agency is painfully and unnecessarily slow to act. Outside DOT, 
truckers can't believe the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is 
moving forward with more crippling emissions regulations.
    In the end, truckers want regulations that reflect their needs and 
the changing dynamics of their industry. It's time for Congress and DOT 
to help make trucking an appealing, safe and sustainable career by 
listening first to the people that make their living behind-the-wheel.
                             Speed Limiters
    In April 2022, DOT reopened a potential speed limiter mandate on 
all CMVs over 26,000 pounds, despite receiving overwhelming opposition 
after its initial 2016 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Any speed limiter 
mandate would be harmful for road safety, crash rates, driver 
retention, and supply chain performance. By establishing a one-size-
fits-all federal mandate restricting heavy-duty CMVs to a speed that is 
separate from passenger vehicles, this regulation would create 
dangerous speed differentials between trucks and cars. Decades of 
highway research shows greater speed differentials increase 
interactions, such as passing or braking, between truck drivers and 
other road users. Studies have consistently demonstrated that 
increasing these interactions directly increases the likelihood of 
crashes.
    In many states, this mandate would create split speed limits on 
two-lane rural roads, which are particularly hazardous. In these 
conditions, passenger vehicles that want to travel at the posted limit 
get stuck behind slower-moving trucks, increasing the number of risky 
passes they must make using the oncoming lane of traffic. Speed 
limiting trucks also increases pressure on drivers to complete their 
work. Truckers required to operate below the posted speed limit must 
drive longer hours to cover the same distance, which increases their 
fatigue and places even greater stress on them to comply with 
burdensome federal hours-of-service regulations. A speed limiter 
mandate would also exacerbate supply chain challenges. By prohibiting 
trucks from traveling at the posted speed limit in certain areas, this 
mandate will literally slow down freight movement across the country. 
If the regulation is implemented, more trucks will be needed to carry 
the same amount of freight in the same amount of time, which also 
increases road congestion and contributes to higher crash rates.
    Furthermore, this mandate would be especially bad for small 
businesses. Some large motor carriers already use speed limiters as a 
fleet management tool, but small business and single-truck operators 
have no need for these devices. A government mandate would ultimately 
take away one of the last competitive advantages that small businesses 
have over large carriers. In its rulemaking, FMCSA admitted this 
mandate would be bad for small businesses, stating, ``small trucking 
companies, especially independent owner-operators, would be less 
profitable with speed limiting devices.''
    There is already a mechanism in place to address vehicle speeds: 
speed limits set and enforced by the states. In 1995, Congress repealed 
the national speed limit and gave states the authority to establish 
speed limits for their roads. Since then, states have been able to 
design their roadways and set top speeds according to what they have 
determined to be safest for their specific needs and conditions. 
FMCSA's ongoing rulemaking ignores this long-standing authority.
    OOIDA is leading a coalition comprised of transportation 
stakeholders in support of H.R. 3039, the Deregulating Restrictions on 
Interstate Vehicles and Eighteen-Wheelers (DRIVE) Act. The legislation 
prohibits FMCSA from implementing regulations mandating the use of 
speed limiters on heavy-duty trucks. We encourage all subcommittee 
members to support H.R. 3039 and hope the DRIVE Act can be enacted 
before FMCSA promulgates another dangerous mandate.
                      Automatic Emergency Braking
    Section 23010 of IIJA required DOT to prescribe federal motor 
vehicle safety standards for AEB systems on newly manufactured CMVs. 
The legislation also required DOT to directly consult with 
representatives of CMV drivers regarding the experiences truckers have 
had with AEB systems as a means to identify and address deficiencies in 
technologies that are already in use.
    DOT ignored these requirements prior to publishing an AEB NPRM in 
June 2023, claiming previous outreach to truckers, initiated before the 
AEB rulemaking began, satisfied the requirement to consult with 
drivers. We disagree. Additionally, the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) has an open investigation into AEB systems on 
certain heavy-duty trucks because of reports of false activations. 
These factors resulted in a proposal that did not adequately ensure AEB 
systems could meet necessary safety standards before the technology 
requirement becomes effective.
    The NPRM contained four irresponsible flaws: (1) failure to address 
false activations; (2) inadequate consultation with professional truck 
drivers; (3) precedes necessary completion of ongoing research; and (4) 
cloaks deficient testing processes with minimum performance 
expectations. These shortcomings negligently pose highway safety risks 
to the motoring public and to professional drivers alike. Congress must 
ensure that DOT addresses these deficiencies in the pending AEB Final 
Rule anticipated in January 2025. If not, AEB systems will jeopardize 
our members' safety and create otherwise avoidable hazards on our 
roads.
                             Freight Fraud
    The evolution of technology, a lack of federal oversight, and a 
failure to prioritize criminal enforcement have all contributed to an 
unprecedented rise in fraudulent activity in trucking over the last few 
years. Motor carriers are victimized through unpaid claims, unpaid 
loads, double brokered loads, or load phishing schemes on a daily 
basis. This costs the trucking industry over $800 million annually. 
Freight fraud committed by criminals and scam artists has been 
particularly devastating to many small business truckers simply trying 
to survive in a tough freight market. The current regulatory framework 
limits enforcement, enables bad actors to operate with impunity, and 
forces out drivers who want to build sustainable trucking careers.
    In recent months, FMCSA has taken initial steps that may curtail 
fraud, including finalizing a long-awaited Broker and Freight Forwarder 
Financial Responsibility Rule, announcing a registration fraud team, 
and preparing modernization updates to the motor carrier/broker 
registration process. However, many drivers remain skeptical that these 
changes will be sufficient to substantively address the problem. OOIDA 
strongly supports H.R. 8505, the Household Goods Shipping Consumer 
Protection Act--bipartisan legislation introduced by Ranking Member 
Holmes Norton and Rep. Mike Ezell. The bill restores and codifies 
FMCSA's authority to issue civil penalties against bad actors, and also 
requires brokers, freight forwarders, and motor carriers provide a 
valid business address to FMCSA in order to register for authority. 
H.R. 8505 would provide FMCSA with better tools to root out 
unscrupulous actors, which are also harmful to consumers and highway 
safety. We hope this bill will be marked-up by the Full Committee 
without delay.
                          Broker Transparency
    For years, small-business truckers have expressed frustration that 
regulations designed to provide transparency are routinely evaded by 
brokers or simply not enforced by FMCSA. 49 CFR Sec. 371.3 mandates 
that brokers keep transaction records and permits each party to a 
brokered transaction to review these documents. These regulations are 
in place to protect motor carriers, brokers, and the public by ensuring 
the transparent and smooth movement of goods throughout the supply 
chain. This transparency helps owner-operators when brokers send them 
bills regarding disputed claims, such as damages. Without this 
information, it is impossible to know if these charges are legitimate. 
Unfortunately, many brokers deliberately implement hurdles they know 
will prevent a carrier from ever seeing this information.
    To ensure that truckers have access to the documents they have a 
right to review under existing regulations, OOIDA petitioned FMCSA to 
require brokers to automatically provide an electronic copy of each 
transaction record within 48 hours after the contractual service has 
been completed, and explicitly prohibit brokers from including any 
provision in their contracts that requires a carrier to waive their 
rights to access the transaction records as required by existing 
regulations.
    In March 2023, FMCSA announced it would launch a rulemaking to 
address our petition. Yet, the proposal is not expected until October 
2024. If rules are promulgated to improve broker transparency and DOT 
better enforces current regulations, the economic stability of the 
trucking industry would be more assured and the reliability of our 
supply chain would improve.
                          Underride Protection
    Underride crashes are accidents where a passenger vehicle travels 
under a semi-trailer in a truck-involved crash. While these types of 
accidents are very rare, they are truly tragic and forever alter the 
lives of the individuals and families involved.
    OOIDA supported NHTSA's 2022 Final Rule improving rear guard 
standards and annual inspection requirements, which was required by 
IIJA. However, professional drivers have numerous concerns about 
mandating side underride equipment. OOIDA has discussed operational 
challenges regarding rail-crossings, loading docks, and low ground 
clearances with Congress, as well as equipment damage resulting from 
curbs, roundabouts, speed bumps, and other highway features.
    IIJA also required DOT to establish the Advisory Committee on 
Underride Protection (ACUP) to study underride crashes and provide 
recommendations on how to reduce injuries and fatalities from these 
crashes. Congress purposefully required that the committee include a 
diverse membership, including trucking companies, truckers, 
manufacturers, as well as safety advocates. In establishing this 
committee, DOT specifically tasked the panel with providing, ``written 
consensus advice to the Secretary on underride protection to reduce 
underride crashes and fatalities.'' Congress and DOT intended that this 
committee find broad areas of agreement among stakeholders and develop 
practical recommendations for their consideration.
    ACUP failed spectacularly in its mission. In short, safety 
advocates and other biased committee members used their slim numerical 
advantage on the committee to redefine ``consensus'' to mean a simple 
majority. Once this change was made, a bare majority of committee 
members issued its ``majority'' report, which is essentially a 
haphazard compilation of safety advocates' unrealistic wishes. 
Recommendations included in the majority report completely ignore the 
legitimate concerns of other committee participants--concerns that are 
informed by data, testing, and real-world experience. Because of the 
committee's failings, dissenting members were compelled to issue a 
``minority'' ACUP report.
    NHTSA's most recent research once again found that the costs of a 
side underride guard mandate would significantly outweigh the benefits. 
Just last year, NHTSA estimated equipping new trailers and semitrailers 
with side underride guards would be six to eight times the 
corresponding estimated safety benefits, even when omitting all of the 
associated feasibility costs. These updated findings, along with the 
dissenting reports produced by the ACUP, indicate that the development 
of performance standards for side underride guards, or a mandate that 
trucks be fitted with this equipment, remains unwarranted. The NHTSA 
rulemaking process, coupled with the activity of the advisory 
committee, represents a massive waste of government time and resources 
pursuing a regulation that is entirely untenable.
    Neither Congress nor NHTSA should advance potential new underride 
standards until further research and analysis are completed. The only 
recommendations that garnered true consensus support among ACUP panel 
members generally involved enhancing research and reporting. As such, 
these are the only elements of the final report Congress and NHTSA 
should take seriously.
                      Entry-Level Driver Training
    Too many new drivers are still getting behind the wheel without the 
basic skills needed to safely operate a CMV--even after Entry-Level 
Driver Training (ELDT) regulations have been in place for two-plus 
years. This will not change until the ELDT rule is supplemented to 
include more comprehensive standards, such as a minimum number of hours 
of behind-the-wheel training. The insufficient ELDT regulations are 
failing new drivers when they encounter unfamiliar conditions, 
scenarios, and other challenges that weren't included in their limited 
training. This presents serious safety concerns. We encourage FMCSA to 
share findings from the pending agency review of the ELDT trainer 
registry to determine what degree ELDT regulatory objectives have been 
met and how regulations can be improved. Strengthening ELDT 
requirements is a no-brainer to improving driver retention and reducing 
truck-related crashes.
                Commercial Driver's License Flexibility
    Instead of focusing on enhancing driver training, FMCSA has 
astonishingly proposed to waive certain training provisions and CDL 
regulations. Most notably, the agency intends to remove safety 
requirements for a CDL holder to accompany a commercial learner's 
permit (CLP) holder when the CLP driver is behind-the-wheel. This 
regulation is designed to ensure that inexperienced drivers will have 
sufficient training, instruction, and oversight as they learn the job. 
Given that ELDT standards do not contain a minimum number of behind-
the-wheel training hours, we believe it would be unwise to eliminate 
this requirement since it provides new entrants at least some 
additional driving experience with a more tenured trucker. FMCSA had 
previously noted that, ``safety considerations outweigh convenience 
during driver training,'' but is now seemingly accommodating a petition 
from large motor carriers based on the false premise of a driver 
``shortage.''
    Rather than proposing ways to expedite the CDL training and 
administration processes, FMCSA must focus on solutions to address high 
turnover rates by bolstering driver training programs. We strongly 
oppose any rulemakings or legislation that would reduce or roll back 
existing CDL testing and administration requirements.
  Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles--Phase 3
    Clean air is a priority for everyone, including the truckers, but 
emissions requirements for heavy-duty vehicles should be practical, 
affordable, and reliable. Unfortunately, EPA has continued their 
regulatory blitz on small-business truckers with their latest rule 
establishing Phase 3 Greenhouse Gas Emission standards. Mom-and-pop 
trucking businesses would be suffocated by the sheer cost and 
operational challenges of effectively mandating zero-emission trucks 
beginning in Model Years 2030-2032. The Phase 3 rule attempts to rush 
production of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) while a national 
charging infrastructure network remains absent for heavy-duty trucks. 
Professional drivers are skeptical of BEV costs, mileage range, battery 
weight and safety, charging time, and availability.
    OOIDA has joined with groups across dozens of industries to raise 
concerns about the feasibility of the Phase 3 Final Rule. We believe 
enacting H.J. Res. 133 is the best course of action to defeat this 
misguided environmental mandate.
                        Truck Leasing Task Force
    OOIDA has supported DOT's role in administering the Truck Leasing 
Task Force (TLTF). Section 23009 of IIJA established TLTF to examine 
the terms, conditions, and equitability of common truck leasing 
arrangements, particularly as they impact owner-operators. During their 
series of meetings beginning in July 2023, TLTF has particularly 
focused on predatory lease-purchase agreements. Predatory truck leasing 
schemes are another longstanding problem within in the industry. 
Carriers and leasing entities peddling these ``opportunities'' 
typically offer the false promise of fair compensation, future 
ownership of the truck, and ``independence'' from employer-employee 
requirements. While the purported goal of these agreements is for the 
driver to own the truck and become a full-fledged owner-operator at the 
end of the lease, the agreements rarely work out that way. In the end, 
drivers are paid pennies on the dollar with little chance of owning the 
truck, and zero independence. This system pushes individuals who desire 
a career in trucking out of the industry and further contributes to 
driver churn. Additionally, the financial and personal pressures 
resulting from escalating debt can create highway safety risks.
    We anticipate that TLTF's report to Congress, DOT, and the 
Department of Labor, which is expected in November 2024, will include a 
number of consensus recommendations to overhaul the lease-purchase 
model, create necessary regulatory oversight, and protect drivers from 
undue financial exploitation.
                            Predatory Towing
    The towing and recovery industry is an essential partner to 
trucking that provides a critical service when truckers have a 
breakdown or are involved in a crash. Yet the very nature of these 
situations leaves motor carriers vulnerable to unscrupulous towing 
companies. Predatory towing happens when a company imposes excessive or 
unnecessary charges for equipment, services, damages, or anything else 
the company dreams up. After a tow, motor carriers will often have 
their equipment held hostage until they pay these exorbitant and 
superfluous fees.
    Predatory towing and fees are a particular problem with respect to 
nonconsensual tows. These are situations where a truck breaks down or 
is involved in a crash, and the truck owner does not have any power to 
select a towing company for recovery. In these cases, the trucker is at 
the mercy of the responding company, and has no way of knowing whether 
they will be dealing with an honest tow service.
    Unfortunately, predatory practices aren't limited to a small 
segment of overall towing services. In a recent survey conducted by the 
American Transportation Research Institute, they found that 
approximately 30% of crash related tows included some form of predatory 
billing.\1\ This same survey found that the average pre-tax total for a 
crash-related tow was approximately $9,000, while the average predatory 
bill was over $18,000.\2\

    OOIDA is supportive of FMCSA's efforts to combat these unfair and 
unnecessary fees. In February 2024, FMCSA submitted comments to the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in response to its proposed rulemaking 
on Unfair or Deceptive Fees, also known sometimes as ``junk fees.'' In 
its comments, FMCSA accurately identified a number of predatory 
practices, including \3\:

FTC%20FMCSA%20Comment
%202.7.24.pdf
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <bullet>  Towing companies that provide an initial quote for a tow, 
but then add additional, mandatory fees only after the job is 
completed.
    <bullet>  Towing companies that add vague or misleading fees, such 
as ``administrative fees,'' that add no value or are completely 
unnecessary.
    <bullet>  Towing companies that simply charge excessive fees 
because they have a captive customer.

    We agree with FMCSA's comments that the FTC should act to prohibit 
misleading or hidden fees, ensure clarity around the definition of 
``total price,'' and impose restrictions on excessive fees, among other 
recommendations.
    In addition to these comments, FMCSA has also initiated a public 
process (FMCSA-2024-0124) to collect more information on predatory 
towing practices. The agency has held a public meeting on the issue, 
and is also accepting written comments through July 31, 2024. We are 
supportive of these efforts and hope that it will guide both the FTC 
and FMCSA on how to crack down on these unfair practices.
                                 DataQ
    FMCSA allows motor carriers, truck drivers, and others to request a 
review of FMCSA-issued data, such as violations and inspection reports, 
that might be incomplete or incorrect. This is commonly referred to as 
a Request for Data Review, or DataQ. States have the authority to 
establish their own review process, and unfortunately, nearly all of 
them have chosen a system that does not provide due process for truck 
drivers or motor carriers.
    In most cases, the DataQ review process is not objective--an appeal 
determination is made by the same person or agency who issued the 
violation, which creates an inherent conflict of interest. In other 
words, very few law enforcement officers are willing to admit they made 
a mistake. Furthermore, determinations are not made in a timely manner. 
This is problematic because violations remain on a driver's or 
carrier's safety record and can negatively impact the employability of 
a driver and insurance costs for small motor carriers, among other 
consequences. We have had members spend thousands of dollars in legal 
fees over the course of many months just to have an obvious mistake 
corrected.
    OOIDA supports the development and implementation of a federal 
DataQ appeals process that would provide transparency, consistency, and 
timely adjudication of challenges. We are therefore appreciative that 
the FMCSA has initiated a request for comments on improvements to the 
DataQ system (FMCSA-2023-0190). As FMCSA considers modifications, we 
believe the agency must establish a system where each reconsideration 
request is addressed by a different reviewer than the person who 
performed the initial review. This change will help to ensure a fair 
review, as the individual who issued the violation is unlikely to 
overturn their decision. We believe this change will also help to 
improve the initial citation process, since the issuing officer knows 
that any decisions they make will be subject to review by a different 
person, possibly a superior.
    Ideally, OOIDA supports a model that would allow states to setup a 
five-member review board made up of two representatives of a state 
commercial motor vehicle enforcement agency, one representative of a 
state department of transportation, one representative of a motor 
carrier, and one representative of a driver. FMCSA has already 
identified states that use such a system and has recommended this as a 
best practice that other states should follow.\4\

                  National Consumer Complaint Database
    The National Consumer Complaint Database (NCCDB) is a system that 
is used by truckers and others to report when motor carriers violate 
safety regulations. FMCSA is responsible for this system, and 
unfortunately, many truckers find it nearly useless and have little 
confidence FMCSA takes action on any of the complaints they submit.
    This system is critical for promoting safety, as it can help FMCSA 
identify carriers that might be pressuring drivers to violate federal 
hours-of-service or equipment maintenance regulations, among other 
concerns. Drivers need an effective system to help them protect 
themselves from carriers looking to take advantage of them and 
jeopardize safety. Not only is the system supposed to address 
individual violations, the findings from examining complaints could be 
used to identify trends or larger problems in trucking.
    Congress recognized the concerns with the NCCDB and, as part of 
IIJA, required that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) examine 
the system and evaluate its effectiveness. GAO completed and issued its 
report in September 2023, and some of the most concerning findings

    <bullet>  In contrast with DOT policy, FMCSA fails to make certain 
information from NCCDB public. This means that FMCSA may be ``missing 
the opportunity to improve transparency and collaboration with industry 
partners.''
    <bullet>  FMCSA has failed to establish appropriate controls or 
procedures for collecting and investigating complaints. As a result, 
FMCSA may not be consistently carrying out reviews and may be 
jeopardizing their ability to respond to unsafe practices by motor 
carriers.
    <bullet>  FMCSA's public website failed to follow leading practices 
for design and usability. Truckers have long complained that the site 
is difficult to use, especially on a mobile device, and GAO confirmed 
this specific concern.

    GAO made a total of 14 recommendations to improve the system, all 
of which remain open today. One of the most frustrating parts of GAO's 
report is that, despite identifying these serious issues, FMCSA isn't 
demonstrating any urgency to fix them. In response to the finding that 
the agency has failed to implement controls and procedures to ensure 
appropriate review of complaints, FMCSA said that it planned to update 
the NCCDB in Fiscal Year 2026. This is beyond discouraging for truckers 
who have long complained about the system. Truckers are properly held 
to the highest standard when it comes to safety and compliance with 
regulations. Yet when the federal government finds that one of its own 
agencies is failing to live up to the standards necessary to promote 
safety, it's apparently acceptable to tell truckers they'll just have 
to wait a few more years until they get around to fixing the problem.
    More generally, OOIDA maintains its concerns about the ambiguity of 
the name ``National Consumer Complaint Database.'' This title is 
misleading and does not signify a connection to the trucking industry 
in any way. OOIDA believes the NCCDB can help improve safety, but many 
drivers are unaware that the NCCDB is available for them to report 
violations of regulations, nor are they aware that coercion complaints 
can be handled through the NCCDB. We have long called for FMCSA to 
change the name of this system, to something such as ``National Truck 
Safety Hotline and Consumer Complaint Database,'' but FMCSA has 
consistently rejected this suggestion without explanation.
                      Minimum Liability Insurance
    According to the most recent federal research, the current required 
minimum level of liability insurance for motor carriers covers damages 
in 99.4% of crashes involving a CMV. If there were any other federal 
regulation that covered over 99% of cases, it's hard to imagine that 
there'd be any discussion of a need for a change.
    Yet, there are members on this committee that want to increase the 
minimum insurance level by over 500%, from the current level of 
$750,000 to $5,000,000. This increase would cause insurance premiums to 
skyrocket and would be absolutely devastating for small businesses. 
It's unlikely that small carriers could afford this increase, and many 
would be forced out of business. As a way to afford this increase, some 
truckers may cut back on maintenance and repair costs, which 
jeopardizes the safety of their operations.
    There is simply no need for this increase. There is no evidence 
that increasing insurance requirements will improve safety. There is no 
data showing that the current levels fail to cover the costs of 
crashes. In fact, the average crash costs only $18,000 in damages. This 
Subcommittee and Congress should reject calls for increasing minimum 
insurance requirements.
             Autonomous Vehicles/Automated Driving Systems
    Rampant speculation continues to grow regarding potential benefits 
of autonomous driving technologies. This is in large part because there 
is a complete lack of federal regulatory oversight on these 
technologies and the companies working to develop them. Despite 
unfounded forecasts and empty promises that automated vehicles will 
lead to zero deaths, there continue to be real-world situations in 
which automation has devastatingly failed. Unfortunately, current 
voluntary reporting requirements leave truckers and the public in the 
dark about the safety and reliability of autonomous technologies. OOIDA 
is frequently asked what truckers think about the development of 
autonomous technology and what it means for the future of their 
profession. To be frank: there's not a whole lot we can say about how 
the technology is performing or what exactly it means for truckers. We 
can only presume these vehicles are not ready for safe deployment 
without mandatory reporting on performance. OOIDA believes that any 
process to advance automated technology should be met with mandatory 
data transparency from manufacturers. This will help educate consumers, 
the industry, and regulators about the actual reliability of autonomous 
technology.
    Over the last several years, DOT agencies have pursued respective 
rulemakings to ``ensure'' the safe introduction of ADS-equipped CMVs 
onto the nation's roadways. Many of the questions included in these 
proposals remain hypothetical in nature and OOIDA has questioned why 
DOT has chosen to focus on regulations that may or may not be necessary 
depending how the technology performs. These regulatory proposals seem 
destined to fail without more concrete data about how AVs will function 
and their impact on the industry.
                               Conclusion
    Unfortunately, many of today's regulations are excessive and lack 
any connection to safety or are deliberately designed to inflict 
unnecessary costs and burdens on operators, especially small 
businesses, to reduce or eliminate competition. At their best, federal 
regulations can help achieve worthy and complementary objectives: 
promoting highway safety and supporting professional drivers and small 
business truckers. Congress and DOT must better prioritize regulatory 
reforms that clearly meet these important objectives.

    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Pugh. Ms. Osborne, you are 
recognized.

TESTIMONY OF BETH OSBORNE, DIRECTOR, TRANSPORTATION FOR AMERICA 
                          (T4AMERICA)

    Ms. Osborne. Thank you, Chairman Crawford and Ranking 
Member Norton, for inviting me to today's hearing. As a former 
staffer for a T&I member, it is really fun to be here for once.
    I am the director of Transportation for America. Our vision 
is a transportation system that connects people to jobs and 
essential services no matter how they travel, no matter a 
person's financial means or their physical ability. My team 
works with States and localities across the country that have 
the same vision.
    We analyze trends in the transportation system and current 
investments, and we have consistently found a gap between what 
the taxpayers are promised and what is delivered through the 
surface transportation program. The current approach allows 
agencies to prioritize expansion at the expense of repair, 
permits roadway designs that have proven dangerous, and puts 
people farther away from the places they need to go.
    What is frustrating to me, who has been part of five 
reauthorizations and is gearing up for my sixth, is that very 
failure is often the rallying cry for more money to be poured 
into the same programs. This is a country of such creativity 
and innovation, yet we apply so little of it to the surface 
transportation program. I want to see that change.
    Congress has given transportation agencies very broad 
latitude but has not provided new tools, clear goals, or 
accountability to the taxpayer. For example, States and 
metropolitan planning organizations are required to set targets 
for the number and rate of roadway fatalities and serious 
injuries, including a target for the number of nonmotorized 
fatalities and serious injuries.
    In our latest report on the danger that those walking face 
on our roadways, ``Dangerous by Design,'' we found that 13 
States are currently setting a target for more fatalities and 
serious injuries than the year before. Even if they exceed that 
elevated target, there is no real penalty.
    There is another category it targets that Congress calls 
``performance'' of the National Highway System, an undefined 
and extremely broad term. U.S. DOT has included greenhouse gas 
emissions as one of those performance targets. What happens if 
a State misses their targets? Not a thing.
    Some claim that under this rule, there will never be 
another highway built or expanded. But in Colorado, they have a 
more powerful regulation that requires projects that increase 
emissions to be paired with projects that will counter that 
increase. Guess what? They are building and expanding highways 
in Colorado.
    Also, interestingly, our research finds that greenhouse gas 
emissions from transportation overwhelmingly come from urban 
areas. More rural States are actually doing quite well.
    In general, we should not be just setting targets at all 
but also rewarding agencies for performing well and providing 
greater direction and support for those failing to progress. On 
individual projects, agencies make big promises, but rarely 
have to look back and see whether or not the projects they have 
built performed as intended. Imagine what we could learn and 
improve if we did.
    Back to safety. We have already heard the safety numbers, I 
believe, from Ranking Member Larsen. But in 2022, 46,027 people 
died in motor vehicle crashes compared to 32,782 in 2012, 10 
years before. That is a trend that is not only awful, it is at 
odds with our peer nations.
    One reason for that is we have a one-size-fits-all approach 
to designing our major roadways. We built the interstate system 
to accommodate high-speed vehicle movement because we knew it 
was impossible to do so safely on our surface roads due to 
conflict: street parking, cross-streets, driveways, and people.
    But over the last 7 years, we have brought interstate 
speeds to many of our surface roads. Speed and conflict are a 
dangerous combination. Even at the speed limit, speeds are 
often too high for a driver to see and anticipate a conflict 
and react. When a driver inevitably fails, we blame them. We 
can certainly provide and prepare drivers more to behave safely 
and penalize those that don't. But if we had better roadway 
design, we wouldn't have to. Certainly, not as much.
    And if Congress and the agencies funded by Congress 
participated more in safer design of our system, the users of 
it might not chafe as much at being regulated themselves. We 
could also make personal vehicle designs safer, getting rid of 
preposterous problems like big front blind spots. We all have a 
role to play.
    I know I sound negative, but it is because I know we can do 
so much better. I hope we can talk about using guidance and 
regulation in a way that would support better outcomes and more 
accountability.
    Thanks again for having me, and I look forward to hearing 
your ideas and receiving your questions.
    [Ms. Osborne's prepared statement follows:]

                                 <F-dash>
   Prepared Statement of Beth Osborne, Director, Transportation for 
                          America (T4America)
    Thank you, Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Norton for inviting 
me to today's hearing. I am the director of Transportation for America, 
the transportation arm of Smart Growth America. My team's mission is a 
transportation system that connects people to jobs and essential 
services by all modes of travel, no matter people's financial means or 
physical ability. We do our work through direct technical assistance, 
research and analysis of the existing transportation system, and policy 
advocacy. In my role, I also manage the National Complete Streets 
Coalition, an Arts & Culture in transportation program, and a 
partnership with the University of Wisconsin's State Smart 
Transportation Initiative.
    My team is currently working with states and localities across the 
country that share our goals. That work includes reviewing procedures, 
standards, regulations and performance measures of state departments of 
transportation, from Florida to Michigan, to modernize them and ensure 
they are protective of all users. We also conduct trainings and assist 
states and localities in using low-cost, quick-build demonstration 
projects to test out new interventions for improving safety, most 
recently in 10 communities in Alaska, California, Connecticut, and 
Tennessee.
    We analyze trends in the transportation system and the results of 
our current investment approach to transportation. We use that 
information to identify and advocate for needed policy changes. Our 
analyses have found a sizable gap between what the taxpayers are 
promised by their elected leaders and what is delivered through the 
bipartisan surface transportation program: the current transportation 
funding system allows states to prioritize expansion over maintaining 
the roads they already have; utilize the same approach to roadway 
design that has made America's roads the most deadly in the developed 
world; and puts people farther away from the places they need to go, 
stymying access to opportunity.
    Every time Congress begins its efforts to reauthorize the surface 
transportation program, we hear about the need to rebuild crumbling 
roads and bridges, improve roadway safety, and save people time by 
reducing congestion (as if there is no other way to do it). Eventually 
Congress, on a bipartisan basis, puts substantially more money in the 
same structure of programs that has existed since 1991, and that bill 
is signed by presidents of both parties. Congress and the president 
compliment themselves and talk about how more money in the same 
programs that led to the current predicament will lead to different 
results.
    They don't. Five to seven years later, we start that process over, 
pointing to the same problems that were supposed to be fixed or at 
least improved by the last reauthorization. Our failure to address our 
stated goals is pointed to as the reason why more money is needed for 
the same programs--rinse and repeat--as if that's the best we can do 
for the taxpayer.
    I am old enough to have participated in five such cycles. I've 
watched this cycle for longer than most people on this committee have 
been in Congress, except Ranking Member Norton. It is frustrating 
watching us enthusiastically spend hundreds of billions of dollars for 
poor results and never consider we need to try a different tack.
    Our safety results are abysmal. According to the National Safety 
Council, roadway deaths decreased 2% in 2022--but that was following an 
11% increase in 2021 and an 8%increase in 2020. In 2022, 46,027 people 
died in motor-vehicle crashes compared to 46,980 in 2021 and 42,338 in 
2020.
    The United States has the most dangerous roads of all the developed 
nations. According to the International Transport Forum, an 
intergovernmental organization with 69 member countries from Albania to 
Uzbekistan, between 2012 and 2022, road deaths increased by 1.5% in the 
35 countries with validated data. But then they actually include this 
sentence in their roadway safety report: ``If US data are excluded, 
overall road deaths in IRTAD countries fell by 14%.'' The US is single-
handedly dragging the performance of the developed world down on 
roadway safety.

    Across those same countries, pedestrian fatalities decreased by 
27.3%. But not in the United States. Our analysis of roadway danger for 
those walking on American roadways based on data from the National 
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, called Dangerous by Design, 
found that pedestrian fatalities are up. In fact, there has been a 75 
percent increase in the number of people struck and killed while 
walking since 2010. Danger outside of a vehicle is getting consistently 
worse: The share of all traffic deaths that were people outside of 
vehicles hit the highest share in 40 years. Those 7,522 deaths are 
roughly the equivalent to more than three Boeing 737s full of people 
falling from the sky every month for a year. Because of how we design 
our roads, danger for people walking goes up when driving is up and 
when driving is down.

    What about repairing our crumbling roads and bridges? The last time 
we looked at the state of repair of our roads, we found that while more 
money is being spent, it is not necessarily going to repair. In our 
report with Taxpayers for Common Sense, Repair Priorities, we found 
that states were spending as much on roadway expansion as repair and, 
as a result, between 2009 and 2017, the percentage of the roads 
nationwide in poor condition increased from 14 to 20 percent.
    These investments in expansion don't just redirect funds away from 
much-needed investments in repair; they continually grow our annual 
spending needs, widening the gap. Every new lane-mile of road costs 
approximately $24,000 per year to preserve in a state of good repair. 
By expanding roads, we are borrowing against the future. But the 
failure to invest in existing infrastructure and the decision to build 
more roads we can't afford to maintain are held up as reasons to take 
more money from the taxpayer (or increase the national debt).
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


    The Washington Post took a look at the issue in 2021 and found the 
same trend continuing: ``Infrastructure plan calls for fixing the 
nation's existing roads. Some states are still focused on expansion.'' 
Thankfully, they were able to get the Federal Highway Administration to 
give them significantly more current data than they made available to 
the public and to us. My organization is looking at the spending under 
the IIJA and finding that these same spending trends continue into 
today. We will release our full findings in September, but our 
preliminary findings have already been made public.
    We hear that the country must build more roads and expand roadways 
in spite of our lack of willingness to pay to keep them up because of 
the terrible congestion on our roadways. But our ``solution'' to 
congestion does not work. The United States has spent decades and 
hundreds of billions of dollars widening and building new highways. We 
added 30,511 new freeway lane-miles of road in the largest 100 
urbanized areas between 1993 and 2017, an increase of 42 percent. That 
rate of freeway expansion significantly outstripped the 32 percent 
growth in population in those regions over the same time period. Yet 
this strategy has utterly failed to solve the problem at hand--delay is 
up in those urbanized areas by a staggering 144 percent--as we show in 
our report, The Congestion Con. Congestion is worse in all 100 cities, 
whether the population has increased or decreased, regardless of how 
much new roadway capacity was built.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


    What we are doing makes travel more expensive in terms of the 
actual cost of transportation and in terms of the amount of time needed 
to travel. Our focus on more and more highways has pushed development 
further out and spread it further apart. This makes trips longer so 
that even if they are faster, it is at best, a wash. In an analysis 
Transportation for America did with Third Way, we found household trips 
for commuting and other necessary tasks in 2017 were significantly 
longer on average than they were in 2001, 10 percent longer in urban 
areas and 12 percent in rural areas.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


    While rural trips have increased in length, rural travel per capita 
has not--which means people in rural America are likely giving up some 
trips. People have a finite budget for travel in terms of money and 
time.
    If you have come this far with me, you may be wondering what this 
has to do with regulation. The point is that the federal spending and 
what we get for it is not regulated nor is there much oversight. There 
is very little transparency into where funding is allocated and there 
is rarely a report on whether a project delivered any of the benefits 
that were promised.
    Just to analyze federal awards and what they're being spent on 
without a massive team, my team had to use AI to get through the 
federal spending information and, even then, we found that some states' 
reporting on their spending was very hard to understand. State 
reporting on their own spending is often even harder to parse.
    Yet when the Federal Highway Administrator writes an unenforceable 
internal memo suggesting that the agency encourage states to use their 
authority to repair existing infrastructure and reduce emissions, some 
on Capitol Hill get very, very upset. If USDOT includes in their 
performance management regulation that states must set targets to 
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (something most of them claim 
will happen in their environmental documents for individual projects), 
there is a lawsuit fighting it. This is in spite of the fact that there 
is no penalty for failing to hit a target the states set for 
themselves.
    Actually, that is the case across the board. States get the same 
amount of money if they produce great results or terrible results, 
whether they hit their targets or not. As we point out in Dangerous by 
Design, 13 states have set targets for more people to be killed or 
injured while walking. There is no penalty for this, even if they 
exceed their elevated targets.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]


    Where USDOT and FHWA do regulate, it often stifles innovation and 
stands in the way of efficiency, quality of life, public health, and 
the economy. And yet, this gets little-to-no attention on Capitol Hill. 
When we work with our partners at the state and local level, the street 
design engineers regularly cite federal rules and standards as the 
reason they cannot narrow lane widths, add color in the roadway, or 
slow traffic speeds. The current default approach to determining 
whether a new pedestrian crossing should be added requires a certain 
number of people to jaywalk to prove demand. If pedestrians proving the 
need for a crossing are hit, they will likely get blamed for 
jaywalking. It would be like requiring people to swim across a river to 
justify a bridge and then blaming people who drown or need a rescue.
    This strange relationship with safety can be seen everywhere. 
Elected leaders and those running transportation agencies love to say 
that safety is their highest priority. We talk about the safe systems 
approach, which requires education, enforcement, and design changes. 
Design change should be at the top of that list. However, just 
designing the roadway to make going the speed limit feel most 
comfortable is hard to do. We have standards that insist on adding 
wiggle room in case people exceed the speed limit, which is exactly 
what they do when that wiggle room is provided. Wider lanes and roads 
with building set back sends a strong message for drivers to go faster.
    Two interesting things in this space. First, our procedure for 
designing roadways and speed limits results in raising speed limits if 
enough people speed. So, if we design the roadway for people who might 
speed and they do, we will raise the speed limit for them. Second, 
while this design is considered auto-centric, it is actually quite 
hostile to drivers, and we all know it on some level. Everyone knows of 
roads that feel like you should be able to drive faster than the speed 
limit allows, We even have a term for that: a speed trap.
    If we designed our roadways to get the behavior we wanted, we would 
not need as much education on how to use them or rely as heavily on 
enforcement. Instead of addressing design failures, we blame drivers 
and pedestrians for their behavior--drivers for going above the speed 
limit but adhering to the design speed of the roadway, and pedestrians 
for crossing where there is no marked crossing because they haven't 
crossed enough there to prove the need for one.
    Congress and USDOT have relied more heavily on regulating vehicle 
design, commercial drivers, and supporting police enforcement. There is 
a group that chafes at all of these options. Each group will tell us to 
trust roadway designers, vehicle designers, and drivers. That is what 
we have been doing. That's why our results are so bad, why we are being 
shown up by Chile, Serbia, and Hungary.
    If safety is a priority (not even the top priority) then everyone 
is going to have to be a part of it, and that will mean having some 
constraints and inconveniences. DOTs will need to update roadway design 
approaches, vehicle manufacturers will have to design safer vehicles 
and drivers will have to be more attentive and drive more slowly. That 
means, we cannot just say why one idea is wrong. We need to talk about 
what we are going to do to get better results for the taxpayer and 
traveling public.
    I thank you for your time and look forward to the committee 
discussion and questions.

    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Ms. Osborne.
    Prior to beginning Member questioning, I would like to make 
our witness panel aware that votes are anticipated to be called 
at 10:30 a.m. this morning. If this occurs, the subcommittee 
may enter into a brief recess. However, witnesses should be 
prepared to resume the hearing when the subcommittee 
reconvenes.
    Again, thank you all for your testimony. I will now turn to 
questions from the panel. I recognize myself to begin.
    Mr. Duit, in your written testimony, you outlined the 
American Road & Transportation Builders Association's 
opposition to the Federal Highway Administration's final rule 
to create a greenhouse gas performance measure. In addition to 
citing the administration's lack of statutory authority to 
promulgate such a regulation, your testimony says, quote, 
``This rule could impinge on State flexibility to select 
projects,'' end quote.
    Could you expand on that and explain to this subcommittee 
what that means and what's at stake here?
    Mr. Duit. Yes, sir. Thank you, Chairman Crawford.
    The rule requires State and local agencies to plan projects 
that meet the intended greenhouse gas goals or, at a minimum, 
contribute to declining greenhouse gas targets. This means that 
States and other transportation agencies may need to prioritize 
certain types of projects over others if they do not align with 
the prescribed GHG reduction targets.
    The concern is that this could lead to a misallocation of 
resources, hinder State-specific transportation needs, and 
undermine the flexibility that States have traditionally 
enjoyed in selecting and prioritizing transportation projects.
    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Duit. As cochair of the 
Congressional Steel Caucus, it is important to me that this 
country has strong Buy America standards in place and supports 
the domestic production of steel as well as other construction 
materials. The Buy Clean initiative encourages manufacturers to 
adopt cleaner, low-carbon processes, and publish environmental 
product declarations or EPDs.
    Mr. Bell, I have heard from constituents that there is 
confusion surrounding the Department's rollout of its low-
carbon transportation materials program and no final decision 
on what the material requirements would be.
    Does the SMA have concerns with that program?
    Mr. Bell. Thank you, Congressman Crawford, and we 
appreciate your leadership and support of the steel industry.
    Yes. The SMA has serious problems with it because it is not 
clear as to where we are going to end up here. You have one 
approach that is being adopted by the General Services 
Administration, and then you have Federal Highway that, to 
their credit, is taking a more collaborative approach and 
working with industry and other subject matter experts to 
determine what their Buy Clean policy will be.
    The fact of the matter is, there should be existing EPDs 
for various product categories. And if you have the right EPD, 
it will show you what the emissions is and whether the steel is 
clean or not.
    Mr. Crawford. Thank you, Mr. Bell. I will yield the balance 
of my time and recognize Ranking Member Norton.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Pugh, in your testimony, you expressed your strong 
support for a bipartisan bill that I sponsored with Congressman 
Ezell. H.R. 8505, the Household Goods Shipping Consumer 
Protection Act, restores the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration's authority to issue civil penalties against bad 
actors and enhances registration criteria.
    How would this bill benefit small-business truckers and 
root out fraudulent actors in the freight industry?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes. Thank you, Ranking Member.
    Yes. This would be very helpful to our industry. Small-
business carriers, it is almost at a crisis level now with 
brokers and fraud. And what we can see from this is, it would 
give FMCSA some teeth to go after these bad actors and these 
fraudsters, because that is one thing that they are lacking. 
This is the first step to give it.
    Secondly, motor carriers forever have been required to have 
a physical address. These fraudsters and these brokers have not 
been. This will make brokers and these folks have to have a 
physical address, which every one of my members that I have 
seen that has gotten hit with one of these fraudsters has been 
at like a UPS box or some sort of fake mailbox or something 
like that.
    We firmly believe that some of this stuff is even coming 
from other countries across the globe. So, yes, this is a very 
good bill, and we much appreciate your support in bringing this 
forward to help our members. Thank you.
    Ms. Norton. Thank you. Ms. Osborne, far too many people are 
dying on our roadways. Your testimony highlights that the 
United States has the worst road safety statistics compared to 
every other developed nation.
    How do the regulations governing road design and traffic 
control limit our ability to build safer and more accessible 
roads?
    Ms. Osborne. I appreciate that question. I will start by 
stealing from my friend and colleague at Strong Towns, Chuck 
Marohn, who wrote a book I highly recommend called, 
``Confessions of a Recovering Engineer,'' who points out that 
we try to make our roadways do everything, and, therefore, they 
kind of do everything poorly.
    If we want a roadway to accommodate high-speed travel by 
vehicles, we need to regulate all points of entrance and exit. 
We need to clear that roadway of vulnerable users and of 
development. There shouldn't be cross-roads, there shouldn't be 
parking, there shouldn't be driveways.
    If we want that roadway to be servicing of local businesses 
and neighborhoods, there are going to be lots of conflict 
points and, therefore, speeds need to be slow.
    We try to do a hybrid of the two where we have high speed 
and conflict, and that leads to deadly conflict and 
consequences.
    We also should set speed limits based on the speed we want 
to see and design the roadway accordingly rather than the way 
we do it now, which is we provide wiggle room so that people, 
if they do speed, can more safely do so, meaning that if they 
lose control of their vehicle, that they have wiggle room.
    That added space encourages speeding. And then when enough 
people speed, we raise the speed limit. That is backwards.
    And while there has been recent flexibility for States and 
transportation agencies to do something different, there has 
been no guidance. So, you can choose the traditional way where 
there is a lot of guidance, or you can make things up on your 
own. That is just not the right way to go about creating safe 
design.
    Finally, I will say we need to reward those that make 
progress in safety and manage those who are not doing well, set 
more limitations on how they spend their dollars and make them 
be more accountable for it. We definitely should not spend $50 
billion a year for these bad results.
    Ms. Norton. Ms. Osborne, your testimony also discusses the 
lack of accountability and transparency in the Federal Highway 
program. You note that even nonbinding information-gathering 
efforts are fought in the courts and in the Congress.
    Can you discuss the need for greater accountability and 
transparency and how States spend taxpayer dollars?
    Ms. Osborne. Yes. I will just say quickly that we have done 
polling that shows a break in people's faith in what the 
surface transportation program produces, and that is because of 
past failures and lack of accountability. And if we want to be 
able to put more money into this program, we are going to have 
to close that gap.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentlewoman's time has expired. The 
gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Stauber.
    Mr. Stauber. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I wanted to 
take just a couple minutes of my time.
    Mr. Bell, in your statements you say the steel industry is 
a wonderful and glorious industry that has built careers, 
companies, communities, cities, and even civilizations.
    You still agree with that statement?
    Mr. Bell. Yes.
    Mr. Stauber. Further down in that same paragraph, you say, 
``modernization and further decarbonization of America's steel 
industry, which is already the cleanest in the world.''
    Do you still agree with that statement?
    Mr. Bell. Yes.
    Mr. Stauber. Okay. Do you know which district I represent 
in Minnesota?
    Mr. Bell. Yes. You are in the Iron Range, aren't you, 
Congressman Stauber?
    Mr. Stauber. I am. I am. Mr. Bell, I am extremely offended 
at your comments here today in your written statements. Trying 
to reduce the steelmaking of the blast furnaces. I can assure 
you, if we had a representative of U.S. Steel in Cleveland-
Cliffs, they would disagree with you vehemently.
    We built communities on the Iron Range. Our steelmaking, 
our mines, are who we are and our way of life. For you to come 
to our Nation's Capital and offend the people that I represent, 
Congressman James Oberstar, the transportation director, is 
rolling over in his grave right now because you are attacking 
our steel industry in northeastern Minnesota.
    Our ports depend on it. We support the Soo locks. Other 
cities depend on it. Our steel--we need to all--we need to 
support, Mr. Bell, all domestic-making steel. Do not separate 
us. China is our adversary in steel, and you know that.
    The recycled steel that you support, do you use any 
Chinese-made recycled steel?
    Mr. Bell. No.
    Mr. Stauber. Are you sure?
    Mr. Bell. Yes.
    Mr. Stauber. One hundred percent?
    Mr. Bell. Yes.
    Mr. Stauber. One hundred percent American? Well, good for 
you. I am not sure I believe that, because China has been 
trying to take us down for a long, long time. They have tried 
to shut the Iron Range down for a long, long time.
    All domestic steel we must support. U.S. Steel at 
Cleveland-Cliffs is our backbone of northeastern Minnesota. 
They support thousands of jobs, hundreds of secondary jobs, 
$90,000- to $100,000-a-year jobs in our steelmaking industry. 
Please do not come to the United States Capitol and attack our 
way of life and attack our steel industry.
    The Iron Range helped us win two world wars. We made the 
steel that helped build America and continue to build America. 
I will not take a back seat when we talk about steel and we 
talk about mining.
    I sit here every single week to have friends on the other 
side of the aisle try to take away our mining and our way of 
life. I will not let that happen. Again, we must support all 
domestic-made steel, and that includes recycling that you 
support. And I do, too.
    Please do not allow this infighting. China is an adversary. 
They are trying to dump cheap steel in this country. We need to 
keep the tariffs on, and I know you support that. Would you 
please, please support all domestic-making steel. That means on 
the Iron Range of Minnesota. That is our way of life. Our 
communities, our jobs, our families, as you say. Our 
communities, our cities, our civilizations, as you say. It is 
our way of life. We do it better than anybody.
    The jobs and opportunities that mining present in 
northeastern Minnesota are second to none, and I will share 
this with you in my last few minutes. Minnesota has the most 
mineral wealth of any State in this Nation with the exception 
of Alaska. And it is because of our Iron Range, and we have now 
found the biggest copper nickel find in the world.
    Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Larsen.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Duit, you note in your testimony that nearly 43,000 new 
construction industry jobs have been added since 2021.
    Are you making the point that those are tied to the BIL?
    Mr. Duit. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Yes, they are. And that States 
have advanced at least one Federal-aid highway and bridge 
project in nearly every county across the country as well. That 
is your testimony, and that is a result of the BIL?
    Mr. Duit. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. And the value--you didn't testify 
to this, but it is in your written--the value of State and 
local government projects breaking ground was up year to year, 
27 percent in 2022 and another 9 percent in 2023. And that is 
as a result of the BIL?
    Mr. Duit. Yes, sir.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Sure. Great. I just want to 
underscore the point that this discussion about regulations is 
one thing, but there is another part of the truth here, is that 
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has increased investment in 
roads, bridges, highways, construction, and it has increased 
jobs in that construction. And I say that one of the reasons we 
have 4 percent unemployment or lower for the single longest 
stretch since probably my life is, in part, because of the 
investments in the BIL, and I would like to keep it going.
    So, we have got a chance to do that next year, or the next 
couple years, when we reauthorize it. So, you are making a 
great case for us to do that as we move forward, and I just--I 
want to thank you for that.
    I want to move to Ms. Osborne. Since 2012, Congress has 
focused the Federal Highway program on outcomes and set goals, 
quote, to achieve a significant reduction in traffic fatalities 
and serious injuries on all public roads and to, quote, enhance 
the performance of the transportation system while protecting 
and enhancing the natural environment. That is since 2012. That 
is according to law directly.
    But despite that investment and this renewed focus, traffic 
fatalities are, in fact, up; carbon pollution is, in fact, up; 
roadway congestion is, in fact, up.
    So, in your view, how has the administration's regulatory 
agenda supported those goals, or not, for that matter?
    Ms. Osborne. Thank you for the question.
    Congress has not given the administration a lot of 
authority to steer spending more towards those goals or not. 
There is really little that the administration could do to 
orient particularly formula dollars towards those goals. They 
could use competitive grants even to a greater extent than they 
do now to do so reward those who are really succeeding in 
meeting those goals and steer spending more into the areas that 
some agencies are struggling with. Like, maybe an agency that 
is really struggling with their safety numbers, competitive 
grants would only be open for safety projects from that agency.
    Many of the rules we are talking about today are meant to 
address safety. We are just trying to figure out how to do that 
well, and that is the right conversation to have with the 
practitioners to get a sense of what the real-world impact of 
them would be.
    There is a lot we could do in light-duty vehicle design. We 
are seeing a larger and larger problem with the fact that 
drivers cannot see the road in front of them based on the way 
trucks are designed. Some of the solutions discussed is putting 
screens in cars so that people would have to take their eyes 
off the road to see the road in front of them. We would like to 
see a more practical and logical solution to that problem.
    And we could help States modernize the way they approach 
transportation and, particularly, performance management. If 
you look back at the discussion in the 1950s when we were 
starting the Federal program, most people wanted to evaluate 
the effectiveness of the system based on whether or not people 
could reach their destinations no matter how they traveled, but 
especially on the newly built roadway system. And we just 
didn't have the statistics and the data, the technology to do 
that at the time. Now we have it, and we all carry it in our 
pockets in smart phones. We have cloud computing that can allow 
that kind of technology to measure hundreds of thousands of 
trips in just a couple of hours and really understand how every 
kind of investment impacts people's access, whether it is 
reducing congestion, improving transit service, creating more 
direct vehicle or bike-ped connections, and bringing the 
destinations people need closer to where they live.
    Seeing something like that could be really transformative.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thanks. I appreciate it. Before I 
yield back, I just want to make a note that we had a hearing a 
couple weeks ago regarding the use of formula grants and 
competitive grant and the desire from some to have fewer 
competitive grants. Everyone is for roadway safety--I don't 
question that at all--but it does seem you are making somewhat 
of a case, if we just leave it to formula grants only, there is 
no guarantee investment will be made in roadway safety as 
opposed to if we had the competitive grants for roadway safety, 
we could better encourage the national policy in investment and 
infrastructure that actually takes into account safety.
    Ms. Osborne. It is just one of the few places where reward 
is possible.
    Mr. Larsen of Washington. Thanks. I yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Yakym.
    Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all of 
our witnesses for being here today.
    I am glad we are continuing our strong oversight of the 
Department of Transportation, an agency charged with 
administrating over $1 trillion of taxpayer money that is 
supposed to be designed to shore up our Nation's 
infrastructure. However, it seems that far too often, a 
cavernous bureaucracy at DOT headquarters bogs down decisions 
in redtape, distracts itself with issues outside of its 
mandate, and they ultimately allow important investments to be 
eroded away by inflation.
    I have heard plenty of concerns from constituent 
stakeholders frustrated by confusing rules, inconsistent grant 
opportunity announcements, complex applications, and delays in 
securing grant agreements. One issue I have heard from 
construction companies in my district is uncertainty around 
Build America, Buy America requirements. I support Buy America 
where possible, but it seems like it is becoming a bureaucratic 
mess.
    For example, for 2 years in a row, a local road-striping 
company in my district has come in to talk about uncertainty 
over how the Federal Government treats the reflective glass 
beads that are laid on top of paint. OMB ruled that the beads 
are construction material, while the paint is a manufactured 
product.
    If they are premixed before arriving at the job site, it is 
considered a manufactured product. But they are seldom premixed 
because it is more time-consuming, more expensive, and it 
doesn't work in all situations. That is not to mention that 
different States are applying classifications and documentation 
requirements differently as well.
    There are easy fixes for all of this. For example, like 
getting the administration out of the weeds and out of this 
bureaucratic mess. But, like I said, the constituent company 
has come in 2 years in a row worried about this issue. That 
says to me to no one at DOT is in a position to fix this, and 
they don't seem to be in a hurry to do so.
    It seems like the Federal Government is all too content to 
micromanage these products and create all sorts of headaches 
for small businesses that are just trying to paint the lane 
markings on the roads. And that keeps the driving public unsafe 
during times of day in all weather conditions.
    Mr. Duit, can you speak to some of the issues you are 
seeing with the Biden-Harris administration stewardship of the 
Build America, Buy America requirements?
    Mr. Duit. Yes, sir. Thank you, Representative.
    First of all, to reiterate, ARTBA fully supports Buy 
America. The problem is that, in the short term, some items are 
not made in the U.S. in adequate amounts or they might be 
specialty items only made in foreign countries for now. While 
U.S. manufacturing catches up, we have to pay a premium for 
whatever U.S.-made inventory is available, and that is on top 
of inflation.
    If we can't find it, there needs to be a waiver request. 
Waivers can take a long time for approval, if they get approved 
at all. Meanwhile, we may have to delay or interrupt work on 
the project to get the issue resolved.
    There are dozens of different items considered to be 
manufactured products. When we think of highway and bridge 
projects, we usually think of concrete, asphalt, steel, and so 
forth. But these days, we are using many electronic items, 
electrical, mechanical units, pumps, lifts, and so on. Think 
about the ITS systems for rest areas, traffic operation 
centers, and everything that goes into them.
    FHWA is proposing that more than 55 percent of a 
manufactured product needs to be made in the USA. The problem 
is that someone like my company, as a contractor, would have to 
inventory all of the components that make up the manufactured 
product and certify where they are made. The manufacturer may 
not have that information.
    One example is a generator. Literally, hundreds of small 
inexpensive components in there. Someone needs to go through 
all of those parts, figure out what they are worth and where 
they were made. The manufacturer's representative selling the 
generator may not have that information. If the contractor 
demands it, the manufacturer's rep will just sell the generator 
to someone else.
    Mr. Yakym. Thank you, Mr. Duit. In closing here, I do want 
to also point out, as my time is expiring, that in terms of 
some of the grant agreement delays as well, according to the 
Department of Transportation's own figures, there are only 148 
out of 415 or 35 percent of RAISE grants agreements in place 
for awards that were awarded between fiscal years 2021 and 
2023, and it is causing projects to drown in redtape, die on 
the vine, and being eaten away by inflation.
    And so, I certainly call on the Department of 
Transportation to get these grant agreements in place so we can 
get the money out the door and these projects in place.
    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I do yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Johnson.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Bell, you have been subjected to a beat-down of 
proportions that I have not seen as a Member of Congress in the 
last 18 years, and you didn't even have a chance to defend 
yourself. You were beaten down like a pinata. And so, I feel 
kind of badly about that.
    And it seems like you were beat down because of your 
representation of the Steel Manufacturers Association, which in 
your testimony, you talked about the two ways of production of 
steel, one being a traditional blast furnace, basic oxygen 
furnace production method, which is centuries old, extractive, 
coal-based, high emissions. That is the old way of making 
steel. And the Steel Manufacturers Association produces steel 
via a cleaner method.
    And I suppose it was the extraction that you advocate 
against in your testimony, with the admonition that we should 
only have one standard, one emissions standard as opposed to 
two emissions standards. The one that you favor is the one that 
is cleaner and better for our environment.
    Would you like to explain a little bit about why that 
method is best as we move forward in funding initiatives to 
move our country away from dirty energy and into a more cleaner 
situation?
    Mr. Bell. Sure. Thank you, Congressman Johnson.
    The EAF approach to steelmaking embraces the circular 
economy. What does that mean? That we use recycled steel to 
make new steel. That means we also use electricity from an 
energy grid that gets greener and greener every year. And as a 
result of that, we have a lower emissions profile than steel 
made the traditional route.
    But for the purpose of this hearing, what is important to 
note, that when it comes to Federal Highway Administration and 
General Services Administration infrastructure projects, the 
integrated blast furnace producers do not make the products you 
need for Federal Highway and GSA projects. They don't make 
them. EAFs make 99 percent of those products that you use.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Well, if I may interrupt you here 
again and again apologize that you had to suffer such a beat-
down, but I hope you feel better about being able to explain a 
little bit about why you are here and why you are advocating 
for your position.
    Mr. Bell. And I appreciate that opportunity. And, by the 
way, Mr. Stauber is a huge advocate for the steel industry. 
And, quite frankly, both integrated producers and EAF producers 
are the ones that are leading the way globally in cleaner steel 
production.
    But, again, for the purpose of this hearing, Federal 
Highway infrastructure projects, the products that are needed 
to do those are not made by integrated producers. So, the 
reason we need a single standard is so it is easy to follow.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Okay. All right. I may disagree 
with you on the single standard concept, but maybe one of my 
fellow colleagues will allow you to talk more about that.
    I want to get to Ms. Osborne.
    Ms. Osborne, considering the alarming statistic of 
approximately 42,795 road fatalities in the U.S. in 2022, with 
12,151 of those attributed to speeding, the Department of 
Transportation has highlighted the crucial need for safer 
speeds in its national roadway safety strategy.
    Could you elaborate on how technologies like automatic 
emergency braking systems can contribute to promoting safer 
driving speeds and reducing speed-related fatalities?
    Ms. Osborne. I appreciate your question and do want to 
point out that some of the things we don't even look at is that 
even going the speed limit is often an unsafe speed. And we 
don't determine which crashes are caused by speed that actually 
meet or are under the speed limit, even though that is part of 
the danger as well.
    We certainly need to look at ways to get people to comply 
with speed limits that are often set higher than they should 
be, but we should be also looking to make it more natural for 
people to behave the way we want them to by better roadway 
design. That just leads to drivers going the safer speed.
    Mr. Johnson of Georgia. Thank you. With that, I yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
    Ms. Maloy.
    Ms. Maloy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    We are here talking about regulation in the transportation 
industry and building things. And we are a country that used to 
innovate and build things and now we just regulate.
    Mr. Pugh, I am going to start with you. You said that long-
haul trucking is one of the most heavily regulated industries 
in the country. You also said that truckers are growing 
frustrated with this administration and all the regulations.
    If we have a different administration and we can change 
regulations, what would long-haul truckers like to see stripped 
out? I think in a post-Chevron world, we are going to be in a 
situation where Congress is making more of these decisions and 
hopefully unelected bureaucrats are making fewer of the 
decisions.
    And you have our ear right now. What would you want 
Congress to know?
    Mr. Pugh. I think first and foremost would be the speed 
limiter rule that has been floated around for the last couple 
years. Truckers already are way under pressure with hours of 
service, because they are regulated, of course, by the amount 
of time they can drive and the amount of time they are supposed 
to take a break.
    So, if you add speed limiters into this--and, of course, 
drivers are paid by piecework. So, when you add speed limiters 
into this, this is just putting more pressure on drivers. It 
has also been proven that inexperienced drivers and newer 
drivers feel this pressure and oftentimes speed in places that 
they probably shouldn't be speeding, two-lane roads and 
construction and stuff like that. So, that is probably the 
first thing.
    Flexibility, more flexibility in hours of service would be 
very helpful; and also an elimination of a rule, and that is 
the elimination of the overtime exemption for driver pay, 
because that was put in in 1938. I think it is a little dated.
    Truckers should be paid for all the time that they work. 
They give away 20, 30 hours a week plus. Probably that would do 
better at managing speeds and a lot of other safety-related 
things that we talk about here and rules that we try to make. 
But a lot of these things we don't like to do because they are 
hard. So, thank you.
    Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
    Mr. Duit, same question: What regulations should we be 
looking at if Congress is making these decisions and not 
agencies?
    Mr. Duit. Thank you, Representative. Congress, including 
this subcommittee, has done a great job conducting oversight of 
the infrastructure law so far. But as we are halfway through 
it, I encourage you to keep up the law as implemented and make 
sure it is doing everything that it is intended to do.
    Anything that we can do, contractors in general, we like 
the flexibility. Anything that we can have that gives us 
flexibility, gives the States flexibility, lets us do things in 
conjunction with the owner certainly is always a benefit to 
anything that we can do.
    Ms. Maloy. Thank you.
    Mr. Bell, same question: If Congress is making these rules 
instead of agencies, what do you need us to know?
    Mr. Bell. I've got to tell you at the SMA, we have a 
preference for regulatory certainty over regulatory overreach. 
And we really do believe that anything that Congress does needs 
to be followed and not circumvented by regulatory frameworks.
    Ms. Maloy. I agree.
    All right. Ms. Osborne, you have had the most time to think 
about it.
    Ms. Osborne. Thank you. I would love to see a reduction of 
some of the regulations on more innovative roadway designs. 
When we work with States and local agencies, particularly on 
attempting more innovative quick build projects to try new 
interventions, they run into antiquated standards in both the 
Green Book and in the MUTCD that make it hard to try new 
things.
    We regularly hear from roadway design engineers that they 
would like to do things like narrow lanes in order to make 
drivers know that is an area they should be going a little more 
slowly in.
    But they have to go through very elaborate and long 
exceptions processes, which slows down their projects and 
raises the cost of them. And then that is held against the 
engineers in their performance reviews.
    So, I would like to make it easier for them to do things 
that get the results that we want and deregulate some of those 
designs.
    Ms. Maloy. Thank you. I am about out of time. I just want 
to wrap up by saying that I am looking forward to being in a 
different regulatory framework where we can go back and look at 
some of these regulations that may have been there since the 
thirties that don't make sense anymore.
    So, I appreciate your time, appreciate you answering my 
questions.
    And I yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentlewoman yields.
    Mr. Garcia.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you, Chair, Ranking Member, 
all of our witnesses.
    We all share the goal of making our highways and transit 
safer, more efficient, and more accessible. I am glad to see 
that the Department of Transportation has made progress toward 
these goals in rulemakings, but there is plenty of work to do 
in the upcoming surface reauthorization bill.
    Before I get into my questioning, I want to mention one 
such topic, which is the increasing number of truck crashes and 
fatalities. There has been a 49-percent increase in truck crash 
fatalities over the last 10 years, while it is true, 
thankfully, that in fatalities this is a small percent of a 
larger number.
    FMCSA's most recent data shows over half a million truck 
crashes in 2021. Even though a small percentage resulted in 
deaths, that still amounts to over 5,000 deaths per year.
    To those who contend that our insurance minimums do not 
need to be raised because only a small percentage of cases 
exceed the minimum, I would like to ask you to tell 5,000 
families who have lost loved ones or sustained lifelong 
disabilities that they deserve to live in debt because they are 
part of a statistical minority.
    On that note, I would like to reiterate a point Ms. Osborne 
made in her testimony about the upcoming surface 
reauthorization bill, that we cannot continue to fund the same 
systems and expect different outcomes.
    Ms. Osborne, we are all aware of the 80/20 split that 
directs the majority of funding towards our highways over our 
transit systems. But as many transit agencies reach fiscal 
cliffs and highway congestion continues to worsen despite 
highway-widening projects, it is clear that deprioritizing 
transit isn't working well for anyone.
    Question: How could transit parity improve these issues, 
and what can be done by Congress to address transit parity?
    Ms. Osborne. I appreciate the question. We have spent the 
last 70-plus years building out a strong and integrated highway 
system, but we have not put the same attention into the other 
modes of travel.
    One of our priorities is to invest in the rest of the 
system, to put the same level of focus on building out a strong 
transit system, passenger rail system, freight rail system and 
bike-ped system.
    Putting more funding towards that effort is important, and 
especially as we basically busted the trust fund since so 
little of the trust fund is paid for by user fee and really 
isn't a trust fund anymore. The old rules about who is paying 
in and where the money should go hasn't been the case really 
since 2009, and it is time to update our priorities there.
    I would also like to see not just on the transit system but 
on the roadway system, something I am hearing repeatedly from 
folks on the ground is that this program needs to be a part of 
the operations and maintenance of the overall system so that we 
can guarantee we get the most efficient outcomes of our 
investments.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you. Investing in transit 
will help mitigate climate change by reducing gashouse 
emissions.
    How does the FHWA greenhouse gas rule equip States to 
reduce carbon emissions, and why is it important for 
communities that experience disproportionate highway pollution? 
You have got about a minute.
    Ms. Osborne. It is important to provide more sunshine into 
what agencies' intentions are and to give us a barometer to 
measure them by. We should not oversell it. It is just a 
sunshine law. Agencies set their own targets, and if they miss 
them, there is really no penalty for it.
    But at the same time, we need not be overwrought about the 
damage it will do or how it will impact investments. In fact, 
if you look at most transportation agencies' environmental 
documents, benefit-cost analyses, their models show that 
expansion of highways will reduce emissions.
    I don't think their models are very accurate, and we don't 
really test them or look back to see if they are correct. But, 
considering the fact that they claim it is going to be great 
for emissions, I am not sure why they are so concerned about 
then measuring them.
    Mr. Garcia of Illinois. Thank you so much. Chairman, I 
yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields. Mr. Nehls.
    Mr. Nehls. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Pugh, good to see you. You have been in front of this 
committee before talking about some of the negative 
consequences of the speed limiter, this mandate. To remind the 
colleagues here, the DOT is considering limiting every single 
truck on the road to 60 miles an hour regardless, regardless of 
what the posted speed limit is.
    In your experience, you've got a lot of experience behind 
the wheel of a big truck, right? Do you believe this mandate 
would actually reduce speeding on our roads or do you think 
that DOT is ignoring the unintended consequences of this 
rulemaking?
    Mr. Pugh. No, I don't believe it is going to reduce--it 
will reduce speeding maybe on the interstate highways, but it 
is not--like I said earlier, more inexperienced newer drivers--
and, unfortunately, we have this churning all the time in 
trucking.
    When new people are coming in, it will cause them--and we 
have seen this. Motor carriers use these things now as a driver 
management tool, fuel management tool. If you look at the data, 
they are still getting speeding tickets----
    Mr. Nehls [interposing]. Right.
    Mr. Pugh [continuing]. Speeding on the interstate. So, it 
is probably a two-lane road or a work zone.
    Mr. Nehls. And what does the safety data tell us about the 
risk for crashes when you have trucks that are--now we are 
forcing them, we are forcing them to travel below the posted 
speed limit or slower than the flow of traffic. What does the 
data say?
    Mr. Pugh. There is plenty of data out there to show. But if 
there is a 10-mile-per-hour differential in speeds between 
traffic, that creates 227 percent more interactions between 
cars and trucks, which interactions is where we have accidents.
    Mr. Nehls. Aside from the safety concerns you related, what 
does this do to our Nation's supply chains? How would that 
affect it?
    Mr. Pugh. Well, it is going to slow our supply chain down. 
It is actually going to have a reverse effect with congestion, 
because we are going to need more trucks to haul the same 
amount of freight that we are hauling now.
    And with that being said, that is going to put more trucks 
on the highway which will be traveling 10 miles per hour below 
the speed limit or more in different sectors, which will again 
cause more congestion and more accidents.
    Mr. Nehls. Thank you.
    Mr. Duit, share with us some of your members' experiences 
with obtaining Build America, Buy America waivers. In my State, 
there is a good example. In my State, we applied for two BABA 
waivers the end of January, and we still are awaiting approval. 
We haven't heard anything.
    How are the other States dealing with this with the DOTs? 
How do they deal with some of this?
    Mr. Duit. I would have to check to get a more--a better 
answer for all the other States, but I think my recollection--
what I am understanding is I think everybody is having similar 
issues with regard to how it is being interpreted.
    I mean, if you look at this--on the Buy America, this is an 
example from Florida [indicating a diagram]. This is one of our 
members, that this is a generator, a project that he had. He 
was required to go through, and they wanted to understand where 
every single part in this generator was made, how much it cost 
and then how that fits within the system.
    I think things like that are just--there has to be some 
common sense applied I think would make the most sense on 
something like that.
    Mr. Nehls. I agree. We have to stop the silliness. We 
really, really do.
    I yield back, sir.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
    Mrs. Sykes.
    Mrs. Sykes. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Chairman Crawford and 
Ranking Member Norton, for holding this hearing today. Grateful 
to be able to continue to talk about the transformative impacts 
of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and how we are 
implementing it with great administrative--sometimes great and 
sometimes not so great.
    One thing I would like to talk about as a member of this 
committee. Ohio, we call ourselves the heart of it all. You can 
get to most of the country and Canada within an 8-hour drive, 
but we are also always concerned about the fact whether people 
are able to travel in and out of our State safely and want to 
just make sure as we are talking about these administrative 
rules, we are keeping safety in mind.
    If people are not able to make it in and out of my State as 
they are traveling through--commerce, for a vacation, for 
leisure--we really are not doing something correct.
    But I do want to direct our attention elsewhere for my 
questions and specifically around some workforce conversations.
    So, following the enactment of the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, Transportation for America released an 
article highlighting the need for workforce development as our 
Nation and our transit systems recovered from the COVID 
pandemic and the role that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
has played in the process.
    One of those programs is the low- and no-emission and bus 
facilities program. And among the requirements, the no-low 
program requires that grantees spend 5 percent of the award 
money on workforce development training, including 
apprenticeships and other labor-management training programs.
    So, Ms. Osborne, as you have seen these grant programs such 
as this one improve our Nation's workforce--or, how have you 
seen it, and what can we do to make it better if it is not 
already working at the top of its ability?
    Ms. Osborne. Thank you for your question. There is greater 
flexibility in the utilization of Federal funds for workforce 
development than I think a lot of agencies are aware. There is 
a lot more we can do to not just show them how they might 
utilize that flexibility but some of the most effective ways to 
do so.
    I think we can do a lot more to share workforce development 
successes across the country rather than have everyone trying 
to reinvent the wheel, so to speak, in every place. But one 
thing we are doing now is analyzing the spending to date across 
the board, in terms of IIJA's spending, to get a better sense 
of what we have gotten for expenditures.
    Mrs. Sykes. Thank you, Ms. Osborne.
    And if you could elaborate a little bit more about some of 
the recommendations that you have to improve this so that we 
can have that information and perhaps act on it.
    Ms. Osborne. I am certainly happy to share any lessons we 
learn in doing analysis, particularly with regard to workforce. 
We don't have any particular recommendations on that today. But 
as we finish our analysis, I would be happy to work with you 
going forward.
    Mrs. Sykes. Thank you very much.
    Chairman, I yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentlewoman yields.
    Mr. Webster.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think my 
question is maybe for Mr. Bell.
    The idea of using lower carbon products in the 
transportation arena is something that is happening, I guess. 
And I am wondering are these products tested for their 
longevity in kind of the wear and tear of transportation in 
actual existence when they get incorporated into some job or 
something? Are they checked for that, do you know, or tested 
out, as far as how well they will endure the rigors of a 
construction project?
    Mr. Bell. Yes, Congressman, they are. And they are given 
information through the environmental product declaration on 
emissions, and then mill test certificates in terms of their 
strength and functionality.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. So, do you believe that other 
items, like glass or concrete or something like that, do they 
stand up to the rigors of that as well as it does for steel or 
some other product?
    Mr. Bell. I can really speak only to steel. But one thing 
that we do know in terms of emissions, glass and concrete and 
other commodities don't have a dual standard to measure their 
emissions. But in terms of their strength, I can't speak to 
that.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. So, do you know--can you kind of 
just summarize the impact of adding these items into the mix, 
something that produces a lower carbon footprint, what that 
entails? Can you elaborate on that?
    Mr. Bell. Well, I do know that if you measure the embodied 
carbon emissions of all commodities that are used in Federal 
Highway infrastructure projects, I think that that will be a 
good thing, because I think that way you will be able to build 
these projects with the best carbon footprint possible.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. But do you have kind of an idea of 
which--I mean, as far as you don't just look at that input. You 
also look at the longevity and endurance and so forth, other 
things.
    Are there some tests that kind of prove out what is the 
sort of a number for that which includes all those things?
    Mr. Bell. I am not aware of that. I can speak specifically 
to steel and I know that they are; but for the other 
commodities such as glass and concrete, I am not sure.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Do you think that that would be a 
good thing to have before we step out into an unknown, an 
unknown usage of products until we find out what the longevity 
of those products would be?
    Mr. Bell. I think it would be good, because it would 
improve our environmental footprint and safety. But as long as 
it can be done in a way that is not burdensome and that doesn't 
hinder free markets and follows legislation, I think we would 
be in good shape.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Do you think there should be some 
kind of not exemption but maybe lenience towards small 
businesses and others who might have trouble putting all that 
together right away? Do you think there should be something 
that could sort of buy them into the whole program?
    Mr. Bell. I think we should do as much as we can to support 
job creators. And small businesses are a very important part of 
that group, and I think that we need to look at that. Again, 
anything we do needs to make common sense and not be 
regulatorily burdensome.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Can you name something that is for 
a small business that might be regulatorily burdensome?
    Mr. Bell. Can you repeat the question, please?
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Can you name a particular product 
or something provided by a small business that might be 
regulatorily prohibitive?
    Mr. Bell. I can't name anything right now. I can focus on 
the steel industry, and we go to great lengths to make sure 
that we provide the Government with the information we need on 
emissions as well as the product properties of the products we 
make.
    Mr. Webster of Florida. Thank you very much. I yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
    Mr. Auchincloss.
    Mr. Auchincloss. Thank you, Chairman.
    I appreciate the testimony from our witnesses.
    Ms. Osborne, I particularly appreciate your work and your 
testimony. You have noted that while today we are spending more 
money overall on our roads, the money is not necessarily going 
towards repair.
    In many cases, as you know, States are spending as much on 
expansion as they are on repair. And you rightly point out--and 
I want to emphasize--that, quote, ``Every new lane-mile of road 
costs approximately $24,000 per year to preserve in a state of 
good repair. By expanding roads, we are borrowing against the 
future.''
    As Congress begins considering the next surface 
transportation reauthorization, how should we reprioritize 
formula funding to ensure that we are maximizing our existing 
roads and not expanding and inducing more vehicular traffic?
    Ms. Osborne. Thank you for that question. To be clear, the 
$24,000 per lane-mile is a number that we came up with from 
Federal Highways in 2019, so, that is probably awfully low. And 
the liability of building things has likely become more 
expensive.
    This committee actually led the way in addressing this 
policy-wise. In the last reauthorization, there was bipartisan 
language added to your bill originally that said that an agency 
could build new infrastructure or expand infrastructure if they 
had a plan to maintain it throughout its useful life while 
improving the overall condition of their system.
    It is something that is just good governance and common 
sense. Unfortunately, the Senate and the White House did not 
follow your excellent lead, and I would love to see that 
language come back in.
    Mr. Auchincloss. There is a lot from the INVEST Act that I 
would like to see come back in for sure.
    You have also noted that our current funding system does 
not prioritize access, whether that is access to economic 
opportunity, healthcare, family. The current formula incentive 
states to simply use more fuel--excuse me--the current formula 
incentivizes States to simply use more fuel, not to actually 
design a transportation system that connects people with the 
places they need to go.
    How should we think about reevaluating that formula to 
prioritize access to jobs and services instead of simply 
inducing more vehicular-miles traveled?
    Ms. Osborne. Yes. This is something I am very excited 
about, and I really think it could be transformative in 
speaking to the user experience and to access to economic 
opportunity.
    For those that are not familiar with multimodal access, it 
is measuring the destinations people can reach when they 
travel. The way we measure the success of the transportation 
system right now is based on a proxy. That was the best thing 
we could do in the 1950s, which is to look at the speed of 
vehicles within an observed section, assuming that if we sped 
up vehicles within that observed section that people would 
arrive where they were going more quickly.
    As it turns out, what we do often to speed up that travel 
actually extends the distance. Think about roadways where you 
have no left turn all the way down and you have to go out of 
your way to take that left turn.
    We can measure that trip now. Virginia has really led the 
way in this and in doing so, I think really improved people's 
experience.
    Mr. Auchincloss. And I am glad you brought up Virginia. 
Let's go one level deeper in granularity to describe what it is 
that Virginia has gone to quantify access to jobs and services 
within sort of a catchment area to help policymakers understand 
how effective their mobility policy is.
    Ms. Osborne. They evaluate all new capacity projects on 
several items, including access to jobs and access to essential 
services. They measure those differently, because a job trip is 
expected and okay if it is a little bit longer and certainly 
does not--it is not treated the same way as, for example, a 
trip to the grocery. A 30-minute trip to a job is an acceptable 
amount of time. A 30-minute trip to a grocery is a public 
policy problem.
    Mr. Auchincloss. So, is it modality-agnostic in the sense 
that----
    Ms. Osborne [interposing]. It is.
    Mr. Auchincloss [continuing]. Regardless of how you get 
there.
    Ms. Osborne. It is not only modality-agnostic, it actually 
brings in distance and land-use decisions. So, if you move the 
things people need closer to homes or affordable housing closer 
to those things, you can get an access increase as well.
    Mr. Auchincloss. And what types of places score higher on 
this metric? Is it single-family zoned, highway-centric, car-
centric planning, or is it walkable mixed-use downtowns?
    Ms. Osborne. On access to nonwork necessities, definitely 
more walkable mixed-use traditional communities.
    Mr. Auchincloss. I yield back, Chair.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
    Mr. Collins.
    Mr. Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Duit, I heard you made the comment about good 
intentions. And we always have a saying around my crowd that 
the road to the poorhouse is paved with good intentions. A lot 
of folks who have good intentions, but they have no clue about 
what they are talking about. I think we find that a lot on this 
side.
    I want to make another comment, too. In talking with a lot 
of the people in the construction business, it seems that a lot 
of your percentage of your cost that you have to put in there 
is due to permits and the waiting on permits and the fact that 
I think that good tort reform in this country would probably 
decrease a lot of those permit costs and speed up your projects 
overall.
    So, I would like for you, if you have a comment, I would 
love to hear it. But otherwise, I think that is something that 
would be of great value, not just to your industry, but 
probably to all industries.
    But what I want to get to is Mr. Pugh. Mr. Pugh, my Baptist 
in me wanted to stand up and cheer. Congratulations; 2.5 
million miles safe driving. People don't realize that is 20 
years on the average driver. That not only says a lot about 
you, but I think it says a lot about where our industry has 
gone with the availability, the technology out there, and the 
focus on being safe.
    I know in my company, we want to be the most 
technologically advanced, the safest with the best employees, 
period. And we have a handful of a million milers out there.
    I want to focus real quick, because there are some things 
that I have heard up here that I want you to make a quick 
comment on.
    Number one, we heard there is a 76-percent increase in 
accidents at 75 miles or over in speed. I don't have a truck 
out there that runs 75 miles an hour. And if you actually 
looked at the data--AAA has even done this. They didn't want to 
admit it. But over 75 percent of the accidents out there are 
not the truck's fault. It is the four-wheeler, it is the car, 
the automobile's fault. With 98 percent of the trucking 
companies out there, 10 trucks or less, 95 percent of them are 
5 trucks or less. A huge portion are owner-operators and 
independent drivers.
    What would this increase that one of the colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle is pushing for liability insurance, 
what would it do to the trucking industry?
    Mr. Pugh. It would, in short, put them out of business, a 
lot of the small guys, my members. We don't even know like how 
this be would charged. We don't know how insurance would 
withstand this, because there is really nothing out there to 
measure.
    There has already been lots of liability insurance 
companies leave the market. We know as people leave the market 
and there is less competition, prices go up.
    So, this could be disastrous to small business, to supply 
chains, to carriers even the size of yours.
    Mr. Collins. I think it would be disastrous for the 
trucking industry, but it is nothing but a pay raise for trial 
lawyers. That is all it is.
    Mr. Pugh. One hundred percent.
    Mr. Collins. Let's move on. Rear impact guards, I would 
venture to say if we had a question in here, people don't even 
know what that is. What is a rear impact guard?
    Mr. Pugh. It is the DOT bumper, for lack of better terms. 
When you see a semitruck going down the road, on the back of 
the trailer kind of a T-pattern thing or something like that, 
it is the rear bumper.
    Mr. Collins. So, we have those, right?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes, we do.
    Mr. Collins. Is a rear impact guard to prevent the truck 
from injuring the car or from the car hitting the truck and 
being injured?
    Mr. Pugh. It is to keep the car from entering completely in 
underneath the truck.
    Mr. Collins. So, I think that puts a little more evidence 
to the fact that the automobiles out there cause the problem, 
and a lot of times we see that the trucking industry takes the 
hit.
    Mr. Pugh. The trucking industry almost always takes the hit 
when--you are correct--over 80 percent of accidents are caused 
by the car.
    Mr. Collins. So, automatic emergency brakes--man, I got a 
boatload of them I would love to get rid of--are they fail 
proof?
    Mr. Pugh. No, they are not foolproof. We have constant 
false acts going on all the time, activations.
    Mr. Collins. Go off when you go under a bridge or road 
construction sign, anything that may----
    Mr. Pugh [interrupting]. I drove a truck back from Reno 
last year back to Kansas City. It was constantly going off for 
just--there was nothing around, in the middle of Wyoming and 
places----
    Mr. Collins [interrupting]. Yet we got Federal bureaucracy 
out there, bureaucrats, Federal agencies, people that sit 
around here that think they know better, have no clue. I 
guarantee you, probably the majority of folks in this room 
don't have a CDL driver's license. They don't know that 
industry.
    But since we are out there on the roadway in the motoring 
public, we are an easy target because people see us. I mean, 
you are scratching your head on what you think you might can 
get done this year. You are riding down the road. Oh, there is 
a big truck, let's see what we can do to that as well.
    I am out of time, but I wanted to add one more thing. 
Broker fraud, it is huge and it has been going on for decades, 
but I would like to add in there that we have another fraud 
going on out there too, and that is the towing industry.
    The towing industry has been ripping off the trucking 
industry for decades. I know for a fact. I just saw one, a 
truck that had an accident by itself, ran off the interstate. 
The towing bill was $78,000.
    Mr. Pugh. I had a member who received a tow bill a couple 
of weeks ago in the State of Pennsylvania. They were charged 
$9,000 heat and humidity charge with a 10-percent 
administration fee on top of that. It was well over a $60,000 
tow bill.
    Mr. Collins. The most regulated, taxed, burdened industry 
in the world.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman's time is expired.
    Mr. Carbajal.
    Mr. Collins. Thank you.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Mr. Duit, our transportation sector is the largest source 
of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Your 
testimony notes your opposition to FHWA's greenhouse gas 
performance rule while stating that the American Road & 
Transportation Builders Association, ARTBA, is not opposed to 
reducing emissions.
    How can we accurately reduce greenhouse emissions if we 
don't even measure the scope of the problem and potential 
solutions, and what specific policies does ARTBA support to 
lower greenhouse gas emissions on our roadways?
    Mr. Duit. Thank you, Representative.
    The rule requires State and local agencies to plan projects 
that meet the intended greenhouse gas goals and at least 
minimum to create the declining of the GHG totals.
    I guess it means the States and other transportation 
agencies need to prioritize certain types of projects over 
others, as I have mentioned, if they do not align with the 
prescribed GHG reduction targets.
    The concern is that that could lead to a misallocation of 
resources and hinder State-specific transportation needs from 
one type of a project to a different type, because that 
specific type has a lower GHG reduction.
    And I think the concern is that that is not necessarily 
doing what the States actually need to have done. They are 
doing what is needing to be done based upon the greenhouse gas 
emissions. With regard to reducing the greenhouse gas, I do not 
have a proposal for that that I am aware of within our 
association.
    Mr. Carbajal. Mr. Duit, is there anything that ARTBA 
supports to lower greenhouse gas emissions on the roadways? 
Anything? Something? An iota?
    Mr. Duit. An iota? I will tell you what, sir. I will do 
some checking and get back with you if that is okay.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you.
    Mr. Duit, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has been a 
transformative investment for our Nation's roads, bridges, and 
infrastructure. In my district, we have seen nearly $1 billion 
in Federal dollars from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, also 
known as BIL, for local projects. Your testimony highlights 
that there have been over 75,000 project commitments in the 
first 2 years of the BIL.
    Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's enactment, 43,000 
new construction industry jobs have been created. As the 
president of a major construction company, how are you seeing 
the benefits of this law, this infrastructure law, play out 
across America?
    Mr. Duit. Thank you, sir. The infrastructure law has helped 
drastically. It has been a true blessing. I think it helps us--
gives us--it gives contractors some clarity, and it gives us 
some time.
    It is a 5-year bill, so that lets us go out and expend the 
money for equipment. It lets us hire people. It gives us the 
opportunity to grow our projects. I think it is a win-win.
    It is good for the American people in that we have the 
ability to make more efficient, quicker ability to get goods 
and services to the market as well as keep people safe. But the 
more that we put into this, the safer we can make these roads 
over a period of time.
    Mr. Carbajal. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
    Mr. Kean.
    Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you to all of our witnesses for being here today.
    In 2021, the FHWA released a memorandum encouraging States 
to prioritize projects to maintain existing infrastructure 
facilities before expanding capacity. While this memorandum was 
subsequently nullified by the FHWA as Congress was beginning 
its disapproval process, it would have marked a major shift in 
the longstanding Federal-State partnership under which States 
retain the autonomy to prioritize projects they needed most.
    Mr. Duit, can you detail for us ARTBA's position on the 
December 2021 policy memo? What do you see as the importance of 
States prioritizing projects according to their own needs?
    Mr. Duit. Yes, sir. Thank you, Representative. A 
longstanding cornerstone of the Federal-Aid Highway Program has 
been State flexibility in project selection. That is because 
transportation challenges in Oklahoma are going to be different 
than they are in, say, Vermont, and States need that ability to 
respond accordingly.
    Putting aside the fact that States are already spending 
nearly half of the formula dollars on repair and rehabilitation 
projects, this is another example of the administration trying 
to work outside the law. We applaud the FHWA for repealing the 
memo and will follow the law ensuring State flexibility.
    Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you. Mr. Pugh, the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act explicitly required that 
the Department of Transportation consult with truckers about 
their experiences with automatic emergency brake systems prior 
to publishing a motor vehicle safety standard requiring this 
technology. In fact, truckers are the only stakeholders that 
were singled out in the law for specific consultation on this 
mandate.
    A notice of proposed rulemaking was published in June of 
2023. How do you think this consultation process went, and can 
you speak a little bit more about the process in general?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes. As far as the AB process, they have not done 
what they said. They have not reached out to drivers or spoke 
with drivers at all. Also, since this has come out, NHTSA has 
also opened up an investigation on false activations of these 
products. So, they are continuing to move forward with a rule 
that they know they have a problem with, and they know these 
trucks have these false activations.
    I have had members and we have had plenty of comments put 
out of drivers almost being put in an accident on bad roads and 
different things like that, and also being rear-ended because 
these things activate and someone is following too close in a 
car or something behind them and almost hits or does hit the 
truck.
    I can't say this enough. I point this out all the time. 
Trucks are completely different from cars. And just because a 
technology works well in a car, in an automobile, does not mean 
that it is going to work well in a truck.
    Every load--every type of truck is different as far as 
weights and how the product moves and stuff like that. You take 
a tanker, there is liquid in there moving the whole thing. So, 
the way you have to stop that is completely different from a 
load of paper towels in a van trailer.
    Mr. Kean of New Jersey. Thank you. I yield back.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
    Mr. Menendez.
    Mr. Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    Thank you to our witnesses for appearing here today.
    New Jersey's Eighth Congressional District is home to the 
largest port on the east coast. While we are very proud of this 
asset and all that it brings to our district and what it does 
not just for our region but our Nation's economy, we all see an 
incredible amount of truck traffic through our communities.
    The port and trucking are both vital to our supply chain 
and our local and regional economies, but emissions from 
medium- and heavy-duty vehicles emit nearly 25 percent of 
transportation-related gas emissions.
    We also know that transportation is the largest creator of 
emissions in the United States. Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles 
often operate in densely populated areas such as my district 
and can have adverse health impacts on the surrounding 
communities. Sadly, these impacts fall disproportionately on 
overburdened communities.
    Ms. Osborne, first, welcome back. But can you tell us how 
does the FHWA's greenhouse gas performance rule work to reduce 
emissions along freight corridors and near ports?
    Ms. Osborne. Well, I don't want to oversell the rule. It is 
a sunlight and tracking rule. It is a rule that requires States 
and metropolitan planning organizations to make clear to 
Congress and the taxpayer what their intention is in terms of 
controlling greenhouse gas emissions. If they fail to meet 
their self-set target, there is nothing that happens. But there 
is certainly better information to the taxpayer and to 
policymakers to determine how they feel about that.
    You can't control something you don't measure. So, I think 
having folks do a better job of indicating what they expect to 
happen in terms of their investment package in terms of 
increasing greenhouse gas emissions is an essential first step 
to doing something about it.
    Mr. Menendez. Increase awareness. More information for 
communities to put pressure on those local actors to try to 
make those changes in a quicker fashion.
    Ms. Osborne. Absolutely. And this is a program where 
finding good data is very challenging. In every report we have 
ever written about Federal spending, we have very long 
appendices that talk about the lack of recent data, comparable 
data, complete data.
    And so, some of these tracking rules can help to provide 
just basic information about where the agencies themselves 
think things are going.
    Mr. Menendez. I just want to underscore that point because 
it is so important. There is a group in Elizabeth, New Jersey, 
called Groundwork. And they find unique ways, low-cost ways to 
collect data about the different challenges that their 
communities are facing.
    And so, by having that additional data that groups like 
that don't have to source themselves, they can be even better 
advocates for their communities. So, it is incredibly important 
and something that even if there is no enforcement mechanism, I 
believe is still going to be helpful in achieving some of these 
goals.
    Moving on to worker misclassification. Worker 
misclassification has quickly become a large topic of 
discussion across all sectors. We have heard quite a bit about 
independent contractor and employee classification in this 
committee as well as the independent contractor classification 
rule finalized by the Department of Labor at the beginning of 
this year.
    Mr. Pugh, we know that the rule will be good for workers. 
It provides clarity and will help to ensure that workers are 
not deprived of Fair Labor Standards Act protections like 
minimum wage. However, some large corporate motor carriers have 
claimed that the rule will harm independent truckers and owner-
operators that want to work as independent contractors.
    What are your thoughts on what this new rule will mean for 
truckers and owner-operators that have worked as independent 
contractors and want to maintain that status?
    Mr. Pugh. I feel and we feel that it will not change. If 
you are in a compliant lease, working for a carrier with a 
lease agreement, you will be fine just like you were prior to 
the last rule being passed.
    Actually, this rule gives more clarity. It is easier to 
show that you are independent, in our opinion. And finally, it 
does away with allowing control, because if you are truly an 
independent contractor leased, subleased, or whatever to 
another motor carrier, you shouldn't be controlled as an 
employee, meaning speed limiters and driver fleet management 
tools like that must be put into your truck.
    The prior rule allowed that and you could still be 
considered independent. We don't feel that if you are an 
independent driver or independent carrier and you have these 
kind of items, have to have them mandated or put into your 
truck by the carrier you lease to, that is a sense of control. 
This does away with that. So, we are good with the new rule.
    Mr. Menendez. I appreciate that and wish I had more time, 
but thank you all so much for coming.
    Mr. Crawford. The gentleman yields.
    As you can see, there is a vote series underway on the 
House floor. Therefore, we shall stand in recess subject to the 
call of the chair.
    [Recess.]
    Mr. Burlison [presiding]. The Subcommittee on Highways and 
Transit will reconvene the previously recessed hearing.
    I now yield to myself for 5 minutes of questioning.
    Mr. Pugh, good to see you today. Recently, the Supreme 
Court overturned the Chevron decision that would prevent 
agencies from ignoring congressional intent, and it takes away 
the agency's ability to loosely interpret statutes for rules.
    Just in the past 2 years, we have seen some ridiculous 
rules come down from DOT and other agencies. This includes 
WOTUS, speed limiters for trucks, greenhouse gas emission 
rules, just to name a few.
    Do you think that the regulations that were done, that 
these regulations have been made based on congressional intent?
    Mr. Pugh. No, I don't think most of these have been made, 
some of these you are talking about, congressional intent at 
all. I think there are certain folks out there who want these 
kind of things, whether it is to take away independent or small 
businesses' advantage for a profit or something like that.
    I mean, the speed limiter rule, FMCSA said that it will put 
small-business carriers at a competitive disadvantage to large 
motor carriers.
    So, again, I think a lot of this stuff comes to serve 
special interest groups, who maybe don't have any experience in 
commercial trucking or they have it but they are just on the 
other side from, like, drivers and my folks.
    Mr. Burlison. Do you think that these rules will withstand 
a court challenge if they weren't clearly gaining congressional 
intent?
    Mr. Pugh. Well, we would like to think they won't, but I 
think with this whole Chevron doctrine and this just passing, 
you know, I am not an attorney. I am a trucker. But we have 
attorneys that work for us, and I think this is going to take 
10, 20 years maybe to see how this all plays out. We will see.
    Mr. Burlison. Hopefully, they get overturned.
    Earlier this year, the EPA finalized its rule titled ``The 
final standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from heavy-
duty vehicles model year 2027 and beyond.''
    This is phase 3 of the greenhouse gas standards for heavy-
duty vehicles, and it will force a significant number of trucks 
to become electric.
    Can you expound on how this rule is going to impact your 
industry?
    Mr. Pugh. It is going to devastate our industry. Again, as 
I said earlier, tractor-trailer trucks are way different than 
cars. And maybe this technology can be argued it works somewhat 
in cars, but it is far from mainstream with trucks. Trucks, 
right now, there is nowhere to really fuel them. No one really 
has a way to address how we are going to recharge these trucks.
    Small-business carriers like myself, I park my truck at my 
house all the time. So, this means when I want to go home or 
park my truck, I need to put in a very expensive charging 
system in my truck.
    Not to mention these trucks weigh 10,000 pounds more than 
their diesel counterparts, which means they will haul less of a 
payload, which means by hauling less of a payload, you are 
going to put more of these trucks out there. And, in fact, in 
my personal opinion, they could have an opposite effect and 
actually cause more pollution.
    Mr. Burlison. Is this technology even available at this 
time?
    Mr. Pugh. Not that I know of. I mean, there are trucks out 
there testing and companies out there have introduced them. But 
as far as--I don't know any carriers or anybody that is going 
out there and buying these things en masse, because, again, 
where do you fuel them?
    There was a trucking company in Illinois that was going to 
get like 32 units for their company. The city reached out to 
them and asked them what they were doing, because they needed 
so much electricity. And they told them that they were putting 
in these electric trucks. And they said, well, you can't do it, 
because your trucks are going to draw more power than our 
entire city does from the power grid. We don't have the 
electricity to give you.
    Mr. Burlison. Yes. I think, in general, we have an energy 
demand problem in the United States, and this, I think, would 
only exacerbate that problem.
    My final question is that I understand there is an attempt 
to impose an additional underride protection requirement on 
trucks. So, we have the rear protection, but this advisory 
committee looked at it and they are trying to require underride 
protection on the sides. How do you see that working?
    Mr. Pugh. Right now, I don't see it working. First of all, 
there is not really good data even saying how many of these 
accidents there are and how much they would prevent.
    There has not been any real-world testing. And the 
committee that you are speaking of that they threw together had 
way more safety advocates on it than it did trucking, and they 
didn't even come to a consensus at the end of this. And they 
ignored the facts of railroad crossings and off-road and other 
operational challenges of these underride guards.
    Mr. Burlison. Thank you. My time is expired.
    I now recognize Mr. Moulton for 5 minutes.
    Mr. Moulton. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Pugh, I 
would like to pick up on some of these questions we were 
talking about, speed limiters and how you mentioned that these 
are pursued by special interest groups. They can limit the 
ability of small businesses to compete, according to you.
    How is that the--how does it hurt small businesses in 
trucking to have a speed limiter on your truck?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes. Well, we have speed limits. We all know 
that. And to oversee----
    Mr. Moulton [interrupting]. I know we have speed limits. I 
am asking how speed limiters hurt small----
    Mr. Pugh [interrupting]. Right. I am getting to that. I am 
answering your question. We have speed limits now. Small-
business carriers like myself, they don't need driver 
management tools or fuel management tools like these are used 
by big carriers, these speed limiters. So, they can go the 
speed limit a lot of times where maybe the larger carriers 
cannot.
    So, the problem is, if you put these on a small carrier, 
that is the one competitive advantage they have is that they 
can run the speed limit and get the loads there more quickly. 
If you take that away from them, they have lost all competitive 
advantages now over their bigger carrier counterparts.
    Mr. Moulton. Okay, I understand that. That makes sense.
    You mentioned that it must be special interest groups or 
whatnot who are pushing these technologies. In the last year 
for which we have data available, 20 percent of fatal truck 
crashes occurred over speeds of 70 miles per hour, resulting in 
about 1,000 deaths.
    Now, if I care about those 1,000 people who died because of 
truck crashes that could have been prevented with speed 
limiters, does that make me a special interest guy?
    Mr. Pugh. No. I think that we all care about crashes. There 
is no one in this world who cares more about highway safety 
than the American trucker. Myself personally, 2\1/2\ million 
miles, I am very proud of that. Truckers----
    Mr. Moulton [interrupting]. Well, if you care about trucker 
safety then you shouldn't be so concerned when you have an 
advisory committee that has a lot of safety advocates on it.
    Speeding was a factor in 29 percent of traffic fatalities 
in 2022, killing 12,151 people, 12,151 Americans who lost their 
lives due to speeding.
    In 2019, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
estimates that the economic cost of speed-related crashes was 
about $46 billion. The economic cost to all of us here in 
America, $46 billion.
    Ms. Osborne, does reducing the speed of vehicles have an 
effect on the chance of fatality in an accident?
    Ms. Osborne. In general, when a driver is going at higher 
speed, their sphere of vision decreases, so, they are less 
likely to spot potential points of conflict. And the faster 
they are going, the less physics allows them to slow and stop 
their vehicle fast enough.
    When you hit another vehicle or particularly a person at 
high speed, it is more likely to result in serious injury or 
fatality, especially as vehicles are getting bigger.
    Mr. Moulton. And, of course, we just talked about the 
effect, the value of speed limiters. It is a technology that 
has been introduced in Europe with no unintended consequences 
so far as the studies show. It is a technology that has already 
been adopted by many truckers here in the United States.
    But bringing it back to the pedestrian level, which you 
have just mentioned, Ms. Osborne, research shows that a 
pedestrian is twice as likely to be killed by a vehicle 
traveling at 30 miles per hour compared to a vehicle moving at 
20 miles per hour.
    So, we are going off the highways here with truckers 
speeding and down to the local level. But how can we encourage 
these slower speed limits to increase road safety, to literally 
cut fatalities in half for crashes at that speed?
    Ms. Osborne. Well, roadway design speeds are often 
different than speed limits. We design our roadways to 
accommodate higher speeds than the speed limit theoretically 
allows. And drivers pick up on that design more than they pick 
up on the speed limit, because you see the speed limit sign 
every half mile or so, but the design of the roadway is 
communicating with you all the time.
    Mr. Moulton. That makes a lot of sense.
    Ms. Osborne. So, if you build the roadway widely, you get 
high-speed travel.
    Mr. Moulton. That is helpful. We are running short on time, 
so, I want to get to a couple more things.
    Between 1993 and 2017, we increased freeway lane-miles by 
42 percent. Congestion delays grew during that same period by 
144 percent over the same period.
    Ms. Osborne, do you believe that increasing highway 
capacity helps improve congestion?
    Ms. Osborne. Looking at the record, it does not seem to. We 
find that in all of the 100 largest cities in the country, even 
the ones who had a reduction in population and an increase in 
lane-miles saw their congestion go up. So, we are clearly 
messing with the wrong lever.
    Mr. Moulton. Everybody knows this outside the United States 
of America, it seems, or maybe outside of this committee. It is 
a really important fact. Increasing highway capacity increases 
congestion.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
    Mr. Burlison. Thank you. The Chair now recognizes Mr. 
LaMalfa for 5 minutes.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Pugh, we are talking about disparity of speed limits 
when you are on--we all have been on the freeway, and 
especially if it is two lanes going one direction, two lanes 
the other.
    And so, I call them turtle races. I guess that may be a 
common phrase or not. So, you got one truck passing another 
truck, and they are stuck going 55 on that particular piece of 
freeway while cars can go 70.
    So, talk a little bit about the difference in speed and 
what that does with drivers, the frustration, and then also 
just the disparity in speed, how that dynamic acts with safety 
in general, whereas if the trucks are able to go the same 
speed. Let's say they can all go 65 or 70 like in some States. 
What is the safer situation?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes. I mean, first and foremost, there is plenty 
of data out there to show that a 10-mile-per-hour differential 
between trucks and cars creates 227 percent more times that 
they interact. Interactions, of course, is where we have 
accidents.
    If we are really concerned about speed and which I talked 
to prior to you, if we really want to do something about it, 
instead of differentiating the speed between cars and trucks 
then lower the speed for everybody so everybody is going the 
same.
    That is all we want. That is what our trucking wants is 
cars and trucks. So, if you are going to limit trucks to 60 
then limit cars to 60, because it is proven over and over and 
over that all traffic traveling the same speed limit is the 
safest.
    We are down to seven States now I think in this country 
that have speed differentials. I also think that a State 
probably should be deciding their speed limit, not an agency 
here in Washington, DC, because I feel like Montana probably 
has a better idea than Washington.
    Mr. LaMalfa. I am from California, and we have a disparate 
speed there of 55 and 70 typically on I-5 I use a lot. And if 
we leave it to California, it will probably just get dumber, 
but we will see.
    But let's speak about the availability of trucks with these 
mandates going with EPA joining with CARB to basically outlaw 
diesel engines by a particular timeline and then going to much 
heavier--you said 10,000 pounds more.
    I have seen as much as 16,000 pounds additional weight by 
two sets of batteries on a truck, which is one-fifth of the 
gross weight of a vehicle at 80,000 pounds additional weight.
    Now, you take the diesel engine and the tranny out, and you 
probably have a different rear axle since they are all going to 
be driven at the wheels, I suppose. So, you are not really 
taking that much weight off the truck when you add all that 
electric.
    So, anywhere, 10,000, 15,000, 16,000 pounds more weight, as 
you mentioned, we are going to have--we need 20 percent more 
trucks to do the same work. Does that seem about right as far 
as the gross weight?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes, I would agree. I mean, I pulled a flatbed 
the majority of my career, hauled a lot of Mr. Bell's steel 
here out of the Ohio Valley. And we got paid by the weight. So, 
not only would I be able to haul less steel one time, I would 
make less money because I wouldn't be able to haul as much of a 
payload.
    Mr. LaMalfa. And the steel guy has got to pay five trucks 
instead of four to get it hauled, right?
    Mr. Pugh. Exactly.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Yes. So, now, talk about availability of--
especially to smaller trucking outfits. Like, on my farm, we 
have used trucks, and they are on the older side except for 
where the State has said I can't run my 2003 anymore. So, I had 
to have them 2011 or newer.
    What does it mean when mom and pop truckers are going to be 
mandated to have vehicles that they can't afford, because they 
have to be a certain tier, a certain timeline? Emphasize that a 
little bit, would you please.
    Mr. Pugh. That means these folks are probably going to go 
out of business, which is going to have another direct effect 
to highway safety, because you are taking some of the safest 
operators off the road.
    These people, like myself, who own their own trucks, have 
their own businesses, most of them run used equipment. They 
don't want to buy new equipment. For one, the used older 
equipment, as you well know, is much more dependable. You can 
get along with it better and you can work on it yourself. And 
it is very expensive to own and operate----
    Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. An average farmer trying to fix 
this electronic gear on a truck that you only get to use 5,000 
miles, 10,000 miles a year or even the guy that hauls hay for 
us here. They don't put that many miles on so that a used truck 
that has 400,000 when they buy it is pretty useful to them.
    So, lastly, this comment here that the more lane-miles you 
add, the more congestion you get. So, does that mean that we 
are going to have less congestion if we tear out lanes on the 
highway?
    Do you want to take a stab at that, Ms. Osborne, as well as 
Mr. Pugh? Because that just doesn't compute for me, is that 
``let's make it one lane, we ought to have zero congestion,'' 
right? How the heck does that work?
    Ms. Osborne. Sometimes we do see traffic evaporate as he we 
shrink our roadways and shrink the footprint. I am just 
reporting on the facts. I am looking back at Federal data.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Traffic will evaporate if you make the road 
smaller?
    Ms. Osborne. We have seen that occur when the highways come 
down and a lot of----
    Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Is this because you frustrate 
people so much they don't even want to use it?
    Ms. Osborne. No, because it is just the principle of 
choosing the best path. People will choose different times of 
day rather than taking discretionary trips during the most 
congested hours, things like that.
    Mr. LaMalfa. So, like, if there were less restrooms, would 
there be shorter lines for the restroom?
    Ms. Osborne. Well, I love your restroom example, because it 
is like saying I should have seven bathrooms in my house 
because I will have a party one time of the year and I need to 
make sure no one stands in line.
    Mr. LaMalfa. No, but a city has traffic all the time, have 
people going in and out for entertainment, moving products and 
all that. I just can't believe we are sitting here saying that 
the more miles we tear out, the less congestion we are going to 
have with a growing population.
    Ms. Osborne. The results of more miles have not been good.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Pardon?
    Ms. Osborne. The results of our strategy have not been 
effective.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Well, if we are having more and more demand 
faster than we build, that might be one thing, but tearing 
out--anyway, I will yield back, Mr. Chairman. That is all I can 
do.
    Mr. Burlison. The Chair recognizes Mr. Van Drew.
    Mr. Van Drew. Thank you, Chair. Instead of implementing the 
mandates guaranteed in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is moving 
forward with a proposed speed limit mandate.
    This rule would potentially limit trucks over 26,000 
pounds--and I don't have to tell you all, you know this 
already--to a single top speed of 60 miles an hour through the 
use of an electronic engine control unit, which is called ECU, 
that will be capable of governing a truck's speed regardless of 
the speed limit.
    On top of this, the Biden administration has been fast-
tracking their woke climate change agenda, which is leaving the 
American people and the transportation industry dangerously 
vulnerable. It is going to create a lot of problems in the 
future.
    In the next 10 years, the administration's goal is to force 
more than half of the people into electric vehicles. But our 
power grid can't take it. It is unreasonable. It doesn't make 
sense. It is not an all-of-the-above approach, and it is not 
ready for this rushed implementation, which is purely for the 
sake of politics.
    I have always believed that good politics is good 
Government. Well, this is bad Government, and it is bad 
politics. Our grid was never designed to support a fully 
electric economy and the push far outpaces the demand for 
electrification.
    A recent study commissioned by the Clean Freight Coalition 
stated that the price to build out the supporting charging 
infrastructure to fully electrify the trucking industry--
everybody ready for this--would cost $1 trillion. Not $1 
billion--$1 trillion. A large burden of that cost being borne 
by who? Trucking fleets.
    And, again, of course, if the trucking fleets are absorbing 
it, who is really ultimately going to be placed on the chopping 
block here? The American consumer. They are going to pay the 
price.
    I am telling you, Americans, American citizens, American 
consumers are getting tired of it. They are tired of 
politicians coming up with crazy plans to fulfill their 
political agenda that accomplish nothing and, worse yet, 
actually hurt.
    At the end of the day, both groups are going to pay more, 
and all the money that goes to this faceless entity that does 
nothing to help the American consumer or the trucker--and I 
would maintain the trucker and the American consumer are in 
this together, and they are in lockstep. Because if the trucker 
gets hurt, the consumer gets hurt.
    Mr. Pugh, the trucking industry moves 72 percent of the 
Nation's freight with slim margins, again, as you know better 
than I do. What will be the impact to the trucking industry 
and, most importantly, the consumer if you are forced to 
electrify on the current timelines and the current proposals?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes, thank you. And, if I may, the American 
trucker is getting a little tired of it, too, just like the 
American consumer. They are tired of being the guinea pigs for 
all of this stuff that comes out of the EPA. We were guinea 
pigs in 2008, we were the guinea pigs in 2011, and we are going 
to be the guinea pigs again.
    And what's happened? Every time we have been a guinea pig, 
a whole sector of our industry got wiped out because they 
couldn't afford this--either couldn't afford it, or once they 
got it, it didn't work like it was supposed to, and they 
couldn't afford the maintenance to maintain it and to keep 
these kind of trucks on the road.
    Truckers want clean air. We all want clean air and clean 
water, but let's let the free market figure this out. Free 
market always does better than Government heavy-handedness.
    Mr. Van Drew. Absolutely. You are absolutely right. I just 
want you to know that I believe the majority on this committee 
supports the truckers, supports the hard work that you do. I 
mean, Americans support it because, guess what? If you are not 
there moving goods across this great country of ours, the 
American people are the ones that are going to suffer, and they 
know how hard you work. It is a hard job. It is not easy, and 
we appreciate it.
    There has also been legislation introduced to Congress that 
would increase the minimum required liability insurance level 
for motor carriers by more than 500 percent. Not 5 percent, not 
50 percent--500 percent from the current levels of $750,000 to 
$5 million. This is, obviously, a tremendous increase that I 
suspect would have a major impact on trucking companies, 
especially the smaller ones.
    This is a country of small businesses, but we keep--when I 
say ``we,'' I don't mean all of us in Congress, but there are 
some folks that keep forgetting about the basis of this 
country, which is hard-working men and women who are small 
businesses. So, for once, we don't again do something to help 
the small businessmen, but maybe the one time we will.
    Can you explain, Mr. Pugh, how the current system is 
working and what the effects of these proposed changes would 
have?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes. I mean, the current system is working pretty 
well. There have been plenty of studies come right out of 
Washington that over 99.4 percent of all accidents are covered 
with the $750,000 there is today. That is $750,000, just for 
history, that was just sort of pulled out of the air. It wasn't 
like they did a study or anything to come up with it. And it 
continues to work, and it is covering.
    I don't think there are too many laws or regulations here 
that come out of Washington, DC, that cover 99.4 percent of all 
things. And the other 0.6, they said there is no amount of 
money that could cover it. If you raise these minimums 500 
percent, this is nothing but a sellout to all the trial lawyers 
who got the billboards all up and down the highways saying sue 
truckers, sue truckers, sue truckers. Can't go anywhere without 
seeing these billboards. Sue. You are in a truck accident; sue.
    We forget that over 80 percent of these accidents are 
caused by the car, and the cars never carry enough insurance to 
cover the loss of the trucker. Nobody wants to talk about that.
    Mr. Van Drew. It is what you see on TV--and I am going to 
wrap up with this. American people are tired of it. Of course, 
the truckers are tired of it. And, you know what--I don't mean 
to be crude here, but we are tired of the hard-working average 
American in whatever job consistently being screwed by 
politicians. Thank you for your work.
    I yield back.
    Mr. LaMalfa [presiding]. The gentleman yields back. We have 
concluded our round of questions here, but I would allow a 
second round of questions for anybody that wishes to. I will 
have one myself. I recognize myself for 5 minutes; if there are 
others that would like to as well.
    Let me come back to the automated devices. I am going to 
focus on Mr. Pugh once again here.
    Now, in my personal life I get really tired of getting 
gonged out all the time because I left the key in the ignition 
or I am driving around my fields and don't have my seatbelt on 
as I am jumping in and out and irrigating, and you can't shut 
the damn things off. The dealer says, oh, it is a safety thing. 
Well, I have enough of a brain to figure out when I can do it 
safely or not.
    But we are not given that credit, especially as truckers 
who put in lots of miles--many, many miles--as professionals. 
So, more and more things are being done to take away their 
discretion and their ability, especially mom-and-pop truckers 
that are maybe not covering the vast majority of miles or hours 
doing so.
    So, again, we are talking about automatic emergency braking 
systems, the speed limiters we talked about, ELDs, which are 
not very highly favored by the smaller truckers. And then truck 
shutoff devices that automatically shut the truck off after 
reaching hours-of-service limits. Now, nothing mankind makes is 
perfect, so, these systems can all glitch.
    I have to wonder about--and we are seeing this on 
automobiles, cars and pickups, that they glitch. And you have 
got automatic braking. If it detects you are too close to 
another car, and you are driving along and the car is jerking 
on you, trying to do things automatically for you. People 
aren't perfect, but neither are the devices.
    So, Mr. Pugh, talk about--and a scenario I have heard about 
is that with automatic emergency braking systems, what if you 
are driving an 80,000-pound rig in an icy condition and 
something detects that we need to jam on the brakes? What does 
that do to upset the control of the truck in that situation or 
others that you know of that you can tell the committee here 
today?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes. Thank you. Yes. In short, it will put you 
into a skid if you are not real careful or don't know what you 
are doing. That is where I point out the fact, as I said 
earlier, cars are much different than trucks. A truck is way 
longer. It is 65, 70 feet long, the tires are bigger, where the 
wheels of the tires are at on the road at the time. Then you 
add in the different kinds of loads.
    If you are hauling a low load of pieces of pipe or 
something, it doesn't stand very high on your trailer, you have 
a lower center of gravity, that handles completely different 
than if you are hauling a giant single coil that weighs 50,000 
pounds and is 6 feet tall but only 4 feet wide. You are a very 
high center of gravity, it is easy to tip.
    Put liquid into the mix. If you pull a tanker--I pulled a 
tanker for a little bit. I generally said it felt like you were 
on a boat all the time, because as you are going down the 
highway, that stuff is in there sloshing. You are on an icy 
road and you hit the brakes or they automatically just lock up, 
and that chemical or something that is in that tanker comes 
forward, it is going to put you in a heck of a situation. You 
are going to be passing yourself.
    Mr. LaMalfa. The trucker is thinking about that load as he 
is going, whereas the automatic device just wants to be 
automatic, right?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes. I mean, as a trained trucker----
    Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Thinking about that in respect 
to a liquid and such.
    Mr. Pugh. In my opinion, as a trained trucker--and this is 
what we should be looking at is training truckers instead of 
coming out with all kinds of electronic devices that dumb down 
the industry. Let's train the people behind the wheel to drive 
the truck.
    I hauled frac sand for a long time down in West Virginia in 
the mountains. You have to know what you are doing to drive 
off-road and go up the side of a mountain. I mean, I was pulled 
up the side of a mountain with a dozer it was so steep. You 
can't make computers, in my opinion, that can do these kind of 
things.
    And you know what, we all forget--and you said it yourself, 
Congressman--computers have bad days, too. I can't get my 
freaking phone to sync to my 2022 Ford pickup truck half the 
time, and I think that is pretty basic technology. But it 
doesn't work a lot.
    But now we want to put all these things into trucks and 
say, hey, you are safer now. We teach pilots to fly the plane 
before we teach them to fly the plane with all the technology. 
Let's teach truckers to drive----
    Mr. LaMalfa [interrupting]. Well, we had an issue with 737s 
that they had too much gadgetry on there they were relying on 
instead of the pilot knowing how to fly the plane, and I 
wholeheartedly agree with you on that.
    The more automated it is, the easier it is for people to 
get lazy on automobiles. Truckers are pretty disciplined.
    But talk quickly about the automatic shutoff devices for 
reaching hours of service. Now, since these things can glitch--
my tractors glitch, my combines glitch. I mean, what kind of 
scenario would you see of a possible engine shutoff because it 
reaches hours of service while somebody is still actively 
driving? What's the possibility of that?
    Mr. Pugh. To be clear, Congressman, I don't think there is 
really a device that shuts your truck off because you are 
nearing out of service. You do have the ELD in your truck which 
keeps track of your hours of service. And what that will do is 
once you go over, it is going to flag you in violation.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Right.
    Mr. Pugh. Where that becomes a problem, if I may, is 
drivers every day are left with a decision on whether they can 
park their truck in a safe place to take a break or be in 
violation to try to find a safe place.
    We saw a tragic accident in Illinois 6 months ago where a 
bus hit a truck that was illegally parked. That trucker had to 
make that decision, and he was tired. So, he pulled off on that 
ramp to get a break because we don't have enough parking in 
this country.
    I drove by that ramp last week going back to Kansas City 
from my home in Ohio visiting family. That ramp on Sunday 
morning at 8:30 in the morning, there were 10 trucks down that 
ramp and out along the side of that highway, that same ramp, 
because we still have nowhere to park these trucks.
    Mr. LaMalfa. I have seen them. Yep. And then we still have 
the problem, are they carrying hazardous products or livestock 
that, you know, they got caught in traffic and they need an 
extra bit of time. There isn't that discretion to get to a 
location that is safe or be able to offload the livestock. 
Sometimes you need an extra hour. And then the rules come down 
so hard upon them.
    So, in general, what we are hearing is that--and close on 
this, Mr. Pugh--we have a general regulatory direction that 
seems to take away the ability of the individuals to make good 
decisions, make safe decisions because Government is overriding 
and a device is overriding.
    Is that the general feel of your drivers in your industry?
    Mr. Pugh. Yes. I think that is a general feel. I think my 
drivers would like to start seeing commonsense regulation that 
is coming from experienced truckers. And instead of making 
regulations on a false fake driver shortage narrative, which is 
we have seen over and over and over, that is where this 
electronic stuff is. Because we keep saying we have this driver 
shortage that we don't have. We have a training shortage, we 
have a parking shortage, we have a pay shortage. We don't have 
no driver shortage.
    So, let's keep people in this industry. Let's listen to the 
people who do the job.
    Mr. LaMalfa. Yes. I have violated my own timeline here, so, 
I better yield back to the committee here.
    I appreciate the answers and--so, with that, I don't see 
anybody else here who wants to go for a second round. So, no 
further questions from the committee, we will conclude our 
hearing for today. I would like to thank all of the witnesses 
for being here and for your testimony.
    With that, the committee stands adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:01 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

 Letter of July 23, 2024, to Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford, Chairman, 
    and Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on 
Highways and Transit, from Alliance for American Manufacturing et al., 
       Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
                                                     July 23, 2024.
Honorable Rick Crawford,
Chair,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, Committee on Transportation and 
        Infrastructure, Washington, DC 20515.
Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, Committee on Transportation and 
        Infrastructure, Washington, DC 20515.
    Dear Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Norton,
    In advance of the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit July 24, 
2024, hearing to examine pending regulatory and administrative issues 
at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), we write to highlight 
actions we believe necessary to ensure that federal Buy Clean policies 
are implemented in a way that enhances the competitiveness of domestic 
industry, creates good jobs for America's workers, and reduces 
pollution by encouraging the use of low-embodied carbon (LEC) 
construction materials.
    With the right implementing policies in place, a preference for LEC 
construction materials has the potential to incentivize and accelerate 
capital investments to support strengthening and decarbonization of 
domestic manufacturing across all of our industrial sectors. Effective 
implementation of this policy stands to support good jobs in 
communities around the country and reward companies producing cleaner 
goods while incentivizing fellow domestic competitors to follow suit.
    FHWA has a key role to play in ensuring that the goals of a federal 
Buy Clean program are met. In March 2024, the FHWA announced the $2 
billion Low-Carbon Transportation Materials Grants Program (LCTM)--as 
authorized in IRA Section 60506 and codified in 23 U.S.C. 179--to fund 
procurement of low carbon materials, including concrete (and cement), 
glass, asphalt mix, and steel. Key details of the program are currently 
being formulated by FHWA. Thus, our organizations appreciate the 
opportunity to highlight several critical implementation 
recommendations necessary for the success of the Buy Clean program. 
This includes ensuring that incentives to decarbonize are accessible to 
all domestic firms, fully implementing Buy America policies, and 
providing clarity, consistency, and certainty for all stakeholders.
FHWA's Buy Clean Program Must Distinguish Between Primary and Secondary 
                              Steelmaking
    To meet the goals of Buy Clean, FHWA must structure its program to 
foster competition among like firms by distinguishing between primary 
(integrated) and secondary (electric arc furnace, or EAF) steelmaking. 
Failing to do so risks undermining the intent of the policy by not 
incentivizing all segments of the industry to reduce emissions. Steel 
is produced using two distinct feedstocks: primary steel is 
predominantly produced from iron-ore pellets whereas secondary steel is 
produced predominantly from scrap metal. Both steel production pathways 
are critical for maintaining national and economic security, and to 
meet growing infrastructure demands. In some cases, each is distinctly 
necessary for different applications.
    Given the typically higher emissions intensity of primary 
steelmaking, a single Buy Clean standard that compares the global 
warming potential (GWP) of primary steel to that of secondary steel 
fails to recognize that primary steelmaking will not be replaced with 
secondary steelmaking. A single standard would not only adversely 
impact the climate goals of lowering carbon emissions, but also jobs--
specifically union jobs throughout the integrated steelmaking supply 
chain--by excluding domestic primary producers from Buy Clean markets. 
Such an outcome further risks displaced production and thereby leaking 
emissions to countries with lower climate standards.
    Distinct standards will push primary producers to compete with each 
other, leading to lower emissions, while fostering similar competition 
among secondary steel facilities. A single steel standard would give 
primary steel producers no incentive to decarbonize and would merely 
reward secondary producers for their existing business model. Congress 
clearly intended for the funding authorized in IRA Section 60506 to 
incentivize and accelerate capital investments in the strengthening and 
decarbonization of domestic manufacturing across all of our industrial 
sectors--not for it to exclude primary steel producers and their 
workers--including union workers--from decarbonization incentives. As 
longstanding and steadfast backers of Buy Clean policies, our 
organizations believe that FHWA must adhere to the clear congressional 
intent underlying this authorization.
    Moreover, a bifurcated standard for steel would make FHWA's Buy 
Clean program consistent with that of the General Services 
Administration (GSA), which, in cooperation with the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA), recognized this imperative by distinguishing 
between primary and secondary steel production processes. To ensure a 
clear standard is being set for all industry participants across the 
government, FHWA should incorporate in its solicitation criteria 
distinct standards for primary and secondary steel consistent with GSA.
      Buy Clean Must Account for Buy America + Buy Clean Coverage 
                             Discrepancies
    The 2021 Build America, Buy America (BABA) Act in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law (BIL) addressed loopholes, narrow agency 
application, excessive use of waivers, and weak federal enforcement by 
harmonizing and modernizing Buy America rules. BABA also expands 
coverage to more infrastructure materials, programs, and projects. 
While waivers are still available in select circumstances to overcome 
short-term market limitations, enforcing BABA fulfills the demand of 
taxpayers to close loopholes, provide more oversight, and better 
support U.S. manufacturing and good-paying jobs for workers across 
various sectors. Successful implementation of BABA will ensure that 
taxpayer dollars support U.S. supply chains, workers, and communities 
instead of foreign competitors while preventing leakage of jobs and 
emissions overseas.
    Our organizations have urged that Buy Clean policies be implemented 
concurrently with full implementation of statutory Buy America 
requirements, as failure to do so could have negative outcomes for 
domestic manufacturers and American workers. Further, this would 
undermine our shared climate goals to grow a cleaner domestic 
manufacturing sector using the purchasing power of federal acquisition 
and federal assistance.
    While federal assistance through FHWA is subject to Buy America 
policies, there are many instances when foreign sourcing is permitted--
through policy loopholes, waivers or other policies that narrow their 
application. For instance, cementitious materials have been statutorily 
exempted as a ``construction material'' in BABA, meaning there are no 
equivalent domestic preferences in place for a variety of carbon-
intensive materials like cement, concrete, and asphalt. A successful 
Buy Clean program that relies first on LEC materials produced by U.S. 
workers must account for these policy shortcomings.
               Additional Buy Clean Implementation Issues
    Our organizations have highlighted a number of additional actions 
necessary to build on the success enjoyed to date and ensure these 
policies have a more meaningful and positive impact in the future. To 
ensure harmonization, clarity, consistency, and certainty, these 
recommendations include:
    1.  Prioritizing a consistent set of definitions for new or 
previously narrowly used terms in Buy Clean implementation and 
compliance;
    2.  Ensuring consistency of underlying datasets and threshold 
criteria;
    3.  Expanding the coordinating role of the Federal-State Buy Clean 
Partnership to avoid unworkable or conflicting policies;
    4.  Providing technical assistance, particularly to small- and 
medium-sized enterprises;
    5.  Improving communications around federal solicitations; and
    6.  Conducting broad stakeholder engagement, particularly with 
labor, environmental, other non-governmental organizations, and 
industry stakeholders.

Letter of August 6, 2024, to Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford, Chairman, 
    and Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on 
  Highways and Transit, from Jim Tymon, Executive Director, American 
 Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Submitted 
            for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
                                                    August 6, 2024.
The Honorable Rick Crawford,
Chair,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, Committee on Transportation and 
        Infrastructure, United States House of Representatives, 
        Washington, DC 20590.
The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, Committee on Transportation and 
        Infrastructure, United States House of Representatives, 
        Washington, DC 20590.
    Dear Chair Crawford and Ranking Member Norton:
    The American Association of State Highway and Transportation 
Officials (AASHTO) welcomes the opportunity to submit this letter for 
the record of the hearing entitled ``Examining the Department of 
Transportation's Regulatory and Administrative Agenda'' held on July 
24, 2024. AASHTO, representing state departments of transportation 
(state DOTs) in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto 
Rico, is grateful to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit for 
holding an important oversight hearing on the U. S. Department of 
Transportation's (USDOT) regulations and implementation of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
    One key area of focus for the hearing was related to the use of 
regulations to reduce the tragic number of fatalities and injuries that 
occur each year on this nation's roadways. State DOTs have no higher or 
more urgent priority than ensuring the safety of every user of our 
nation's transportation system. State DOT employees work hard every day 
to keep their families, friends, neighbors and travelers in their 
states safe when using their transportation networks. Yet this country 
continues to experience a crisis in which too many users of our 
transportation system do not make it home safely. It is crucial to 
address this crisis using all means and methods at our disposal. As 
called upon by AASHTO President Craig Thompson, the state DOT community 
is harnessing all their data and best practices to significantly move 
the needle on safety across the country. AASHTO and our members believe 
achieving this goal is our shared responsibility and collaborative 
action offers our best opportunity to achieve it.
    In order to resolutely and firmly reinforce the commitment of state 
DOTs' to connecting places and communities with a transportation system 
free of fatalities and serious injuries, AASHTO held a highly 
successful Safety Summit in October 2023 that brought together a broad 
array of transportation stakeholders to discuss strategies and steps 
that can be taken together to achieve this commitment. To continue this 
momentum, another edition of the Safety Summit is planned for this 
October. AASHTO also strongly supports the priorities outlined in the 
USDOT National Roadway Safety Strategy and proudly served as a First 
Mover among the Allies in Action.
    In addition, AASHTO's Board of Directors passed the Safety 
Resolution in November 2023 which established AASHTO's Safety Action 
Plan, that:
    <bullet>  Promotes sharing notable practices, tools, policies, and 
other resources among states.
    <bullet>  Promotes a coordinated and consistent data-driven 
decision-making approach to road safety throughout the project 
lifecycle.
    <bullet>  Prioritizes resources that need to be developed by AASHTO 
or others to assist state DOTs in institutionalizing safety.
    <bullet>  Identifies actions for AASHTO councils and committees to 
undertake individually or jointly to implement and enhance the plan.
    <bullet>  Establishes new partnerships to further promote a culture 
of safety.

    When looking at advancing safety through performance management and 
target-setting, AASHTO and its members acknowledge and appreciate that 
what we measure matters, with the nation's state DOTs serving as 
primary stewards of the federal performance management framework that 
was enacted in 2012 under the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st 
Century (MAP-21) Act. Since initial implementation began in 2013, with 
the full effect of the federal law and subsequent iterations of the 
Federal Highway Administration's regulations being in place since 2018, 
state DOTs have delivered on the Congressional intent of the 
performance management provisions--which is to provide a consistent 
framework to measure the performance of the transportation system.
    Under state DOTs' leadership, the national performance management 
framework has been implemented in a manner that advances a safer and 
more efficient transportation system while minimizing undue regulatory 
burdens on states. Given the scale and complexity of this framework, 
there continue to be recognized challenges to further accomplish a 
safer and more efficient transportation system, an area in which the 
state DOTs and USDOT continue to address through their longstanding 
partnership.
    Target setting--including for MAP-21's safety performance 
measures--is a significantly data-driven and multidisciplinary process 
that seeks to close the gap between the policy goals and real-world 
outcomes in a strategic manner. Congress recognized in 23 USC 150 that 
this strategic approach required target-setting flexibility that best 
meets the unique needs of each state, which are impacted by a wide 
range of constraints and opportunities affecting their specific 
transportation system. Available funding, legislative mandates and 
priorities, and issues identified through the public involvement 
process can factor into states' planning and target-setting. In 
addition, population growth, a growing economy, and increased 
international trade are expected to result in growing passenger and 
freight movement, all of which can impact performance measures both on 
aggregate and per-capita basis--sometimes in different directions. 
Consequently, it is essential that states and metropolitan planning 
organizations (MPOs) have the flexibility to set targets, including 
targets that have performance holding steady or, in some situations, 
declining. This flexibility is critical to state DOTs to balance the 
breadth of performance measures they must address.
    AASHTO has consistently stated that state DOTs must maintain the 
ability to set targets for improving, declining, or constant 
performance because an important function of performance management is 
to answer two broad questions:
    <bullet>  What performance can be achieved? In other words, what 
type of performance level can be achieved given the resources 
available?; and
    <bullet>  What resources are needed? In other words, how much 
funding is needed to achieve a certain performance level?

    Improving targets may or may not be achievable depending on many 
factors, including trends in the state, the economy, and the level of 
autonomy the state DOT has to impact activities that could support 
target attainment. In addition, FHWA's guidance on performance 
management and target setting states that:

        ``The FHWA strongly discourages the use of aspirational 
        targets. In 23 CFR 490.101, a target is defined as a 
        quantifiable level of performance or condition, expressed as a 
        value for the measure, to be achieved within a time period 
        required by FHWA.

        Setting aspirational targets that are not data-driven, 
        realistic, or achievable does not align with the performance 
        management framework or the stated congressional policy to 
        improve project decision-making through performance-based 
        planning and programming . . .'' \1\

    And:

        ``FHWA strongly discourages using aspirational targets or TZD 
        [toward zero deaths] targets for setting annual targets . . .

        States and MPOs should ensure their annual targets are data-
        driven, realistic and achievable. Setting aspirational or TZD 
        targets that are not data-driven, realistic or achievable does 
        not align with performance management framework or the stated 
        congressional policy to improve project decision-making through 
        performance-based planning and programming (23 U.S.C. 150(a)) . 
        . .

        The Statewide and Metropolitan Transportation Planning Rule (23 
        CFR Part 450) also requires States and MPOs to take a 
        performance-based approach to planning and programming, linking 
        investment decision-making to the achievement of performance 
        targets in the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program 
        (STIP) and the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) (23 CFR 
        450.206 & 23 CFR 450.306). It may be difficult to demonstrate 
        how investments contained in the STIP and TIP link to 
        achievement of targets if the targets are aspirational or not 
        data-driven. This requirement applies to safety targets in 
        addition to other performance areas.'' \2\

    Safety will always be the highest priority for state DOTs. AASHTO 
remains extremely concerned with the increases in roadway fatalities 
and serious injuries in recent years, and state DOTs are doing all they 
can--including through performance management--to improve real world 
outcomes and most importantly, save lives.

        Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Ranking Member,
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee on 
        Highways and Transit, U.S. House of Representatives, 
        Washington, DC 20515.
    Dear Chairman Crawford, Ranking Member Holmes Norton and Members of 
the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's 
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit:
    On behalf of Associated Builders and Contractors, a national 
construction industry trade association with 67 chapters representing 
more than 23,000 members, I write to thank you for holding a hearing on 
``Examining the Department of Transportation's Regulatory and 
Administrative Agenda.'' This hearing is vital to ensuring the U.S. 
Department of Transportation conforms with congressional intent. It 
also provides the U.S. House of Representatives the opportunity to 
evaluate DOT's policies and priorities, which have a significant impact 
on infrastructure projects nationwide.
    Since Pete Buttigieg became secretary of transportation in January 
2021, he has played a significant role in promoting the Biden-Harris 
administration's sweeping environmental and labor initiatives rather 
than prioritizing efficient and economical infrastructure improvements. 
Specifically, through notice of funding opportunities and regulations, 
Secretary Buttigieg has implemented policies that discriminate against 
businesses and workers in favor of special interests. Rather than 
welcome all American businesses and workers to participate on 
infrastructure projects, the DOT stripped the ability of many small 
businesses to compete fairly for projects.
    ABC is extremely concerned with the trajectory of Secretary 
Buttigieg's DOT. Most critical for ABC and our members are the 
determinantal rulemakings that the DOT advanced along with the 
stipulations its has placed on taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects 
highlighted below:
    <bullet>  National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Standards and 
Requirements: On Feb. 28, 2023, the DOT's Federal Highway 
Administration released a final rule that establishes the National 
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program. This rule implements 
provisions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into 
law in 2021, which include $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging 
stations (including $5 billion over five years to install EV chargers 
mostly along interstate highways). The intent of the program is to 
support the installation of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers across 
the country by 2030 as part of a domestic push to shift away from gas-
powered vehicles. As part of the rule, DOT requires all electricians 
working on electric vehicle supply equipment either be certified by the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' Electric Vehicle 
Industry Training Program or be a graduate or recipient of a continuing 
education certificate from a government-registered apprenticeship 
program with a focus on EVSE installation approved by the U.S. 
Department of Labor in consultation with the DOT. This discriminatory 
rulemaking disregards ABC's comments on the proposed rule, which 
expressed concern the rule would prohibit qualified contractors from 
building EV chargers and bottleneck workforce development. As of July 
23, reports indicate that only seven of 500,000 electric vehicle 
charging stations have been constructed with the $7.5 billion in 
federal investment available through the FHWA's National Electric 
Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program.

    <bullet>  Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability 
and Equity Grant Program: The RAISE Grant Program provides federal 
assistance to state and local government entities for the purpose of 
major surface transportation infrastructure projects. At least $2.275 
billion in funding appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act and other funding sources is available. Unfortunately, the DOT 
attempted to steer these funds toward applicants that require project 
labor agreements on their projects by including specific language in 
the notice of funding opportunity indicating that PLAs will increase 
applicants' scores for ``partnership and collaboration,'' improving 
their chance of receiving RAISE funds. ABC has consistently and 
vigorously opposed government-mandated PLAs and PLA preferences on 
federal government and federally assisted construction projects, as 
well as state and local government infrastructure projects. PLAs 
needlessly increase costs, chill competition and steer hundreds of 
billions of dollars' worth of construction projects funded by taxpayers 
to well-connected special interests, i.e., construction unions and 
contractors signatory to specific construction unions party to a PLA.

    <bullet>  Additional Grant Opportunities: Despite the negative 
impact of language and policies promoting PLA mandates and preferences, 
ABC has identified a significant number of federal agency grants issued 
by the Biden-Harris administration similar to the RAISE Program--
totaling more than $270 billion for infrastructure projects procured by 
state and local governments. These preferences and mandates will 
increase costs and reduce competition on federally assisted 
construction projects. Specific to the DOT, ABC has identified 25 
federal grant opportunities since 2022, totaling more than $51 billion, 
that include project labor agreement preferences. These DOT preferences 
provide grant applicants preferable treatment, by increasing the score 
regarding economic competitiveness and partnership. In addition, others 
clearly state that projects with PLAs will be prioritized. The 
misguided pro-PLA objectives advanced by Secretary Buttigieg's DOT are 
wide reaching and extend to the following: RAISE Grants NOFO, Bus/Bus 
Facilities NOFO, Combined NOFO, Small Shipyard Grants NOFO, Carbon 
Reduction Program Guidance, Safe Streets and Roads for All NOFO, 
Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Safety and Modernization Grant 
NOFO, Bridge Investment Program NOFO, Port Infrastructure Development 
Program Grants NOFO, RAISE NOFO, All Stations Accessibility Program 
NOFO, Ferry Programs Combined NOFO, Reconnecting Communities Pilot 
Program NOFO, Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program, Promoting Resilient 
Operations for Transformative, Efficient, and Cost-Saving 
Transportation Program, Combined NOFO FY2023-2024, Department of 
Transportation Bridge Investment Program, Large Bridge Project Grants 
and the Department of Transportation RAISE Grants FY 2024 NOFO.

    The DOT policies under the Biden-Harris administration prevent some 
of the best and most experienced federal contractors from pursuing 
federal construction contracts funded by taxpayers for no other reason 
than because these large and small businesses are not willing and able 
to sign a union agreement. By mandating PLAs, the Biden-Harris 
administration is steering work toward its special interests, which 
comprise 10% of the industry, at the expense of taxpayers and free 
enterprise.
    To prevent the DOT from including pro-PLA language within its 
discretionary grant programs, ABC urges you to co-sponsor H.R.1209, the 
Fair and Open Competition Act, to ensure federal and federally assisted 
contract awards occur through a fair and competitive bidding process 
that allows all qualified contractors to compete on a level playing 
field based on merit, experience, quality and safety to deliver the 
highest-quality projects at the best cost.
    ABC appreciates the opportunity to comment on the committee's vital 
oversight of the DOT. It is essential the committee encourages the DOT 
to prioritize our nation's infrastructure over radical policy 
initiatives.
    ABC members stand ready to build America's infrastructure in the 
21st century.
            Sincerely,
                                        Kristen Swearingen,
                 Vice President, Legislative and Political Affairs,
                               Associated Builders and Contractors.

  Statement of the National Association of Small Trucking Companies, 
       Submitted for the Record by Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford
    The National Association of Small Trucking Companies (NASTC) 
appreciates the subcommittee's holding this hearing to examine the 
Department of Transportation's (DOT) regulatory and administrative 
agenda. Regrettably, the Biden-Harris administration's DOT has wielded 
an even heavier hand than the Obama administration did. And the costs 
and burden of this regulatory morass fall disproportionately harshly on 
small trucking firms.
    NASTC is a member-based organization whose 14,000 member companies 
range from a significant segment that operates as a single-power-unit, 
owner-operator model to carriers having more than 100 power units; 
NASTC members average 12 power units. These companies mostly operate in 
the long-haul, over-the-road, full-truckload, for-hire, irregular-route 
sector of interstate trucking. NASTC members come from the largest 
segment of America's long-haul trucking: small motor carrier 
businesses. They are representative of the vast majority of our 
nation's commercial motor carriers, those having fewer than 100 power 
units.
    Recent estimates quantify how much the regulatory burden costs the 
U.S. economy. The National Association of Manufacturers says the total 
cost is $3.1 trillion annually.\1\ In its analysis, the Competitive 
Enterprise Institute says the current administration has been much more 
regulatorily active than its immediate predecessor administrations.\2\ 
CEI's report puts total compliance costs and economic effects due to 
federal regulations at $2.1 trillion annually. DOT ranks third ``most 
active rule-producing executive branch'' agency in the U.S. government 
for FY 2023. President Biden in three years has averaged 87 highly 
significant rules per year; in four years, President Trump averaged 72 
annually, including more than 50 deregulatory actions that reduce the 
costs regulations impose; President Obama, over eight years, averaged 
69 completed economically significant rules annually; over his eight 
years, President George W. Bush averaged 49 completed economically 
significant rules per year.

regulations/#crains
    \2\ https://cei.org/studies/ten-thousand-commandments-2024/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Furthermore, regulatory ping pong is alive and well, including at 
DOT. The Obama administration proposed a host of trucking regulations. 
The Trump administration withdrew many of them. The Biden-Harris DOT 
revived those regulatory proposals, such as the speed limiter 
rulemaking and the safety fitness determination (SFD) rulemaking. NASTC 
opposes these regulations.
    As we have expressed to the committee many times before, mandatory 
speed limiters would create rolling traffic jams and increase 
congestion, frustration, and risky driving tactics--leading to more 
highway accidents, injuries, deaths, and property loss. Meanwhile, it 
would deprive small carriers of the ability to drive the speed limit on 
highways, as opposed to the governed trucks of the megacarriers as a 
means to control their fuel costs. This would raise costs of operation.
    The SFD rule would further confuse the issue that the Compliance 
Safety Accountability's (CSA) subjective, spottily data-based, unfair-
to-small carrier ratings have completely failed to achieve since its 
initiation in 2010. If this administration's Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety Administration (FMCSA) were serious about ensuring carrier 
safety, it would implement the idea NASTC has advocated for several 
years now: Scale up the new entrant virtual safety inspection such that 
bi- or triennial safety ``audits'' are conducted on every carrier with 
DOT authority (i.e., FMCSA would oversee sufficient numbers of 
contractors to conduct audits of half or one-third of the population of 
interstate motor carriers each year); each ``audit'' should result in 
issuance of a Satisfactory safety rating, unless objective evidence 
leads to subsequent investigation; FMCSA should provide extensive due-
process measures to ensure a carrier can efficiently, promptly take 
measures to warrant and expeditiously receive at least a Conditional 
rating within five days.
    Another regulatory burden is the automatic emergency braking (AEB) 
mandate. This was enacted in the infrastructure law. AEBs in heavy 
vehicles will cause more wrecks than they prevent. The technology is 
far too premature to use at scale, much less to mandate on commercial 
vehicles.
    These regulations were rejected over the years since CSA was 
initiated, and resurfaced under each Democratic administration. They 
should be rejected now and in the future (and the AEB mandate 
repealed).
    In addition, the Biden-Harris administration threatens trucking and 
its ability to perform the vital role it plays in our supply chains 
through several other lines of regulatory assault. One is the 
Environmental Protection Agency's phase 3 greenhouse gas standard. The 
EPA reaches the height of absurdity with such an unachievable, 
unrealistic GHG requirement. This obviously is part of the 
administration's zealotry for forcing America, including the trucking 
industry, into all-electric vehicles. The administration's ultimate 
goal, the elimination of internal-combustion vehicles, faces an 
American public that rejects that destination.\3\ Moreover, the cost is 
prohibitive. The Roland Berger firm has estimated that infrastructure 
costs alone for fully switching trucking to electric power would cost 
$1 trillion.\4\ Then the extra weight of electric batteries translates 
into less freight that a single tractor-trailer could haul, requiring 
many more vehicles on the road to carry the same amount of freight 
larger capacity rigs carry today. Such absurd regulatory burdens will 
carry unreasonable costs that will necessarily be passed along to 
shippers, warehousers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and 
consumers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finally, there is the heavy-handed regulatory excess of the 
administration's assault on the independent contractor model. The 
Biden-Harris Department of Labor is pursuing policies that would 
essentially federalize the California AB5 law and its ``ABC test'' for 
worker reclassification. Blue-collar entrepreneurs in the trucking 
sector opt for independent-contractor status. Yet, the Biden 
administration seeks to impose AB5's reclassifying independent owner-
operators as ``employees'' on the entire United States. Land Line 
reports, ``California has made an adversary out of many in the trucking 
industry . . . [and is] driving truckers out of the state.'' \5\ AB5's 
B prong (The service is performed outside the usual course of the 
business of the ``employer.'') is impossible for most independent 
contractors, including those in trucking, to meet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ Mark Schremmer, ``AB5 creates `hurdle' for truckers, California 
Trucking Association leader says,'' Land Line (April 13, 2023) (https:/
/landline.media/ab5-creates-hurdle-for-truckers-california-trucking-
association-leader-says/).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It would be bad enough if these regulatory measures were enacted by 
Congress. The end-running of the legislative branch, abuse of 
administrative authorities, and overreaching regulatory processes 
corrupt the functioning of our government and make the governed cynical 
toward the federal government. The data in the findings of the above-
cited and other studies show that this administration has been overly 
energetic with administrative actions that foul up the separation of 
powers, the constitutional checks and balances, and the accountability 
of the regulatory and administrative state.
    We can assure the subcommittee that the Biden regulatory burden and 
cost are felt in the small trucking sector. Just in our relatively 
small population of companies, almost 4,000 member companies have 
closed or suspended their authority. In addition, we feel that almost 
all of these regulatory overreaches have violated the spirit and true 
meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act.
    This reregulation onslaught aimed at small businesses and the 
trucking industry has accelerated, it seems, as regulators have lost 
sight of our way of life, our economy, and our future. To the 
administration's shame, based on just-released fatality numbers for 
2021, since CSA's implementation in 2010, raw fatality numbers have 
skyrocketed from 3,675 in 2010 to 5,788 in 2021, and from 1.3 per 100 
million miles travelled to 1.9 per 100 million miles travelled those 
same years. And, for the first time in history, over 1,000 occupants of 
large trucks, almost all being professional CDL holders, lost their 
lives in highway accidents.

Letter of August 6, 2024, to Hon. Eric A. ``Rick'' Crawford, Chairman, 
    and Hon. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on

        Infrastructure, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 
        20515.
The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Ranking Member,
Highways and Transit Subcommittee, Committee on Transportation and 
        Infrastructure, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC 
        20515.

RE:  Letter for the Record of the Highways Subcommittee Hearing, 
``Examining the Department of Transportation's Regulatory and 
Administrative Agenda.''

    Chairman Crawford and Ranking Member Holmes Norton:
    NATSO, Representing America's Travel Centers and Truckstops, and 
SIGMA: America's Leading Fuel Marketers (together, the 
``Associations'') \1\ appreciate the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Highways and Transit Subcommittee (the ``Subcommittee'') 
for convening a hearing on the Department of Transportation's 
(``DOT's'') regulatory agenda. The Associations are concerned that the 
Department of Education, in conjunction with DOT, plans to propose a 
rule that would expand the definition of a vending machine under the 
Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility Program to allow electric vehicle 
(``EV'') charging at Interstate rest areas.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ NATSO currently represents approximately 5,000 travel plazas 
and truckstops nationwide, comprising both national chains and small, 
independent locations. SIGMA represents a diverse membership of 
approximately 260 independent chain retailers and marketers of motor 
fuel. Together, the Associations represent approximately 90 percent of 
retail sales of motor fuel in the United States.
    \2\ See the Biden Administration's Unified Agenda of Regulatory and 
Deregulatory Actions, ``Amendments to Definitions Under the Randolph-
Sheppard Vending Facility Program and Related Provisions of That 
Program and to the State Vocational Rehabilitation Services Program'', 
currently ``pending review'' by the Office of Management and Budget, 
RIN 1820-AB83, available at https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/
eoDetails?rrid=616662.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Any administrative action that would allow for EV charging 
infrastructure to be installed at rest areas on the Interstate right-
of-way would be in direct contravention of longstanding, clearly 
defined statute.\3\ Congress most recently reaffirmed this position 
under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 (``IIJA'').\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ 23 USC 111. Agreements relating to use of and access to rights-
of-way-Interstate System.
    \4\ P.L. 117-58 (2021).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Federal agencies do not have the authority to circumvent Congress 
and should therefore dispense with any impending regulatory action that 
would allow for commercial services at Interstate rest areas, including 
EV charging infrastructure.
           I. The Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility Program
    The Randolph-Sheppard Act of 1936 \5\ authorized the Vending 
Facility Program to provide blind business owners with remunerative 
employment and self-support through the operation of vending facilities 
on federal and other property. Randolph-Sheppard was intended to 
enhance employment opportunities for trained, licensed blind persons to 
operate vending facilities. More than simply providing passive income 
from vending machines on federal property to blind individuals, 
Randolph-Sheppard is a success because it provides blind entrepreneurs 
with the opportunity to own and operate their own business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \5\ P.L. 74-732, as amended by P.L. 83-565 and P.L. 93-516; 20 
U.S.C. Sec. 107 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 II. The Rest Area Commercialization Ban and Vending Machine Exception
    When Congress created the Interstate Highway System in 1956, 
Congress and community leaders recognized that highways could 
potentially decimate local businesses, jobs, and tax bases as motorists 
bypassed cities and towns. Congress therefore included language 
prohibiting Interstate System rest areas located along the right-of-way 
from offering commercial services. As a result, a robust off-highway 
business environment emerged at the Interstate exchanges. Since its 
enactment, Congress has repeatedly and consistently upheld the ban on 
offering commercial services on the Interstate right-of-way, including 
the recently enacted IIJA.
    The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 added a narrow 
exception for vending machines, with a priority given for such machines 
operated by blind business owners pursuant to Randolph-Sheppard.\6\ 
This provision provided meaningful support to the blind community 
without undercutting the commercialization ban's underlying purpose of 
protecting off-highway communities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ P.L. 97-424, enacted Jan. 6, 1983, at 96 Stat. 2106 
[hereinafter the ``Vending Machine Exception''].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Vending Machine Exception directs that:

        ``Such vending machines may only dispense such food, drink, and 
        other articles as the State transportation department 
        determines are appropriate and desirable [emphasis added].''

    Congress approved the Vending Machine Exception with the intent 
that vending machines would offer limited food and beverage products, 
or other tangible articles, and that the exception would not undercut 
the general prohibition on offering commercial services, including 
automotive (i.e., refueling) services, at Interstate rest areas.
     III. The Vending Machine Exception is for Incidental Products
    The Vending Machine Exception was created to allow motorists to 
purchase incidental products at rest areas. When the exception was 
enacted, vending machines only provided snack food and beverage 
products such as candy bars, potato chips, and canned or bottled 
beverages. These types of products are incidental; the public would not 
stop at rest areas with the sole purpose of buying such products from 
vending machines. Instead, motorists stopping at the rest area for a 
different purpose (i.e., to stretch or use the restroom) will purchase 
something from a vending machine upon arrival. Were more robust food 
offerings to be made available, such as sit-down or take-out 
restaurants, motorists would bypass the vending machines and elect to 
purchase those options, undercutting nearby off-highway businesses and 
communities in addition to the vending machine operations of blind 
merchants at rest areas.
    Purchasing incidental products at a rest area merely supplements 
the motorist's brief stop; it poses no threat to off-highway businesses 
and localities. Off-highway businesses have continued to thrive in the 
time the Vending Machine Exception has been in place. Had Congress 
provided a broader exception to the rest area commercialization ban 
(such as encouraging motorists to stop at the rest area with the 
primary purpose of automotive services or purchasing food), it would 
have effectively overturned the Interstate rest area commercialization 
ban, undercutting off-highway businesses and localities. The Vending 
Machine Exception therefore must be limited to items that do not 
directly compete with off-highway businesses and localities so that the 
exception does not swallow the broader prohibition against 
commercializing the Interstate right-of-way.
    IV. The Vending Machine Exception Does Not Allow for EV Charging
    Statute is unambiguously clear that the Vending Machine Exception 
is not a mechanism to allow EV charging infrastructure in the 
Interstate right-of-way. Such a change in policy requires an act of 
Congress. As noted above, Congress recently considered, and rejected, 
this change in policy.
    The Vending Machine Exception allows vending machines located along 
the Interstate right-of-way to ``dispense food, drink, and other 
articles as the State transportation department determines are 
appropriate and desirable.'' The Federal Highway Administration defined 
vending machines in policy guidance issued in 1992 as follows:

        ``A vending machine is a coin or currency operated machine 
        capable of automatically dispending an article or product.'' 
        \7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ Federal Highway Administration, Federal Aid Policy Guide--Non-
Regulatory Supplement. Transmittal 6: Vending Machines in Interstate 
Rest Areas and Abandonment of Interstate Rest Areas (Oct. 5, 1992) 
available at: http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/real_estate/right-of-way/
policy_and_guidance/0752sup.cfm. This definition is virtually identical 
to the Department of Education's definition of ``vending machine'' 
under the Randolph-Sheppard Act. See 34 C.F.R. 395.1(y).

    Both the law and long-standing agency-established definitions make 
clear the intent behind the Vending Machine Exception is to provide 
articles and products to motorists as they briefly stop at an 
Interstate rest area. No reasonable interpretation of the law would 
allow for EV charging infrastructure to fall under the definition of a 
vending machine.
    EV charging is an automotive service. Installing EV charging 
infrastructure at an Interstate rest area would be akin to installing a 
self-service gas pump in the same location. Both require a motorist to 
insert currency into a machine that dispenses transportation energy to 
refuel their vehicle. Congress made its intent clear in 1956 that 
automotive service stations should not be located in the Interstate 
right-of-way. This includes the electrified vehicles of today, just as 
it has included vehicles that are fueled by other alternative fuels, 
including biomass-based fuels and liquid hydrogen fuel.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ See 102 Congressional Record, Senate, May 29, 1956, at page 
9207, adopting the amendment to prohibit ``automotive service stations 
or other commercial establishments for serving motor vehicle users to 
be constructed or located on the rights-of-way of the Interstate 
System.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  V. Installing EV Charging Infrastructure at Rest Areas Will Lead to 
                        Broad Commercialization
    The installation of EV charging infrastructure at Interstate rest 
areas will lead to broad rest area commercialization. Motorists today 
typically use the Interstate rest area to quickly use the restroom and 
grab refreshments from the vending machines operated by blind business 
owners before returning to their journey. If motorists stop at an 
Interstate rest area to charge their vehicle, they will be required to 
wait for 20-30 minutes without any of the services that a private 
business might offer. Permitting EV charging at rest areas would 
inevitably lead EV users, over time, demanding further erosion of the 
commercialization ban to enable them to purchase food and beverages at 
rest areas while they charge their vehicles.
      VI. Implications for Private Sector EV Charging Investments
    The Associations' members are actively engaging in the National 
Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (``NEVI'') grant program, which was 
created under IIJA. The NEVI program has the potential to prompt 
private sector investments that will enable recharging to look and feel 
similar to the existing on-the-go refueling experience. Our industry 
has invested heavily in the personnel necessary to navigate states' 
different application processes and criteria, along with the 
intellectual capital necessary to engage in opaque electricity markets 
and regulatory regimes that were not designed to drive private capital 
toward EV charging stations.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \9\ See Testimony of NATSO and SIGMA before the Subcommittee on 
April 30, 2024, available at https://transportation.house.gov/
uploadedfiles/04-30-2024_ht_hearing_-_kim_okafor_-_testimony.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    If EV charging were made available at rest areas, it would 
undermine our industry's existing and prospective investments in EV 
charging. It will also discourage future participation in federal EV 
charging grant programs.
                            VII. Conclusion
    We appreciate the opportunity to submit our concerns about DOT's 
efforts with the Department of Education to expand the definition of 
vending machine in the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facility Program and 
allow EV charging at Interstate rest areas. Our industry has 
demonstrated to this Subcommittee its willingness to invest in whatever 
refueling technology our customers want, including electricity. 
Regulations such as the proposal to amend the Vending Machine Exception 
will undermine off-highway businesses and communities and slow private 
investment in alternative fuels.
            Sincerely,
NATSO, Representing America's Travel Plazas and Truckstops.

Motor Vehicle Crashes are a Devastating and Costly Public Health Crisis
    In 2022, an average of 116 people were killed every day on roads in 
the U.S., totaling just over 42,500 fatalities.\i\ An additional 2.38 
million people were injured.\ii\ This represents a 29 percent increase 
in deaths in just a decade.\iii\ Early projections for 2023 traffic 
fatalities remain at a similar historic high level; nearly 41,000 
people are estimated to have died that year.\iv\ Tragically, 7,522 
pedestrians and 1,105 bicyclists were killed in 2022, representing a 57 
percent and 48 percent increase respectively in the past decade.\v\

and 2016 there was a change in data collection at U.S. DOT that could 
affect this calculation. From 2009 to 2015 the number of fatalities in 
truck-involved crashes increased by 21 percent, and between 2016 to 
2022, it increased by 27 percent.
    \viii\ Overview 2022 and Annual Report 2021. Note, the 117 percent 
figure represents the overall change in the number of people injured in 
large truck involved crashes from 2009 to 2022. However, between 2015 
and 2016 there was a change in data collection at U.S. DOT that could 
affect this calculation. From 2009 to 2015 the number of people injured 
in truck-involved crashes increased by 59 percent, and between 2016 to 
2022, it increased by 19 percent.

    Several leading behavioral issues continue to be leading factors in 
traffic fatalities including alcohol-impairment, speeding and lack of 
restraint use.\x\ Driver distraction is also known to be a principal 
cause of motor vehicle crashes.\xi\ In 2022, alcohol-involved crashes 
claimed the lives of 13,524 people, speeding-related traffic crashes 
killed 12,151 people, and 11,302 people killed in crashes did not 
buckle up, when restraint use was known.\xii\ This dangerous road 
epidemic is predicated on dangerous roadway design (See 2024 Dangerous 
by Design report). Additionally, in 2021, the most recent year for 
which data is available according to the Non-Traffic Surveillance (NTS) 
system, an estimated 3,990 people were killed in non-traffic motor 
vehicle crashes, an increase of 26 percent from 2020.\xiii\ And, since 
1990, at least 1,098 children have died in hot cars, including 14 
children this year.\xiv\ These issues are persistent, and the solutions 
are known and available, yet remain underused, underfunded, or 
unregulated and therefore not required as standard equipment in 
vehicles.

    The financial impact of motor vehicle crashes on our economy and 
our families is staggering. Conservatively, the annual economic cost of 
motor vehicle crashes is approximately $340 billion (2019 dollars).\xv\ 
In comparison, the budget for the modal agencies within U.S. Department 
of Transportation (DOT) responsible for roadway safety in 2024 is only 
a little more than 20 percent of that figure, at $74.8 billion.\xvi\ 
Essentially, every person living in the U.S. pays an annual ``crash 
tax'' of over $1,000. These crashes negatively impact businesses as 
well. According to the Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, the 
total cost of crashes to employers is more than $72 billion (2019 
dollars).\xvii\ Moreover, the total value of societal harm from motor 
vehicle crashes in 2019 was nearly $1.4 trillion.\xviii\

   Federal Safety Standards Have Saved Hundreds of Thousands of Lives
    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has 
estimated that between 1960 and 2012, over 600,000 lives have been 
saved by motor vehicle safety technologies.\xix\ Advocates always has 
enthusiastically championed rulemaking for innovative vehicle safety 
technologies shown to prevent injuries and deaths because it is 
effective. In 1991, Advocates led the coalition that supported 
enactment of the bipartisan Intermodal Surface Transportation 
Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 \xx\ which included a mandate for front 
seat airbags as standard equipment. As a result, by 1997, every new car 
sold in the United States was equipped with this technology and the 
lives saved have been significant. Airbags have saved an estimated 
50,457 lives from 1987 to 2017, according to NHTSA.\xxi\

    Requiring proven safety technologies as standard equipment in 
vehicles also promotes traffic safety equity for new car buyers, the 
next generation of used car buyers, other vehicle occupants and road 
users outside the vehicle when the rulemaking includes them, as it 
should when applicable. Rulemaking accelerates fleet penetration and 
amplifies the safety benefits of the technology while curbing its cost 
due to economies of scale.
    Advocates also publishes an annual Roadmap to Safety report. This 
comprehensive tool provides a guide for communities, state 
legislatures, governors, Congress, and the DOT on how to reverse the 
trend of skyrocketing deaths and injuries on U.S. roads.
    In stark contrast to the effectiveness of federal standards and 
proven safety technology, voluntary agreements have been found to be 
wholly ineffective. In fact, Congress rejected voluntary standards over 
50 years ago when it passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle 
Safety Act in 1966. As the Senate Committee Report stated, ``The 
promotion of motor vehicle safety through voluntary standards has 
largely failed. The unconditional imposition of mandatory standards at 
the earliest practicable date is the only course commensurate with the 
highway death and injury toll.'' \xxxv\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Voluntary agreements typically produce weak, limited outcomes that 
do not represent the best practices and state-of-the-art technology or 
systems. For example, the voluntary agreement announced by automakers 
in September 2019 on technology to prevent hot car deaths of children 
prolonged the timeline to get this equipment into new cars even though 
it is available at a very minimal cost now.\xxxvi\ The agreement also 
failed to include the important component that the systems must detect 
and alert to the presence of children who have been unknowingly left in 
or gained access to hot cars.\xxxvii\ Over two decades ago, in April 
2001, General Motors (GM) announced it would equip its new cars with 
technology that ``can detect motion as subtle as the breathing of an 
infant sleeping in a rear-facing child safety seat'' with the intent to 
begin rollout in 2004.\xxxviii\ Yet, to date GM, and most other 
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), still do not equip vehicles 
with such a safety system, and systems it does install only monitor the 
vehicle's rear doors instead of using a sensor to detect the presence 
of a child. In fact, Kids and Car Safety has documented hot cars 
incidents involving seven children who have died in vehicles equipped 
with door sequencing features.\xxxix\ Since 1990, nearly 1,100 children 
have died in hot car incidents and at least another 7,500 survived with 
varying types and severities of injuries, according to data collected 
by Kids and Car Safety.\xl\

    Most recently, the U.S. DOT issued a Final Rule on automatic 
emergency braking (AEB) for light vehicles which supports this 
position, ``Voluntary measures are intended to supplement rather than 
substitute for the FMVSSs, which remain NHTSA's core method of ensuring 
that all motor vehicles can achieve an adequate level of safety 
performance.'' \xli\

 The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Must be Implemented 
                    with Expediency and Thoroughness
    Commonsense solutions were advanced by this Subcommittee during the 
consideration of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
(IIJA).\xlii\ These include provisions and robust appropriation levels 
to advance the Safe System Approach (SSA) and Complete Streets policy 
which undertake a holistic method to improve safety for all in the 
roadway environment. Vehicle safety technology and roadway 
infrastructure improvements designed to upgrade safety have great 
potential to complement each other, ensure redundancy and save lives. 
For example, the IIJA authorizes safety upgrades to the Highway Safety 
Improvement Program (HSIP) which will help to protect vulnerable road 
users, such as infrastructure features that calm traffic and reduce 
vehicle speeds, separate road users to minimize conflicts, and deter 
dangerous driving. It also includes provisions requiring AEB for 
passenger motor vehicles and large trucks.\xliii\ According to the 
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), AEB has the capability 
to reduce car front-to-rear crashes with injuries by 56 percent and 
large truck front-to-rear crashes by 41 percent.\xliv\ NHTSA estimates 
that requiring AEB on light vehicles will save at least 362 lives and 
mitigate 24,321 non-fatal injuries annually.\xlv\ In addition to 
curbing the physical and emotional toll on families, the ripple effect 
of crash reductions is wide-ranging and results in less damage to 
infrastructure, less congestion caused by crashes, less crash related 
costs, and less expenditure of first responder and health care 
resources, among others.

    While Advocates lauds NHTSA for issuing a Final Rule earlier this 
year that requires passenger vehicles be equipped with an AEB system 
that detects pedestrians, the agency must promptly complete the 
rulemaking requiring AEB on heavy vehicles as well as other required 
rules to save lives and meet the deadlines set by Congress.\xlvi\ These 
include rulemakings involving advanced impaired driving technology; 
systems to address the issue of unattended children in vehicles leading 
to pediatric heatstroke; technology to curb driver distraction and 
automation complacency; lane departure warning and lane keeping assist 
systems; adaptive driving beam headlamps; upgrades to hoods and bumpers 
to better protect vulnerable road user safety; updates to the New Car 
Assessment Program (NCAP); seat belts for limousine passengers; 
strengthening seatback safety standards; and, automatic shutoff and 
keyless ignition systems. Additionally, numerous safety rulemakings 
mandated by Congress in laws preceding the IIJA are exceedingly 
overdue.\xlvii\

              Additional Safety Solutions Must be Advanced
    Several bills introduced in this Congress would help address the 
unacceptable death and injury toll on our Nation's roads and should be 
enacted without delay. These include: Complete Streets Act (S. 3670/ 
H.R. 7082); DOT Victim and Survivor Advocate Act (H.R. 8349); End DWI 
Act (H.R. 8213); Pedestrian Hazard, Awareness and Safety Expansion 
(PHASE) Act (HR 6111); Save Our Pedestrians Act of 2024 (H.R. 7191); 
She Develops Regulations In Vehicle Equality and Safety (She DRIVES) 
Act; and, Sarah Debbink Langenkamp Active Transportation Safety Act (S. 
3964/ H.R. 1668).
    Congress should take additional actions to address the public 
safety crisis on our Nation's roads. The IIJA permitted federal funding 
for automated enforcement (speed and red-light cameras) in work and 
school zones.\xlviii\ Congress should include high injury networks and 
continue to encourage the use of this technology to address dangerous 
driving behaviors. Further, drugged impaired driving poses a 
significant threat to roadway users. Establishing roadside testing 
technology, accelerating research to determine a causal link and a 
standard for cannabis impaired driving, and substantial funding for law 
enforcement training can all help to address this deeply concerning and 
growing issue.

    Unfortunately, several misguided measures introduced in this

The Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton,
Ranking Member,
Subcommittee on Highways and Transit.
    Dear Chairs Graves and Crawford and Ranking Members Larsen and 
Holmes Norton,
    We write to express our serious concerns regarding the Department 
of Transportation's (DOT) continued delay in implementing two critical 
rulemakings essential for improving truck safety on our nation's roads: 
the requirement for automatic emergency braking (AEB) on all new large 
trucks, and the mandate for speed limiters in large trucks weighing 
26,001 pounds or more.
    These delays could not have come at a worse time. In 2022 alone, 
truck crash fatalities reached a staggering total of 5,936 and injuries 
exceeded 160,000. These alarming figures continue a trend of worsening 
truck safety since 2009. Unfortunately, the DOT has continued their 
troubling trend of inaction and delay.
    The pushback of the AEB rule for large trucks is extremely 
troubling. Congress recognized the necessity of this safety technology 
when they mandated its use as part of the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act (IIJA) in 2021. By reducing impact speeds or preventing the 
crash entirely, AEB could be the difference between life and death in 
instances of driver fatigue, distraction, and impairment.
    In addition, the DOT has been deliberating on the implementation of 
a heavy vehicle speed limiter rule since petitioned in 2006, so it 
strains the credibility of the agency that the government has had 
insufficient time to move this rule forward. Speed limiters are a vital 
and proven tool in ensuring that large trucks operate at safe speeds, 
which directly aligns with one of the five pillars of the 
Administration's Safe System Approach: Safer Speeds.
    The DOT's inaction not only is counter to their own Safe System 
Approach, but more alarmingly puts the lives of countless Americans at 
risk. It is imperative that we hold the DOT accountable for these 
delays and urge them to expedite the rulemaking processes for both AEB 
systems and speed limiters in large trucks.
    We respectfully urge the Subcommittee to question the DOT on the 
reasons behind these delays and to advocate for the swift 
implementation of these critical safety measures. The lives lost to 
truck crashes are not just statistics; they are beloved family members, 
friends, and community members whose deaths could be prevented with 
timely and effective regulatory action.
    Thank you for your attention to this pressing issue and for your 
commitment to improving truck safety on our nation's highways.
            Sincerely,
                              Institute for Safer Trucking.

                               Appendix

                              ----------                              


Question from Hon. Dina Titus to Tim Duit, President, Duit Construction 
Company, Inc.; on behalf of the American Road & Transportation Builders 
                          Association (ARTBA)

    Question 1. Your testimony notes that roughly 900 fatalities occur 
in and around transportation construction worksites every year. Unlike 
most transportation projects, infrastructure solutions to protect work 
zones are not permanent and need to take into account the temporary and 
often mobile nature of a roadway construction site. Furthermore, a tow 
truck driver is killed every six days due to the dangers they face on 
the front lines. That's why I have been a longtime supporter of a House 
resolution, which passed out of this Committee, to promote ``move 
over'' laws.
    For construction workers, what specific types of projects or safety 
interventions should Congress consider funding to reduce fatalities and 
ensure a safe workplace?
    Answer. The safety and welfare for all those who work or travel on 
America's transportation network are the highest priorities for the 
American Road and Transportation Builders Association (ARTBA).
    Safety efforts are part of--and must be aligned with--a 
comprehensive approach that includes operations, maintenance, education 
and emergency response efforts. Congress can play an important role in 
protecting roadway workers by implementation of the following 
initiatives:
    1.  The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act placed a significant 
emphasis on protecting ``vulnerable road users'' or VRUs. Subsequently, 
the U.S. Department of Transportation has required states to include 
protections for VRUs in their state Strategic Highway Safety Plans 
(SHSP). While roadway workers are by definition VRUs, very little 
recognition is being given to them on the SHSPs. Congress could provide 
more direct support for worker protection as VRUs.

    2.  We have seen significant improvements to pedestrian safety in 
school zones thanks to the use of speed safety cameras and increased 
law enforcement. Congress should consider more aggressive support for 
these applications in roadway work zones, as well.

    3.  Congress created the National Work Zone Safety Information 
Clearinghouse to create improved information and communication about 
the need for work zone safety. The resources devoted to the operation 
have dwindled and not kept up with inflation. Increased funding for the 
Clearinghouse, particularly focused on driver awareness and speed 
compliance, is needed to keep pace with the increasing numbers of work 
zone related fatalities and injuries.

    4.  The Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) should remain 
focused on infrastructure safety activities, while also supporting 
collaborative safety strategies and worker protection.

    5.  Positive protection, wherein a physical barrier divides a work 
zone from traffic in specific situations, is an effective means of 
worker protection. Congress should consider policies that include clear 
definitions and more consistent application of positive protection to 
encourage its greater use on highway construction projects.

    6.  Congress should support efforts to study and address mental 
health rates in the U.S. construction industry. Currently, suicides in 
the industry are more than four times the national average. Devoting 
resources to improving total worker health is also important to 
ensuring a safe workplace.

 Questions from Hon. Steve Cohen to William ``Lewie'' Pugh, Executive 
 Vice President, Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA)

    Question 1. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) 
directed the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement rules 
on rear and side underride guards. OOIDA has expressed strong 
opposition toward these devices.
    Considering the physical size and weight mismatch between 
commercial motor vehicles and passenger vehicles, as well as between 
commercial motor vehicles and vulnerable road users, how does OOIDA 
propose to address the gory dangers of underride accidents without 
placing all responsibility on victims?
    Answer. This question unfortunately demonstrates a major disregard 
for the safety of truckers, who are also victims of underride crashes. 
Truckers are not immune to serious injury or death in an underride 
crash simply because they are operating larger and heavier vehicles. In 
fact, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, operating a 
commercial motor vehicle (CMV) is one of the top 10 most dangerous 
occupations for Americans. We are disappointed a long-time member of 
the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee doesn't better 
appreciate the safety risks our members face when they are involved in 
collisions of any kind.
    Your question erroneously states IIJA ``directed the U.S. 
Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement rules on rear and side 
underride guards'' [emphasis added]. While IIJA included an enhanced 
rear underride guard requirement, which OOIDA supported, the bill only 
required additional research and feasibility assessments involving side 
underride guards. The legislation provided DOT the opportunity to 
develop performance standards only ``if warranted'', but by no means 
directed DOT to implement any rules on side underride guards.
    This is an important distinction to make, as DOT was also directed 
to provide your Committee with a determination as to whether the 
Secretary intended to develop performance requirements following the 
additional research and assessment. DOT deferred this determination 
until it received recommendations from the Advisory Committee on 
Underride Protection (ACUP) and completed an analysis of the comments 
received on its Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM). While 
all these factors have been completed, DOT has not advanced the 
rulemaking. Considering the department has a long history of declining 
to pursue such mandates due to their inherent impracticality and 
analyses that consistently show costs would dramatically outweigh 
safety benefits, coupled with the defective and clearly biased final 
report produced by the ACUP's `majority' members, we anticipate DOT 
will ultimately determine performance standards remain unwarranted.
    We likely agree CMVs are involved in crashes with passenger 
vehicles at an unacceptable rate, but it's important to remember the 
Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance estimates 70% of these crashes are 
caused by the passenger vehicle driver. Therefore, it stands to reason 
passenger vehicle drivers are likely responsible for an even larger 
portion of underride crashes due to the nature of these accidents. When 
discussing the responsibility for reducing underride crashes, we 
believe stakeholders must better prioritize safety policies targeting 
those most commonly responsible for collisions. We find it remarkable 
that leading proponents of side underride guard mandates remain focused 
almost exclusively on unproven, impractical, and cost-prohibitive crash 
mitigation proposals, with little to no attention paid to preventing 
underride crashes from occurring in the first place.
    This glaring oversight is perfectly illustrated by the ACUP's 
`majority report'. In IIJA, Congress explicitly directed ACUP to 
``provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on safety 
regulations to reduce underride crashes and fatalities relating to 
underride crashes'' [emphasis added]. Unfortunately, the `majority' 
members of ACUP were so predisposed to produce a report that featured a 
side underride guard mandate they nearly forgot about the first 
objective you prescribed entirely--reducing underride crashes. For 
example, the `majority report' says nothing about the need to improve 
passenger vehicle driver training, especially involving how to safely 
share the road with CMVs, and only recommends flashing light mandates 
for trailers when addressing the growing problem of distracted driving, 
which is unquestionably insufficient. Considering these proponents have 
continuously reached legislative and regulatory dead-ends in their 
quest to impose a clearly unworkable and ineffective mandate, we find 
their lack of interest in crash prevention solutions striking.

    Question 2. The Advisory Committee on Underride Prevention was 
convened to advise the DOT on underride crashes, but it appears that 
the only proposal that the ``majority'' and ``minority'' agreed on was 
that more research and analysis are required.
    How can Congress help encourage parties with such divergent 
opinions to reach actionable conclusions?
    Answer. First, Congress is unquestionably responsible for the 
failure of the ACUP. Over our objections, you deliberately authorized 
an unbalanced panel of stakeholders and tasked them with reaching 
consensus on ways to reduce underride crashes and fatalities related to 
them. At the time, we warned that purposely granting such an advantage 
to biased, inexperienced, and unqualified advocates would jeopardize 
the panel's ability to achieve its mission of developing a concise, 
data-driven report that garnered consensus support among participants 
and stakeholders.
    ACUP conducted a series of public meetings on various underride 
topics beginning in May 2023. Over the course of these meetings, ACUP 
predictably failed to work in a collaborative and consensus-driven 
fashion. Safety advocacy representatives brazenly manipulated their 
numerical advantage in membership to approve a motion to redefine 
``consensus'' as a simple majority that minimized opposing viewpoints 
of other ACUP participants. As a result, the Committee was forced to 
produce a `majority' report and a dissenting `minority' report along 
with individual letters of concurrence and/or non-concurrence rather 
than a single, unified document. This represents a complete and total 
failure of the `majority' members to follow crystal clear Congressional 
direction. If these advocates can't be compelled by a sympathetic 
Congress to work in a collaborative manner to achieve their goals, we 
struggle to understand why you're asking truckers how parties with such 
divergent opinions can reach actionable conclusions.
    If you genuinely want to develop solutions supported by diverse 
stakeholders, our advice is you stop pacifying and empowering those who 
not only continue to display an open hostility to collaboration with 
industry, but have gone so far as to redefine the term ``consensus'' to 
advance their single-minded objectives.
    OOIDA recognizes that both truckers and the driving public share 
responsibility for reducing underride crashes, as well as potential 
injuries and fatalities resulting from them. Demonstrating this, our 
2019 letter to you outlining our priorities for surface transportation 
reauthorization (ultimately IIJA), explained, ``we support the 
establishment of an enhanced rear underride guard on the manufacture of 
new trailers''. Our support for this requirement was rooted in the fact 
the equipment would improve safety in a cost-effective manner, without 
presenting operational challenges or safety concerns for truckers. 
Enhanced rear guards are a reality today because all stakeholders 
agreed their installation was a practical solution. Clearly, there are 
opportunities for stakeholders to work together to improve underride 
safety.

      Questions from Hon. Steve Cohen to Beth Osborne, Director, 
                 Transportation for America (T4America)

    Question 1. Over 22,000 students take school buses in Memphis, 
Tennessee, and most walk to school bus stops. Unfortunately, the city 
tops the list of those that are Dangerous by Design for pedestrians. 
Furthermore, laws defining illegal passing around school buses and 
stop-arm violations vary from state to state and are not consistently 
enforced.
    Question 1.a. How can roads be designed to support the safety of 
students when they get on and off school buses?
    Question 1.b. How can we invest in school bus safety while 
balancing other priorities like increasing accessibility or minimizing 
congestion?
    Answer to 1.a. & 1.b. My organization has been writing about the 
need for changes to street design for a long time--the first edition of 
Dangerous by Design came out in 2009. Despite the discouraging trends 
in pedestrian safety, our message remains consistent. In order to make 
environments safer for people walking, we need to actually change our 
environments. The data are clear that improving street design to slow 
cars, reduce conflict points, and provide proper and consistent 
infrastructure for pedestrians is the only way we'll move the needle on 
safety.
    This is the point of Vision Zero: roadway design impacts behavior, 
and high speed is only appropriate on a separated roadway, not around 
cross streets, stopping vehicles, pedestrians, and especially school 
children.
    Streets that are designed for speed enable, if not outright 
encourage, reckless driving behavior. And these are the places where 
people are killed while walking, biking, and rolling. In the same way 
that we know what design interventions can save lives, we know what 
street designs contribute to the rising fatalities. A driver traveling 
45 mph on an arterial road will find it hard to see the arm on the bus 
go up and react in time to stop for the school children crossing. That 
is because the road is not designed for stops: it is designed like a 
highway and drivers react appropriately. On some level we know this, so 
enforcement seems unfair, as the roadway design is unfair, setting the 
driver up to make an error.
    If we want a child to be safe on the street when they get off the 
school bus, streets need to be redesigned and repurposed to provide 
safe, accessible, and convenient places for people walking. Using 
medians, curb extensions, and pedestrian refuge islands can achieve 
this while simultaneously delivering important cues to drivers on how 
to safely navigate the space. FHWA has really good guidance on 
pedestrian safety countermeasures. We know what to do. We don't do it 
because people fear it will lead to slower vehicle movement and 
congestion, which is a higher priority than the safety of the people 
using the transportation system. We are going to have to face and own 
it or reckon with it if we want different results.
    What is interesting is that the U.S. is terrible at providing 
smooth, convenient, predictable auto travel. Trip lengths have 
increased across the board and congestion is far worse today than 30 
years ago. Congestion isn't even the right goal, access to jobs and 
essential services is the point. If people could get where they needed 
to go in 10 minutes with traffic or in 50 minutes with no traffic, 
almost everyone would choose the former (and the latter is vastly more 
expensive). Access to jobs and essential services (schools, groceries, 
banks, etc.) can be addressed by improving vehicle movement, transit 
service, walking and biking or economic development (build more jobs 
and stores, and build some closer to people that don't have them close 
by). The choice isn't congestion v. safety: it is speedy vehicles v. 
safety with better access to the things we need.

    Questions from Hon. Colin Z. Allred to Beth Osborne, Director, 
                 Transportation for America (T4America)

    Question 1. Ms. Osborne, you're likely aware that Artificial 
Intelligence, or AI, has emerged as a useful tool across all industries 
including in the transportation sector. In fact, in May 2024, DOT 
published a request for information on the ``Opportunities and 
Challenges of Artificial Intelligence in Transportation.'' Are you 
concerned about the impacts of potential AI regulations on the 
transportation sector? How can we ensure appropriate regulation without 
suppressing innovation?
    Answer. Artificial Intelligence in transportation, like many new 
tools and technologies, has the power to transform the way we travel, 
the efficiency of the transportation system and how our communities are 
designed. However, if we want any tool or technology to accomplish a 
particular goal, we need a policy that steers it in that way. Tools 
have no capacity to deliver any particular outcome without that policy. 
Automobiles were the new technology a century ago and yet the 
transportation system varies across U.S. cities and the world, based on 
how that tool was deployed.
    My organization is currently using AI to evaluate how federal 
funding under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) will 
impact GHG emissions. AI allows us to go through 50,000 projects with a 
small staff. We will use that same technology to see how current 
spending will affect the state of repair of our roads and bridges among 
other outcomes. AI can help us determine how many places people can 
reach by all modes of travel too. But the AI does not inherently know 
that this is the goal.
    Many have concerns about the safety of AI in vehicles, both in 
terms of hacking and the vehicle operating in a way that endangers 
people in and around those vehicles. I have to leave the issue of 
hacking to others. But in terms of safety, I fear that we program the 
AI to prioritize vehicle movement, just as we have in all other rules, 
designs and procedures. As a result, our current transportation system 
is the most unsafe in the developed world (by a lot)--and yet we have 
all the technologies that others with much safer roads do. Without a 
change in our policies and designs, AI will likely help us build more 
of what we have been building with more of the same results, but 
faster.
    Recognizing that, it seems safe to proceed carefully, testing the 
impact of AI deployment. It is not as if we are risking holding back an 
outcome that only AI can identify or know. It is our job to test how 
well it works in enacting our priorities rather than test every 
possible application without a sense of what we are trying to 
accomplish.
    My concern is that, in AI (and in automation more generally), 
people see what they want to see. For some, an automated vehicle is a 
way to give more people access to a private automobile; while for 
others, it is a way to reduce the number of cars on the road. Though 
contradictory, both sides see the future they wish for. AI as the 
Rorshak test of transportation futures.
    AI will only produce the outcomes we want to the extent we deploy 
it to do so. And that brings us to the core of the problem with our 
transportation system: our national transportation policy is, 
currently, to send money to the states to build transportation things. 
Throughout my career, we have been able to agree on little more. AI 
will not chose our priorities for us. We have to do that.

       Questions from Hon. Dina Titus to Beth Osborne, Director, 
                 Transportation for America (T4America)

    Question 1. In 2022, 235 people were killed on roads in Clark 
County, Nevada, with 85 of those deaths resulting from excessive 
speeding. The Department of Transportation has listed safer speeds as a 
top objective of its National Roadway Safety Strategy.
    DOT has also proposed additional actions to mitigate fatalities 
from high speeds, but what more can the administration be doing to 
protect all road users?
    Answer. Speeding is incredibly dangerous, but we forget in the 
country that many legal speeds are just as dangerous. Sixty-three 
percent of pedestrians--nearly two-thirds--are killed on roads posted 
for speeds of under 50 mph. These roads are often in busy activity 
centers that lack sufficient protection for people on foot.
    Fundamentally what this country gets wrong is thinking we can have 
highway speeds in areas with lots of conflict points--driveways, cross 
streets, on-street parking and vulnerable users. We knew when we built 
the Interstates that this was impossible which is why we built the 
Interstates with managed entrances and exits and no development 
adjacent, cross streets, driveways or vulnerable users. Now we design 
the danger right in and this is allowed by federal rules and adopted 
design guides, like the MUTCD and AASHTO Green Book. FHWA does not need 
to adopt standards and guides that permit dangerous conditions. In 
fact, they should do the opposite.
    As Chris McCahill stated in a guest post in our latest Dangerous by 
Design report, ``Preventing pedestrian deaths requires a paradigm shift 
in thinking about traffic speeds and road design. In major activity 
centers and anywhere people might be walking, speeds above 30 mph pose 
an exponentially greater risk. That means it is not just the 
responsibility of drivers to obey speed limits, but it is also up to 
road designers to set appropriate target speeds that both support lower 
limits and encourage slower driving.'' (emphasis added)
    If we want people to drive the speed limit, we need to design our 
roadways in a way that makes that speed limit the easiest speed to 
travel. Current practice is to design roadways for 10-15 mph higher 
than the posted speed limit, assuming that people will speed. And that 
is exactly what we get. If we want people to travel a safe speed then 
we need to set safe speed limits and then design for that speed.
    Some specific strategies for speed management that USDOT 
recommends:
    <bullet>  Developing and implementing jurisdiction-wide speed 
management programs and plans.
    <bullet>  Outlining how to set safe, consistent, and enforceable 
speed limits based on the presence of all road users and context and 
not just drivers' operating speeds.
    <bullet>  Applying proven safety countermeasures to help achieve 
safe speeds for the safety of all roadway users.
    <bullet>  Improving crash data report forms with targeted reporting 
of speeding-related crashes that provides consistency and focuses on 
identifying contributing factors.
    <bullet>  Deploying enforcement through transparent high-visibility 
activities, educational programs, and awareness campaigns rather than a 
strictly enforcement focus.
    <bullet>  Considering equity in speed management decision making.

    The Vision Zero approach is: the faster the traffic, the more 
separated the roadway needs to be from oncoming traffic and conflicts. 
That means high speed roadways need to be fully separated from the 
community, and roadways in the community need to be slow. The in-
between is the unsafe zone where the United States lives and we get 
predictable results. As Strong Towns says, our roads are the 
transportation equivalent of a futon, which is not a particularly good 
bed or sofa. Our roadways designed to try to do everything are not 
particularly good at moving traffic swiftly or serving the local 
community effectively and safely. FHWA could require the community it 
funds to choose one of the safe options (fast and separated or slow and 
integrated), but it would be easier with Congressional direction and 
backing. Sadly, I do not think that is forthcoming on either side of 
the aisle.

    Question 2. Transportation remains the largest economic sector 
creating carbon pollution in the United States.
    Why is it important for states to calculate emissions and set 
targets to understand their impact on climate change?
    Answer. You can only address what you measure. My organization 
covers the importance of measuring the performance of the 
transportation system in terms of climate in Driving Down Emissions. 
The U.S. simply will not meet our transportation climate goals if we 
don't know where the problems are, but it is clear that many people do 
not want us to address emissions from vehicles, whether we are talking 
about greenhouse gas emissions or criteria pollutants that harm human 
health (and they tend to go together).
    Beyond that, Congress is taking hundreds of billions of the 
American taxpayers' hard earned money, and those taxpayers deserve to 
know what they are getting for it. Nothing should be hidden from them. 
I am reminded of a quote from the musical ``1776'' when Stephen Hopkins 
is told he is the deciding vote on whether the Continental Congress 
will debate a resolution on independence: ``Well, I'll tell you, in all 
my years, I never seen, heard, nor smelled an issue that was so 
dangerous it couldn't be talked about. Hell yes, I'm for debating 
anything!'' That is how I feel about measuring the impacts of 
transportation. I have never seen, heard or smelled an issue that was 
so dangerous it couldn't be measured and reported to the taxpayer. And 
I look with suspicion on anyone who is not willing to do so, much less 
block this information. Hell yes, I'm for measuring anything!
