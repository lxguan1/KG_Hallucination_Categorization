                              ----------                              


                        THURSDAY, MARCH 16, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:03 a.m., in 
room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Maria 
Cantwell, Chairwoman of the Committee, presiding.
    Present: Senators Cantwell [presiding], Klobuchar, Markey, 
Peters, Baldwin, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Lujan, Hickenlooper, 
Warnock, Welch, Fischer, Moran, Sullivan, Budd, and Vance.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON

    The Chair. Good morning. The Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation will come to order. This morning, 
we are having a hearing on strengthening the aviation workforce 
and we have a distinguished panel here. I plan to have the 
majority of the chairing--the hearing chaired by my colleague, 
Senator Duckworth, a pilot in her own right and Chair of the 
Subcommittee.
    And, but I am going to make an opening statement and have 
our colleagues make opening statements, Senator Moran, and then 
turn it over to her. Yesterday at the FAA Safety Summit, there 
was agreement that there has been an uptick in safety 
incidents, from near-misses to runway incursions.
    Among the critical action items is ensuing that we 
increased training to account for human factors in the cockpit 
and in the control tower. We have always had the risk of human 
error, but as we bring in new safety workforce, we must double 
down on the human factors and training.
    We also must have the right safety equipment to identify 
and prevent runway incursions and near-misses, and these 
airport surface device detection systems that are deployed at 
some airports, and other technologies like them can help air 
traffic controllers on track the movement of aircraft on the 
ground and facilitate communications between the tower and the 
cockpit.
    These type of investments are needed for situational 
awareness and to prevent incidents or accidents. So, the FAA, I 
believe, must move forward with these safety upgrades. As 
Captain Jason Ambrosi can tell us, this means having also 
enough qualified and talented individuals trained with the most 
up to date expertise in every work group, not just the pilots.
    The FAA workforce must keep pace too, and that is what we 
are here to discuss this morning. We must continue to invest in 
an FAA that has 45,000 employees, including 14,000 air traffic 
controllers, 5,000 flight standard workers, and 1,500 aircraft 
certification personnel.
    So, I look forward to hearing from David Spero, 
representative of the FAA safety profession, on this issue. And 
from airlines to airports to aerospace manufacturers, Americans 
go to work each day basically depending on these individuals.
    According to the FAA, aviation contributed to more than 5 
percent of our GDP, $1.9 trillion in total economic activity 
and supported 11 million jobs. The ranking--the subcommittee 
ranking member, Senator Moran, knows this well.
    He and I worked on a lot of issues trying to train and 
skill a workforce for tomorrow. And as this footprint continues 
to grow, we see the economic opportunities for our Nation. 
According to the Department of Transportation, the U.S. airline 
industry employed 787,328 workers in January 2023, nearly 8 
percent more than the pre-pandemic time period of 2019.
    The U.S. aircraft manufacturing sector is expected to hire 
more than 10,000 workers in 2023, as production increases 
continue to rise, and careers in this field offer highly 
skilled, good paying jobs with an average salary of over 
$106,000, about 40 percent above the national average, 
according to the Aerospace Industry Association.
    So, we are proud of this talented workforce, particularly 
in my home state. The State of Washington is home to more than 
130,000 aerospace workers and the supply chain that works with 
more than 1,500 suppliers.
    With post-pandemic aviation growth, we now face new 
challenges and we need to develop a pipeline of qualified 
workers to replace those who either retired or voluntarily left 
the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the next 20 
years, to meet projected growth in commercial aviation, we will 
need 128,000 pilots, 134,000 maintenance technicians, 173,000 
crew members in North America alone.
    So big opportunities for us to skill and train a workforce 
for the jobs of tomorrow that are already here today. I look 
forward to hearing from our witnesses about how we can expand 
access to aviation jobs through all parts of America. Now more 
than ever, we cannot afford to leave good talent on the table.
    Dr. Rebecca Lutte will tell us about women and people of 
color, and how they are still underrepresented in aviation 
careers, and that bridging this gap is a key to ensuring a 
strong aviation system, and certainly making education pilot 
access to that diverse workforce more affordable so that they 
can get the skill set of the future.
    Women represent roughly 5 percent of airline pilots, less 
than 12 percent of aerospace engineers, and yet make up 47 
percent of the total workforce. So, we have got to bridge the 
gap, and I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. I 
want to thank Ms. von Muehlen for being here from Alaska 
Airlines.
    We talked last week and she had a very compelling story 
about her own career and what they are trying to do to meet the 
gap locally in the Pacific Northwest. According to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, less than 15 percent combine of pilots and 
engineers are of black or Hispanic or Asian.
    And we are going to hear about what we can do to build this 
pipeline for the future. The cost of flight education, as I 
mentioned, is one of those barriers. A traditional 4-year 
institution can range past $100,000 subject to rising tuition 
fees, and that is why we need to consider policies that will 
help drive down those cost and get more students into the 
aviation talent pool.
    In 2018, we led efforts here on an FAA grant program to 
help develop a more inclusive talent pool of aviation pilots 
and aviation technicians. And today, I have letters for the 
record from two recipients of the 2023 FAA workforce grant 
recipients in the State of Washington, Aviation Technical 
Services in Everett and Redtailed Hawk's Flying Club in 
Mukilteo, part of the Black Pilots of America.
    This funding will help aviation technical services develop 
and train new airframe mechanics and support military veterans 
transitioning to a civilian workforce, and it will enable 
Redtailed Hawks, a flying club, to help underserved and 
underrepresented students access aviation education.
    These Washington State organizations are training the next 
generation of aviation professionals and Congress should 
consider more ways to buildup this successful program. I think 
we will also hear about how the ROTC could play a very vital 
role, too. And we should consider that.
    So, strengthening our aviation workforce, having the right 
people, having the right skillsets, making safety in aviation 
the number one priority, that is what we are here to discuss 
this morning. So, thank you to all the panelists, and now I 
will turn it to Senator Moran.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS

    Senator Moran. Well, thank you very much. I am excited 
about this hearing. I recognize its value and importance. Know 
that we have a lot of expertise in the room.
    I think this country and certainly the State of Kansas, the 
State of Washington, is poised for further growth related to 
aviation and aerospace, and the limiting factor is highly 
motivated, trained, and educated workforce.
    So, we have our work cut out for us and you outlined the 
statistics that demonstrate how much opportunity and how much 
challenge we have. During the 2018 FAA reauthorization, 
Congress worked to address this issue by creating the Aviation 
Workforce Development Grant Program aimed at strengthening the 
pool of pilots in aviation maintenance and technical workers.
    A total of $10 million in grants was awarded to more than 
20 recipients, but the demand sought by all those applicants 
was over $120 million. Industry, academia, and Congress all 
recognize that in order to remain a global leader in aviation, 
we must have a strong workforce.
    I am honored to lead the hearing today and gain insight 
into how Congress can continue to support the growing demands 
in this workforce, particularly as we pursue the upcoming FAA 
reauthorization legislation.
    I would like to give particular welcome to one of the 
witnesses here today, Dr. Sheree Utash, President of Wichita 
State University's campus of Applied Sciences and Technology, 
or WSU Tech. Dr. Utash has served in her position as President 
for almost a decade, overseeing the college's transition from 
Wichita Area Technical College to WSU Tech, our state's largest 
technical college.
    WSU Tech's commitment to specializes--commitment 
specializes in the delivery of career technical education while 
driving economic development within the region, and meeting the 
current and future workforce needs of the industry.
    Dr. Utash oversees an innovative partnership and solutions 
to building a talent pipeline titled, Get to Work Werx, w, e, 
r, x. This program offers students full time paid employment 
within the maintenance, repair, and overhaul sector, while 
simultaneously processing through WSU Tech's aviation 
Maintenance Technology Program.
    Dr. Utash offers a unique perspective with experience in 
teaching and working in both higher education and private 
industry. And she has helped combat workforce challenges in our 
state, and we appreciate her very much, and I look forward to 
hearing what she would have for advice to me and my colleagues.
    Aviation is one of Kansas's--I am sorry, is one of 
America's, that is an easy slip for me--aviation is one of 
America's top industries. And in Kansas, aerospace and aviation 
makes up nearly 20 percent of our state's exports. Wichita, 
also the number one aerospace manufacturing metro in the 
Nation.
    Our nation and state success within this vital sector 
depends upon those who train, educate, and prepare our students 
to be ready contributors within the aviation industry. In order 
for our Nation to continue leading in aviation, it will take 
innovative programs like those Dr. Utash has helped implement.
    I look forward to hearing from her today and all of our 
panelists, and I look forward to working with you all as we 
work to reauthorize the FAA. And Madam Chair, I would take this 
as an opportunity to thank you again and thank you publicly in 
this setting.
    AMJP, Senator Cantwell was hugely necessary, engaged, and a 
willing partner as we passed aviation manufacturing jobs 
protection during COVID, which created the opportunities for us 
to not lose, but to maintain our workforce during a very 
challenging time in the aviation and aerospace industry.
    That legislation's success would not have been possible 
without Senator Cantwell, and I remain very grateful to her for 
her assistance. Madam Chair, thank you very much.
    The Chair. Thank you. And I thank you, Senator Moran, for 
working with me on that. In the COVID program and in the 
ensuing challenges that we faced in actually getting it over 
the goal line. But I think once we did, we realized how much 
the supply chain itself benefited from keeping those jobs.
    And now as we see companies advertising on TV for workers 
and the challenges we face, I am glad we kept every one of 
those jobs that we could. I will now turn it over to our Chair 
of the Subcommittee.
    And thank you so much for, again, sharing this hearing and 
for your insights and leadership on this important issue. 
Senator Duckworth.

              STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY DUCKWORTH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for 
your leadership on this. And it is so important for us to get 
FAA reauthorization done, and this is an important hearing on 
that path.
    Also, thank you to Ranking Member Cruz for helping with 
this hearing as well. Coming out of the pandemic, our aviation 
system faces a lot of challenges. Yet when considering the 
future of American civil aviation, success or failure may ride 
on whether we are able to dramatically strengthen our Nation's 
aviation workforce over the next 5 years.
    Without properly trained, equipped, and compensated 
workforce, the safety of the flying public will be put at risk, 
and the delays we have experienced over the past few years will 
seem mild by comparison.
    As a pilot, I want to reiterate my strong support for the 
post Colgan Air safety reforms, especially the 1,500-hour rule, 
and express strong opposition to any proposal that would weaken 
safety standards in a misguided effort to address workforce 
challenges.
    As Captain Sully Sullenberger recently noted, if we were 
trying to increase the number of physicians serving rural 
areas, we wouldn't dream of cutting the length of medical 
school from 4 years to 2 years for doctors who serve those 
communities.
    Madam Chair, I would like to ask unanimous consent to place 
a copy of Captain Sully's March 3, 2023, Op-Ed from the Chicago 
Tribune into the hearing.
    The Chair. Without objection.

  Capt. `Sully' Sullenberger: Safety in the skies is paramount. Don't 
                 cheapen pilot training and experience.

                    By Capt. ``Sully'' Sullenberger

                Chicago Tribune--Mar 03, 2023 at 1:20 pm

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

International Airport in support of improved working conditions and 
benefits across their profession on Sept. 1, 2022. (Brian Cassella/
Chicago Tribune)

    In backrooms and dark corners, airline lobbyists, particularly the 
Regional Airline Association, are scurrying all over Washington, still 
trying to undo all the hard work that has been done to make air travel 
the safest form of transportation in human history. They're doing this 
for the usual reasons. They want to try to cheapen pilot training and 
levels of experience for their own financial gain and expedience. 
They're trying to do what is easier and cheaper for them, not what is 
best for passengers or crews, or for their industry.
    Once again, it is necessary that those of us who deeply understand 
that safety really must be the priority are having to refight the same 
battles that we have had to fight too many times before.
    This time around, the lobbyists are trying to weaken pilot 
experience requirements by seeking super credits for certain training 
experiences and, in so doing, substantially lower the number of actual 
pilot flying hours required. This subterfuge is trotted out as a way of 
achieving their goal of cheapening and quickening flight training 
without appearing to lower the total 1,500 hours required. But with 
super credits, the total flight hours would be much less, as much as 50 
percent less. If we were trying to provide more physicians to serve 
rural areas, would we suggest that the answer would be to cut medical 
school in half from four years to two years? No! We'd say that would be 
crazy--because it is crazy.
    When pilots have only a few hundred hours of flight experience, it 
means they have experienced only one cycle of the seasons as a pilot: 
one spring of gusty crosswinds, one summer of thunderstorms, one fall 
of fog and frost, and one winter of ice and snow. And if their flight 
training was all conducted in Florida, they would not have experienced 
a real winter. If their training was in Arizona, they might not ever 
have flown in a cloud! The first time they encounter real weather 
should not be when they are flying paying passengers, unwitting and 
unwilling test subjects.
    The way pilots develop the critically important judgment they must 
have is through effective experience in the real world of operational 
flying, with its challenges and ambiguities, not in the hand-holding of 
the sterile training environment and not just in simulated flight.
    The lobbyists are also pulling an old debater's trick, posing a 
false choice between quantity and quality of flight training and 
experience. They are trying to convince us that if the quality of 
training is good enough, then less of it should be required, when in 
reality, we can and we must have both.
[Editorial: Don't compromise safety to ease airline pilot shortage]
    On U.S. Airways Flight 1549 on Jan. 15, 2009, First Officer Jeff 
Skiles, now a captain, had 20,000 hours of flight time like I did. He 
and I had only 208 seconds from losing thrust after being struck by a 
flock of birds to when we landed in the Hudson River. We did not have 
time to discuss what had happened and what to do about it. I had to 
rely on him immediately and intuitively knowing what he should do to 
help me. We had to be able to collaborate wordlessly. If he had been a 
lot less experienced, we could not have had as good an outcome or 
managed to save every life.
    It is not only in extreme emergencies that airline flying requires 
two fully trained, qualified and experienced pilots in every cockpit. 
At the other end of the spectrum, those same aptitudes, traits and 
qualities must be present as well. In fact, one of the biggest 
challenges in airline flying is how often it is routine, and it is in 
those situations that each crew of pilots must have the professionalism 
and diligence to avoid complacency and ensure that best practices are 
adhered to on every hour of every flight, every day, every week, every 
month and every year, for decadeslong careers.
    So, I am calling on everyone who flies to loudly and forthrightly 
tell the airline lobbyists that we're on to them and their subterfuge, 
and we're not having it. We are not going to allow them to turn back 
the clock to the days not that many years ago when there were dozens of 
airline crashes resulting in hundreds of deaths each year.
    Our message is clear: Pilots must have the aptitude and the 
diligence to strive for excellence and become the best of the best. And 
we must arm them with the knowledge, skill, experience and judgment 
necessary to handle whatever challenges they will face.
    High levels of pilot training and experience literally make the 
difference between success and failure, life and death. And in safety-
critical domains like aviation, everyone involved must have a deep 
understanding that ``just good enough''--isn't.

Capt. ``Sully'' Sullenberger is known for landing a U.S. Airways plane 
on the Hudson River in 2009. He was most recently the U.S. ambassador 
and permanent representative to the International Civil Aviation 
Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations, and is a 
safety expert, author and speaker on leadership and culture.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Madam Chair. Captain 
Sullenberger's voice rightly carries a significant weight in 
safety debates, and his name is associated with the ``miracle 
on the Hudson.'' But in the context of the 1,500-hour rule, it 
is worth highlighting two additional figures, 20,000 and 208, 
that demonstrate why Captain Sullenberger's heroics were less a 
miracle and more a reflection of why hard-earned pilot skills 
and experience is so important.
    On that fateful day in January, Captain Sullenberger and 
his first officer had a mere 208 seconds between losing thrust 
and landing in the Hudson River. Fortunately for the 155 
passengers on board, both Captain Sullenberger and First 
Officer Jeff Skiles had an accrued 20,000 hours of flight time 
prior to that extreme emergency each.
    Their combined 40,000 hours of actual flight time 
contributed to their swift and coordinated response. Of course, 
safety does not begin or end in the air. We must also make 
safety our top priority for flight attendants, gate agents, and 
other frontline aviation workers. The number of unruly 
passengers reports came down in 2022 from an all-time peak, but 
they remain too high.
    There were nearly 2,500 unruly passenger reports last year 
alone. A few weeks ago, a passenger onboard a United Airlines 
flight from Los Angeles to Boston tried to stab a flight 
attendant with a metal handle of a broken spoon.
    A year ago, a Southwest Airlines passenger was arrested for 
assaulting a gate agent in Atlanta, after his behavior on board 
the aircraft during taxing forced the aircraft to return to the 
gate. Such abuse is disgusting, disgraceful, and must end.
    Madam Chair, I would like to ask unanimous consent to place 
a copy of a statement of the Association of Flight Attendants, 
CWA, prepared for this hearing into the record.
    The Chair. Without objection.

      Prepared Statement of Sara Nelson, International President, 
             Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO
Introduction
    Thank you Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz and members of the 
Senate Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee for convening a 
hearing to discuss strengthening our aviation workforce.
Staffing Cut to Minimums Pre-COVID
    Staffing of Flight Attendants on planes, at the gate, and in ground 
support was cut to minimums pre-COVID. There is no ``give'' in the 
system. Pre-COVID airlines counted on high overtime hours to staff the 
operation. With a seasoned workforce, and a normal hiring rate for 
typical attrition, the frontline workforce knew our jobs well and often 
``made it work'' when operational hiccups occurred.
    For example, almost all domestic flights are staffed with the 
minimum number of Flight Attendants, so when something goes wrong 
there's no additional crew already in the operation to help staff 
flights. When we think of the disruptive passenger incidents we've 
seen, often there is a single flight attendant facing unhinged rages.
    Adding the conditions of the pandemic, which include higher rates 
of sickness among the workforce, difficulties with commuting to work on 
full planes, compressed cabin environments, increased turbulence, 
weakened infrastructure to support operational irregularities, a 
combative environment, mass retirements with fewer seasoned workers to 
mentor new employees on the job, and a somewhat chaotic network that 
was a response to new trends of passenger demand and little ability to 
forecast--Flight Airlines and other aviation workers are feeling the 
stress and strain of an operation stretched to its limit.
    The last 20 years of austerity also greatly diminished parents from 
encouraging children to seek a job in aviation. More typically, the 
current workforce has discouraged the next generation from getting into 
the profession or the industry altogether.
Women in Aviation
    When we work to open the airline industry to a broad range of 
workers it helps to open a pipeline of new workers to the industry. 
It's important then to take action that substantially addresses the 
realities of women working in aviation.
    Hosting panels and roundtables to talk about the importance of 
inclusive programs at the airlines and within the aviation industry is 
fine, but it's hypocritical to say ``We want people to know that they 
can come to the airline industry, that they can have a family-
sustaining job,'' \1\ when the truth is Flight Attendants are so 
frustrated with the double speak.

need-for-diversity-in-aviation-workforce
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is important for Committee members to know that during 
consideration of the Fiscal Year 2023 year-end omnibus, AFA and other 
unions who represent Flight Attendants and pilots advocated for Senator 
Jeff Merkley's (D-OR) PUMP for Nursing Mother's Act to be included in 
the funding bill. However, airline management fought hard to prevent 
Flight Attendants and pilots from being allowed to use a breast pump 
while on duty during non-critical phases of flight. The messages we 
received after the bill passed without the inclusion of airline crew 
from Flight Attendants were heartbreaking. Many crewmembers are 
justifiably distraught and upset that the airlines would sabotage their 
ability to provide breast milk for their baby, and disregard the health 
risks for the working mothers too. How can the aviation industry vow to 
increase its participation of more women when they block attempts for 
women to actually be a working mom? This attitude and policy must 
change if airlines want to attract more women to the industry and 
strengthen the workforce.
    Recommendation: Include language in the FAA Reauthorization bill 
that defines the ability and right of airline crewmembers to pump 
during non-critical phases of flight.
Mitigate risks of Violent Attacks
    Just last week, our union was dealing with another terrible violent 
passenger incident involving a Flight Attendant who was just four 
months into the job. A passenger repeatedly attempted to stab him in 
the neck with a handmade metal shiv. While this Flight Attendant was 
thankfully not seriously injured, this has real consequences beyond 
just how this is impacting him and his emotional, mental and physical 
well-being. Being concerned to show up to work and do your job, hoping 
you are not physically assaulted that day is extremely stressful and 
anxiety ridden.
    In addition to the terrible assaults Flight Attendants experience 
while on duty, passenger service agents are experiencing an increased 
amount of passenger rage and their experiences often go unrecognized. 
These incidents vary from using vulgar language when addressing 
employees, using racial epithets that cause psychological harm to our 
agents, to punching, biting, kicking, shoving and even spitting on 
them. Union representatives report the highest number of calls to 
employee assistance programs searching for ways to cope with fatigue, 
stress and fear caused by these incidents.
    Recommendation: Include language in the next FAA reauthorization 
bill that will:

  1)  ban these disruptive passengers from flying on all airlines so 
        they cannot commit these acts again; and

  2)  require signage at airports to remind passengers about the 
        Federal statutes that prohibit intoxication onboard flights.

    Our union has requested both of these measures in our FAA 
Reauthorization bill priorities and I am hopeful that the Committee 
includes them.
Staffing at the Gate
    Gate agents are a vital part of a multilayered airline security and 
safety process at the airport and their importance can not be 
understated. The safety of ground service workers is a priority. At the 
gates, oftentimes one passenger service agent is left to board full 
planes by themselves creating communication issues during the boarding 
process. And when a flight gets delayed or canceled that same agent or 
sometimes no one is left in the terminal to assist passengers--making 
an already difficult situation worse.
    The airlines and the airports are too reliant on overtime hours to 
meet basic operational metrics. This way of doing business needs to 
stop or the industry will be run into the ground and it puts safety at 
risk.
    Recommendation: Increase staffing at the gate and on each flight. 
We need more frontline workers in the airports and on planes who are 
able to answer questions, identify problems early in order to de-
escalate, or simply have backup from other workers when issues get out 
of hand or require physical restraint and a law enforcement response.
FAA Extensions Have Unintended Consequences
    We are pleased the Committee is working diligently to put together 
a comprehensive long-term FAA Reauthorization bill before it expires in 
September 2023. Ensuring there is no lapse in funding for the FAA is 
absolutely essential. FAA extensions have serious unintended 
consequences and should be avoided. Temporary funding leads to 
budgetary uncertainty and instability for the FAA and its programs. 
Long-term planning and growth, which includes the workforce, 
technology, and infrastructure, is stunted. These delays impact safety 
and security of our entire aviation ecosystem. One example of this is 
the poor Air Traffic Control (ATC) staffing that occurred as the result 
of several FAA extensions.
    Having stable, adequate funding is essential to bring our aviation 
system into the 21st century. We can't afford another government 
shutdown or funding bandaid. We also need a confirmed, permanent FAA 
Administrator to ensure these updates and programs get done. This is 
why we urge the Senate to confirm the nomination of Phil Washington to 
serve as FAA Administrator as soon as possible.
The anti-merger, merger: JetBlue-Spirit Merger
    The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA supports the merger of 
JetBlue and Spirit. (Although this is an acquisition on the front end, 
the workers only experience the effects once the business transaction 
is complete and the merger of operations commences. That is why we only 
refer to this as a merger.) The die was cast for concentrated corporate 
power when mergers were approved in the last decade to create four mega 
airlines that now control 81 percent of the market. The strong stance 
the current administration has taken on competition and good union jobs 
set a foundation for a merger proposal with a JetBlue-Spirit 
combination that attempts to correct past antitrust failures, and 
instead drives competition to the highest standards for workers and 
consumers.
    Our union does not offer our support lightly. We have experience 
with eight mergers in the past decade and this is the first merger that 
we enthusiastically support for these reasons:
    No Two-Tiered Employment. This merger will insource jobs currently 
contracted out at Spirit to make all of these workers direct employees 
of JetBlue with higher pay and benefits. The airline will not use any 
contract flying with regional jets, a practice that the major airlines 
utilize to keep labor costs on average 45 percent less than mainline 
airlines for nearly half of the domestic flights in their network. This 
immediately increases access to thousands of improved aviation jobs and 
puts pressure on the mega airlines to compete to the highest standards 
for workers.
    More, Better Jobs. JetBlue has committed to no furloughs, no 
displacements, and an expedited joint collective bargaining process 
that will ensure Flight Attendants gain the benefits of the merger as 
soon as possible. Spirit management recently reached agreement with our 
union to close out open contract negotiations. The short-term contract 
provides immediate double-digit raises from 10-27 percent, scheduled 
additional raises, scheduling improvements and other benefits. This 
sets up the opportunity for significant further improvements for the 
combined Flight Attendant group, but only if the concerns of the DOJ 
are resolved and this merger moves forward.
    Safety and Comfort. All Spirit airplanes will be reconfigured from 
28'' seat pitch, which is the worst in the industry, to 32'' seat pitch 
which is the best minimum standard in the industry. This means more 
comfort for passengers and a far better ratio of gate agents and Flight 
Attendant to passengers. This improves safety, comfort, and contributes 
to a better flying environment that has been plagued with disruptive 
and violent episodes on our planes and gate areas.
    JetBlue will use larger airplanes and fly each plane more to 
maintain or even add capacity to the industry. This keeps fares low, 
while making flying better for everyone. Bigger seats, free wifi, 
unlimited snacks, and the option to forgo all of that for even lower 
fares if passengers so choose. This would contribute to Senator 
Duckworth's efforts to review cabin conditions and ensure safe 
evacuation of aircraft in today's environment.
    Failing to settle this case will do nothing to change today's 
industry dynamics, but it will ensure things stay the same. There's not 
a person in the country who would say that's okay. Everything the 
public hates about flying today would be better on the merged airline.
    We encourage regulators to resolve its specific concerns and ensure 
we don't have to wait a day longer before experiencing the benefits 
this combination will create for workers and consumers across the 
industry.
    Thank you for your attention to workforce issues.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Madam Chair. We must also 
ensure that our supply of aviation workers keeps pace with 
increasing demand, especially for pilots and mechanics. A 
recent study projected that the supply gap of aviation 
mechanics in North America could reach more than 40,000 over 
the next 4 years.
    The estimate--the study also estimates that up to 35 
percent of the current aviation mechanic workforce is already 
between 55 and 64 years old. Having just turned 55 last week, I 
don't think that is that old, but you know. In the 2018 FAA 
reauthorization bill, Congress established an aviation 
workforce development grant program at the FAA to enhance 
public investments in institutions that train future pilots and 
mechanics.
    Measured by demand alone, our program has been a smashing 
success. In Fiscal Year 2021 alone, applicants sought a total 
of $121 million in grant funding. Unfortunately, measured 
against our goal of strengthening our aviation workforce, the 
actual grant funding amount of $10 million failed to meet the 
real-world demand of $121 million.
    Fortunately, there is strong bipartisan support for 
dramatically boosting investments in programs that seek to 
train our Nation's next generation of pilots and mechanics. For 
example, together with my subcommittee ranking member, Senator 
Moran, we developed and introduced a bipartisan Aviation 
Workforce Development Enhancement Act late last year.
    Our legislation would triple investments in grants to 
support efforts to train pilots and mechanics, while creating a 
new grant for programs to train aviation manufacturing 
technical workers. Senator Klobuchar, Thune, and Kelly, and 
Fischer have also developed bipartisan proposals that seek to 
increase and broaden aviation workforce investments.
    I am optimistic that working together in a bipartisan way, 
we will craft a proposal that combines the best elements of our 
respective bipartisan bills to ensure the forthcoming FAA 
reauthorization will empower our Nation's civil aviation system 
to build a strong pipeline of pilots and mechanics over the 
next 5 years.
    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about 
what Congress can do to strengthen our aviation workforce. 
Thank you. That ends my opening statement, and I would like to 
move on to introducing our panel. We have with us Constance von 
Muehlen, my fellow rotor head in the room.
    I think we may have been at flight school at the same time. 
She is the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 
of Alaska Airlines, SeaTac, Washington. Dr. Rebecca Lutte, 
Associate Professor, University of Nebraska, Omaha Aviation 
Institute, Omaha, Nebraska. Captain Jason Ambrosi, President of 
Airline Pilots Association, and he's based right out here out 
of Virginia.
    David Spero, National President, Professional of Aviation 
and Safety Specialist, AFL-CIO. Welcome. Dr. Sheree Utash, 
President, Wichita State University, campus of Applied Sciences 
and Technology. Thank you for being here today.

aerospace and defense leader. Again, thank you for joining us. 
And we will begin by recognizing Constance von Muehlen for her 
opening statement.

         STATEMENT OF CONSTANCE von MUEHLEN, EXECUTIVE

          VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER,

                        ALASKA AIRLINES

    Ms. Muehlen. Good morning. Thank you. Thank you, Chair 
Cantwell, Chair Duckworth, Ranking Member Moran, and 
distinguished members of the Committee for the opportunity to 
testify on this important topic.
    My name is Constance von Muehlen. I am the Chief Operating 
Officer of Alaska Airlines. I am proud to represent our company 
and our 23,000 employees across Alaska Air Group, 14,000 of 
whom are represented by Senators on this committee. I was proud 
to be a member of the FAA's Women in Aviation Advisory Board.
    Alaska Airlines is the fifth largest carrier in the U.S. 
and our success is fueled by our people. Thank you to our 
remarkable Alaska Airlines employees for the work they do every 
day to operate safely and reliably while delivering the caring 
service we are known for. We are passionate about our guests, 
our airline, and about aviation.
    We provide caring service to 120 exciting destinations like 
Paine Field to Las Vegas, Anchorage to Maui, and San Diego to 
either Boston or Bozeman. I started my career 30 years ago as 
an officer in the U.S. Army, flying Black Hawk helicopters, and 
leading flight operations throughout the world.
    Our team was made up of people from every possible 
background. Still, we found a way to come together and to 
achieve our goals under rigorous circumstances. And that is 
something I hold on to because we built what we--we built on 
what we had in common.
    That is the perspective that I bring as we work to solve 
the big challenges facing aviation today. I believe in building 
collaborative career pathways that build on relationships 
between airlines, Government, the military, manufacturers, and 
schools of all sizes. A strong aviation workforce is what 
enables safe and reliable operations, and that is something I 
have been passionate about throughout my career.
    In my role at Alaska Airlines, I am responsible for 
delivering performance in the day-to-day operations, on the 
ground and in the air. My objectives fall into three categories 
this year: elevating safety, building resilience, and enabling 
growth. Alaska Airlines is an industry leader in safety. It is 
our top priority, along with our top value.
    And this applies to our workforce strategy as well, because 
our workforce enables safety. Our safety program is rooted in 
what we call ready, safe, go. Only after we have ensured that 
we are ready and able to deliver safely do we proceed with the 
operation. And in fact, every one of our employees is empowered 
to stop our operation.
    Resilience means having the equipment and the staffing to 
deliver a safe and reliable and on time operation. This past 
year, we updated five labor contracts to ensure our employees 
receive market wage rates and to recognize their valuable 
contributions.
    We finished 2022 with on time performance and completion 
rates near the top of the industry, as we have for the past 15 
years. Finally, enabling growth. Enabling growth is based on a 
strong workforce pipeline. We must have an inclusive approach 
to expanding and diversifying talent pools, especially for 
maintenance pilots, and maintenance technicians and pilots.
    As we plan for the future at Alaska Airlines, we have 
established a handful of programs to that end. One is the 
Ascend Pilot Academy, where enrolled cadets are eligible for 
low interest financial assistance and a stipend of $26,000 upon 
signing up to fly for Horizon, our regional carrier.
    We expect to graduate 250 pilots a year out of that 
program. The Maintenance Technician Development Program 
provides a $12,300 stipend and reimbursement for employees who 
wish to shift their career to become a technician. Last year, 
our first person completed this program, Kyle.
    Kyle is an Alaska native who joined Alaska Airlines on the 
ramp, as a ramp service agent in Juneau. And after 2 years of 
training while working at our airline, he is now a line 
aircraft technician in Anchorage. A success story.
    As we look to grow our workforce, one significant barrier 
to entry is pilot costs. Offering low interest Federal loans to 
students entering this critical profession is key to improving 
access to the pilot pipeline. This is a policy we urge Congress 
to explore and advance so we can have the pilot supply needed 
to meet the demand in the long term.
    Congress should also expand the breadth and investment of 
the Section 625 grants for outreach, education, and training of 
pilots and maintenance technicians, as well as pave the way for 
veterans to enter aviation careers through the GI Bill. Thank 
you.
    I look forward to working with this committee on enhancing 
and developing the safest and strongest aviation workforce for 
our common future. It will take the industry, Government, and 
educators collaborating to accomplish this mission.
    [The prepared statement of Ms. Muehlen follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Constance von Muehlen, Executive Vice President 
              and Chief Operating Officer, Alaska Airlines
    Thank you, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, Chair Duckworth, 
Ranking Member Moran, and distinguished members of the committee for 
the opportunity to testify on the important topic of aviation 
workforce. My name is Constance von Muehlen and I am the Chief 
Operating Officer of Alaska Airlines. I am proud to represent our 
company and our 23,000 employees across Alaska Air Group, nearly 14,000 
of whom are represented by the Senators on this Committee. I was also 
proud to be a member of the Women in Aviation Advisory Board 
established in the 2018 Federal Aviation Administration 
reauthorization.
    Alaska Airlines is the 5th largest U.S. carrier, and we have 
operated in this highly competitive and often challenging industry for 
more than 90 years. Our success over that time has been fueled by the 
dedicated and engaged people who work here. I want to thank our 
employees for their commitment to our success, and for the work they do 
every day to operate safely and reliably while delivering the caring 
service we are known for.
    We are the only major airline based on the West Coast, with our 
headquarters in Seattle and additional hubs in Anchorage, Portland, Los 
Angeles, and San Francisco. With more than 1,100 flights per day to 120 
destinations across North America--spanning from Alaska to Hawaii and 
Washington, D.C.--we operate and employ people in urban centers and 
rural areas across the U.S., as well as in Canada, Mexico, Belize and 
Costa Rica. We provide our guests global reach as a member of the 
oneworld alliance with over 900 destinations in more than 170 countries 
and territories.
    At Alaska Airlines our employees are empowered and guided by a care 
framework built on five values:

  <bullet> Own safety.

  <bullet> Do the right thing.

  <bullet> Be kind-hearted.

  <bullet> Deliver performance.

  <bullet> Be remarkable.

    We have always taken a balanced, long-term approach to running our 
business, and that's why after 90 years in the business we are here 
today, ready to deliver for the next generations who depend on us.
A Strong Workforce Enables a Strong Operation
    Running a safe and strong operation is something that I have been 
personally passionate about throughout my 30-year aviation career. In 
my role today at Alaska Airlines, I am responsible for overseeing the 
day-to-day operations on the ground and in the air. This year my key 
operational objectives fall into three categories:

  1.  Ensuring safety

  2.  Building resilience

  3.  Enabling growth

    Safety is our top priority and at the core of everything we do--
this applies to our workforce strategy as well, because our workforce 
enables safety. Safety is personal to every one of us at Alaska 
Airlines and is a core part of our onboarding and ongoing training. Our 
safety program is rooted in what we call ``Ready, SAFE, Go''--only 
after we've ensured we are ready, and able to deliver safely, do we 
proceed with our work in the operation.
    This framework empowers each one of our team members to ``stop the 
operation'' if they see something that isn't right. It also empowers us 
to speak up and be transparent, to ensure issues are corrected. In 
2022, we held the first of what has become a quarterly Safety Day to 
reaffirm our personal and collective commitment to safety across our 
company--we stop our operation and have stand downs across all our work 
groups to discuss safety and our safety culture. As we hire at Alaska 
Airlines, we want to attract talent that embodies this approach and 
train our new team members not only in their functional work, but also 
in the importance of speaking up when it comes to safety.
    In its most recent rankings for 2023, AirlineRatings.com has again 
ranked Alaska as the only U.S. airline within its Top 10 safest 
airlines in the world. We also received our 22nd Diamond Award of 
Excellence from the Federal Aviation Administration, recognizing both 
Alaska and Horizon aircraft technicians for their dedication to 
training. Alaska is the only carrier to earn this honor for 22 straight 
years.
    Additionally, we know that our Federal partners at FAA, TSA, CBP, 
NTSB and others have a similar approach and having a safe and 
transparent relationship between industry and the agencies is vital to 
the overall safety of the National Air Space.
    Resilience means having the equipment, trained workforce and 
staffing plan to deliver not only a safe but a reliable and on-time 
operation. In the last year, we focused on three strategic priorities 
to build a resilient operation:

  <bullet> Strengthening operational integrity across the network was 
        key to providing guests with reliable service during a period 
        of historic travel demand. We finished the year with completion 
        and on-time performance rates near the top of the industry. 
        Operational integrity is the cornerstone of a healthy airline, 
        and we remain focused on consistently delivering the 
        operational excellence Alaska Airlines is known for as we build 
        the foundation for our future growth.

  <bullet> Updating labor contracts with represented labor groups to 
        ensure our employees receive market-competitive rates, and to 
        recognize their valuable contributions to our success. We 
        ratified five contracts in 2022: Pilots, dispatchers, and 
        customer service agents at Alaska as well as pilots and 
        maintenance technicians at our regional carrier, Horizon Air. 
        We're actively negotiating with our flight attendants and are 
        making good progress toward an agreement. We also recently 
        started our negotiation with our maintenance technicians which 
        we expect to be done by the end of the year.

  <bullet> Prioritized transitioning our Mainline and Regional 
        operations to single fleets. The single-fleet operating models, 
        anchored by the Boeing 737 for the Mainline fleet and Embraer 
        175 aircraft for the Regional fleet, will drive simplicity and 
        efficiency for our business.

    These important steps and our strong results in 2022 signal how 
well our teams are navigating recovery and setting up a foundation for 
our return to pre-COVID flying levels and sustainable growth 
thereafter.
    Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic there are new staffing 
realities, and this is not just true of aviation. To ensure we reliably 
deliver on our schedule we have adapted our staffing plans and apply 
approximately 5 percent more staff than we did for equivalent capacity 
prior to the pandemic. To support resilience and prudent growth, we 
hired 8,000 people in 2022 and plan to hire 3,500 more for 2023.
    Enabling growth is the third pillar in my operational objectives. 
As I look to the future and growth for Alaska Airlines, the critical 
path to success is a strong pipeline of ready and trained talent to 
join our team. Thus, we are making joint efforts to develop a robust 
workforce pipeline not only for pilots, but also maintenance 
technicians. Across the industry it is imperative we cultivate talent 
and take an inclusive approach to aviation by expanding and 
diversifying the talent pool.
    I started my career as an officer in the U.S. Army, flying Black 
Hawk helicopters and leading flight operations throughout the world. I 
enlisted when I was 23 years old. After rotary wing pilot training, my 
first assignment was with a Germany based aviation unit tasked with 
protecting the no-fly zone over Northern Iraq--part of Operation 
Provide Comfort.
    Our team was made up of soldiers from all across the country--from 
every place and every background. There was me--a young woman who grew 
up speaking German and French, and didn't even learn English until I 
moved to Southern California when I was 13. There was a farm boy from 
Kentucky. Another young man who grew up in public housing in the Bronx. 
Another was from Manhattan. And another was from an immigrant from 
Poland.
    Still, we found a way to come together as a team and achieve our 
goals. We built on what we had in common. For me, it was a powerful, 
lifelong lesson about each person bringing their own brilliance, and 
despite differences accomplishing extraordinary things together.
    I see it every day. I see teams across our company bring together 
different skill sets and backgrounds and expertise to really do 
remarkable things. And that's what it's going to take to solve the big 
challenges facing aviation today: I believe in building collaborative 
career pathways that build on relationships between airlines, 
government, military, manufacturers, and schools of all sizes.
    To meet the strong demand for flying that we are seeing now and 
expect to continue, and as our workforce ages and retires, we need to 
create a bigger pipeline and expand our sources of talent, making sure 
we are reaching all communities in our recruitment. There are 
incredible careers in aviation, but the pool of those who have access 
to and benefit from this industry has often been limited in the past. 
Continuing to do things the old way will not allow us to grow into the 
future; expanding our talent sources is the way forward.
    According to Federal labor statistics, currently 94 percent of all 
aircraft pilots are male and 93 percent are white. To build a workforce 
that is accessible to all, we must invest in training, open up career 
pathways for a broader source of talent by removing barriers to entry, 
and engage young people early so they imagine themselves in the 
aviation field.
    As we plan for the future of mainline Alaska Airlines and regional 
Horizon Air, we are actively working to train the next generation of 
pilots. We have established new programs to enable more young people to 
reach aviation and other career goals, including working with local 
schools and establishing our own pilot academy.

  <bullet> Horizon Air Pilot Development Program: Student pilots 
        launching their flying careers receive a flight training 
        stipend and take advantage of mentoring from professional 
        pilots. With completion of the program and after gaining the 
        necessary experience, these pilots step into roles as First 
        Officers for Horizon.

  <bullet> Ascend Pilot Academy: In partnership with Hillsboro Aero 
        Academy in Oregon, Ascend Pilot Academy provides aspiring 
        pilots with a well-developed, more financially feasible way to 
        become an airline pilot. Enrolled cadets will be eligible for 
        access to low-interest financial assistance, and a stipend of 
        $26,000 upon signing to fly for Horizon. In the first month 
        after its recent launch, more than 700 prospective pilots 
        applied for the program--surpassing our goal by more than 600 
        percent. We expect to graduate 250 pilots a year and the 
        current class is 38 percent women, 29 percent BIPOC, and 17 
        percent people from other jobs within Alaska Airlines and 
        Horizon Air.

  <bullet> Pilot Pathways Program: This is the most direct flight path 
        for Horizon pilots who want to become Alaska Airlines pilots. 
        Each year, Alaska recruits internally from Horizon to fill 
        positions on the flight deck. Since its inception in 2018, 365 
        pilots have advanced through the program.

  <bullet> True North Pilot Development: A first-of-its-kind program in 
        the industry, we are partnering with historically Black 
        colleges and universities to develop and hire pilots who are 
        Black, Indigenous and people of color. Financial assistance, 
        mentoring and eventual direct hire placement in an entry-level 
        position are all part of the program. The program kicked off in 
        2021, and in early 2022 we accepted four students from two 
        HBCUs, Delaware State University and University of Maryland-
        Eastern Shore. In 2023, we have accepted three more students in 
        the program. In the future, we plan to expand the program to 
        other schools as well as broaden its scope of career 
        opportunities within Alaska.

  <bullet> Our Maintenance Technician Development Program is open to 
        employees who are interested in careers as aircraft 
        technicians. The program provides mentorship, up to $10,500 in 
        stipends and up to $1,800 for A&P test fee reimbursement, and 
        an aviation maintenance technician (AMT) job at Alaska or 
        Horizon maintenance bases when licensed. Participants are 
        guaranteed a technician job upon successful completion of the 
        program.

    Recently, we had our first employee complete our Maintenance 
Technician Program. He is a Tsimshian and Tlingit Native from 
Metlakatla, Alaska. He joined Alaska Airlines as a ramp service agent 
in Juneau, and after his managers encouraged him to apply to the 
program, he completed his two years of training and is now established 
in his role as a line aircraft technician in Anchorage.
    Across the industry, about 3 percent of aircraft maintenance 
technicians are women, so clearly there's an opportunity to grow to 
strengthen the talent pipeline. But it's not just about the numbers; we 
also want people to come work in aviation because it's a fascinating, 
well-paying career that sparks passion for many who are fortunate 
enough to pursue it.
How the Government Can Help Strengthen the Aviation Workforce
    I was pleased to share my passion for aviation and experience 
through my role on the FAA's Women in Aviation Advisory Board--one of 
two Federal advisory committees established by the 2018 FAA 
Reauthorization Act. Congress saw five years ago, even before the 
pandemic and challenges the industry faced, that the aviation workforce 
was something to pay close attention to and study so that air carriers, 
the FAA, manufacturers, and other stakeholders have the workforce they 
need to secure the future of aviation.
    Finding people with a passion and giving them opportunities is why 
Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air have been advocating for expanded 
Federal student loan coverage for flight training at accredited 
institutions.
    As we look to grow our workforce, one significant barrier to entry 
for aspiring pilots is cost, particularly for young people who are 
unable to afford the estimated $70,000 to $100,000 to pay for training, 
schooling, and the licenses to become an airline transport-rated pilot.
    Furthermore, it can be difficult for flight school students to 
secure government-backed financing, which means financing terms are 
often prohibitive.
    We believe it should be as easy to get a federally backed, low-
interest student loan to become a pilot as it is to attend medical 
school. Offering low interest subsidized and unsubsidized Federal loans 
to students entering critical professions is key to improving access to 
the pilot pipeline and is a policy we urge this Congress to explore and 
advance so we can have the pilot supply needed to meet demand across 
the country long-term.
    We continue to support the Federal Aviation Administration's 
investment in training schools for both pilots and maintenance 
technicians through workforce grants set forth in Section 625 of the 
2018 FAA Reauthorization. Specifically, we support expanding the scope 
of the programs to be supportive of partnerships that directly support 
outreach, education, and training of commercial pilots and maintenance 
technicians, as well as increasing the authorized and appropriated 
funding for these programs.
    These FAA grant programs could also support assistance for 
transitioning from military to civilian careers as a pilots or 
maintenance technicians. Additionally, one of the recommendations of 
the Women in Aviation Advisory Report was that Congress should restore 
the ability of American Veterans to use the GI bill for obtaining pilot 
certifications.
    In closing, aviation plays a vital role in our economy. We connect 
people and places to enable relationships and opportunity. We carry 
cargo all around the country, we connect families to their ski trips 
and summer vacations, and we connect people from different coasts and 
different countries to move business forward.
    If you take away three things today, remember these points:

  1.  First, Ensuring Safety is aviation's top priority: Our national 
        airspace is safe. We need to be vigilant and continue investing 
        our time and effort across various stakeholders to continue 
        improving.

  2.  Second, Building Resilience with the right equipment, workforce, 
        and staffing models to deliver not only a safe but a reliable 
        and on-time operation to our guests. We value the people who 
        make up Alaska Airlines. We invest in their development and 
        their careers because we entrust and empower them to own safety 
        and take care of our guests.

  3.  Third, Enabling Growth by expanding and investing in our talent 
        pipelines: We do need government action to strengthen and 
        deepen the pipelines for both pilots and maintenance 
        technicians. We are taking action ourselves, but it requires a 
        collaborative effort.

    Thank you and I look forward to working with the Committee on 
Commerce, Science & Transportation on enhancing and developing the 
safest and strongest aviation workforce for our future.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. I now recognize Dr. Lutte.

       STATEMENT OF REBECCA (BECKY) LUTTE, DISTINGUISHED

           PROFESSOR OF AVIATION, AVIATION INSTITUTE,

                UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AT OMAHA

    Dr. Lutte. Thank you. Chairperson Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Cruz, Chairperson Duckworth, Ranking Member Moran, and members 
of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here 
today.
    My name is Becky Lutte. I am a commercial instrument rated 
pilot, flight instructor, and an aircraft owner. I am also the 
Distinguished Professor of Aviation at the University of 
Nebraska at Omaha Aviation Institute.
    My research concentrates on aviation workforce with a focus 
on women in aviation, and I was a member of the FAA Women in 
Aviation Advisory Board, which served from 2020 to 2022. The 
board thanks the Members of Congress and their staff who 
championed establishing the board in the 2018 FAA 
Reauthorization Act to develop recommendations for encouraging 
more women to pursue careers in aviation.
    To meet the challenges of today and tomorrow, including 
workforce, aviation must attract and retain the best possible 
talent from the widest possible pool. Women make up half the 
workforce, yet for decades, the introduction of women into the 
aviation industry in nearly every functional specialty has been 
relatively stagnant.
    Aviation is fundamental to the U.S. military, 
transportation, infrastructure, and economy. In rural 
communities, aviation provides crucial transportation and 
access to supplies, in addition to quality jobs. We must not 
take for granted the industry's continued strength and success.
    According to forecasts, over the next 20 years worldwide, 
we will need 602,000 new civilian pilots and even more 
maintenance technicians. This projected shortage of maintenance 
technicians has been labeled a talent crisis.
    Workforce needs also extend to the development and 
integration of new entrants, like uncrewed aerial systems and 
advanced air mobility. An obvious strategy to address workforce 
needs is identifying and recruiting talent from 
underrepresented groups. In most aviation occupations, women 
make up less than 20 percent.
    Of the world's top 100 passenger airlines, only seven are 
led by women. Women make up only 5 percent of airline pilots, 
and the largest gender gap in the industry is in maintenance, 
where just under 3 percent of technicians are women.
    To meet workforce needs, aviation must expand the pipeline. 
We can do this by addressing systemic barriers to talent. The 
board found there is a complex system of barriers impending 
recruitment, retention, and advancement of women in aviation.
    The barriers start with a lack of early awareness and 
compound to include deficient engagement, cost issues, 
inadequate work life balance, lack of role models, and negative 
workplace culture, including harassment impacting both 
recruitment and retention.
    In a 2018 survey of women in aviation, 71 percent of 
respondents reported they had experienced sexual harassment in 
aviation. The good news is that these barriers are not 
inherent, but rather the product of a system we have built.
    We can change this system, and if we do, we will make it 
better for everyone. The board's 55 recommendations seek to do 
just that. They are broken down into five key areas. First is 
culture, which underlies most of the board's recommendations. 
Changing culture is a long-term commitment, and no single 
individual or entity is responsible for it.
    For this reason, the board urges Congress to establish a 
permanent advisory committee to ensure sustained focus and 
coordination. Recruitment recommendations, increase essential 
early exposure to aviation through improved outreach and 
educational opportunities, such as a virtual resource center, a 
one stop shop with information about careers and resources.
    Recruitment recommendations also target significant cost 
barriers through new funding avenues. Recommendations for 
retention center on creating improved family friendly policies 
and mentoring talent.
    These ensure that women not only remain in the pipeline but 
are set up for long term success. Advancement recommendations 
seek to propel women into essential leadership roles by 
improving professional development and sponsorship 
opportunities.
    And finally, data recommendations will identify and remove 
data gaps and track progress, including the effectiveness of 
the board's recommendations. I am hopeful. In my over 30 years 
in aviation, I have never seen so much momentum to expand the 
aviation workforce.
    We are seeing vibrant and scalable initiatives from 
industry, the FAA, and Congress to better reach 
underrepresented groups. Congressional support for the board's 
recommendations, in collaboration with the FAA and industry and 
with support from a permanent board, will further propel 
aviation forward and create a stronger industry.
    Thank you for your time.

Prepared Statement of Rebecca (Becky) Lutte, Distinguished Professor of 
     Aviation, Aviation Institute, University of Nebraska at Omaha
    Chairperson Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, Chairperson Duckworth, 
Ranking Member Moran, Members of the Committee:
    Thank you for the opportunity to address the U.S. Senate Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation Committee to highlight the work of the 
Women in Aviation Advisory Board, and explain how implementing the 
Board's recommendations will improve the aviation workforce--not just 
for women, but for all.
    My name is Becky Lutte. I am the Distinguished Professor of 
Aviation at the Aviation Institute of the University of Nebraska at 
Omaha. I have a PhD in Public Administration with an Aviation 
Specialization, and I am a commercial, instrument-rated pilot, a flight 
instructor, and an aircraft owner. My research concentrates on aviation 
safety and workforce supply--with a focus on women in aviation--and I 
was a member of the FAA's Women in Aviation Advisory Board, which 
served from 2020 to 2022.
    Congress established the Women in Aviation Advisory Board in the 
2018 FAA Reauthorization Act to develop and provide recommendations and 
strategies for encouraging more women to pursue careers in aviation. I, 
and the entire Board, sincerely thank the members of Congress and their 
staff who championed Section 612 of the Act; they deserve recognition 
and the industry's appreciation for providing the foundation for us to 
conduct this vital work.
    To meet the challenges of today and tomorrow, including workforce, 
the aviation industry must attract and retain the best possible talent 
from the widest possible pool. Women make up almost half the workforce, 
yet for decades, the introduction of women into the aviation industry--
in nearly every functional specialty--has been relatively stagnant. 
Therefore, the need for the Board's work--and the importance of 
implementing our recommendations--is evident.
    Attracting, retaining, and advancing women in aviation is critical 
to the U.S. aviation industry's safety, sustainability, profitability, 
and ability to innovate.'' \1\ No other industry connects humanity like 
aviation; it expands to all corners of the globe and all aspects of our 
lives. Aviation is fundamental to the U.S. military and transportation 
infrastructure, and a key economic engine for our country and the 
world--contributing 5.2 percent to the U.S. gross domestic product and 
generating more than eleven million jobs.\2\ In rural and smaller 
communities across the United States, aviation is a lifeline, providing 
transportation and access to supplies and emergency services, in 
addition to quality jobs.

    An obvious and necessary strategy to address workforce needs 
throughout the industry is identifying and recruiting talent from 
underrepresented groups. In most aviation occupations, women make up 
less than 20 percent of the workforce. Of the world's top one hundred 
passenger airlines, only seven are led by women.\8\ Women make up less 
than 10 percent of the total FAA-certificated pilots and only 5 percent 
of airline pilots. One of the largest gender gaps in the industry is in 
maintenance, where just under 3 percent of technicians are women. 
Further, in many areas, the participation rate of women has changed 
very little over the years. For example, the percentage of commercial 
pilots who are women has increased at a rate of about only 1 percent a 
decade, and for women in maintenance, the rate of change is even 
slower.

    To meet aviation's workforce needs, the industry must expand its 
talent pipeline. Expanding aviation's workforce pipeline is not about 
lowering standards; it is about addressing the real and systemic 
barriers to talent. Through its research, the Board found that a 
complex system of barriers impedes the recruitment, retention, and 
advancement of women in aviation.
    These barriers begin with a lack of early awareness and ongoing 
engagement, which are essential to the recruitment of women into 
aviation. Original survey research of professional women not working in 
aviation found that 70 percent had never considered working in 
aviation, the most common reason being a lack of familiarity with the 
options available to them. Top factors negatively impacting both 
recruitment and retention are cost, family and work balance challenges, 
lack of women in leadership, and negative workplace culture--including 
bias and harassment. In a 2018 survey of Women in Aviation 
International (WAI) members, 71 percent of respondents reported that 
they had experienced sexual harassment in the aviation workplace or 
another professional aviation setting; 81 percent reported having 
witnessed it.\11\ These numbers are disturbingly high and very real. 
And the impact of these barriers compounds over time. Later in a 
woman's career, an imbalance of professional development and 
sponsorship opportunities impacts her advancement into leadership 
roles--reflected in the small number of women in executive positions 
and on industry boards.

    The good news is that the Women in Aviation Advisory Board not only 
conducted extensive research into workforce barriers, but also 
identified concrete solutions. The barriers to women in aviation are 
not inherent, but rather the product of a system we have built. We can 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
change this system, and if we do, we will make it better for everyone.

The Women in Aviation Advisory Board Report's fifty-five 
recommendations are a flight plan for Congress, the FAA, and industry. 
The recommendations address five key workforce issues: Culture, 
Recruitment, Retention, Advancement, and Data.

  <bullet> Culture: Culture underlies most of the Board's 
        recommendations. Changing culture is a long-term commitment, 
        and no single individual or entity is responsible for it. For 
        this reason, the Board urges Congress to establish a permanent 
        advisory committee to ensure sustained focus across current and 
        future administrations, and coordination among organizations. 
        The Board also recommends the creation of an industry-wide 
        reporting program to redress gender bias, discrimination, and 
        sexual harassment.

  <bullet> Recruitment: The Board's recruitment recommendations will 
        increase essential early exposure to aviation through improved 
        outreach and educational opportunities, such as a virtual 
        resource center--a ``one-stop-shop''--with information about 
        career pathways, educational and scholarship resources, and 
        engagement opportunities. Recruitment recommendations also 
        serve to improve access through new funding avenues to remove 
        significant cost barriers, such as Workforce Development 
        Grants.

  <bullet> Retention: The Board's recommendations for retention will 
        ensure that women not only remain in the talent pipeline, but 
        are set up for long-term success. These recommendations center 
        on creating more and improved family and work/life balance, and 
        mentoring talent.

  <bullet> Advancement: The Board's advancement recommendations will 
        propel talent into essential leadership roles by creating and 
        cultivating professional development programs, as well as 
        formal and informal sponsorship opportunities, with purposeful 
        design for women.

  <bullet> Data: The Board also makes recommendations that will help to 
        identify and remove data gaps and track progress, including the 
        effectiveness of the Board's own recommendations.

    For the U.S. aviation industry's continued safety, sustainability, 
profitability, and ability to innovate, a massive talent pipeline is 
required. The Board's work is not only a call to action, but a flight 
plan to a better future. Each one of our recommendations will make 
aviation better for all people--and in doing so, create a safer, 
stronger industry.
    I, for one, am hopeful. In my over 30 years in aviation, I have 
never seen so much momentum to expand the aviation workforce. We are 
seeing vibrant and scalable initiatives to better reach 
underrepresented groups: from industry, like the United Aviate Academy, 
Women in Aviation Girls in Aviation Day, and Organization of Black 
Aerospace Professionals youth programs; from the FAA, like grants to 
schools working to inspire the next generation of aviation 
professionals; and from Congress, like legislation to improve funding 
of aviation exposure and education. Congressional support for the work 
of the FAA Women in Aviation Advisory Board, in collaboration with the 
FAA and industry and with support from a permanent advisory committee, 
will further propel aviation forward. It is time for Congress, as well 
as the FAA and industry, to implement our recommendations. Thank you 
for your time and your commitment to this industry.

        STATEMENT OF CAPTAIN JASON AMBROSI, PRESIDENT, 
       AIR LINE PILOTS ASSOCIATION, INTERNATIONAL (ALPA)

    Mr. Ambrosi. Thank you, Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Cruz, Chair Duckworth, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the 
Committee for holding this important hearing. My name is 
Captain Jason Ambrosi.
    I am an international captain on the Boeing 767 and 
President of the Air Line Pilots Association. It is an honor to 
be here today representing more than 67,000 airline pilots who 
fly for 39 U.S. and Canadian airlines. The United States 
aviation workforce is strong and resilient.
    Thanks to the leadership of this committee and the payroll 
support program, there are enough pilots to meet passenger and 
cargo demand. I experienced the pandemic as a frontline 
aviation worker.
    I can attest to the fact that decisions made during COVID 
to bump pilots to smaller aircraft, park aircraft, furlough and 
place pilots on inactive status created a significant training 
backlog. When demand and subsequently growth returned more 
quickly than some airlines anticipated, most of these pilots 
had to be retrained.
    This necessary process is time intensive and expensive. It 
also relies on a training footprint that includes personnel and 
simulator devices and was not designed for a global pandemic of 
this magnitude.
    The good news is that we have more pilots available now 
than before the pandemic, so this temporary backlog will 
resolve itself as airlines get caught up in pilot training. 
With the recovery, and thanks to this committee's actions 
during the pandemic, airlines are hiring pilots as companies 
expand market share and networks.
    These actions have further complicated the current labor 
market by creating attrition with pilots moving between 
airlines, and pilots are also leaving airlines that offer less 
attractive careers for those that provide good paying jobs and 
better quality of life. But this too will resolve itself with 
time because, both because regional pilot contracts are 
improving and because mainline hiring will stabilize.
    Airlines make market-based business decisions every day. 
Unfortunately, this includes decisions to pull service from 
some small and rural communities you represent. Pilots do not 
make these decisions. However, we stand ready to support the 
Committee in making reforms to essential air service programs 
because we believe all Americans deserve safe, reliable air 
service, including those in small and rural communities.
    That said, we should not now or ever consider lowering 
safety standards to deal with a training backlog, attrition, or 
business decisions that airlines make to leave particular 
markets. As an airline captain, I can tell you that before the 
current first officer certification and training requirements 
adopted in 2010, many new pilots who entered my flight deck 
required on the job training.
    This is a period in aviation history that we should never 
repeat, not if we want to keep America's skies the safest in 
the world. Since Congress passed the FAA reauthorization bill 
in 2010, passenger fatalities have gone down by 99.8 percent.
    Clearly, the current pilot training requirements are saving 
lives and we should reject any effort to undo them. In fact, 
our extraordinary aviation safety record and enviable safety 
culture has made being an airline pilot one of the best careers 
in this country.
    It is a great time to be a pilot. Current data tells us 
that the number of pilots working for U.S. passenger airlines 
actually rose 5 percent from 2019 to 2022. And while this is 
encouraging, we should not lose focus on continuing to maintain 
and grow a robust pilot pipeline.
    The airline industry must offer strong and stable careers 
to individuals from all backgrounds and protect U.S. airline 
employees from efforts to undermine their rights, including 
insisting that the Department of Transportation consider and 
abide by the public interest requirement and enforce aviation 
workers' rights.
    Congress has a unique opportunity in this year's FAA 
reauthorization to build on the strength of America's aviation 
workforce, maintain safety, and open the doors of opportunity 
for all of those who aspire to fly by providing student loans 
for appropriate flight training programs, establishing grants 
to build flight training and education degree programs at 
minority serving institutions, including historically black 
colleges and universities, increasing funding for workforce 
development grant program, and making the Women in Aviation 
Advisory Board a permanent body focused on increasing and 
supporting women.
    With this committee's leadership, we have created the 
safest air transportation system in the world, and with the 
Committee's continued leadership, we can strengthen the U.S. 
aviation workforce, open the doors of opportunity, and make the 
world's safest mode of transportation even safer. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Ambrosi follows:]

        Prepared Statement Of Captain Jason Ambrosi, President, 
           Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA)
    On behalf of the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA), 
I want to thank you for inviting me to testify on Strengthening the 
Aviation Workforce. My name is Captain Jason Ambrosi and I am a current 
and qualified international captain on the Boeing 767 at Delta Air 
Lines, and serve as the president of ALPA. ALPA is the largest airline 
pilot union in the world, as well as the largest nongovernmental 
aviation safety organization, with a history of safety advocacy 
spanning more than 90 years.
    Thanks to the leadership of Chair Cantwell and many others on the 
Committee, the Payroll Support Program and its strong worker protection 
and retention provisions provided a bridge to guarantee there are a 
sufficient number of pilots to not only ensure system operability 
throughout and after the pandemic, but to also accommodate demand-
driven growth for air carriers today. In the absence of bold 
intervention to invest in and preserve pilots and other airline 
personnel, we likely would not be having this hearing today. Carrier 
capacity would be extremely limited, and available pilot personnel 
would be a major constraint on passenger and cargo operations.
    Much has been written about the current and future supply of pilots 
in the United States, with frequently little to no substantiation of 
information, misleading data, or a failure to account for a multitude 
of industry dynamics at play. Here are the facts: there are more than 
enough pilots to meet U.S. airline hiring demand; airline pilot growth 
has increased each year since the pandemic; and airline decisions to 
leave communities are market-driven business choices and should not be 
conflated with pilot supply. Training capacity has been the dominant 
pilot-related constraint on air travel. The displacement of pilots by 
carriers to ease costs combined with post-pandemic carrier hiring 
growth has created considerable attrition and a significant training 
backlog. These are the pilot labor dynamics prevailing today. The good 
news is that the system is resilient--and is working to correct this 
current, short-term situation.
    Responding to temporary post-COVID industry problems with permanent 
changes to pilot training and qualification requirements is ill-
considered and dangerous. The lifesaving safety improvements ushered in 
by this Committee through the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation 
Administration Extension Act of 2010 and attendant minimum first 
officer qualification rules is the framework by which the U.S. airline 
industry is safer than at any point in history. In fact, since the 
passage of the 2010 Act, the United States has experienced a 99.8 
percent reduction in airline passenger fatalities. Attempts to 
undermine or otherwise alter or repeal this lifesaving set of 
requirements, including moving from an experiential-based training and 
qualification regime to a simulation-based system, threatens the 
traveling public and should be summarily rejected.
Pilot Supply and the Airline Industry
    Over the last decade, segments of the industry have speciously 
suggested there is an issue with pilot supply in the United States. 
This narrative does not reflect reality. According to the only publicly 
available data on pilot head counts at U.S. air carriers, there are 
more than 5,500 net pilots at mainline and ultra-low-cost carriers 
(ULCC) than pre-pandemic, as airlines supplied by a strong pilot 
pipeline are filling classes and meeting passenger demand as airlines 
grow.

    To most accurately quantify the number of pilots who can operate 
aircraft for FAR Part 121 air carriers (as opposed to all commercial 
pilots), it is necessary to examine the ATP multiengine rating (ATP-
MEL) holders. The ATP-MEL is the required license that pilots flying 
for Part 121 major, low-cost, regional, and cargo airlines hold.\1\ 
ATP-MEL pilots include both ATP and R-ATP pilots who can operate 
aircraft for these air carriers. The current production of ATP-MEL 
certificated pilots has outpaced U.S. airline hiring needs to replace 
retiring pilots and has also covered the new hiring demand created by 
flying increases before the pandemic and today. Specifically, over the 
last nine-and-a-half years for which there is data, the FAA has issued 
62,972 certificates, while mainline airline carriers hired for 48,500 
pilot positions--leaving a surplus of 14,472 certificated pilots 
relative to demand.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ This testimony will use ``ATP-MEL'' when discussing pilot 
supply and demand. This term covers ATP and Restricted-ATP certificate 
holders. ATP-MEL is the data series provided by the FAA for use by 
airline stakeholders, including Airlines for America (A4A), the 
Regional Airline Association (RAA), and ALPA. By using ATP-MEL, we 
ensure the removal of pilots with only single-engine licenses, which 
represent a fraction of ATP and R-ATP certificate holders. The data 
presented in this testimony therefore represents the most accurate 
statistical approximation of the pilot pool that can apply for and fly 
for FAR Part 121 air carriers.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Looking at the certificates issued by year versus cumulatively, 
there has been an average of more than 6,200 new ATP and R-ATP 
certificates issued every year since 2014, and that figure has 
increased since airlines have announced additional hiring needs. For 
example, from March 2021 to February 2023 the FAA has issued 15,759 new 
ATP and R-ATP certificates (or an average of 657 per month). This also 
means that more than half of all active ATP and R-ATP certificate-
holders under the age of 65 today received their FAA certification 
during the last nearly 10 years, signifying a younger cadre of new 
pilots who will remain in the industry for a long time. These numbers 
also reflect a demand for pilots to accommodate substantial growth in 
the airline industry year-over-year.

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    As we examine various data to use in the discussion about pilot 
availability, it's important to frame the context under which forecasts 
for pilot demand or independent reports about pilot supply are created 
and published. For example, Boeing releases an annual forecast on the 
global commercial market that includes pilot demand. This forecast, 
based on fixed growth assumptions, is useful for the manufacturer's 
purpose of selling aircraft, but has limited predictive value for the 
U.S. airlines and the pilot profession, which are subject to cyclical 
dynamics, including recessions, fuel prices, and pandemics. Building 
aircraft is a time-and resource-intensive process that requires long 
lead-time horizons to match forecasted future demand for aircraft with 
a manufacturer's ability to design and build planes. That said, 
Boeing's latest forecast through 2041 predicts demand for the entirety 
of North America for the next 20 years to be 6,400 pilots a year, which 
is far below historic and current ATP production for the United States.

    Oliver Wyman, a management consulting firm, has produced popular 
reports on both the global pilot and North American pilot pipeline 
following the pandemic. The firm's analysis, however, comingles North 
American supply with U.S. domestic pilot supply, and fails to provide 
any substantiating information for its sweeping conclusions about the 
U.S. market.
    Misinformation regarding pilot supply is often related to the 
little-understood effect of pilot retirements. During the pandemic, 
airlines offered various ``early out'' retirement-inducement programs 
primarily to pilots between the ages of 62 and 65 to help reduce costs 
for airlines and enable younger pilots to remain in their jobs rather 
than face furlough.
    While the prudence of this decision may be questionable in 
hindsight, these ``early outs'' had minimal effect on supply. Rather, 
they simply accelerated retirements that were already planned to take 
place in the following years for pilots subject to the statutory 
retirement age of 65. As a result, 2020 saw a higher-than-expected 
number of retirements as pilots in the oldest age bracket--
approximately 62-65 years of age--retired early. Consequently, this 
will reduce the number of retirements expected in the next few years. 
Specifically, retirements for 2024-2025 will be below pre-pandemic 
forecasts, with retirements stabilizing and returning to the pre-
pandemic, forecasted levels by 2025.

    Dispensing with concerns related to the supply of pilots, ALPA 
understands that both the available pilot labor market and the 
provision of flying has been complicated, owing to the difficulties of 
returning from the pandemic. Most notably, there has been a significant 
training backlog as a result of the airlines' decisions during the 
pandemic to park planes, bump pilots off larger aircraft to smaller 
aircraft fleets and types, furlough during the lapse of the first PSP, 
and place pilots on inactive status. Given pilots are a seniority-
structured profession, this resulted in a massive, across-the-board 
allocation of pilots. Such decisions may have seemed reasonable to 
carriers as the industry, manufacturers, and analysts predicted an 
approximately three-to five-year recovery lag. However, because demand 
returned significantly quicker than predicted, airlines have 
consequently had to reverse these decisions and effectively retrain 
nearly every pilot, often back to the equipment they flew prior to the 
pandemic, while accommodating new pilot hiring due to growth. This 
massive training event is costly (e.g., mainline retraining cost per 
pilot is approximately $22,000 to $55,000), time-intensive, and set 
against a fixed training footprint of limited personnel and simulators 
that was never designed to respond to a one-off event like a global 
pandemic.
    This training backlog has affected flying capacity as carriers have 
more pilots today than in 2019, but pilot utilization--as measured in 
block hours--is down. For example, ALPA's seven largest mainline 
passenger airlines have more pilots than in 2019 but are flying 
substantially fewer block hours as airlines struggle with pilot 
training throughput. The CEOs of American, Delta, and Southwest agree 
and have publicly declared to investors that the constraint on their 
flying is pilot training, not supply.\2\

    Many of the regional carriers have complained about the ``pilot 
shortage,'' but what they really face is pilot attrition. The regional 
airline industry is necessarily fragile by its structure. Mainline 
carriers use their regional ``feed partners'' to operate their regional 
flying in small markets set by contract. These contracts require the 
regional airline to cover labor expenses, aircraft maintenance, and 
aircraft ownership costs, while the major airline effectively controls 
and limits regionals' economic capability, including ticket pricing and 
schedules. This arbitrage strategy has historically resulted in low 
pilot regional pay, single-digit operating margins, fewer regional 
carriers, and pilot-retention problems.
    For decades, pilots entered these low-paying positions at a 
specific regional airline with a ``flow'' program to a major carrier 
partner. However, flow programs have diminished in size and scope, 
guaranteeing very few mainline positions, while the ULCC carriers 
increasingly provide an avenue for pilots to move to higher-paying jobs 
more quickly, achieve greater career progression, or bypass the 
regional system entirely. Currently, regional airlines' problem is a 
matter of captain attrition, not inadequate numbers of first officers 
or overall pilot supply. Given the pay differential between regionals 
and their ULCC and mainline counterparts, captains have been leaving 
regional carriers as ULCCs and mainlines increased hiring the last two 
years. Mainline carriers in particular have been seeking first-mover 
advantages to build out their networks as demand for flying and, 
specifically, international flying opportunities increase. This post-
pandemic growth has created a temporary hiring binge by mainline 
carriers. By the admission of the largest regional carrier to its 
investors, with a new, higher-paying contract, they expect to ``manage 
attrition'' \3\ for captains while their first officer ``pilot classes 
[are] filled.'' \4\ This should be the case for many regional carriers 
who have followed suit in terms of improving pilot contracts and will 
face fewer headwinds as mainline hiring slows down.

    Since deregulation in 1978, airlines have made their business 
decisions based on expected consumer demand, geography of growth, route 
profitability, network planning and allocated flights, frequency of 
service, and aircraft purchases accordingly. With the cessation of the 
Payroll Support Program's requirement for continuation of air services 
for certain markets served prior to the pandemic, airlines began making 
substantial changes to meet pandemic-market demand, with leisure travel 
largely replacing small community business travel and many carriers 
ending or reducing service to markets they deemed no longer 
economically advantageous.
    Simultaneously, for nearly a decade, airlines have shifted to 
``higher gauge'' aircraft with more seats and away from fuel-
inefficient regional aircraft. According to Wall Street analysts, by 
retiring smaller regional jets in favor of larger and newer aircraft, 
carriers will ``see operating cost efficiency and market share gains'' 
\5\ by improving unit costs, matching consumer demand with supply, and 
improving aircraft features.\6\ Fifty-seat aircraft, which historically 
operate to smaller markets, are fuel inefficient, cannot accommodate 
high-end, first-class seating, are expensive to maintain, and 
consequently are being phased out by the industry.\7\ Put simply, 
airlines are in the business of making money and, right now, the profit 
is in leisure markets and in-demand cities through the use of larger 
aircraft. As a result, they are phasing out 50-seat regional jets in 
favor of narrowbody aircraft and reducing frequencies in favor of 
larger aircraft with high load factors and greater profitability. Such 
decisions, which are not made by pilots, are increasingly depriving 
small and rural markets of connectivity, business opportunities, and 
growth.

    As carriers rationalize their networks and increase the gauge of 
their aircraft, we must not let market demand sacrifice small and rural 
air service markets. We believe air service to small and rural 
communities is a national responsibility and that safe, efficient, and 
reliable air service to these communities is a critical component of 
our national air transportation system. We call on Congress to increase 
its support for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, and to 
incentivize greater carrier participation and increased service. The 
goal of the EAS program was to ensure that air connectivity for smaller 
and rural airports remained. Congress has, at times, either through the 
FAA authorization process or annual appropriations bills, impaired the 
program by limiting funding, restricting eligibility criteria, and 
eliminating program expansion.
    Airlines have cancelled their EAS contracts and thus eliminated air 
service to smaller and rural communities. Remedying the market failure 
of the deregulated airline industry's provision of air service to rural 
and small markets will require consideration for changing the subsidy 
and enplanement cap, allowing air carriers to renegotiate EAS contracts 
to account for unforeseen operating costs, revising the DOT's 
calculation for driving distance, allowing communities that lost EAS 
service to regain or reestablish eligibility, and revise the DOT's 
process for carrier selection. ALPA looks forward to working with the 
Committee to balance these reforms with careful financial stewardship 
to help ensure the irrevocable benefits of community air service remain 
a Federal priority.
Pipeline Development
    While the current supply of pilots is robust enough to meet demand, 
ALPA is fully committed to inspiring, developing, and supporting the 
next generation of pilots. Each year, ALPA connects with thousands of 
students--from elementary to university aged--to inspire young people 
from all backgrounds to see themselves as pilots. ALPA is also working 
to create an accessible, inclusive airline pilot workforce for all who 
are interested and for those who for too long have not been adequately 
represented in the pilot profession. Women and people of color, in 
particular, face significant barriers to becoming aviators--and that 
must change.
    Congress can and must do more to reduce the cost of flight 
training. Specifically, the FAA reauthorization provides an opportunity 
to amend the Higher Education Access Act of 1965 to ensure flight 
education and training qualify for federally subsidized student loans 
for four-year, two-year, and appropriately accredited Part 141 
programs. There is no reason for unequal loan treatment between a 
traditional college student and a student seeking to be a professional 
airline pilot, who must shoulder prohibitively costly private loans for 
training. We thank Senator Baldwin for her leadership and for working 
with ALPA to reduce financial barriers to entry in this great 
profession, and making clear that we will not lower the pilot training 
and qualification bar in the process. More wholistically, reforming 
educational opportunities should include increasing participation for 
underrepresented or nontraditional, low-income, and rural populations 
as well as providing grants to build flight training and education 
degree programs at minority-serving institutions, including 
historically Black colleges and universities. To ensure prospective 
student success and long-term career attachment, qualifying programs 
should be structured and accredited training programs, and cost control 
should be a consideration given that higher education institutions' too 
frequently capture the cost of Federal subsidy increases.
    This Committee should consider augmenting and growing the Workforce 
Development Grant Program originally authorized by the FAA 
Reauthorization Act of 2018. The program authorized support for 
educational and development projects for pilots and maintenance 
technical workers. We believe Congress must authorize and ultimately 
appropriate more resources for the program to have a greater impact. 
Additionally, we are supportive of adding new workforce eligibilities, 
including an aviation manufacturing program mirroring the existing 
programs. Chair Duckworth and Ranking Member Moran deserve considerable 
credit for their dogged support for the program, increasing its 
visibility, and attempting to grow its impact.
    Similarly, more must be done to increase female participation in 
aviation professions. ALPA was proud to not only fight for the Women in 
Aviation Advisory Board (WIAAB) as part of the last FAA bill, but also 
to serve on the Board. The findings in the WIAAB's report confirmed 
that women and men experience their careers in aviation differently--at 
all seniority levels--with barriers being largely systemic and no one 
entity or sector responsible for them or their resolution. The Board's 
report calls for unions, industry associations, government agencies, 
and Congress to share the responsibility of making changes to the 
industry in five areas: culture, recruitment, retention, advancement, 
and data. For these identified measures, we believe it is important to 
make the WIAAB permanent so it can focus on increasing and supporting 
female pilots and other aviation personnel. ALPA appreciates the 
ongoing contributions of the Committee, including Senators Peters and 
Fischer, for their engagement to make the Board permanent and increase 
support for women aviators and encourage more women in aviation fields.
    We would also draw attention to the Report's many recommendations 
regarding scheduling, family leave, and accommodations for mothers, 
including the Nursing Mothers' Accommodations (#40) recommendation. It 
is long overdue that Federal law stop discriminating against pilots and 
flight attendants regarding pumping by ending their exclusion from the 
Fair Labor Standards Act's (FLSA) provisions on break time and 
reasonable accommodations for nursing mothers when aboard aircraft. 
Congress passed the PUMP Act last year in order to remedy deficiencies 
in FLSA, but unfortunately industry lobbying killed provisions related 
to flight and cabin crew protections. Congress must end this gross 
inequity if it wishes to truly increase and support female growth and 
retention in the industry.
Protecting and Promoting the Rights of Workers
    Any discussion of workforce development must consider the 
preservation of the core rights of workers. This includes both 
preserving the rights airline employees enjoy under state and local 
laws, as well as holding the Department of Transportation to account 
for its failure to exercise its authority to protect U.S. airline 
employees from domestic and foreign efforts to undermine their rights 
and working conditions. The long-term growth and prospects for the 
pilot profession and other aviation personnel is based on stability and 
dignity. This Committee should look to the FAA reauthorization to 
advance, rather than diminish, these core tenets.
    ALPA opposes changes to the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA), in 
particular its scope of preemption of state law. In 1978 Congress 
limited ADA preemption so as not to foreclose state and local 
regulation of traditional areas of state concern regarding labor and 
employee issues as applied to aviation workers. By expressly tailoring 
preemption of state law only to circumstances where the states directly 
regulate customer-centric prices, routes, and airline service, Congress 
balanced the industry's need for uniformity in its relation to the 
traveling public while respecting the states' traditional ability to 
protect and support its citizens. Our members, like workers throughout 
the economy, avail themselves of the benefits provided by state and 
local governments to care for sick spouses, children, and to address 
medical concerns outside the protections provided by their collective 
bargaining agreements. These long-established protections should not be 
arbitrarily foreclosed.
    As this Committee recently observed in the railroad industry, 
transportation workers care significantly about matters unrelated to 
pay, and the flexibility to provide and care for oneself and family is 
necessary for a stable industry. Attempts to expand the intent and 
statutory framework of ADA preemption to swallow up and preclude these 
important state law rights will negate this significant progress. In 
challenging state and local laws, the airlines have unsuccessfully 
litigated a series of cases which attempted to block labor, paid sick 
leave, meal and rest, and related laws, including recent denial of 
petitions of certiorari before the Supreme Court. The establishment of 
labor standards falls within the traditional police power of the 
State--a settled principle that applies with equal force to airlines--
and the connection between the ADA and labor policy is extremely 
attenuated, as recognized by the courts. Any attempt to amend or 
otherwise undermine the accepted status of the ADA's preemption 
provisions, contrary to the courts' interpretation, in the pending FAA 
reauthorization or any other legislation will needlessly undermine 
long-existing rights of workers and will be strongly opposed by the 
American labor movement.
    It is also long past time that Congress direct the Department of 
Transportation to consider all of the public interest factors related 
to the protection of U.S. airline workers in its statute. In 1980, 
Congress required the Department of Transportation to consider the 
effect its economic regulations have on U.S. aviation workers, 
including in airline licensing cases. Specifically, that the Department 
``encourag[e] fair wages and working conditions'' for U.S. airline 
employees (49 U.S.C. Sec. 40101(a)(5). However, since deregulation, the 
DOT has believed that Congress did not want employee matters to play a 
consequential role in DOT decision making, irrespective of the 
responsibility Congress gave to it to take these interests into account 
in the statute.
    In recent decisions, the DOT has essentially disregarded Congress' 
interest regarding the protection of U.S. workers. In 2016, the DOT all 
but ignored the statutory public interest to grant a foreign air 
carrier permit to an airline -Norwegian Air International--that engaged 
in forum shopping to undermine labor standards. In July of 2022, the 
DOT granted a U.S. airline operating certificate to Waltzing Matilda 
Aviation LLC without imposing any safeguards to prevent the airline 
from basing all of its employees abroad under foreign labor laws. By 
ignoring the public interest, this arrangement would open up the door 
for would-be investors to set up ``nominal'' U.S. carriers with 
otherwise no material ties to the U.S., U.S. employees, or U.S. labor 
law to operate airlines point-to-point in the U.S. Finally, the 
Department proactively removed an employee protective clause in the 
Delta Air Lines-LATAM Joint Venture that would have ensured U.S. 
employees a fair share of new flying rather than inequitably benefiting 
the foreign partner.
    The Fair and Open Skies Act seeks to remedy some of these failures 
by (1) restoring and requiring the multifactor public interest test for 
foreign air carrier permits (49 USC 41302), (2) adding a new criterion 
regarding the undermining of labor standards, and (3) including labor 
standards language in the negotiating objectives for State and DOT to 
consider in bilateral negotiations to help prevent the U.S. from 
entering agreements without considering potential harm to workers and 
mitigations. We thank Senator Klobuchar for her long and enduring 
support for ensuring that U.S. airline employees are protected from 
arbitrage schemes and that the Department of Transportation do their 
part for aviation workers. We hope this provision will be included in 
the Committee's FAA reauthorization legislation.
    I appreciate the Committee's thoughtful and thorough consideration 
of our industry's workers and our contributions to the safest period in 
air transportation in history. The pilots of ALPA stand ready to assist 
this Committee with its important policy and oversight work.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Spero.

  STATEMENT OF DAVID SPERO, PRESIDENT, PROFESSIONAL AVIATION 
                  SAFETY SPECIALISTS, AFL-CIO

    Mr. Spero. Good morning. Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member 
Cruz. Chair Duckworth, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the 
Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify on behalf of 
the Professional Aviation Safety Specialist, AFL-CIO.
    PASS represents approximately 11,000 FAA and DOD employees 
throughout the United States who are tasked with ensuring that 
the U.S. aviation system remains the gold standard of safety.
    The largest bargaining unit is the ATO, Technical 
Operations Unit, consisting of technical employees who install, 
maintain, repair, and certify the radar, navigation, 
communication, and power systems making up the air traffic 
control system.
    PASS has long called attention to not only the need for 
sufficient technical staffing, but also the lack of a reliable 
staffing model on which to base staffing decisions and 
placement. The work of FAA technicians is vital to the safe and 
efficient operation of the NAS.
    While keeping the system safe is the number one priority of 
PASS members nationwide, the work they perform in-house can 
also save the agency time and money. Sufficiently staffing this 
workforce can lead to the upgrade of the NAS in a more 
efficient and cost-effective manner.
    To that end, PASS is asking Congress to direct the FAA to 
establish the technical operations workforce plan and consult 
with PASS in its creation and implementation. PASS believes 
that the abilities and skills that tech ops employees provide, 
if utilized and staffed properly, can provide a distinct 
improvement in the implementation of new NAS systems.
    PASS also represents aviation safety inspectors and other 
employees within ABS. Aviation safety inspectors in the Flight 
Standards Service and Aircraft Certification Service are 
responsible for the certification, oversight, surveillance, and 
enforcement of the entire aviation system.
    PASS is extremely concerned about the agency's inability to 
effectively and consistently staff the FAA inspector workforce. 
59 percent of the Certificate Management Office and 79 percent 
the Flight Standards District Office managers said in a 2021 
Inspector General report that they are understaffed.
    Among the reasons for this serious level of understaffing 
are increasing workload, hiring challenges, extended hiring and 
training periods, and increasing oversight responsibility, 
including new entrants in the evolving UAS segment.
    Furthermore, the staffing model currently being used by the 
agency is insufficient to determine the number of aviation 
safety inspectors needed. PASS is asking that the FAA be 
directed to revise its inspector staffing model in consultation 
with PASS.
    PASS is also requesting that the FAA increase the number of 
safety critical positions in flight standards. PASS is 
currently in contract negotiations on collective bargaining 
agreements with the FAA for the employees we represent in both 
ATO and ABS.
    PASS sees these negotiations as opportunities to focus on 
recruitment and retention of these essential employees. In 
fact, contract negotiations should serve as the perfect vehicle 
to promote recruitment and retention efforts.
    However, I regret to report that little progress has been 
made, especially when it comes to ABS negotiations. PASS 
sincerely seeks to assist the agency in maintaining and 
enhancing its aviation safety workforce, if only the agency was 
as equally committed.
    Finally, one of the elements that would help our collective 
bargaining is having a permanent head of the FAA. In a quote 
that was attributed to Teddy Roosevelt he said, the best 
executive is one who has sense enough to pick good men--pardon 
the gender--to do what he wants done and self-restraint enough 
to keep from meddling with them while they do it.
    I believe Phil Washington has the necessary attributes to 
succeed as the next FAA Administrator. PASS appreciates the 
opportunity to share information and recommendations regarding 
the FAA workforce. We stand ready to assist Members of Congress 
as you work toward addressing this important issue.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Spero follows:]

  Prepared Statement of David Spero, President, Professional Aviation 
                      Safety Specialists, AFL-CIO
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of the Committee, 
thank you for inviting me to testify on behalf of the Professional 
Aviation Safety Specialists, AFL-CIO (PASS) to discuss strengthening 
the aviation workforce.
    PASS represents approximately 11,000 Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) and Department of Defense employees throughout the 
United States. PASS-represented employees in the FAA install, maintain, 
support and certify air traffic control and national defense equipment, 
inspect and oversee the commercial and general aviation industries, 
develop flight procedures, and perform quality analyses of complex 
aviation systems used in air traffic control and national defense in 
the United States and abroad. PASS members work to ensure the safety 
and efficiency of the aviation system that transports over 2.9 million 
airline passengers across more than 29 million square miles of airspace 
(domestic and U.S. airspace over oceans) every day. The diversity of 
the PASS-represented workforce provides insight into the safety of the 
system they maintain and the industry they oversee. PASS members are 
tasked with ensuring that the U.S. aviation system remains the gold 
standard of safety.
    There has been a significant focus on recruitment and retention. It 
is worth noting that PASS is currently in negotiations on new 
collective bargaining agreements with the FAA for the employees we 
represent in the Air Traffic Organization (ATO) and Aviation Safety 
(AVS). This process presents a significant opportunity for PASS to 
assist the agency by negotiating over ways to enhance recruitment and 
retention. PASS appreciates the opportunity to share information and 
recommendations regarding the FAA workforce.
Air Traffic Organization
    The largest PASS bargaining unit is the ATO Technical Operations 
unit, consisting of technical employees who install, maintain, repair 
and certify the radar, navigation, communication and power systems 
making up the air traffic control system.
    Within Technical Operations, PASS represents FAA airway 
transportation systems specialists, sometimes referred to more simply 
as technicians. Systems specialists ensure the functionality of 
communications systems, computer systems, navigational aids and power 
systems vital to safe air travel and the mission of pilots and 
controllers. In addition, Flight Inspection Services (FIS) 
professionals and aeronautical professionals in Mission Support 
Services (MSS) support pilots, air traffic administrative professionals 
and aviation planners through the development and maintenance of all 
public instrument flight procedures and airways.
    PASS has long called attention to not only the need for sufficient 
technical staffing but also the lack of a reliable staffing model on 
which to base staffing decisions and placement. Along with sufficient 
staffing goes sufficient training. PASS is concerned with the training 
for both current employees and new hires. New hires in these areas of 
operation undergo extensive training that can last months, if not 
years. In addition, training slowed considerably due to the pandemic, 
which delayed technical education for Technical Operations staff. While 
some online training was made available, in-person training on critical 
equipment and software that serve the National Airspace System (NAS) is 
vital. We can collaboratively develop better ways to ensure workable 
training models. Furthermore, as technicians reach retirement age, 
there aren't enough fully trained employees to step into their shoes. 
It is imperative that the agency develop a model which allows for 
sufficient training for new hires and allows more seasoned employees to 
pass along their expertise to these employees prior to retirement.
    The work of FAA technicians is vital to the safe and efficient 
operation of the National Airspace System (NAS). It is also vital that 
this workforce be provided with the resources to permit them to be 
successful in this endeavor.
    This point is illustrated not only through the safe functioning of 
the NAS but also through recent milestones achieved by PASS-represented 
employees. For instance, in 2021, members of the Navigation 
Communications, or NavCom, team in Orlando, Fla., successfully replaced 
the glideslope facility shelters at the Orlando Executive and Orlando 
International airports. The glideslope is part of the facility's 
Instrument Landing System (ILS), which provides aircraft with precision 
vertical and horizontal navigation guidance information during approach 
and landing.
    The team was responsible for disassembling the prior shelters and 
reestablishing new infrastructures to house the equipment. In fact, the 
group had to rebuild part of the ILS. The capstone of the project were 
the flight inspections that determined the rebuilt systems were safe 
for flight. An enormous undertaking, the FAA employees completed the 
projects in just over a month, saving the agency both time and money. 
Given the current staffing models, this endeavor, although exceptional, 
is unable to be sustained.
    This is a prime example of how FAA employees represented by PASS 
have the knowledge, skills and abilities to perform these functions 
``in house'' rather than through contractors, whose work often extends 
the time to implement the new equipment and costs the agency more than 
is required. Staffing the workforce to perform similar installation 
projects would lead to the upgrade of the NAS in a much more efficient 
and cost-effective manner.
    It is undeniable that the FAA is lacking in sufficient technical 
staffing. For example, inadequate staffing has resulted in PASS-
represented employees being unable to serve on important agency groups 
and initiatives. To illustrate the issue, a PASS member who had been an 
integral participant with the Data Communications (DataComm) initiative 
needed to report back to his facility because of understaffing. 
DataComm is the FAA's next generation of communications between pilots 
and air traffic controllers. The PASS member was part of the group 
tasked with testing and overseeing development of the program. To 
emphasize his importance to the initiative, the DataComm program office 
specifically requested he be retained due to his extensive knowledge 
and experience. His expertise is critical to the implementation across 
the country; yet, due to insufficient staffing at his facility, he was 
not released and as of today, has still not been permitted to rejoin 
this important program.
    While PASS is pleased that members of Congress have recognized the 
important role stakeholders play in modernization of the system, 
without enough staffing in place, the agency stands to miss out on 
vital insight and information provided by frontline employees.
    PASS views our contract negotiations as an opportunity to make 
meaningful decisions aimed at recruiting and retaining employees 
throughout the ATO.
Technical Operations Workforce Plan
    PASS is currently engaged with the FAA on the development of the 
Technical Operations staffing model (TSM) and, while some progress is 
on the horizon, much work is still needed. This model only addresses 
the technical employees in the field who perform preventative 
maintenance and cannot be relied upon to address staffing for other 
duties they perform. It also does not reflect the work performed by 
support personnel who are not directly interfacing with live NAS 
equipment and systems. Furthermore, the model does not take into 
account new hire training or fatigue factors. PASS does not believe 
that the TSM is a reliable tool for determining staffing for this 
workforce.
    PASS is asking that the FAA be directed to establish a Technical 
Operations Workforce Plan and consult with PASS in its creation and 
implementation. PASS believes that the abilities and skills that Tech 
Ops employees provide, if utilized and staffed properly, can provide a 
distinct improvement in the implementation of new NAS systems. The 
development of the Technical Operations Workforce Plan should serve as 
a model for other plans to follow for Mission Support Services and 
Flight Program Operations. By creating Technical Operations pilot 
programs to build business cases for insourcing work to the technical 
workforce (similar to the work performed in Orlando), Congress can 
point the agency in a direction that will create lasting change for the 
aviation community and take a step forward in building confidence in 
the FAA's ability to provide new services and technologies in a 
fraction of the time it takes today.
Aviation Safety
    PASS represents aviation safety inspectors and other employees 
within AVS. Flight Standards Service (FSS) and Aircraft Certification 
Service (AIR) aviation safety inspectors are responsible for 
certification, education, oversight, surveillance and enforcement of 
the entire aviation system.
    PASS is extremely concerned about the agency's inability to 
effectively and consistently staff the FAA inspector workforce. In 
fact, according to a 2021 report by the Department of Transportation 
Inspector General (IG), an alarming 59 percent and 79 percent of 
Certificate Management Office and Flight Standards District Office 
managers, respectively, said their offices are short-staffed.\1\ Among 
the reasons cited in the IG report for understaffing are many reasons 
cited by PASS over the years. These include increasing workload, hiring 
challenges, extended hiring and training periods, and increasing 
oversight responsibility (including for the evolving UAS segment).

FAA Can Increase Its Inspector Staffing Model's Effectiveness by 
Implementing System Improvements and Maximizing Its Capabilities, 
August 11, 2021, p. 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The agency itself has recognized the need to maintain a robust 
inspector workforce. According to the FAA, ``To meet the safety needs 
of the NAS, AVS will need to recruit, hire, maintain, and retain a 
workforce with outstanding technical expertise, capabilities, and 
adaptability. Our efforts must ensure we can hire and retain the right 
people with the right skills and mindset, engaged at the right time, 
with systematic coordination between certification and operational 
suitability.'' \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ Federal Aviation Administration, Aviation Safety Workforce Plan 
2021-2030, p. i.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PASS agrees with the FAA and we are eager to assist in the 
administration of Section 104 of the Aircraft Certification Safety and 
Accountability Act. This law requires the administrator to collaborate 
and then bargain with the exclusive bargaining representatives of 
engineers, safety inspectors, and systems safety specialists regarding 
the recruitment of employees and for retention incentives for 
employees. Unfortunately, the agency is not in full compliance with 
this legal requirement. While a workgroup was created in name only, no 
demonstrable progress has been achieved.
    PASS is currently in contract negotiations with AVS for a new 
collective bargaining agreement. This should serve as a perfect vehicle 
to promote recruiting and retention. However, it is regrettable that no 
meaningful dialogue or progress has been made in bargaining to address 
the agency's needs for recruiting and retention. To date, it is our 
impression that AVS is ignoring most of our efforts at the bargaining 
table tailored toward recruiting and retention. All aviation 
stakeholders, including those representing airlines, general aviation 
and pilot certification, depend on the specialized and highly skilled 
workforce represented by PASS. Groups representing these interests 
would no doubt find AVS's lack of commitment to recruiting and 
retention alarming.
Aviation Safety Inspector Staffing Model
    The ``staffing model'' currently being used by the agency is 
insufficient to determine the number of aviation safety inspectors 
needed. As noted by the IG in 2021, due to the model not including 
relevant inspector staffing data, it ``will be limited in its ability 
to determine whether the model provides reliable information on 
projected inspector staffing levels.'' \3\ The same report noted that 
managers are reluctant to use the model.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Inspector General, 
FAA Can Increase Its Inspector Staffing Model's Effectiveness by 
Implementing System Improvements and Maximizing Its Capabilities, 
August 11, 2021, p. 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PASS is asking that the FAA be directed to revise its inspector 
staffing model in consultation with PASS. PASS is also requesting that 
the FAA increase the number of safety-critical positions in Flight 
Standards.
Aviation Registry
    The FAA Civil Aviation Registry is the largest in the world, 
maintaining a repository of over 300,000 aircraft. Its employees 
examine applications for aircraft registration and accepts or denies 
registration based on applicability of appropriate Federal statutes and 
regulations, and evidence of ownership.
    PASS represents these hardworking employees and strongly supports 
the FAA's efforts to hire additional employees to fill the empty 
positions of those who retired. Though there is a plan in place to hire 
additional employees, it will take six months to train them. Those 
positions being unfilled contributed to the current backlog, which PASS 
represented employees are diligently working to clear up. The backlog 
is currently under 120 days and is on schedule to be under 75 days by 
the end of April. We are talking with industry about ways to speed up 
the registry and look forward to further discussions as we work on FAA 
reauthorization.
Consolidation and Realignment of FAA Facilities
    Section 804 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, as 
amended by Section 510 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, 
establishes a workgroup for making recommendations regarding the 
consolidation and realignment of services and facilities. While PASS 
appreciates that members of Congress and the FAA recognize the 
important roles PASS-represented employees play in making such 
decisions, it is imperative that organizational changes that impact the 
NAS are covered under this umbrella. Furthermore, it should be ensured 
that this process is applied to the merging or consolidating of 
Technical Operations facilities or the reduction of services to air 
traffic control that could occur.
    Clarity on this matter could have precluded a significant 
disruption to the facility outage reporting process in the FAA's 
Operational Control Centers (OCCs) due to the premature closing of the 
Pacific Operations Control Center (POCC) in San Diego. There are long-
term solutions that are still needed to address the matter. FAA is 
working with PASS to implement solutions. The agency deserves credit 
for recognizing that the decision was flawed and for collaborating with 
PASS on some solutions.
    PASS continues to provide the FAA with representatives to provide 
input and recommendations regarding consolidation and realignment. We 
ask that the agency continue to proceed with caution and consider all 
factors involved.
Conclusion
    The work of the highly trained and skilled employees represented by 
PASS is essential to protecting aviation safety and fulfilling the 
agency's mission. PASS recognizes that having the appropriate and 
skilled workforce in place is essential to maintaining safety of the 
system. We want to work with the agency to recruit and retain the very 
best employees. This can be accomplished in many ways including through 
collective bargaining.
    PASS respectfully calls on this committee to consider our areas of 
concern and recognize the critical contributions made by the employees 
we represent. As always, we stand ready to work with you to ensure that 
the United States remains the safest aviation system in the world.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. We now recognize Dr. Utash 
for her statement.

           STATEMENT OF DR. SHEREE UTASH, PRESIDENT,

                WICHITA STATE UNIVERSITY, CAMPUS

               OF APPLIED SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY

    Dr. Utash. Well, good morning, Chair Cantwell, Chair 
Duckworth, Ranking Member Cruz, and Ranking Member Moran.
    I am Sheree Utash and I serve as the President of WSU Tech 
and the Vice President for Workforce Development at Wichita 
State University in Wichita, Kansas, and I want to thank you 
for the opportunity to address you this morning on behalf of 
higher education.
    I also want to thank you all for championing this cause of 
fortifying our aviation workforce, which is critical, as we all 
know. At WSU Tech, our National Center for Aviation Training 
operates a State-of-the-art facility located on Jabar Airport 
in Wichita, Kansas, where over 250,000 square feet of teaching 
and learning happens for aviation and manufacturing.
    We design, we build, we fly, we manufacture, with quality 
inspection, maintenance, and pilot training, all offering 
educational workforce development for the aviation and 
manufacturing industry.
    Our aviation maintenance program provides the opportunity 
to study in a hands-on learning environment, combining 
lectures, hands on work, and independent projects. The program 
is rigorous and it holds students to the industry's highest 
standards. As a result, it has a national reputation for 
excellence.
    In academic year 2022, we had 315 students enrolled in this 
program. 54 of those were high school students. 10 percent were 
female, 30 percent had racial ethnicity, and 38 percent were 
Pell Grant eligible.
    Ninety-two percent of those graduates are now working in 
high demand jobs in aerospace throughout South Central Kansas. 
In fact, Wichita, the largest city in which--in Kansas, is 
recognized globally as the air capital of the world and is one 
of five aviation clusters of the world.
    The average aviation maintenance mechanic salary in 
Wichita, Kansas, is $84,000. Approximately 50,000 people work 
in Wichita's aviation manufacturing industry, primarily at the 
four main aircraft manufacturing plants, Spirit AeroSystems, 
Textron, which is Cessna and Beechcraft, and Bombardier.
    Additionally, more than 2,500 manufacturing firms operate 
in Kansas as part of that aviation supply chain. I have long 
believed that the best three-legged stool to get things done is 
when Government, education, and industry work together in 
collaboration.
    The National Center for Aviation Training is a great 
example of that that opened 12 years ago. It was a result of 
vision and leadership of each of those sectors coming together 
to solve a problem, to focus on creating opportunities for 
productive lives for citizens, and to ensure our country 
continues to build economic prosperity.
    I believe those shared values are the guiding principles we 
need today to meet the challenges and opportunities we 
collectively have before us to build the aviation workforce for 
today and for the future.
    It is both a great responsibility and a privilege to 
provide educational training pathways for those that are 
starting their career or those that may be upskilling or 
reskilling. I always say at WSU Tech, who wouldn't want to be 
in the life changing business, because that is what we are 
doing is transforming lives.
    We must continue to build upon this success by building 
partnerships with industry and becoming more strategic in our 
recruiting efforts. We have strong partnerships with Spirit 
AeroSystems, Textron Aviation, Bombardier, and that large 
supply chain I mentioned that reaches aviation across the 
globe.
    We must continue to understand and meet their workforce 
needs. We also have to recruit differently. We have recently 
created the Future Ready Center for Aviation and Manufacturing, 
with the state's largest school district, where juniors and 
seniors can begin their technical education career while in 
high school.
    We have developed a new Earn and Learn Program, as Senator 
Moran mentioned, Get to Werx, W-e-r-x, with a local maintenance 
repair operation where students are employed day one and work 
full time in addition to going to college.
    The employer pays them a full-time wage and benefits in 
addition to funding their education. This is a great example of 
our commitment at WSU Tech and Wichita State to students having 
an applied learning experience so they are engaged in their 
learning while they are earning in their industry of choice.
    As I conclude my comments, I want to emphasize again that 
education, industry, and Government all have a role to play in 
meeting the workforce needs of the aviation ecosystem.
    Key elements will include, but not be limited to FAA 
reauthorization, aviation career awareness of middle school 
children, the importance of short-term Pell Grants, the 
continued and increased funding of the workforce grants, and 
building strategies to encourage diversity in gender, 
underrepresented populations both economically and of color, 
and a better transition for our veterans.
    I want to thank you for this opportunity, and I look 
forward to answering questions when appropriate.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Utash follows:]

   Prepared Statement of Dr. Sheree Utash, President, Wichita State 
         University, Campus of Applied Sciences and Technology
    Good morning, Chair Cantwell, and members of the Subcommittee. My 
name is Sheree Utash, and I serve as the President of Wichita State 
University Campus of Applied Sciences and Technology (WSU Tech) and 
Vice President of Workforce Development for Wichita State University in 
Wichita, Kansas. Thank you for the opportunity to address you this 
morning.
    WSU Tech's National Center for Aviation Training operates a state-
of-the-art training facility located on Jabara Airport in Wichita, Ks. 
It provides students the opportunity to study aircraft maintenance in a 
hands-on learning environment combining lectures, hands-on-work, and 
independent projects. The program is rigorous, and our program holds 
its students to the industry's highest standards. As a result, it has a 
national reputation for excellence, and places 92 percent of its 
graduates in high-demand jobs in aerospace throughout south central 
Kansas after graduation.
    In fact, Wichita, the largest city in Kansas is recognized globally 
as the Air Capital of the World and is one of five aviation clusters in 
the world. This designation is largely based on the city's rich history 
in the early days of aviation and the concentration of aviation and 
defense research, development and manufacturing located there today. 
The average Aviation Maintenance Mechanic salary in Wichita, Ks is 
$84,702 as of Feb 2023, but the salary range typically falls between 
$73,788 and $95,478 (Salary.com). Approximately 50,000 people work in 
Wichita's aircraft manufacturing industry, which is 1 out of every 6 
aircraft-manufacturing workers in the USA, primarily at the four main 
aircraft manufacturing plants: Spirit AeroSystems, Textron (Cessna and 
Beechcraft) and Bombardier Learjet. Additionally, more than 2,500 
manufacturing firms operate in Kansas as part of the aviation supply 
chain.
    Despite our success, we frankly need your help. According to 
Boeing's latest Pilot and Technician Outlook, between 2022 and 2040, 
the global civilian aviation sector will need 610,000 new technicians 
to support the commercial fleet over the next 20 years--134,000 of 
those technicians will serve North American markets. The U.S. is ill-
poised to meet that demand; aviation technician personnel pipelines are 
stagnant at best, growing only about 2 percent a year. In contrast, a 
report published by the Aviation Technician Education Council (ATEC) 
maintains that technician production must increase by 20 percent to 
meet industry's growing demand. Additionally, in this same report it is 
projected that the aviation industry will need 612,000 new pilots 
across the globe. In North America, specifically, Boeing estimates that 
we will need 130,000 new pilots by 2040.
    Consulting firm Oliver Wyman predicts that the gap between supply 
and demand for aviation technician workers will reach between 8 and 12 
percent this year, that shortfall only eclipsed by the larger shortage 
anticipated later this decade.
    We are seeing the effects. Workforce shortages are creating airline 
disruptions that reverberate through the network. And while flight 
cancellations and delays get the most public attention, the lack of 
technical personnel is hitting third-party maintenance, repair, and 
overhaul facilities the hardest. A pre-pandemic study by the 
Aeronautical Repair Station Association found that the technician 
shortage is costing the repair station industry $100 million per month, 
a figure that has likely increased since the industry trimmed its 
workforce during the uncertain days of 2020 now find themselves 
scrambling to meet demand.
    The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reports that, nationally, 
the aviation sector accounts for more than 5 percent of the U.S. gross 
domestic product, contributes $1.6 trillion in total economic activity, 
and supports nearly 11 million jobs. Moreover, aviation manufacturing 
continues to be the Nation's top net export (FAA, 2016). In Kansas, 
aviation is a significant economic catalyst. Over 91,000 jobs are 
directly or indirectly related to the sector, including 42,000 from 
Aerospace Manufacturing. These employees receive more than $4.4 billion 
in total payroll and generate more than $20.6 billion in annual 
economic output for the state of Kansas according to the 2017 Kansas 
Aviation Economic Impact Study. As such, the aviation sector plays a 
key role in supporting and building on Kansas's economic strengths, and 
possesses strong potential for bringing high-wage, high-demand jobs and 
increased business to the state and region.
    Supporting this vibrant sector takes a qualified workforce of 
highly trained technicians and specialized MRO (Maintenance, Repair, 
and Operations) facilities that maintain and rehabilitate commercial 
and military aircraft fleets. According to the Aeronautical Repair 
Station Association's (ARSA) 2017 report titled U.S. Employment and 
Economic Impact by State, aviation maintenance employs more than 
277,000 people and generates over $44 billion in economic activity 
nationally. The aviation industry in Kansas contributes $7 billion to 
the Kansas GDP, $2.25 billion in annual aerospace exports and is #3 in 
the largest concentration of aviation workers in the United States.
    I am participating this morning to encourage you to increase 
support to Aviation Technology programs like we offer at WSU Tech. I 
mentioned our program's national and international reputation for 
excellence, and its rigor. Students complete 1,900 hours of training, 
over 100 exams, and nearly 300 hands-on projects. The program offers an 
Associate of Applied Science degree in Aviation Technology and 
accompanying certificates for direct employment in the core skill areas 
of: (1) Airframe and Power-plant (2) Structural Repair, and (3) 
Avionics. The program is designed to replicate the industry to provide 
students with a real-world experience throughout the program. WSU Tech 
is one of about half of FAA-approved schools offering an Aviation 
Maintenance associate degree in the Nation. Additionally, we have 
recently developed a drone maintenance and private pilot degrees and 
certifications. At the National Center for Aviation Training, we have 
developed an academic ecosystem that mirrors all phases of the aviation 
industry. From engineering design to all manufacturing processes, to 
maintenance and repair, quality inspection, avionics, and flight we 
have industry recognized credentials, certificates, and degrees. 
Additionally, we work closely with our high school partners and deliver 
our programs to juniors and seniors. We are working to develop a new 
program that will set up five high school programs a year, across the 
state and be the provider of Choose Aerospace curriculum in 
collaboration with Aviation Technician education Council (ATEC). We 
anticipate we would serve 100 students in the first year and increase 
that number by 100 each in the second and third years as we expand to 
more schools. This opportunity to expand into high schools became 
available with the passage of the new Part 147 that governs aviation 
maintenance schools. We hope to take advantage of this opportunity and 
expand aviation career education across the state of Kansas.
    We are developing and are implementing industry-education 
partnerships based in applied learning opportunities to expand our 
student capacity and build a talent pipeline for the aviation 
industries of Kansas. We are also focusing on introducing these career 
opportunities to students in middle school, working with 
underrepresented populations to do our part to make certain that the 
aviation workforce of the 21st century is supported.
    But we need to do more. We need your support to strengthen efforts 
by educators, workforce development programs, and economic development 
organizations to align education and workforce training programs with 
employer needs. We need to urge new and more innovative industry-career 
and technical education partnerships that support student success and 
meet the diverse needs of students, industry, and our communities, 
resulting in a much broader talent pool, thereby enhancing the aviation 
workforce.
    Thank you for this opportunity. I look forward to addressing your 
questions.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. And now, quite patiently, I 
recognize Mr. Raman Ramanathan.

                 STATEMENT OF RAMAN RAMANATHAN,

          AMERICAS AEROSPACE & DEFENSE SECTOR LEADER,

                       ERNST & YOUNG LLP

    Mr. Ramanathan. Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, Chair 
Duckworth, Ranking Member Moran, and members of the Committee, 
thank you for inviting me to speak today on the challenges and 
opportunities to strengthen the aviation workforce.
    As the Ernst and Young U.S. Aerospace and Defense Sector 
Leader, I have the honor of working with some of the largest 
and most innovative aerospace and defense companies in the U.S. 
to meet their growth operations and talent objectives.
    In my role, I also lead EY's collaboration with the 
Aerospace Industries Association Annual Workforce Survey. My 
comments today will include results from the survey, which I 
asked to submit as part of the written testimony.
    I should note at the outset that any commentary reflects my 
personal views and is not intended to reflect the views of 
Ernst and Young. The 2022 AIA Workforce Survey reaffirms the 
industry's challenges, many of which are well known, some of 
which have been or will be discussed today by my fellow 
panelists.
    Among the challenges presented in the report, I would like 
to emphasize three today. First, the survey highlights the 
challenges and drivers of attrition, attraction, and retention. 
While engineering and technical schools are generating new 
talent, a sizable portion of those talent is lost to other 
industries, such as technology, which offer higher 
compensation, faster career progression, enhanced flexibility, 
and other benefits.
    The challenge to attract and retain talent is more 
pronounced in the lower tiers of the aerospace supply chain 
that deliver components and parts to aircraft and other 
subsystems in the aircraft.
    Second, the survey points out the need for talent to be 
upskilled and reskilled to support the aviation workforce of 
the future. Currently, there is a gap within the workforce's 
current capacity and capabilities, which is exacerbated by the 
evolution of the desired skill sets required for the future.
    These future skills include more digital, artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, data science, and automation 
capabilities. Third, competitive pressure in the aerospace 
industry is growing around the globe.
    European aerospace companies continue to expand their share 
and content on global aircraft market, which helps them fund 
new aircraft and technology development. Asia is accelerating 
the growth and maturation of its indigenous aerospace industry 
with advances in airframe, propulsion, avionics, and aircraft 
systems, and will have competitive offerings in the future.
    Regions and countries that have already a capable workforce 
will have a competitive advantage. The enduring success of our 
aerospace industry has been the steady stream of top tier 
talent from every corner of the country. To retain the lead, 
aerospace needs to grow their ability to attract and retain 
this talent in the face of intense competition from other 
sectors.
    As the survey shows, companies are adapting to the 
challenge by offering more flexible working models and growing 
more diverse to leverage new talent sources. The survey also 
informs more can be done. For example, support the efforts to 
build excitement in the commercial aerospace industry.
    Industry observers believe that there are at least two 
broad areas that can drive excitement, next generation 
transport aircraft from medium to long range travel, perhaps 
using conventional architecture, but using advanced 
technologies, and advanced or urban air mobility involving 
newer architectures and the supporting infrastructure.
    Both areas offer opportunities for innovation and 
experience around opportunities for talent to make an impact, 
to make a difference. We recognize that Congress is adding 
debates around some of these topics.
    We believe Congress is focused on attracting and reskilling 
the workforce of the future is a worthwhile endeavor. Another 
example enabled expansion of eligible workforce pool. This 
could include facilitating access to other talent pools across 
various geographies, demographics, industries, and promoting 
efforts to create access for education for early career 
professionals and reskilling for mid-career professionals.
    I applaud this committee for engaging on aviation workforce 
issues during such a critical time, as the U.S. shifts from a 
COVID centered footing and the demand for commercial aerospace 
talent is surging back.
    Air traffic has begun to return. IATA January press release 
shows that the global domestic passenger traffic is at 97 
percent of 2019 levels, and international traffic is at 77 
percent of 2019 level and growing.
    While we may not have a demand problem, the survey 
indicates that we do have a workforce supply problem. The 
discussion to strengthen the aviation workforce is a vital part 
of the aerospace industry's future. I am honored to join you 
here today. Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Ramanathan follows:]

 Prepared Statement of Raman Ramanathan, Americas Aerospace & Defense 
                    Sector Leader, Ernst & Young LLP
    Chair Cantwell, Ranking Member Cruz, and members of the committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to speak today on the challenges and 
opportunities to strengthen the aviation workforce. As the EY U.S. 
Aerospace & Defense Sector Leader, I have the honor of working with 
some of the largest and most innovative aerospace and defense companies 
in the U.S. to meet their growth, operations, and talent objectives. In 
my role I also lead EY's collaboration with the Aerospace Industries 
Association (AIA) annual workforce survey. My comments will include 
results from the survey which I ask to submit as part of my written 
testimony.
    I should note at the outset that any commentary reflects my 
personal views and is not intended to reflect the views of Ernst & 
Young, LLP.
    The 2022 AIA workforce survey reaffirms the industry's challenges, 
many of which are well known and some of which have been or will be 
discussed today by my fellow panelists. Among the challenges presented 
in the report, would like to emphasize three today:

  <bullet> First, the survey highlights the challenges and drivers of 
        attrition, attraction, and retention. While engineering & 
        technical schools are generating new talent, a sizeable portion 
        of this talent is lost to other industries, such as technology, 
        offering higher compensation, faster career progression, 
        enhanced flexibility, and other benefits. The challenge to 
        attract and retain talent is more pronounced in the lower tiers 
        of supply chain that deliver components and parts of aircraft 
        and various subsystems.

  <bullet> Second, the survey points out the need for talent to be 
        upskilled and re-skilled to support the aviation workforce of 
        the future. Currently there is a gap within the workforce's 
        current capacity and capabilities, which is exacerbated by the 
        evolution of desired skillsets required for the future. These 
        future skills include more digital, artificial intelligence, 
        machine learning, data science, and automation capabilities.

  <bullet> Third, competitive pressure in the aerospace industry is 
        growing around the globe. European aerospace companies continue 
        to expand their share and content on global aircraft market--
        which helps them fund new aircraft and technology development. 
        Asia is accelerating the growth and maturation of its 
        indigenous aerospace industry with advances in airframe, 
        avionics, propulsion, and aircraft systems, and will have 
        competitive offerings in the future. Regions and countries that 
        have a ready and capable workforce will have a competitive 
        advantage.

    The enduring success of our aerospace industry has been the steady 
stream of top-tier talent from every corner of the country. To retain 
the lead, aerospace needs to grow its ability to attract and retain 
this talent in the face of intense competition. As the survey shows, 
companies are adapting to this challenge by offering more flexible 
working models and growing more diverse to leverage new talent sources.
    The survey also informs that more can be done, for example:

  <bullet> Support the efforts to build excitement in commercial 
        aerospace. Industry observers believe that there are at least 
        two broad commercial aerospace areas that can drive 
        excitement--next generation air transport aircraft for medium 
        to long-range travel using conventional architecture but 
        advanced technologies, and urban/advanced air mobility 
        involving newer architectures and the supporting 
        infrastructure. Both areas offer opportunities for innovation; 
        experience around opportunities to make an impact--to make a 
        difference. We recognize that Congress is having debates around 
        some of these topics. We believe Congress' focus on attracting 
        and re-skilling the workforce of the future is a worthwhile 
        endeavor.

  <bullet> Enable the expansion of eligible workforce pool. This could 
        include facilitating access to other talent pools across 
        various geographies and demographics and industries, promoting 
        efforts to create access to education for early career 
        professionals and re-skilling.

    I applaud this committee for engaging on aviation workforce issues 
during such a critical time. As the U.S. shifts from a COVID-centered 
footing, the demand for commercial aerospace talent is surging back. 
Air traffic has begun to return--IATA January press release shows that 
global domestic passenger traffic is at 97 percent of 2019 level, and 
international traffic is at 77 percent of 2019 level and growing.
    While we may not have a demand problem, the survey indicates that 
we do have a workforce supply problem. This discussion to strengthen 
the aviation workforce is a vital part of the aerospace industry's 
future. I am honored to join you here today. Thank you.

    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. And without objection, we 
will include the survey results that you mentioned for the 
record.

    Senator Duckworth. I now recognize myself for the first 
line of questioning.
    Dr. Lutte, thank you for your service on the Women in 
Aviation Advisory Board. I find it incredibly frustrating that 
only 2.6 percent of aviation mechanics in the United States are 
women, and that representation of women as a percentage of the 
total number of aviation maintenance technicians has barely 
budged over the past decade.
    We just aren't making the kind of progress that we need. 
And it is even more discouraging that this is happening when we 
face such an acute need to grow the workforce. I know how 
critical it is to conduct outreach to young women while they 
are still in school to help broaden their horizons and 
hopefully inspire and prepare these young Americans with 
potentially high paid careers in aviation mechanic work.
    The Aviation Workforce Development Grant Program provides 
funding for this type of outreach and education. Dr. Lutte, 
could you explain the return on investment that Congress could 
expect if it dramatically increases aviation workforce 
development grant program funding to meet industry demand and 
help broaden outreach to more Americans, particularly young 
women?
    Dr. Lutte. Certainly. Absolutely, maintenance is definitely 
a clear area, as we talked about earlier, of talent crisis. So 
as mentioned, you know, 3 percent of maintenance technicians 
are women. I will say there is a slight bit of good news on 
that front. So, the most recent ATEC report that came out had 
the number, the percentage of graduates from aviation 
maintenance technical schools at 9 percent, so--exactly.
    I mean, it has tripled but we are still in the single 
digits. And one of the things that came out of that report that 
was very disturbing to me also is that only 42 percent of the 
graduates from these schools are actually going on and doing 
the AMP certification.
    So, although it is 9 percent graduates, that is not really 
going to convert to a big increase in women in maintenance 
numbers. So, workforce development grants are something that we 
talk about in the board report and highly recommend expansion 
of workforce development grants as a tool to help us draw in 
and more workforce and a broader representation in workforce, 
in particular women, to the aviation industry.
    So those grants give us the ability to, as you mentioned, 
expand in education and awareness. We know this is a key area 
is to get people introduced, women introduced to aviation, 
particularly at a young age.
    So over half of women surveyed, for example, in aviation 
said that one of the major influencing factors for them 
choosing aviation was getting introduced to it as a young girl 
or a young woman. So, it is essential.
    Workforce development grants give us the opportunity to do 
that. And they also give us the opportunity to not have to 
reinvent the wheel. So, there are some really great programs 
that we have for outreach for youth, everything from, you know, 
Awam, Girls in Aviation Day, and Organization Black Aerospace 
Professionals with Girls Launch, Young Eagles, of course, EAA.
    But there are lots of programs that are out there for 
aviation outreach. And one of the things that the development 
grants allow us to do is to capitalize on what already exists, 
expand it, deepen it, broaden it, and really have the 
opportunity to recruit and retain more women into aviation.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Captain Ambrosi, can you give 
us ALPA's view on this, on the return-on-investment in 
Congress? I am afraid that we are sending a message that 
workforce, aviation workforce development is a low priority 
when most applicants don't receive the requested funding.
    Can you speak a little bit about what you think the return 
on investment would be if we drastically scaled up aviation 
workforce development grant funding from the $10 million a year 
it is right now to better approach the scale of need, which 
seems closer to $100 million a year?
    Mr. Ambrosi. Absolutely. Thank you for your question. 
First, let me thank you for your opening comments on preventing 
special interests from rolling back safety regulations. But on 
this topic, ALPA absolutely supports increasing funding to 
women and underrepresented groups involved in aviation.
    This is a great profession. It is something to be proud of. 
We need to reach out to these folks. I have an 8-year-old 
daughter that I hope has an easier ability to get into this 
business than females in my generation did, you know, over 30 
years ago when I started in this process. So absolutely, we 
have--ALPA does outreach.
    We go to everything from elementary schools. We have done 
over 2,000 visits from elementary schools up to higher 
education. So, we absolutely support and believe there is an 
excellent return on investment.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Dr. Utash, I understand you 
sought one of these grants and did not receive it, and that is 
unfortunately a common experience. Can you speak a little bit 
about the need to increase the grant program?
    Dr. Utash. Certainly, thank you. We have applied the last 
two rounds and we have not received it. But I also have 
reviewed the proposals of those that received, which, you know, 
absolutely are great workforce programs. But I also perused all 
of the ones that did not receive funding.
    And so, we would absolutely support the additional funding. 
What--there wasn't a proposal in that group that did not have a 
good return on investment, in my personal opinion. In ours, 
what we were trying to do was to, with the recent changes in 
the FAA regulations for the maintenance program, was to be able 
to take the general part of aviation across the State of Kansas 
to all of our high schools.
    There is a--that is a broad reach and a large net that can 
be cast. And every single one of those proposals that I perused 
and looked at, I thought had a great return on investment. So, 
we would highly encourage from education that that funding be 
expanded.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. I now recognize my Ranking 
Member, Senator Moran.
    Senator Moran. Chairwoman, thank you very much. I look 
forward to continuing to work with you as we have in the past 
on workforce issues, especially in aviation.
    Let me ask you just a broad question, and maybe this is for 
Dr. Lutte or Dr. Utash, Mr. Ramanathan. What is the difference 
between just encouraging STEM education and encouraging 
aviation education?
    So, we spend a lot of time trying to convince women, young 
students for--to pursue degrees in science, mathematics, 
engineering, and research. Does that translate into something 
that matters to aviation, or does the educational focus need to 
be specifically toward aviation? Dr. Lutte, you have your head 
nodding.
    Dr. Lutte. Well, you know, to me personally, it is the 
passion for aviation. I mean, there is something about aviation 
that hooks you in, you know, whether it is, you know, that 
first time you look up and see the airplane and, you know, that 
that is your dream and that is what you want to do.
    I just see that in a different way. It probably a little 
bit of bias for the aviation bug for me. But in terms of 
recruiting and retention, I think it is critically important to 
think about it. We know, for example, from research that young 
women tend to self-select out of STEM programs.
    They don't feel necessarily welcomed in STEM programs. So, 
I think it is really important, in terms of outreach and 
education and some of the areas that we are talking about here, 
that when we do outreach, we do it from a focus of aviation 
first, STEM second. If you lead with STEM, you are going to 
have potentially self-selected out women or young women from 
those programs.
    And that is not what hooks them in. You know, the research 
shows that what hooks young women into aviation, the number one 
response on a survey of women in aviation was passion for 
aviation, followed by the desire to be challenged.
    You know, that is where the hook is. So, I think we lead 
with aviation because we want to send the message that, you 
know, if you are not interested in STEM, aviation isn't for 
you. That is not what we want to send. We want to let people 
know, get hooked on it, or, you know, if you have the passion 
for it, there is a place for you.
    Senator Moran. So, there is a distinction.
    Dr. Lutte. I believe so, yes.
    Dr. Utash. I would add into that, I do think there is a 
distinction. But I think the other thing that is so critically 
important about this is young children, middle school children, 
they don't--they know what a pilot is, but they don't know what 
all the other things, you know, you think about at Alaska 
Airlines, all the people that make that plane fly, all the 
people it takes that is in that infrastructure.
    I don't think people really understand, young children 
don't really understand what those opportunities are. On a 
flight I was on yesterday, it was a 45-minute delay because a 
maintenance person needed to come fix something so that we 
could go on the air safely.
    That--we have to do a better job, because--and the way it 
ties in, Senator Moran, to the STEM is that you do have to have 
some strong science and math skills to be successful. But I 
think leading with the passion, leading with the awareness 
piece, and then building from there, I think is a better way to 
encourage young people in this profession.
    Senator Moran. Mr. Ramanathan, I think you said something 
about we lose to other industries within the tech sector, 
aviation workers.
    Mr. Ramanathan. Yes, Senator, I concur with some of the 
panelist comments. You touched on Dr. Lutte. I think you need, 
you know, we like--you know, we are all passionate people in 
the sector and we like people, you know, to have passion in the 
aviation sector for sure. But STEM is a building block.
    I mean, I think the basics of physics and mathematics is a 
building block, so that definitely helps for somebody to be 
preparing for an aviation or aerospace professional. Having 
said that, I think the distinction is a lot of the STEM, you 
know, we do not have a problem in graduates coming out of, you 
know, colleges or universities, but a lot of them are attracted 
to other sectors.
    So, if it is a pure STEM person, could be attracted to 
other sectors, namely tech, if you will, that offers, as the 
survey showed, you know, from AIA, that offers higher 
compensation, flexible working models, and faster career 
progression versus a, you know, aerospace industry.
    So, if you are a STEM person could be, you know, attracted 
to other sectors. Whereas the aviation passionately STEM person 
could be more attracted to stay in the sector.
    Senator Moran. Thank you all for your answers. I would 
highlight that next month we will help cut a ribbon in 
Atchison, Kansas, on a museum honoring Amelia Earhart, which 
I--and when we have changed out our statue, our state's statue 
in Statuary Hall to Amelia Earhart.
    And again, those kinds of circumstances, perhaps a history 
lesson allows us to capture people to be interested, and in 
this case, particularly women to be interested in careers in 
aviation and aerospace. Do you have suggestions how we can--we 
are going to focus a lot of attention at the museum on STEM.
    If you can help us figure out how we, based upon our 
conversation, how we make sure that that STEM that lends itself 
well to careers in aviation.
    Dr. Lutte. I think one of the key areas is just put women 
in front of, you know, young people. I mean, have people that 
look like them as a part of the presentation and a part of the 
experience. So, I think that can be a really powerful thing, is 
to see it be an experience, right. So, in the end, as was 
mentioned, I think introducing a variety of areas of aviation 
occupations is important as well, so.
    Senator Moran. Dr. Lutte, Acheson is only a short distance 
from Omaha--we would like it if you could see us.
    Dr. Lutte. You bet. Absolutely.
    Senator Moran. Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. I recognize Senator Klobuchar.

               STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA

    Senator Klobuchar. Well, thank you so much, Chair. And 
thank you, Senator Moran. I was a huge fan of Amelia Earhart 
growing up. It was one of those fourth-grade biographies I read 
over and over again. So, I am excited----
    Senator Moran. Well, look at you today.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes, there we go. Well, now I have my 
new aviation hero in Tammy Duckworth, so there we are. But 
thank you, and I am proud to co-chair the Travel and Tourism 
Caucus with Senator Moran.
    And so, a lot of the issues you have been talking about 
resonate at home where Minnesota actually has 126 general 
aviation airports that need trained staff. We have--our airport 
was once again voted best in the country, in the Twin Cities. 
And then, of course, we make Cirrus jets and have an air base, 
and are really proud of aviation in our state. But we just have 
a huge workforce issue right now.
    And that is why I am working on a number of bipartisan 
efforts with Senators Duckworth, Thune, Moran, Fischer, and 
Kelly to expand the FAA's workforce development grant program. 
This was mentioned, and then Senator Moran and Capito and I 
have a bill to work on and recommend improvements to future 
outages, which we don't want to see, and how we bring all the 
stakeholders there so we move to the next generation of air 
traffic control. It is going to be really, really important.
    So, and I passed a bill on women in STEM just because I 
just see that, if we are going to add more workers and more 
workforce, we don't want to leave a whole bunch of our workers 
behind. So, I guess I would start with sort of the current.
    Captain Ambrosi, in your testimony, you state that post-
pandemic air travel demand returned significantly and quicker 
than predicted. Can you describe what impacts there were on new 
pilot hiring and training as a result of that demand?
    Mr. Ambrosi. Yes, absolutely, Senator. Thank you. As you 
know, the airlines, we didn't know--they didn't know that a 
vaccine was going to happen so fast. And, you know, the 
leadership here on the payroll support program, you know, 
they--everybody thought that--they were fighting to keep the 
lights on.
    So, they have down--they probably overreacted in light of 
it and displaced, and bumped people down to smaller airplanes. 
And it would take so long for us to train back the other way. 
In the recovery, we are still trying to recover from that. 
Airlines have more pilots.
    The big airlines have far more pilots than they had pre-
pandemic right now, but they are still not operating at that 
pre-pandemic level.
    Senator Klobuchar. Because of that kind of change and----
    Mr. Ambrosi. All that training is just--it just takes a 
huge amount of time to go back the other way.
    Senator Klobuchar. So, what how would the additional grant 
funding help to train new workers and to get that expedited?
    Mr. Ambrosi. Well, the pilot pipeline is in a good place 
right now. There are pilots that--there are more flight 
instructors than there has ever been.
    The colleges and universities are full. But we need to look 
beyond today or tomorrow and look to the future, and then 
encourage that next group of aviators and of more diverse 
background to get into it. So, encouraging those folks to get 
involved will be essential.
    Senator Klobuchar. Yes. Dr. Utash, do you want to add 
anything to that?
    Dr. Utash. Well, I would add that we just started a pilot 
program almost 2 years ago. It has been full. It is very 
popular, but it is very expensive and it is very hard to braid 
the funding together in order to offset the tuition and fee 
cost in addition to the flight cost.
    Senator Klobuchar. One also, as you were pointing out, 
about the bigger airlines and the pipeline, we still have a lot 
of regional and smaller airlines, and the need to make sure 
that that pipeline is strong.
    So, I wrote a book on antitrust, which I know you will all 
go home and read now. 200 pages of footnotes. But one of the 
things, we don't want to just have consolidation and only big 
airlines, so that is part of it. Ms. von Muehlen, you began 
your career as an aviation officer, as we know, in the U.S. 
Army, flying helicopters and leading flight operations.
    This idea of attracting even more veterans who already--I 
know I have met a lot of veterans who are pilots and in 
aviation in different ways, is certainly part of the solution. 
What should we do to attract more veterans to consider jobs in 
aviation?
    Ms. Muehlen. Senator, thank you for the question. 
Obviously, I am passionate about veterans. The skills and 
talent and tenacity veterans bring to all who employ them is 
admirable and really a differentiator.
    So, drawing that talent of folks who have already been 
exposed to aviation into the airlines and aviation more broadly 
is critical. What I will tell you at Alaska is we recruit 
directly at transition events on military basis for both pilots 
and aircraft technicians, as well as others to lead our ramp to 
work in our operations center, because there is already the 
passion that Dr. Lutte was talking about.
    However, the transition for pilots and technicians has to 
be planned. You have to ensure that you have all your ducks in 
a row, if I might say, in order to successfully get the 
equivalent FAA certification.
    So, making that process more streamlined is actually one of 
the ways that government can help.
    Senator Klobuchar. OK, well, I am out of time. I will ask 
you on the record, Mr. Spero, later about the air traffic 
control age and the requirement to retire at 56, and just, you 
know, what we should be doing there with air traffic 
controllers.
    But I know you want to answer, but I should defer to some 
of my colleagues here, and I will put that on the record. I 
just want to raise the issue of air traffic control. Do you 
want to answer in one sentence?
    Mr. Spero. Well, I can't speak to the air traffic 
controllers' maximum retirement--minimum retirement age, but I 
will be able to speak a little more about our aging workforce 
when it comes to the technicians.
    Senator Klobuchar. Excellent. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Senator Baldwin was here at 
gavel--I recognize her. Thanks.

               STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN, 
                  U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN

    Senator Baldwin. Thank you very much. Captain Ambrosi, I 
really want to thank you for coming before the Committee on 
this important topic. I have offered legislation to increase 
the level of education assistance available for students who 
wish to become pilots.
    And I want to thank the Airline Pilots Association for 
support of this measure, the Flight Education Access Act. I 
certainly hope the Committee will include this legislation in 
our FAA bill as we consider how best to support a strong pilot 
workforce.
    But as you well know, the upfront costs associated with 
becoming a pilot are high. And however, those who complete the 
education and training needed are able to access fulfilling and 
well-paid profession.
    So, I would love to have you focus on this legislation in 
terms of how it might lower barriers for those who wish to 
become pilots.
    Mr. Ambrosi. Absolutely, Senator. And thank you for your 
leadership on this issue. I will be honest with you, I probably 
wouldn't be here today if it was this expensive back when I did 
this, started this process over 30 years ago.
    It is expensive and we need other professions, other 
professional professions can access Federal student loans, so 
we need to be able to do that in the aviation community. So, we 
absolutely support that.
    And it will not only allow--it will allow more diverse 
workforce as well, because everybody will have access to that 
funding.
    Senator Baldwin. That is great. And with regard to that 
diversity, Ms. von Muehlen, I understand, did you also serve on 
the Women in Aviation Advisory Board?
    Ms. Muehlen. Yes, Senator.
    Senator Baldwin. Yes. So, the report released last year, 
you know, I pointed out that we have a lot more we need to do.
    And one of the recommendations in the advisory board's 
report was to increase the level of education assistance for 
those who wish to become a pilot but may not have the resources 
needed for a significant up-front costs associated with the 
education and training.
    Do you believe this legislation, the Flight Education 
Access Act, could lower barriers for more women to become 
pilots?
    Ms. Muehlen. Senator, yes. The key barrier to entry for 
women and people in underrepresented groups is cost, so 
therefore easier access to loans, and as Captain Ambrosi 
mentioned, broader access to loans is critical to drawing 
pilots to the workforce, but others to the workforce as well.
    Senator Baldwin. And this may be just an obvious question, 
but we have all talked about the high costs associated with the 
studies. I guess, Dr. Lutte and Dr. Utash, do you want to 
detail some of those costs? What are we talking about? 
Equipment--you know, why is it so expensive? What does that--
what are the elements of that?
    Dr. Lutte. Sure. Happy to. And I am very familiar with the 
costs because as a pilot myself, but also my son just graduated 
from our 4-year flight training program this August, which I 
just paid for.
    So, I am really familiar with the cost. And as I mentioned, 
cost was a factor that we talked about in the board report. It 
is part of our recommendations, so we are excited to see action 
toward that recommendation from the board report. So, the cost, 
you know, on average, one report says that students get about 
$9,000 a year in Federal financial aid, so that maybe probably 
won't cover the cost, standard cost of college, you know, 
books, tuition.
    When you add flight training on to that, you are looking at 
additional cost of anywhere from about $60,000 to $80,000 on 
top of the college degree that you are paying for. So, and that 
comes in the form of, you know, as you mentioned, the 
breakdown.
    Certainly, aircraft costs, instructor costs, and along 
those lines, you know, with aircraft is insurance and 
maintenance and, you know, all the work that goes behind it. So 
it is, as you mentioned, it is a significant additional cost. 
It is a barrier to entry.
    And we absolutely have to expand financial aid for those 
in-flight training if we want to enhance the workforce pool and 
also bring in more women in aviation.
    Senator Baldwin. Right. Dr. Utash, do you have anything you 
want to add to that?
    Dr. Utash. Thank you, Senator. I would just add to that I 
agree with everything Dr. Lutte just said. I would just add to 
that, in a 2-year program, which is what ours is, that costs 
for that pilot program with flight is about in the mid $80,000.
    And again, that is a barrier for entry and it is just hard 
to find braided funding to be able to overcome those costs. The 
other side of it, it is extremely expensive to administrate. 
When we talk about an aviation maintenance program or a pilot 
program, those are high dollar costs to your educational 
institutions that offer those programs from a standpoint of the 
faculty cost, the insurance, the equipment, and all the things 
that go into the infrastructure and buildings to house those 
programs.
    Senator Baldwin. Thank you.
    Senator Duckworth. Senator Sullivan.

                STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA

    Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I want to 
thank the witnesses, in particular. Ms. von Muehlen. You are 
senior executive in ARA Airlines, Alaska Airlines. That is our 
state's airline.
    I know it is headquartered in Seattle, but we consider it 
our airline. So, and you are a veteran Blackhawk pilot, which 
is very impressive. And Alaska, the state has more veterans per 
capita than any state in the country. So, these are things that 
should all work together to help us to address some of the 
challenges.
    So, I want to follow up on Kyrsten, my colleague's question 
on veterans and the more we can be doing. You actually came 
through the pipeline as a pilot yourself, and so is there 
anything more that you want to add to Senator Klobuchar's 
question and the discussion you had on getting veterans?
    And of course, we have another Helo pilot who is Chairing, 
my friend, Senator Duckworth. Blackhawks, too, right?
    Senator Duckworth. Air assault all the way.
    Senator Sullivan. All right. I knew she would do that. This 
is great. I love it. But it is a very--it is a match made in 
heaven, right. Our veterans know how to get up at 4 a.m. Be on 
time. Discipline. So, what more can we be doing in that area?
    Ms. Muehlen. Senator Sullivan, thank you for your support 
of Alaska Airlines. We are an important infrastructure element 
to the state and are proud to be that for the last 90 years 
that we have operated there. It sharpens the skills of our 
pilots and all our team.
    To that end, we hire a lot of veterans because of the, as 
you mentioned, skills they innately bring to the task. Two 
things. One is transitioning from their current work to either 
becoming a pilot or a certificated technician. Getting the FAA 
equivalent is clunky. And then second, I would say loans, GI 
loans are not at the level that they need to be to assist in 
that transition.
    Senator Sullivan. So, let's dig into that, and maybe for 
the record, if you could provide, or other witnesses here, it 
is a great panel, that FAA clunkiness, right. We see that all 
the time. And you know, if you are like a Motor T military 
member and then you got to--when you get out, you got to spend, 
you know, $15,000 bucks to get your CDL and you are like 
driving trucks in Iraq, you are pretty qualified, right?
    But similarly, if there is clunkiness to FAA licensing for 
our veterans, let's work together on this FAA reauth that we 
are literally drafting right now to address that, because these 
are the kind of things that drive people nuts. If you are doing 
all this stuff in the military and then you got to get out and 
they pretend like you are starting from scratch on some of the 
licensing and other things.
    We would want to work with you on that, so can we maybe--
everybody here, if you guys have ideas on how to make that less 
clunky, especially for our pilots and others, I think that 
would be really helpful. You guys think that is a good idea? I 
mean, that is a--we have got a pilot shortage. Yes, OK, so 
let's try and do that.
    By the way, I want to also express support for Senator 
Baldwin's bill that she is working on, my office is working 
with her on. Do you think that--it sounded like from the last 
exchange that the idea of providing an opportunity for 
federally funded education programs to ensure flight and 
aviation components to have education and student loans for 
that is important. Would everybody agree on that? Anyone have 
additional comments? It is a really important issue that I 
think can help with our shortages.
    Ms. Muehlen. Senator Sullivan, I would just support that 
tremendously because there is career awareness, you know, 
issues that we are dealing with, but there are also financial 
issues to get people into the pipeline.
    And one other comment on your FAA is, the part 65 should be 
much more widely publicized from the FAA as a transition for 
those that are on the flight line to an AP mechanic part 147 
license.
    Senator Sullivan. Well, let me ask about that. That is a 
final question I wanted to have. You know, I appreciated, Ms. 
von Muehlen, your testimony, you gave a shout out to one of my 
constituents from Metlakatla, who recently became an aircraft 
technician with the help from Alaska Airlines Maintenance 
Technician Development Program and has now established a new 
carrier as a line aircraft technician in Anchorage.
    Can you tell the Committee a little bit more about how that 
program or other programs that enable people to begin--I was 
actually on Alaska Airlines flight very recently with one of my 
former Marines. We had a recon unit in Anchorage that--great 
Marine who started, you know, on handling bags and now is in 
your, one of your top technicians and he has been on Alaska 
Airlines for 20 years.
    It was great to chat with him just a couple of weeks ago on 
a flight from Juneau to Anchorage. Those kind of programs that 
help people advance, I would love to hear more about those, and 
from any other witness, too.
    Ms. Muehlen. Thank you, Senator, for mentioning. We invest 
$12,300 to support a technician who wants to or someone who 
wants to become a technician who is currently working with and 
for us.
    So, as they continue to work in this case, Kyle was working 
on the ramp, he is getting--he got his AMP certificate. 
Incredible young man who was working while getting his 
education and got support from us in doing so.
    We are looking forward to expanding this program, and also 
to the extent that the Federal Government is there to help in 
expanding that type of program further, really critical because 
the pilot and technician jobs are incredibly well-paying and 
great careers, especially if you have the opportunity to do it 
within the geography that you grow up in, as Kyle did.
    Senator Sullivan. Great. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. And now via remote, Senator 
Markey. Senator Markey--there you go. We couldn't hear you.

               STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

    Senator Markey. Can you hear me now?
    Senator Duckworth. Yes.
    Senator Markey. Oh, beautiful. So, I just wanted to echo 
what you have been saying, Madam Chair, that there are critical 
workforce issues. Diversity is lacking. The numbers are 
incredible. Less than 20 percent of aviation workers are women.
    Less than 10 percent of pilots and maintenance technicians 
are women. And workers of color make up less than 10 percent of 
pilots and flight engineers. And that just doesn't fly. So, 
this is, Ms. Lutte, can you briefly describe what your research 
shows in terms of lack of diversity in aviation in our country?
    Dr. Lutte. Certainly. I think, you know, you just did a 
nice job of summarizing some of the data for me, so thank you 
very much. As you mentioned, you know, there is certainly a 
major gaps within for women in aviation and people of color.
    Less than 20 percent of the workforce overall for women, 
and 5 percent of airline pilots, 3 percent of maintenance 
technicians are women. In addition, you know, you mentioned the 
racial gap in the workforce as well.
    So, I think you summarize it well. I think we also need to 
address, you know, what the primary barriers are in order to 
address those gaps. And what we know is, as has been mentioned, 
one of the primary barriers include things like outreach and 
awareness and education for young people, getting people 
informed of how they can become involved in aviation.
    We have several recommendations, of course, in the board 
report along those lines. You talked specifically about, you 
know, racial imbalance within the aviation industry as well. In 
a survey that was done of the Organization of Black Aerospace 
Professionals, they also showed some of the same similar 
barriers that we found for women in aviation, such as costs, 
certainly negative culture.
    For women, bias and discrimination, sexist comments. And in 
the Black Aerospace Professional Group, racist comments. So, I 
think those areas are key areas that clearly, we need to 
address. But cost, awareness, and culture are three key areas 
that we can address to help improve the representation across 
the board in aviation. And again----
    Senator Markey. So that is how you think that women and 
minorities can be better included by broadening the pipeline, 
by taking the actions that you just mentioned so that we have 
got a strategy to reach out to include them and to help them to 
make it through the process.
    Dr. Lutte. Right. Exactly. The strategies that we lay out, 
the 55 recommendations in the board report that will address a 
lot of those barriers that we just mentioned.
    Another one, by the way, from the survey that we did that 
was interesting was just a lack of awareness. If somebody is 
interested in the aviation as a career, but they really don't 
know or they don't have enough information about the pathway 
forward.
    You know, how do I find out more about the career? How do I 
stay engaged throughout school, or how do we keep young people 
engaged? And so one of the key recommendations we had in the 
report was that one stop shop, virtual resource center, to help 
inform and put the information out there so that people--you 
know, when you get hooked on aviation and you get that passion 
for aviation, you know what the pathway forward is so that we 
can, you know, better help people to find us in the industry 
and get them where they want to be on their journey.
    Senator Markey. And I agree with you, 100 percent. And that 
is why I am working on legislation to create and support 
aviation programs at minority serving institutions and at 
institutions focused on increasing racial and gender 
representation in this area.
    And Ms. Lutte, I am sure you agree that as part of the FAA 
reauthorization, Congress should include legislation for women 
and minorities to have them be increased in our Nation's 
aviation workforce. You agree with that?
    Dr. Lutte. Most certainly. In fact, that is good to hear 
that that is being worked on, because that literally is our 
recommendations in action. We have a recommendation 
specifically about funding for minority serving institutions. 
As an example, we have approximately--not, approximately, we 
have 107 HBCUs in this country, but only 8 have aviation degree 
programs with four-year degrees, so.
    Senator Markey. So, you would support legislation that help 
to enhance that?
    Dr. Lutte. So, we need to enhance that. You know, we need 
to figure out----
    Senator Markey. OK, but that will be the legislation that I 
am introducing. And finally, we can't really talk about 
aviation workforce issues without talking about airport service 
workers. Those individuals, the wheelchair attendants, the 
baggage handlers, the concession workers are overworked, they 
are underpaid.
    And that is why last week I reintroduced the Good Jobs for 
Good Airports Act to ensure that airport service workers get a 
living wage and benefits. I introduced it with Senator Schumer, 
Senator Blumenthal, and others. It is just time for us to 
recognize these hidden figures at airports who showed up 
throughout the entire pandemic, ran higher risk of getting 
COVID, and were not properly compensated for what they did.
    So, we just have to move forward, just make sure that they 
get the funding for their families, and that as we fund 
airports, we make sure it goes down as well into that part of 
our workforce as well. So, thank you, Madam Chair, very much.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. I now recognize Senator Budd.

                  STATEMENT OF HON. TED BUDD, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA

    Senator Budd. Thank you, Madam Chair. Again, thank you all 
for being here. The U.S. has the safest and most complex 
airspace in the world. Keeping it that way requires a lot of 
talented FAA personnel, engineers, pilots, aircraft designers, 
and mechanics. We have an opportunity to address these needs in 
the upcoming FAA Reauthorization Act.
    One initiative I hope that will be included is the National 
Center for Advancement Act, and this bill establishes a center 
to develop the U.S. aviation workforce through collaboration 
with educators, governments, and industry to provide 
scholarships, apprenticeships, and up to date real world 
focused curriculum.
    So, Mr. Ramanathan, you helped write a report that said 
defense and aerospace companies are partnering with community 
colleges and universities to develop deeper talent pipelines. 
You also found that firms are experimenting with knowledge 
transfer programs from older to younger generation of workers.
    How well is the aerospace industry doing in recruiting and 
retaining a workforce that can keep pace with technological 
progress?
    Mr. Ramanathan. Senator Budd, thank you for asking the 
question. This is very critical for the future of the aerospace 
industry in the country, so I can totally understand where you 
are coming from.
    The industry has made advances over the past several years, 
and particularly in the recent past, you know, in terms of 
collaborating better. And these are, you know, trying to go and 
do internships in universities.
    And if you look at the survey, it shows that the extent of 
internships that are sponsored by the companies and aerospace 
companies have started increasing, you know, compared to the 
past.
    You know, is it completely sufficient? Do we have 
everything that is happening to, you know, to fulfill the needs 
of the future aerospace industry? Probably not, but I think it 
is continuing.
    Senator Budd. So good, but more work to go.
    Mr. Ramanathan. More work to be done, yes, particularly 
given the challenges if you look at it in the future. We have 
the conventional aircraft and the associated technology and we 
need people for that.
    You know, both engineers, technicians, because the air 
traffic, commercial aircraft fleet is bound to increase 
significantly over the next 20 years and almost about to 
double. So, we need, you know, engineers, we need technicians, 
and all that.
    At the same time, we have got the newer technologies, newer 
architectures related to unmanned aerial mobility, you know, 
advanced air mobility. And that requirements, the skills 
required for that are quite different from, you know, what, you 
know, the industry is used to. So, I think from that 
standpoint, I think more needs to be done.
    Senator Budd. Thank you very much. Dr. Utash, how can 
technical colleges better partner with industry to attract more 
students to pursue careers in aviation?
    Dr. Utash. Thank you for the question, Senator Budd. I 
would look at the applied learning model that we have really 
tried to implement throughout our institution, and that is for 
students to be able to work in industry while they are 
receiving their education.
    So, it is a side by side, they are earning and they are 
learning at the same time. But that is, you know, that can be 
challenging for industry, and any kind of incentives or any 
kind of encouragement that can be given to industry to do that 
is incredibly important.
    I mentioned in my written testimony a project that we have 
called Get to Werx, W-e-r-x, where we are working with a 
maintenance repair operation right now, they are hiring 
students. They go to work day one and they go to school day 
two, and they have a full-time job with benefits and that 
employer is paying their tuition, and then they make a two-year 
commitment to stay with them once they graduate.
    Those kind of things, the way that we integrate education 
and work together so that students can end up as they graduate 
with a j-o-b and not debt would be great.
    Senator Budd. Very good. You know, aviation just can't work 
without pilots. Regional airlines are feeling the effects of 
pilot shortages. 400 regional aircraft are parked because of a 
lack of pilots, and 226 non-hub and non-primary airports have 
seen flight loss averaging 32 percent. So, Ms. von Muehlen, has 
your airline or its regional partners needed to reduce flights 
because of a lack of pilots?
    Ms. Muehlen. Senator, thank you for the question. We are 
committed to all the communities we serve and continue to 
serve. We understand from our 90 years in the state of Alaska 
that we are a critical part of infrastructure and in fact, 
successful--a successful economy, not only in that state but in 
every state, we serve, so we are committed to continuing to 
serve the communities we serve today.
    Senator Budd. So, in your opinion, how does a pilot 
shortage impact future growth for the aviation industry?
    Ms. Muehlen. The expanding of the talent pool, drawing more 
pilots into the workforce is critical because we are facing, 
like everywhere, an aging workforce. As the workforce retires 
and we grow, there is no doubt that the numbers in the future 
will be more than the numbers in the past. Therefore, 
attracting, training, and retaining pilots is critical.
    Senator Budd. That is very helpful. Thank you. Thank you to 
the panel. I yield back.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. Senator Rosen, remotely.

                STATEMENT OF HON. JACKY ROSEN, 
                    U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA

    Senator Rosen. Thank you, Senator Duckworth. Appreciate 
that. Appreciate everyone being here today to talk about this 
important topic. And I want to talk a little bit about military 
to commercial aviation pipeline, because Nevada plays a major 
role in national security and in the aerospace sector.
    We are home to Nellis Air Force Base and Nevada Test and 
Training Range, Creech Air Force Base, Fallon Naval Air 
Station, and numerous other equities that engage in aviation. 
Nellis is seven miles Northeast of Las Vegas, covers more than 
14,000 acres, and it ranges provides over 15,000 square miles 
of uninterrupted airspace for flying operations.
    An estimated 12,000 military and civilian personnel work at 
Nellis, making it one of the largest employers in Southern 
Nevada. Las Vegas campus of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical 
University, also confers undergraduate and advanced degrees in 
professional aeronautics, space, education systems, 
engineering, and logistics and supply chain management.
    So, Captain Ambrosi, can you talk about the importance of 
the military aviation pipeline in the commercial aviation jobs, 
and the resources needed to train military pilots for open 
civilian aircraft positions?
    And are there existing Federal programs, we should be 
leveraging to strengthen the pilot workforce generally and 
bring up this pipeline specifically?
    Mr. Ambrosi. Well, thank you, Senator, for the question. 
Certainly, we could smooth the transition for military pilots 
coming to civilian aviation. There is a process and pilots are 
able to work through it.
    I would encourage that this legislation would also 
encourage veterans that have served our country to also be 
able--that were not pilots in the military, to be able to get 
funding to seek getting into good aviation jobs, including 
pilots, technicians, what have you. But absolutely, we support 
the initiative and we are happy to help.
    Senator Rosen. That is a fantastic idea. And I want to 
build on that because in the past, excuse me, as was discussed, 
it is just a high educational cost of becoming a pilot and, or 
even some of the supporting jobs and the burden of student 
loans, particularly for those who haven't served in the 
military, is often really a barrier.
    And so, do you consider this a type of barrier? What are 
the other major barriers, Captain Ambrosi, that you feel we 
have to attracting pilots or training new pilots? And in what 
ways do you think we should be addressing it?
    Mr. Ambrosi. It is expensive for a civilian, the civilian 
ranks. We just talked about the military. Many pilots now are 
coming through the civilian ranks with less military pilots, so 
that cost is enormous. It is a burden, as has been discussed by 
the panel this morning.
    Increasing the ability for Federal loans for pilots, not 
only, you know, for everybody to get a more diverse workforce, 
allow people that traditionally wouldn't be able to get into 
the workforce ability to get funding is essential. And again, 
we support your efforts on that front.
    Senator Rosen. Thank you. And speaking of workforce, pilots 
can't fly without the air traffic controllers managing those 
runways, right, and all the other things that they look at in 
the skies. And I know that has been a major issue facing air 
traffic controllers for many years, understaffing, right.
    And so, workforce attrition, there is lengthy training 
periods, there is forced early retirement, coupled with the 
stop and go funding we have had with sequestration, it really 
had a lasting negative effect on our air traffic control 
workforce and really also including on hiring and retaining 
that talent.
    They perform a very highly complex, a high stress job. It 
requires quick decisionmaking. And we can't afford to go 
without these hardworking, well-trained, dedicated individuals. 
As part of the government funding bill last year, and I worked 
with Members of Congress to address this hiring shortage by 
reinstating the retired military controller program. And we are 
very proud of that.
    And so, Mr. Ram, can you tell us how reinstating this 
program is helping to alleviate the staffing shortage of air 
traffic controllers? And what other ways, again, you might 
consider that we would do to fill the pipeline either from the 
military or otherwise to build out our nation--our civilian 
control towers? Mr. Ram.
    Mr. Ramanathan. Thank you, Senator. I didn't realize it was 
addressed to me. My focus is more on the commercial aircraft 
industry and the subsystem manufacturers. But I would like to 
get back to you after conferring with my colleagues, if that is 
OK.
    Senator Rosen. OK, thank you. If anyone has any anything 
they would like to mention about air traffic controllers, I am 
glad to--but I guess now my time is about up. We can take that 
off the record.
    I just think that it's a really important part of our 
workforce that we need to continue to see thrive and grow. 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My times is up. Madam Chair, sorry, 
Senator Duckworth.
    Senator Duckworth. Not a problem. We now recognize Senator 
Peters, also remotely. Oh, no. I am sorry. Senator Vance.

                STATEMENT OF HON. J. D. VANCE, 
                     U.S. SENATOR FROM OHIO

    Senator Vance. All right. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. So, 
I want to start just by, you know, we have heard a lot already 
about workforce shortages. I know that is not a new 
conversation. This is going to be directed to Captain Ambrosi. 
We haven't heard as much, or at least not since I have been 
paying attention, about the role of the vaccine mandates in the 
pilot shortage.
    And look, I am not asking this question to point fingers or 
to attack anybody, but I would like just an honest explanation 
and conversation here about what the vaccine mandates did to 
our pilot workforce?
    And obviously, Captain Ambrosi, you are the right person to 
answer this question, but could you walk me through what effect 
that had, or whether we are still feeling it today?
    Mr. Ambrosi. Well, thank you, Senator. And I know it is 
more about the vaccine. Maybe at the end, if I have time, I 
could address some of the fallacies with the pilot shortage 
thing going on out here. But the facts are, when the vaccine 
happened, every airline handled it differently. We know some 
airlines actually did the mandate.
    Other airlines, I collaborated with my airline at the time 
to make sure that pilots and other employees could have a 
reasonable accommodation. So, we successfully came to an 
agreement where we incentivized the vaccine, but no employees 
got terminated. So, there was zero effect at our carrier for 
that.
    On industry as a whole, most people did either get 
vaccinated--so it was a very small, very small percentage. So, 
I would say that the vaccination process itself and where we 
are today has very little effect at where we are.
    I think the fact that, you know, honestly, the fact that 
many pilots and other workers got out of the business during 
COVID, early retired, whether they were vaccinated or not, 
early retired, the fact that airlines bumped a lot of pilots 
down to lower paying equipment, smaller equipment because they 
didn't know what was going to happen and how fast the recovery 
was going to be.
    And then this massive training backlog we are dealing with 
right now, which is working its way through, but that massive 
training backlog is coming back the other direction, is really 
what is the root of why we are not flying pre-pandemic levels. 
But to be clear, the airlines have more pilots today than they 
had pre-pandemic, but they are not operating as many flights.
    That is because of this massive training backlog, which is 
working through. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. The 
flight schools are full. We have more pilots. We have more 
airline transport pilot certificates issued last year than in 
history.
    More than are required. So, airlines make economic 
decisions as to why they don't serve smaller communities. There 
are a lot of small airplanes parked. Those airplanes aren't 
coming back, even if, you know, there was a surplus.
    Senator Vance. Can I just follow up on the training 
requirement quickly. I want to ask a question to Mr. Spero just 
about what we do with our maintenance staff and outsourcing.
    But so really quickly, just because I have limited time, I 
have heard a lot, and I have in fact had private conversations 
with airline executives who have encouraged us to relax the 
1,500-hour standard in flight.
    And I recognize you don't like that idea, Mr. Ambrosi, and 
that is fine. You know, I don't know. And I, that is part of 
the reason I am asking, but maybe to try to square the circle a 
little bit, one of the arguments I have also heard, not just 
about the number of hours, but is that there is too much rote 
flying and not enough preparation for sort of crisis situations 
in some of the flight training that we do.
    Do you think that is right? So, let's say, for example, you 
didn't want to relax the 1,500-hour rule. Would you be open to 
sort of changing the way that this 15 hours--or 1,500 hours are 
composed, such that there was a little bit more focus on crisis 
response? Do you think that is a fair problem?
    Mr. Ambrosi. So, the 1,500-hour rule is a bit of a 
misnomer. That is the name. But there are other mechanisms. If 
you are out of the military, it is 750 hours. If you are a 4-
year accredited school where you had advanced academics, it is 
1,000 hours.
    If it is a two-year program, it is 1,250 hours. The process 
is already there. There doesn't need to be a change. There is 
an air carrier rulemaking, the Act Arc at the FAA that can 
study any of those proposals.
    So, it is a solution in search of a problem because it 
already is there. The mechanism, if someone has got a great 
idea, can go to the rulemaking committee and say, hey, here is 
an alternative means. But to be clear, the there is a fallacy 
that people are just flying around in circles, buying time to 
build their 1,500 hours. That is not the case. These people are 
teaching other pilots.
    They are out there doing commercial work, getting paid to 
do this. You know, very few pilots have the financial resources 
to just go buy 1,500 hours' worth of flights. And so, these 
people are contributing to the next generation of pilots right 
behind them.
    Senator Vance. Yes. Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Ambrosi. 
And Mr. Spero, given that I am right on time, I am going to 
submit this question to the record, but let me explain why I am 
going to ask this question.
    So, I really worry when you see the trends in offshoring 
and outsourcing a lot of our aircraft maintenance. One, I worry 
about it from the perspective of workers. Obviously, that means 
that there are American workers who are not doing those jobs, 
not earning those wages and so forth.
    But I think with what is going on in the world, we should 
start to think about this maybe as a national security problem. 
If you think about what we are doing, we could very well be 
training in East Asia a generation of commercial aviation 
maintenance people who could be doing military aviation 
maintenance 5 years down the road, 10 years down the road in a 
way that's very, very oppositional to our national security 
interests.
    So, I will also put that question to the record, but that 
is why I am asking it, is I worry about the effect on workers. 
Also worried about the effect on our national security. Thank 
you, and I yield.
    The Chair. Thank you, Senator Vance. And just so you know, 
in part of the aviation safety bill is for the United States to 
be the leads in those safety standards and then go to ICAO and 
get those as the international safety standards.
    That is the best way for us to lead. And that way we would 
know what those standards had to be adhered to around the 
globe. We don't want a lesser standard, and but we need the FAA 
to have the leadership to go do that and to be a very loud 
voice on that. Senator Welch.
    Senator Vance. And Madam Chair, I just have to say, you 
have the best water of all the Committees. I am the new guy, 
but you know, let me say this is good stuff.
    The Chair. OK, good to know. Senator--OK, Senator Peters.

                STATEMENT OF HON. GARY PETERS, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN

    Senator Peters. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. von Muehlen, in 
Northern Michigan and in the Upper Peninsula in particular, 
there are many airports that host only a couple of roundtrip 
flights per day, often relying on the Essential Air Service 
program to keep those flights in circulation.
    I have heard directly and in very loud terms from community 
leaders from in Oden, Marquette, and Sault Ste. Marie about the 
consequences that recent reductions in regional air service 
have had to them economically and throughout rural Michigan. I 
know that Alaska Airlines flies several EAS routes in Alaska.
    And my question for you is, based on that experience, can 
you speak to how critical Essential Air Service program is to 
maintaining the economic strength of rural communities? And 
given the challenges at airports served by the programs have 
faced since the pandemic, are there steps that you think 
Congress should take to strengthen that program?
    Ms. Muehlen. Certainly, Senator Peters. Thank you for the 
question. We understand that Essential Air Service and air 
service in general is critical to the infrastructure of where 
we fly in this case, for us, EAS is in the State of Alaska, but 
also to rural communities in the State of Washington, Montana, 
Idaho, and in your case, Michigan.
    We are committed to the communities that we are flying to 
today because we understand how critical it is to support those 
communities. And in fact, what I would say the solution is, we 
are meeting here today to work across entities to solve the 
workforce problem that we will have in the future as the 
workforce ages and retires. And then we are also going to want 
to grow. So, the solutions we bring forth today will be 
important to implement.
    Senator Peters. Great, thank you. Dr. Lutte, thank you for 
being here, and thank you for your work on the Women in 
Aviation Advisory Board.
    Your fellow board member and Michigander, Kelly Jost, told 
me about the work that your board did to encourage recruitment 
and retention of women in various aviation fields, who 
astonishing, astonishing to me, represent fewer than 5 percent 
of airline pilots and 3 percent of aviation mechanical folks.
    And I don't think we can expect, in my mind, a strong and 
resilient pilot and aviation workforce without working toward 
better representation from women in the workforce. That is why 
I am preparing to introduce Promoting Women in Aviation Act 
next week to codify the Women in Aviation Advisory Board.
    And I would like you to speak to the importance of 
establishing a permanent committee to continue your work to 
improve recruitment and retention of women in the industry, and 
how that will certainly benefit the flying public?
    Dr. Lutte. Certainly. First of all, thank you. We are 
excited to hear when our recommendations are in action, so, and 
we consider that a high priority recommendation out of our 
board report. And the reason for that is, you know, we 
identified in the report this complex system a barrier.
    So, there is no one quick fix. There is no one easy answer 
to increase those data numbers that you just discussed and 
presented. So, in order to make sure that we continue on the 
path to make change and implement those recommendations, we 
find it necessary to call for the permanent advisory committee 
to do so.
    And the focus of that committee will just make sure we get 
it done. Let's stay on target. Let's make sure the 
recommendations get implemented. But to me, I actually see some 
additional benefits to that board beyond just our wish to get 
it done, which obviously we have. But that board will bring 
together people from a wide variety of disciplines within 
aviation, if you will.
    So, we are going to hope to have industry and non-profits 
and labor and just a broad perspective brought together. And 
what that allows us to do is a couple of things. It also allows 
us to keep an eye out for additional future changes and watch 
what is happening in the industry so we can stay ahead and keep 
ahead of the workforce issues.
    But also, the opportunity to share best practices and 
collaborate amongst those groups. As I said earlier, there is 
great work going on. It would--it is beneficial to us to bring 
those groups together in order to share best practices and 
collaborate and make the most of it. So, thank you for that.
    Senator Peters. Well, thank you. Mr. Ramanathan, we have 
several excellent flight schools in Michigan that are doing all 
they can to make sure that we have a strong aviation and pilot 
workforce.
    But one of those programs, Northwestern Michigan College, 
has a backlog of students waiting to matriculate through their 
pilot program, but they are unable to acquire additional 
training aircraft due to a shortage of training aircraft. My 
office has spoken with training aircraft manufacturers to begin 
to understand the supply chain difficulties and its impact on 
the aviation workforce.
    And so, my question for you is, can you expand on some of 
the root causes of these types of manufacturing and supply 
chain challenges, and how that is impacting our ability to 
train pilots because of a shortage of aircraft?
    Mr. Ramanathan. Yes. Thank you, Senator, for asking the 
question. I can speak to the supply chain aspect of it. 
Specifically, regarding the availability of training aircraft 
or not, I do not have information on that.
    Specifically, if you look at aircraft manufacturing and the 
parts available for either to produce or to maintain the 
aircraft, we do have a massive challenge right now. You know, 
the two biggest challenges that the industry deals with is, 
one, supply chain, and the second one is talent.
    Talent actually feeds into the supply chain, and this goes 
all the way to the sub-tiers because a larger company may be 
able to hire employees and, you know, based on what the 
compensation requirements are as well as the brand.
    But if you look at the sub-tier space where they make the 
specific components for aircraft, even a training aircraft, for 
example, I think that is a challenge. You know, they are, you 
know, struggling to attract talent. That could be impacting. 
But specifically, the lack of availability of the aircraft, I 
cannot speak on that.
    Senator Peters. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair.
    The Chairman. Senator Welch.

                STATEMENT OF HON. PETER WELCH, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT

    Senator Welch. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thanks to the 
hearing. And I want to really thank all of the witnesses. We 
seem to have very strong bipartisan recognition that there is a 
lot of work to be done in order to maintain the skies being 
safe and sound. We have got to do everything we can for the 
pilots, for the flight crews, for the airport workers.
    That is the baggage handlers, it is the folks who clean up. 
I mean, it is--when you think about showing up to get on the 
plane and you want as a flier to take it for granted that 
everything is going to work, that doesn't happen by accident. 
It is an incredible amount of effort, so thank you very much.
    And just as an example of how those protocols and training 
go into place, I just want to describe an incident that 
happened in Vermont just this past week. Airline was flying in. 
Somebody left a note in the lavatory saying that there was a 
bomb on the plane, alarming, and there were protocols in place. 
That was made known to the pilot. They are about 20 minutes 
out. And then procedures were followed. The plane landed.
    On the ground, the person was then isolated. And the 
various safety personnel all did exactly what they were 
supposed to do. Good news, no bomb, but also good news, there 
was a clear set of protocols that well-trained people were able 
to follow and provide maximum safety and immediate response.
    And I just want to express as a flier and as one of the 
people who takes for granted that things are going to work, and 
then when things don't work, there is going to be protocols to 
address it and make it right, thank you. So, thank you very 
much.
    I do want to ask Mr. Spero, just to give you an 
opportunity, what steps can we take in Congress to meet the 
needs of aviation safety specialist and other airline 
employees, including that--ensuring that airports are 
adequately staffed and workers have the support they need?
    Mr. Spero. Senator, thank you for the question. With regard 
to the aviation safety specialists that work in the field, what 
would help very much is if the FAA would begin to use a valid 
technical operations staffing model.
    Currently, right now, the data that is being used is 
flawed. The work that our folks do needs to be set forth in a 
workforce plan setting us up for this decade and beyond, quite 
frankly. The opportunity to give our folks in the field and 
give the aviation community the ability to move forward with 
the national airspace system that can move into next decade is 
critical. So, Congress can help----
    Senator Welch. It is practical standards that are modern 
and updated.
    Mr. Spero. Yes, sir.
    Senator Welch. It makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Captain 
Ambrosi, what can we do here in Congress in the upcoming FAA 
reauthorization bill to support pilots and establish 
initiatives that recruit, train, and retain pilots and other 
aviation workers?
    I mean, we are having a shortage in labor there as we are 
in so many sectors in the economy. And I know one person said 
on the job training or while you are going to school getting 
some training. Makes sense to me. But give you an opportunity 
to respond to that.
    Mr. Ambrosi. Well--would be a hard one to do on the job 
training while you are going to school, so we will probably 
push back on that one a little bit. But anyway, thank you for 
the question.
    There are--flights schools are full, the pipeline is there, 
but we--I encourage and support the Committee's actions on 
funding for flight training. It is very expensive. It allows 
underrepresented groups, females, minorities to get into this 
business, because as I said earlier, at the cost today, I 
wouldn't be sitting here. It is far more expensive and 
inflation has killed flight training.
    So, there are reasons for that, but we need to make it more 
accessible to folks through to funding.
    Senator Welch. OK. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I 
yield back.
    The Chair. Thank you. And we miss Senator Leahy tomorrow, 
so we appreciate you wearing the green. Thank you very much, 
Senator Welch. Senator Sinema.

               STATEMENT OF HON. KYRSTEN SINEMA, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA

    Senator Sinema. Oh, thank you, Chair. And thank you to the 
witnesses for joining us today. When thinking about the 
aviation industry, safety must always remain our most important 
priority and the ultimate focus of our efforts.
    Rewarding aviation careers are essential to ensure 
continued American leadership on aviation safety. That is why I 
chaired an aviation subcommittee field hearing in Goodyear, 
Arizona, last May to explore how to develop the pipeline for 
21st century aviation careers.
    The issues we explored nearly a year ago in sunny Arizona 
are key questions for Congress as the aviation economy rapidly 
expands and modernizes. Now, the statistics are staggering and 
worth repeating.
    94 percent of pilots are male and 93 percent are white. But 
that is not the whole story. Less than 3 percent of aviation 
mechanics are women, and there has been less than a 1 percent 
change in the rate of women serving in these roles over recent 
decades.
    In fact, it is estimated that less than 20 percent of all 
aviation related jobs are held by women. Now, I was excited 
that the Aviate Academy in Goodyear, Arizona, has the goal to 
have more than half of their class be women or people of color. 
Congress has taken steps to address this challenge, including 
establishing the Women in Aviation Advisory Board in the 
Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization in 2018.
    But clearly, more must be done. So, I have two questions 
for Dr. Lutte. First, where do you see Congress having the 
greatest ability to help reach women and other traditionally 
underrepresented communities in the aviation space?
    And second, are there particular Federal legislative 
programs, whether in aviation or otherwise, that Congress has 
passed that could serve as models or be expanded to help these 
populations enter the aviation workforce?
    Dr. Lutte. Yes. Thank you for that. I will say to your 
first question, what can be done? Certainly, again, I think, as 
you mentioned, that more work has to be done in this area. So, 
establishing that permanent advisory committee will allow us to 
continue that work, or allow the Committee, I should say, to 
continue that work and focus on getting those recommendations 
implemented to address the gaps in representation in aviation.
    In terms of examples for Congress and what they can do, you 
know, certainly funding, we are going to say it again because 
it is such a key issue, but cost of training is absolutely a 
barrier. And so, work that can be done to enhance access to 
financial aid and assistance for flight training costs is 
certainly going to help make a dent and assist us. So cost is a 
big part of the issue.
    Other examples are workforce development grants. I think, 
again, continuing extending expanding those grants so that we 
can continue to do the outreach and other good work that needs 
to be done.
    And all of those areas are recommendations within the 
advisory board report, so we would encourage Congress to enact 
those recommendations.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you. As many of you have pointed out 
in your testimony, it is no secret that individuals face 
considerable challenges due to the high costs of aviation 
education and training.
    The host of our hearing last year on the aviation 
workforce, United Aviate Academy in Goodyear is the first 
flight school wholly owned by a major airline. We were able to 
learn about some of their innovative techniques, like public 
and private partnerships, that they are using to financially 
support aviation training, particularly for those with the most 
need.
    I know that other carriers like Alaska and American are 
also working to lessen pilot and other training costs through 
initiatives and partnerships. So, Ms. von Muehlen, has Alaska 
been successful in cutting the cost of pilot training, and what 
have you found to be the most effective strategy to address 
these costs?
    Ms. Muehlen. Thank you for the question, Senator. Alaska 
has invested in the Ascend Pilot Academy to provide financial 
assistance, mentorship, and in fact, a career path to becoming 
a pilot.
    We have also invested in the True North Pilot Development 
Program, which in fact our pilots came up with to suggest and 
start a pilot development program for students in HBCU 
colleges. One is Delaware State and the other is the University 
of Maryland Eastern Shore, where we provide, again, financial 
support and mentorship to folks to become pilots.
    Those outreach programs, those financial support programs 
to traditionally less represented communities are critical to 
reach the numbers and workforce growth that we will need 
looking forward as our workforce ages and we expect to continue 
to grow.
    Senator Sinema. Well, thank you. You know, there is a range 
of opinion about how suppling the aviation labor market more 
broadly. Some have argued there is a shortage, while others 
disagree strongly with that.
    I want to take a broader perspective. Public and private 
studies all raise key questions around attrition, the impact of 
technology, and the availability of qualified labor.
    So, Captain Ambrosi, and then Ms. von Muehlen, what are 
your perspectives on the long-term outlook for pilot demand and 
whether we are prepared to meet it?
    Mr. Ambrosi. Well, thank you, Senator, for the question. We 
are meeting the demand right now. There is a lot of talk around 
a pilot shortage. Airlines make decisions to support, or to fly 
to markets based on economics.
    A lot of you will see some of the major airlines in our 
country have said that they are going to do away with the 50-
seat RJ. So, there are numbers about how many RJ are parked or 
small airplanes are parked out there, and it is because of a 
pilot shortage. Well, those airplanes aren't coming back.
    They will make a decision to serve a market based on its 
profitability as they are for profit businesses. I also 
completely support working with Congress on improving Essential 
Air Service funding to make sure that these markets do it.
    The point is that special interests would like to make an 
argument that we should roll back pilot training and safety 
requirements in order to make our costs cheaper in order to 
serve those smaller markets.
    I will tell you that passengers in those markets deserve 
the same level of safety, regardless of how big their city is, 
as anybody that flies out of a major city. So, we absolutely 
are opposed to rolling back. Pilots are in the pipeline. We are 
in a training backlog, but we are getting caught up.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you.
    Ms. Muehlen. Thank you, Senator, for the question. At 
Alaska Airlines, we are back to our 2019 levels of flying 
currently. The problem is a long-term problem because the lead 
time to becoming a captain at a regional carrier and then a 
captain at a mainline carrier is so long, in years.
    Two and a half years to become a captain at a regional 
carrier, once you are hired there as a first officer. And then 
a similar, if not longer, time-frame for mainline carrier. Just 
to be clear, the pinch point is at regional carriers.
    And so being ahead of this workforce problem and working 
ahead because of the long lead time is actually absolutely 
critical, and I am glad we are discussing it today.
    Senator Sinema. Thank you, Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Senator Cantwell.
    The Chair. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. This is such 
an important issue. Wasn't what I was going to ask questions 
about, but I do want to bring up the point. I mean, this 
committee just passed a major infrastructure investment bill 
and a CHIPS and Science Act, and it is about allowing 
innovation to happen in more places than just San Francisco and 
Seattle.
    It is about the unleashing of the innovation economy across 
the United States. Well, I guarantee you, you have to have 
airports. Some number, I don't know, whatever. It is a high 
number. It is like 80 percent of all economic development 
happens within ten miles of an airport.
    So, we are going to figure out how to get this, and I don't 
know that it's going to be all Essential Air Service. I don't 
know. But Wenatchee deserves to have air cover and so does 
other places throughout the United States that represent these 
markets.
    They represent--Wenatchee is our apple economy, and they 
have to have coverage and so do other places. I know--I don't 
know if my colleague, Senator Thune, has been here, but he has 
been big on this. And so, we can't let what I would call key 
economic engines at smaller airports across the United States 
be strangled because of the pilots. We got to figure out a 
solution.
    OK, Captain Ambrosi, I do want to ask about yesterday and 
what happened at the safety summit that was held, and the NTSB 
investigating six close calls at runways around the country and 
investigating two wrong way landings last year, and two 
separate severe turbulence incidents in the same day in Hawaii 
last December.
    So, we heard from the NTSB Chairwoman Homendy, about what 
she is referring to. One of the things the Committee also did 
in the safety bill was to say, we want trend reports. We want 
to know. We, here want to understand the trends so that we can 
do our oversight job. So what NTSB is saying is, there are open 
FAA issues that, or recommendations about what should be 
implemented because of these patterns, these troubling patterns 
and near-misses.
    For example, NTSB has called for an expanded use of 
technology, air service detection systems, which is Model X, or 
airport surface surveillance capability, ASSC, which helps the 
air traffic controllers track the movement of aircraft and 
vehicles that would interfere with runway operations.
    It also alerts controllers when a plane is landing, is 
lining up on to land on a taxiway instead of a runway. They get 
an alert. This technology is currently used at 44 airports 
across the country, including at JFK, where the ASDEX helped 
avoid a collision on January 13. So, we have this technology at 
SeaTac.
    And since its implementation since 2018, it has prevented 
pilots from mistakenly landing in the wrong direction, this is 
according to data, 50 different occasions. So, I want to ask 
you, Captain Ambrosi, do you believe that implementing the NTSB 
recommendations for runway safety technology could enhance 
safety at airports, yes or no?
    Mr. Ambrosi. Yes, there is no doubt. It is related to 
funding, so.
    The Chair. OK. Should we establish a requirement for 
airplanes landing at primary airports to be equipped with 
systems that alert pilots when an airplane is not aligned on 
the runway, yes or no?
    Mr. Ambrosi. There are so many advancements in technology. 
Technology--pilots embrace technology. So, anything that helps 
make our job safer, we absolutely support.
    The Chair. Mandated technology for cockpit systems that 
provides and alerts pilots when an airplane is not aligned with 
the intended runway surface for landing at primary airports. 
Yes, OK, thank you.
    So, I think this is where we are. Requiring all airports 
which schedule passenger service a ground improvement safety 
system that will prevent runway incursions and provide direct 
warning capabilities to flight crew.
    Mr. Ambrosi. Yes. Again, it is related to funding. We 
support broad based funding to the FAA. It is not just these 
specific items. They need--they have a long-term plan. They 
need funding for national airspace improvements. We have all 
these new operators coming in with UAS. It is a broader topic 
than just ground surveillance, but that is a start, absolutely.
    The Chair. Well, I think what we are seeing here and 
feeling across these many stories is that we have to have the 
highest safety standards and we have to have the investment in 
modern equipment that is going to give us those safety 
standards.
    Mr. Ambrosi. Absolutely.
    The Chair. So that is what we are going to be pushing for 
here. I also wanted to ask, you know, specifically, you know, 
on the workforce side. My colleague here who is chairing our 
hearing this morning, has the Troop Talent Act.
    I wanted to ask Ms. von Muehlen about what you guys, what 
Alaska has been doing to try to get that workforce. But what I 
feel like we need to do is--we are almost there. We are not 
quite there. There is still something missing between DOD and 
commercial carriers on how to take this workforce and get them 
delivered.
    Ms. Muehlen. Senator, absolutely. Streamlining the pipeline 
is essential with regards to certification, for example, but 
also expanding the GI Bill to support more careers in aviation, 
and specifically pilots. The funding, increasing the funding in 
that area would be beneficial to facilitate that transition.
    The Chair. Yes. I am going to let Senator Duckworth talk a 
little bit more about her experience for the record. I really 
want it on the record. But she is saying, as a military person, 
she got the training that was consistent with what would give 
her the education on the outside while she was in the military.
    So now, as I believe we--these people come out, they don't 
have that relevant--it doesn't translate. And then we are doing 
an FAA one off certificate for every single person to see if 
they qualify or not qualify. We need a more standardized 
system. But one of the reasons why I support Phil Washington is 
because I feel like he is not going to go along with a group 
think of everything is OK.
    He is someone coming from the outside. But on this issue of 
workforce, which is the issue here and is the issue writ large 
in the FAA, I feel like at his hearing he talked about this was 
one of his main objectives, which I was glad to hear.
    I feel like this is our best shot right now at a workforce, 
is to get the DOD people that are practically trained to get 
the training, whatever it is, so that they can move into the 
commercial space. Is this our best opportunity?
    Ms. Muehlen. I think absolutely. The--what I was referring 
to is people who are not yet pilots in the military benefiting 
from GI loans to become a pilot outside of the military. But, 
yes, Senator.
    The Chair. Yes. OK, great. And Captain Ambrosi, do you 
support Mr. Washington?
    Mr. Ambrosi. Thank you for the question. The FAA needs long 
term, stable leadership. I have had a conversation with Mr. 
Washington. I would like to say I appreciate his commitment to 
safety, his commitment to standards, and his commitment to 
keeping pilots in the flight deck. I believe that Mr. 
Washington can be an effective FAA Administrator.
    The Chair. Great, thank you. Well, thank you very much for 
the hearing, Madam Chair. I think we have a lot of work to do.
    The witnesses have given us a lot of thought. Well, this is 
a problem we can solve. But as you said, we can't lower the 
standards. And in many cases, I think we have seen here that we 
need to raise the standards, but we have to figure out how to 
build this pipeline more successfully and give American cities 
really access to good aviation access so that they can 
continue--it can't be held hostage to an airline that just 
wants to pay dividends.
    We have to get the system right and get air transportation 
right, and that will help America overall. Thank you, Madam 
Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you, Chairwoman Cantwell. Before I 
recognize Senator Hickenlooper, I wanted to make the statement 
that she has asked me to make describing how I received my FAA 
airmen certificates.
    Basically, when I was going through flight school, an FAA 
Regional Office Administrator came in and talked to the class 
and said, if any of you want to get your FAA commercial 
instrument rotorcraft license, take the weekend, come to this 
course, intensive 12 hours, 2 days, at the end of which we took 
the written test for the commercial pilot test.
    When we did that, upon graduation from flight school at 
Fort Rucker, Alabama, I received my FAA license as a commercial 
instrument rotorcraft pilot. I was one of maybe four who took 
the time to go do that, and the rest of my class did not.
    So what we have here is a problem, and this is what I was 
trying to do with my Troop Talent Act is that the DOD 
schoolhouse did not set aside the time, didn't want to set 
aside the time of an additional two or 3 days to allow the FAA 
to come in, teach the classes, because what you needed to be 
able to pass a commercial test was not what we were getting as 
Blackhawk pilots in the Army.
    So, you needed to still be able to meet the FAA licensure 
requirements. But the DOD did not provide that space for that 
testing to happen, so it is on the individual to take your time 
off to go do that and pay additional--the testing fees. What 
was good was that the FAA regional office had this agreement at 
Fort Rucker, Alabama, this one place, to provide that.
    And so, when I graduated, from the time that I graduated, 
every flight hour I flew as a military pilot counted toward my 
FAA totals. Now, my colleagues who did not do that then had to 
use a GI Bill or whatever it is to go and take all of their, 
you know, flight training and take all of their check rides and 
all of that to get their commercial pilot license, and then 
they started logging time as commercial pilots when they had 
all this time flying a complex aircraft, you know, dual engine, 
complex aircraft.
    And so, this is the type of thing we need to work out. We 
have solved this for the CDL. Senator Sullivan mentioned this 
earlier. Because we now work with the individual Secretaries of 
State in each of the states to provide a CDL to someone who 
graduates from the military truck driving school, so that when 
they graduate from truck driving school and they get the 
military driver's license for tractor trailer driver, they also 
get a CDL.
    So that no longer do you have people who are driving 
military tractor trailers for 200,000 miles in combat being 
told, sorry, you have no over-the-road experience as far as the 
Secretary of State is concerned.
    You have got to waste your GI Bill money, go do that, and 
now you are still shown as having no experience when you 
actually drove 200,000 miles under enemy fire. So, we got to 
figure this out. And same with mechanics. Just because you 
graduated from crew chief school doesn't mean you are a 
qualified AMP mechanic because there are additional 
requirements, and we should make that space within the DOD.
    So, let's work on the pipeline. I will work with my 
colleagues. We might come to you to see what we can do to try 
to get that. And it may be individual schools, civilian 
commercial schools that would be willing to work with the 
various flight schools that exist within the military to 
provide that certification and that testing. With that, I am 
going to recognize Senator Hickenlooper.

             STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN HICKENLOOPER, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO

    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you, Madam Chair. And 
thank all of you for your commitment and your public service. 
All the work that you do to keep our aviation system safe and 
efficient. I just want to follow up a little bit on what 
Chairman Cantwell had mentioned with Captain Ambrosi in terms 
of Phil Washington's nomination to run the FAA.
    And there has been a lot of discussion, and I have known 
Phil Washington for almost 20 years, so I am a big fan. I think 
his integrity, you know, his drive to get things done is 
unmatched.
    But there has been a lot of discussion that we had to have 
a, or someone--we had to have a pilot in that position. And 
that is, you don't view that as a requirement?
    Mr. Ambrosi. Thank you for the question, Senator. There 
have been past FAA Administrators that have not been pilots 
that have been successful. It is essential that you have 
experience running a large organization and you can do so.
    It is important that if you are not a pilot, you reach out 
to the stakeholders and include them. And Mr. Washington has 
given us that commitment that he will absolutely do that.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. I appreciate that. And I know 
from experience, having watched him do that very thing, that he 
will reach out and make sure that everyone is involved in the 
conversation, and there is a real collaborative approach to 
solving some of the challenges you all face.
    Dr. Lutte, you know, in Colorado, like so many parts of 
this country, regional air service is essential. Rural 
communities can't thrive without a connection to the rest of 
the world. Colorado and many Western states rely on regional 
flights to cover large, relatively long distances to hub 
airports like Denver so that people can get to the hub and then 
get to their ultimate destination.
    In terms of the workforce, and there has been a lot of 
discussion on this committee around the lack of a robust and 
diverse aviation workforce. In terms of the reliability of 
flights serving rural communities, do you think that there is, 
that that diversity has a real benefit to the reliability of 
flights?
    Dr. Lutte. Well, thank you. I think the foundation of 
aviation is having that strong, highly trained professional 
workforce to deliver services throughout the country to all 
kinds of markets, large and small. And as a part of that, you 
know, women have contributed to that workforce and can 
contribute--continue to do so. And I think through the 
recommendations in the report, we will be able to attract and 
retain more women to continue to provide--assist in providing 
those services.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Great. Thank you. And Ms. von 
Muehlen, the large regional commercial airlines and the major 
airlines, I mean we have heard throughout this hearing and in 
previous hearings that the workforce needs and how significant 
they are for pilots in aviation mechanics.
    You know, as airlines begin to launch their own dedicated 
training academies to grow the aviation pipeline, the question 
is, how can we, you know, in addition to the Federal efforts 
were already making you have already discussed, how can we do 
more to help commercial airlines, let's say, in terms of 
scholarships or apprenticeships, to lower barriers to entry and 
make sure that we are expanding not just the aviation 
workforce, but getting more diversity in that workforce as we 
expand?
    Ms. Muehlen. Senator, thank you for the question. It is in 
fact, critical that we expand our pipeline in order to meet the 
requirements of the future.
    So, we are particularly proud at Alaska that we have 
started a program like the True North Pilot Development 
Program, where we partner with students and help develop 
students at the University of Delaware--sorry, the Delaware 
State University and University of Maryland Eastern Shore.
    We provide a stipend and development funds for individuals 
at historically black colleges and universities to become 
pilots. We mentor them along the way. Our own pilot team came 
up with this idea and are directly involved in mentoring these 
students, providing them internships.
    So, for sure, the loans, and too, there is a barrier to 
entry. And I would say beyond that, the grants for workforce 
development, because reaching back into the middle and high 
school years is the place that you spark the passion for 
aviation and provide the breadcrumbs to that career.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I couldn't agree more. And I am down 
to 8 seconds, so I have got a couple more questions I will put 
forward in writing and you can answer them at your leisure. 
Thank you all again for being here and for all your work to 
make our aviation system the global model that it is. Yield 
back to the Chair.
    Senator Duckworth. Thank you. We now recognize Senator 
Warnock.

              STATEMENT OF HON. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA

    Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Senator Duckworth. 
As my colleagues on the Committee have heard me say before, I 
believe Georgia is this country's most important aviation 
state.
    Georgia is home, after all, to Delta Airlines and the 
world's busiest airport in Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson 
International Airport. According to the Georgia Department of 
Economic Development, the aerospace products are both the 
state's top export, and its second largest manufacturing 
industry, one that is responsible for an annual economic impact 
of over $57 billion.
    Most importantly, Georgia's aviation industry employs more 
than 108,000 people, spread across more than 800 different 
companies. But as we have heard today, there is a severe, a 
severe workforce shortage affecting our aviation industry, 
something that should concern all of us.
    Dr. Lutte, what can Congress do to encourage the growth, 
the expansion, and development of the aviation workforce? And 
do educational institutions of all levels have a role to play 
here?
    Dr. Lutte. Most certainly educational institutions play a 
critical role. So, as we have heard, one of the key areas is 
making sure that everybody knows we are here and that aviation 
is a great field to consider.
    And not just pilots, but across the board, introducing 
young people to the many different careers in aviation. We can 
absolutely do that through the K-through-12 system by 
introducing curriculum at a very early age in grade school. 
Make sure we keep students engaged with curriculum being 
introduced throughout.
    And then in the high school level, there are great high 
school programs that already exist, but also taking the 
opportunity to partner with colleges, universities, and 
technical programs for dual credit and other opportunities.
    So, I think that segment plays a critical role in creating 
awareness of aviation careers to build the workforce of the 
future.
    Senator Warnock. I agree. And we have got to foster a well-
trained aviation workforce, which means we have got to invest 
in aviation education. And that starts, you know, in grade 
school and beyond, which is why I fought to secure funding for 
middle Georgia State University's School of Aviation in last 
year's appropriations package, which they are using now to 
purchase a flight simulator to train more pilots at Georgia's 
only, Georgia's only public flight school.
    That is also why I am proud to be working on aviation 
workforce legislation to help more schools, including State and 
technical colleges, train students from rural communities, 
nontraditional communities to work in the aviation industry at 
a lower cost. We have to broaden the pool.
    I believe that the current workforce shortage presents a 
once in a generation opportunity to revitalize our aviation 
workforce and industry from the ground up. We ought to see this 
not only as a challenge, but an opportunity.
    The entire education system has an important role to play 
in not just addressing the shortage, but also growing and 
supporting a modern and representative aviation workforce. We 
need all of our people to get to where we need to go.
    So, the aviation workforce continues to lag behind other 
industries, there is no question about that, when it comes to 
recruiting workers from underrepresented backgrounds, which I 
propose contributes to the current workforce shortage.
    The vast majority of aircraft pilots still, the flight 
engineers, mechanics, technicians all come from similar 
backgrounds. Conversely, a much smaller percentage of the 
aviation workforce come from low income or rural communities, 
identify as women, or as people of color.
    Mr. Spero and Dr. Utash, would strengthening and expanding 
the pool of potential aviation workers help address the current 
workforce shortage, yes, or no?
    Mr. Spero. Senator, thank you for the question. Yes. I 
would add with regard to the FAA, it would be important to have 
those jobs available, which means that they need to staff that 
workforce and have the proper staffing models to identify what 
employees they need and how many.
    Senator Warnock. Dr. Utash.
    Dr. Utash. Absolutely, yes. The more females, the more 
underrepresented populations, people of color that we can get 
into this workforce will help solve----
    Senator Warnock. So those are not competing objectives. One 
actually facilitates the other, right?
    Dr. Utash. That is correct.
    Senator Warnock. If so, what types of schools and training 
programs do you think are most likely to produce an aviation 
workforce that reflects our country?
    Dr. Utash. So, I would just point to something that we have 
just recently done that I think makes a big difference. We have 
created a future ready center for juniors and seniors in high 
school from our largest school district in Wichita and largest 
school district in Kansas, actually.
    And those students are being able to begin their careers as 
juniors and seniors, and many of them are graduating with their 
high school diploma and their college, their WSU Tech 
certification and/or associate applied degree at the same exact 
time.
    So, coming in May, they will be graduates of both, and they 
are ready to be workforce ready at that point in time, 
particularly in manufacturing and aviation maintenance. Those 
kind of programs are the kind of programs that are really going 
to, you know, advance the workforce.
    We are very fortunate in the State of Kansas that we have 
what we call a program in Excel in CTE, where our State is 
picking up the tuition for those high school students. So, they 
come out with all of their preparation to go to work with no 
student loan debt. That is a great program.
    And then you look at driving that in our Wichita school 
system is full of underrepresented and very ethnic diverse 
population.
    So that particular program is meeting both an immediate 
workforce effort, reducing student loan, and also hitting on 
females and underrepresented populations.
    Senator Warnock. Very good. Mr. Spero, do you want----
    Mr. Spero. I have nothing to add with that. Well said.
    Senator Warnock. Great. So, the aviation workforce 
development legislation that I am working on right now will 
grow and strengthen the entire industry by educating and 
recruiting a vibrant and diverse workforce, with emphasis on 
training tomorrow's aviation workers who are currently 
underrepresented in the industry.
    All of us have a stake in this. I look forward to working 
with the Committee to ensure this year's FAA reauthorization 
includes critical workforce development provisions that further 
develop and sustain the industry.
    Thank you all so very much for your testimony, and thanks 
to all of our witnesses for your participation today. The 
hearing record will remain open for 4 weeks until April 13, 
2023. Any Senators that would like to submit questions for the 
record should do so two weeks from now, by March 30, 2023.
    And we ask that all witnesses complete their responses and 
return them to the Committee by April 13, 2023. That concludes 
today's hearing.
    [Whereupon, at 12:29 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                            A P P E N D I X

                                                     April 12, 2023
Hon. Maria Cantwell,
Chair, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
United States Senate,
Washington, DC.

Hon. Ted Cruz,
Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
United States Senate,
Washington, DC.

Dear Chair Cantwell and Ranking Member Cruz,

    We, the undersigned organizations, write in strong opposition to 
the inclusion of policies that would fundamentally undermine the 
existing Open Skies aviation agreement framework within the 2023 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill.
    For more than 30 years, Open Skies agreements have been a 
bipartisan policy success, advanced by both Democratic and Republican 
administrations. These bilateral trade agreements allow U.S. passenger 
and cargo airlines to fly around the world without the government 
interference in airline decision-making about routes, capacity and 
pricing, which was very prevalent before the U.S. decided to export its 
domestic aviation deregulation policies to the international 
marketplace.
    The U.S. has reached Open Skies agreements with more than 130 
countries, creating significant benefits for consumers, the aviation 
workforce, as well as the economy at large. Recent estimates \1\ 
demonstrate that these accords have generated at least $4 billion in 
annual gains to travelers, along with a 15 percent average drop in 
fares. Additionally, a 2018 D.C. Circuit Court opinion \2\ found that 
these agreements ``promote competition'' and that ``a service 
authorized by a bilateral agreement is in the public interest.''

    Placing burdensome conditions and requirements on new foreign air 
carrier permits would violate existing Open Skies agreements and invite 
retaliation from U.S. aviation partners worldwide. During a March 16, 
2023, hearing \3\ in the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation, Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) 
President Capt. Jason Ambrosi testified \4\ in support of including so-
called ``flags of convenience'' legislation within the 2023 FAA 
Reauthorization bill. He wrongly claimed the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT) has ignored the statutory public interest 
requirements of 49 U.S. Code Sec. 40101 in past foreign air carrier 
permit decisions. In fact, DOT is already statutorily required to make 
a public interest finding in awarding routes to air carriers.

    Erroneously dubbed as the ``Fair and Open Skies Act,'' \5\ this 
legislation and others like it would put the U.S. in violation of an 
international trade agreement that could lead to legal action by 
foreign government partners. While ALPA has tried to downplay the 
threat of retaliation in the past, recent responses from the EU clearly 
demonstrate their intention to uphold terms of the U.S.-EU Air 
Transport Agreement (ATA). On July 23, 2019, the then Director-General 
of the European Commission (EC)'s Department for Mobility and 
Transport, stated in a speech \6\ to the International Aviation Club of 
Washington, D.C., ``I sincerely hope that all parties honour and value 
our [Air Transport] Agreement and if need be, we will use all legal 
means to defend ATA.'' The EU has also previously filed for arbitration 
\7\ against the U.S. for breaching this pact during Norwegian Air 
International's application process, saying that DOT's slow-walk to a 
decision ``constitutes a breach of the EU-U.S. Air Transport 
Agreement.''

    Additionally, in the authoritative Memorandum of Consultations \8\ 
signed in 2010 at the conclusion of the U.S.-EU negotiations, the 
delegations stated explicitly that ``in the event that a Party would 
take measures contrary to the Agreement . . . the other Party may avail 
itself of any appropriate and proportional measures in accordance with 
international law, including the Agreement.'' The EC has also 
emphasized that, if such a bill were to be signed into law, the U.S. 
would be in clear violation of the U.S.-EU Open Skies Agreement. As 
such, ALPA's assertions that the EU does not have the ability or will 
to unilaterally act against U.S. air carriers is demonstrably false.

    We are grateful for this Committee's leadership and dismissal for 
more than a decade of ALPA's dubious and misleading claims surrounding 
shortfalls in the Open Skies framework. A so-called ``flags of 
convenience'' bill would only serve to place the U.S. in violation of 
the U.S.-EU Open Skies Agreement and invite retaliation on the U.S. 
commercial and cargo aviation industries by our international 
partners--with consumers and U.S. businesses shouldering the greatest 
consequences. Therefore, we ask for your continued leadership in 
upholding the Open Skies framework in the 2023 FAA reauthorization 
bill.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                         Constance von Muehlen
    Safety Culture at Alaska Airlines. There have been reports of 
recent aviation near misses, some of which appear to be pilot or 
controller error. Aviation appears to be at a critical waypoint. The 
confluence of workforce attrition during the pandemic, a faster-than-
expected recovery in passenger demand, and the lag in getting pilots 
trained to conduct flights have all increased risks in the aviation 
safety system.

    Question 1. At the FAA Safety Summit, we heard about a 
``juniority'' problem at the airlines--in other words, a lack of highly 
experienced personnel. Has this become a problem at Alaska and Horizon? 
If so, how does it impact your training approach and operations?
    Answer. We have been fortunate to retain seasoned and highly 
trained personnel while also expanding our workforce with new talent. 
Owning safety is our number one value at Alaska Airlines and, as we 
start 2023, we continue to carry that forward. Safety is baked into 
every decision and action we make and so we are focused on elevating 
safety and making it personal for every employee as one of our 
strategic priorities this year. Importantly this is not just a priority 
for new hires but for long-term employees as well--safety is something 
we cannot take for granted and so we need to constantly retrain and 
stay vigilant. This means consistent and engaging messaging from our 
safety team to all employees, reviewing and updating training 
protocols, expanding peer to peer support, and implementing operation 
programs focused on safety and identifying any new risks, etc.
    For example, this year we will be implementing what we're calling a 
``Safety Day'' each quarter for all employees. We will nearly stop the 
operation for a short period of time at each station and review with 
our teams how we can improve safety, reduce risk, and reconnect to our 
commitment to this value.
    Finally, we are also focused on celebrating when our folks get it 
right and praising employees who help us stay vigilant and constantly 
improve safety.

    Question 2. Can you describe the importance of voluntary safety and 
confidential reporting at the airlines and with the FAA for improving 
safety and identifying trend lines? Can these programs be improved?
    Answer. Alaska Airlines takes tremendous pride in maintaining a 
safety culture where all employees feel empowered to immediately make 
known a safety problem or concern, and to halt operations immediately 
until that concern is resolved.
    Alaska Airlines also understands that in order to achieve optimal 
safety outcomes, there must be avenues by which voluntary and 
confidential reporting of safety concerns can be made. We value the 
FAA's Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program and its contribution to 
aviation safety. We constantly strive to make sure our employees are 
aware of all opportunities to raise a safety concern, and we will 
continue to work both internally and with our regulators to perfect our 
pursuit of safety.
    Additionally, Alaska Airlines believes in celebrating when 
employees do the right thing and contribute to our overall safety 
culture through innovation, exceptional performance and going beyond 
normal job expectations, including in safety reporting. At Alaska 
Airlines we have a Safe Operations Award and Recognition (SOAR) program 
to help us highlight our employees who help us improve our safety 
culture.

   Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to 
                         Constance von Muehlen
Topic: Lactation Accommodations
    The Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) Act passed with 
overwhelming bipartisan support last Congress as an amendment to the 
Fiscal Year 2023 omnibus appropriations package. This bill ensures 
mothers who want to use a breast pump to express milk during their 
workday without fear of being fired by their employer have the right to 
do so. However, flight crews were specifically excluded from the bill 
at the behest of airlines. The Woman in Aviation Advisory Board 
recommended the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) explore ways to 
accommodate nursing mothers who work in the aviation industry, 
especially pilots and flight attendants while on flying duty.
    Question. Ms. von Muehlen: In your opinion, can more be done to 
support flight attendants and pilots who are new parents, and will you 
commit to working with me on this issue and ensuring flight crew 
members never have to choose between keeping a job and nursing a child?
    Answer. We work with our employees in all positions to provide the 
health care, leave time and other accommodations that come with 
becoming a mother. Alaska Airlines is proud to have a workforce that is 
over 50 percent female across the company, and we continue to work on 
improving that representation across the various workgroups and in 
leadership positions. I know first-hand what it is like to be a pioneer 
in a field with few women and take our desire to create an inclusive 
workplace seriously. Creating an environment where our employees feel 
respected, safe, and appreciated is of vital importance to me and our 
airline.
    When it comes to working with our inflight crew, we must consider 
the unique duties and requirements of these positions and adhere to 
Federal aviation safety regulations. Safety is and will always be our 
top priority and we continue to advocate for a consistent Federal 
standard for our pilots and inflight crews necessary to ensure the 
safety of all onboard our aircraft. Within this Federal standard, we 
work on a case by case basis with our flight crews to accommodate 
pumping when it is safe to do so.
                                 ______

    Topic. Ms. von Muehlen, you spoke in your testimony about the 
importance of diversifying the talent pool, and about efforts in Alaska 
to recruit a diverse population of future pilots.

    Question. How can Congress and the FAA do more to support diversity 
in pilot recruitment?
    Answer. Alaska Airlines is committed to helping develop and employ 
a more diverse talent pool in the aviation industry. We are constantly 
looking at investments we can make and communities we can engage with 
to address this issue and help shape the workforce of the future in 
aviation.
    We look forward to working with Congress and the FAA to identify 
ways in which we can best eliminate the barriers to entry for 
underrepresented communities. As Congress looks to a new FAA 
Reauthorization, Alaska Airlines is committed to working with the 
Federal government to continue existing programs that move us closer to 
these goals, and to help develop new programs that can mitigate the 
substantial costs and barriers to entry currently in place in the 
aviation workforce. Addressing these systemic policy barriers to entry 
is key to diversification.

    HBCU Partnerships. Georgia represents both the world's busiest 
airport and a major U.S. airline, with Hartsfield-Jackson International 
Airport and Delta calling the state home. I believe that is important 
that we work with airlines and airports to advance opportunities to 
grow and diversify their talent pipeline through partnerships with 
universities, pilot training schools, and non-profit organizations. 
Currently, the only public undergraduate aviation program in Georgia is 
at Middle Georgia State University. Expanding access to different types 
of aviation programs could help to make the aviation workforce more 
inclusive of rural Georgians, veterans, women, and economically 
distressed populations.

    Question. Can you speak to the important role that HBCUs, HSIs and 
other minority serving institutions offer as the aviation industry 
seeks to attract and retain more diverse aviation talent?
    Answer. Alaska Airlines is committed to helping develop a more 
diverse and highly skilled aviation workforce. Minority serving 
institutions can play a very important role in realizing that goal, and 
we look forward to working with Congress, stakeholders and other 
partners to identify how to best partner with and leverage these 
institutions and their talent pools.
    At Alaska Airlines, we're demonstrating our commitment through the 
programs we offer and the partnerships we're fostering. For example, 
Alaska's True North program is specifically targeted at partnerships 
with HBCUs--currently Delaware State University and the University of 
Maryland-Eastern Shore. True North is a pilot development program. 
Enrolled students in True North are supported by Alaska Airlines for 
their flight training fees and are offered guaranteed first officer 
positions at Alaska's regional carrier, Horizon Air, providing a 
pathway to Alaska Airlines. Alaska Airlines is also a part of the HBCU 
Partnership Challenge which encourages private companies to partner 
with HBCUs.
    Additionally, we are proud to be a strong supporter and partner of 
UNCF. Recently, in partnership with UNCF Pacific Northwest, we sent 43 
high school juniors from Seattle and Portland on a weeklong college 
tour. They flew to Atlanta on the ``Our Commitment'' plane and 
experienced five historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs)--
Fort Valley State University, Morris Brown College, Morehouse, Clark 
Atlanta, and Spelman. Over the course of the week they learned how 
HBCUs are designed to provide a uniquely inclusive college experience 
that enables students to thrive. The students spoke to campus leaders, 
administrators, and college students, toured through each of the 
campuses, and were encouraged to continue on their educational journeys 
by applying for scholarships and admissions.

    Question. How can we increase the number of flight training 
programs and aviation education programs at these institutions and make 
them more affordable to pursue?
    Answer. Thank you for this question, as it is an important and 
challenging one. As I said in my testimony, Alaska Airlines believes in 
collaborative career pathways that build on relationships between 
airlines, government, military, manufacturers, and schools of all 
sizes. We believe that when all of these groups come together with a 
shared understanding and a common goal, we can accomplish great things. 
In order to have access to the highly skilled and diverse workforce our 
industry needs in the future, we will need to work with our industry 
partners to find ways to make training and education programs more 
affordable and accessible for people of all backgrounds. There is a 
strong demand for these careers in aviation. Expanding the 625 grants 
from the previous FAA reauthorization to help grow existing programs 
and establish new, high-quality training programs at these and other 
institutions is one way to help grow the pathways.
    Additionally, Alaska Airlines believes that providing a financial 
pathway for students to consider these programs is important. 
Specifically, we urge Congress to expand student loan aid to help 
finance flight school training.

    Skills-First Alternatives to 4 Year Degree Programs. Historically 
college degrees have served as a barrier to entry for many seeking 
career opportunity and advancement, particularly among Black and 
Hispanic populations.

    Question. Can you speak to the importance of valuing training and 
skills gleaned through work experience, apprenticeships, and targeted 
coursework as a means of expanding and diversifying the aviation talent 
pipeline?
    Answer. Work experience, apprenticeships and targeted coursework 
are vital to creating the talented workforce our company and our 
industry needs for the future. We likewise believe that we must make 
the aviation industry more accessible to diverse and underrepresented 
communities.
    Offering low interest Federal loans to pilots in training, whether 
at certificate, 2-or 4-year degree programs, is one key component to 
improving access to the pilot pipeline and is a policy we urge this 
Congress to explore and advance so we can have the pilot supply needed 
to meet demand in the long-term.
    Congress should also expand the breadth and investment of the 
section 625 grants for outreach, education and training of pilots and 
maintenance technicians, as well as pave the path for veterans to enter 
aviation careers through the GI bill and other programs.
    Ultimately there are multiple pathways into aviation careers, and 
we should draw from a wide range of backgrounds as we build the future 
aviation workforce.

    Question. How can we better publicize these opportunities and 
ensure that frontline talent are being considered for multiple career 
pathways across the aviation industry beyond entry level roles?
    Answer. Making sure individuals from many diverse communities are 
aware of the incredible opportunities in the aviation workforce is a 
priority for Alaska Airlines. The two most visible parts of our 
business are our employees and our airplanes, and it is important that 
both represent who we are as a company. We're committed to improving 
diversity in our frontline and being inclusive in our recruiting and 
hiring. It is so important for young people see themselves in these 
careers they aspire to, which is why having a diverse frontline, as 
well as diverse leadership is important.
    Alaska Airlines is also proud of what we call ``Our Commitment'' 
aircraft that symbolizes Alaska's own equity journey and our collective 
commitment to education. The aircraft--which was designed in 
partnership with our employees--embodies Alaska's long-term partnership 
with UNCF, the largest scholarship provider for students of color and 
an organization dedicated to enabling under-represented students to 
become highly qualified college graduates.
    We are committed to continuing to work with industry partners, 
regulators, and academic institutions to identify ways we can create 
greater awareness in this space.

    Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. J. D. Vance to 
                         Constance von Muehlen
    In 2018, it was reported that almost 25 percent of all heavy 
aircraft maintenance was performed overseas, more than a 3-fold 
increase from 2003.<SUP>[1]</SUP> The same report also found that, 
among 11 U.S. airlines, the share of outsourced maintenance jobs ranged 
from 24 to 75 percent. Alaska Airlines was reported to have outsourced 
49 percent of its airline maintenance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \[1]\ Ted Reed, ``Amount of Outsourced Offshore Airline Maintenance 
Work Has Risen, Report Says,'' Reuters, April 2018, https://

sourced-offshore-airline-maintenance-work-has-risen-report-says/
?sh=1d65e0326e2b.

    Question 1. What share of Alaska Airlines' aircraft maintenance has 
been outsourced? How much of it occurs outside the United States? In 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
which countries?

    Question 2. What factors does Alaska Airlines consider when 
deciding whether to outsource the maintenance of aircraft in its fleet?

    Question 3. Since 2003, how many maintenance requests have planes 
in Alaska Airlines' fleet required on average each year?
    Answer. It is important to recognize that global aviation is highly 
regulated and no maintenance, regardless of domestic or international, 
is done without appropriate approvals. An aircraft cannot fly without 
having required maintenance performed in accordance with the operator's 
approved maintenance program and approved for return to service by 
appropriately qualified and certificated individuals and companies.
    Like all U.S. air carriers, Alaska Airlines also has a robust 
Safety Management System (SMS). Per the FAA, an SMS is the formal, top-
down, organization-wide approach to managing safety risk and assuring 
the effectiveness of safety risk controls. It includes systematic 
procedures, practices, and policies for the management of safety risk. 
As part of that SMS, Alaska Airlines also has a Continuing Analysis and 
Surveillance System (CASS) that feeds data into the SMS regarding 
maintenance matters.
    Specifically, 14 CFR Sec. 121.373(a) states that ``Each certificate 
holder shall establish and maintain a system for the continuing 
analysis and surveillance of the performance and effectiveness of its 
inspection program and the program covering other maintenance, 
preventive maintenance, and alterations and for the correction of any 
deficiency in those programs, regardless of whether those programs are 
carried out by the certificate holder or by another person.'' These 
safety regulations are strictly adhered to by Alaska Airlines.
    Contract maintenance has been part of the global aviation industry 
for decades. These issues should be thoughtfully approached and 
methodically considered, and decisions should be made based on data 
that would benefit safety. Considerations and unintended consequences 
of disrupting maintenance lines, distorting competitive markets and on-
going maintenance technician shortages should all be important 
components of a contract maintenance policy.
    We would also encourage you and your staff to reach out to the 
Aeronautical Repair Station Association (ARSA) for additional 
background on the global maintenance industry.
    With regards to your specific questions:

  1)  All our aircraft heavy maintenance for airframe structural 
        inspections as well as modifications are accomplished by 
        maintenance repair and overall providers in North Carolina, 
        Oklahoma, and Texas.
  2)  With regards to heavy maintenance, we consider our labor 
        agreement with our technicians, the provider's FAA 
        certification, quality of work, skilled workforce availability, 
        maintenance capability, hangar capacity, tooling availability 
        and cost.
  3)  We perform hundreds of routine and non-routine maintenance tasks 
        each day.

                         Constance von Muehlen
    Question. I know Ms. Von Muehlen was a member of the Women in 
Aviation Advisory Board along with Dr. Lutte and others. Much of the 
board's report talks about the professional barriers to women accessing 
and advancing in the aviation industry. Part of the report talks about 
better collaboration between stakeholders and the FAA to promote the 
recruitment of women into the industry.
    From an airline perspective, how can the FAA better facilitate that 
collaboration?
    Answer. Eliminating barriers to entry for women and other 
underrepresented communities is of great importance to our airline. 
Awareness, especially early in school, of the exciting opportunities a 
job in the aviation workforce presents is a major aspect of that 
challenge. I think building on the investments by Congress and the FAA 
in this area and standing up additional programs focused on these goals 
can be an important step in the right direction. Collaboration between 
stakeholders is vital and the FAA can be both a leader and facilitator.
    As we plan for the future at Alaska Airlines, we have established 
programs focused on reducing workforce barriers to entry, including 
those referenced in my testimony. We invite the FAA to join us at some 
of our events targeting young people and future aviation professionals, 
such as our ``Aviation Days''. Aviation Day at Alaska Airlines is a 
special program that grew out of a small youth program to become a 
multicity event where we open our maintenance hangars to kids from the 
surrounding communities for an entire day to come and touch and feel 
aircraft, use simulators, talk to employees and connect with training 
programs.
    Collaboration and sharing of best practices within the aviation 
community to attract youth into aviation careers whether at airlines or 
the FAA is something we can all do together.

    Workforce Development Grant Program. In Fiscal Year 2021, the FAA 
Workforce Development Grant program received 326 applications worth 
$121 million, but the FAA could only issue 31 grants for $10 million 
given current caps.

    Question 1. Do you agree that Congress should expand the scope of 
this grant program and increase funding to meet the needs of the 
aviation workforce? What other areas of the workforce should be 
covered?
    Answer. Yes, expanding the scope of this grant program is 
consistent with both specific Women in Aviation Advisory Board (WIAAB 
or the Board) recommendations, as well as general themes and strategies 
found in the Board's report to redress funding barriers. Expanding the 
grant program will result in significant advantages to address 
workforce needs including:

  <bullet> expanding existing programs already in place;

  <bullet> supporting the development of new programs;

  <bullet> supporting collaboration amongst partners (non-profits, 
        higher education, industry, etc.) to both create new programs 
        and build on existing known successful strategies for workforce 
        development;

  <bullet> ability to include careers beyond the current limiting 
        factor of only pilots or mechanics; and

  <bullet> facilitating sharing of best practices for outreach, 
        recruitment, retention, and advancement of the aviation 
        workforce.

    It is recommended that the expansion include an emphasis on 
targeting underrepresented groups in aviation, which are the untapped 
resource for building the workforce.

Topic: Lactation Accommodations
    The Providing Urgent Maternal Protections (PUMP) Act passed with 
overwhelming bipartisan support last Congress as an amendment to the 
Fiscal Year 2023 omnibus appropriations package. This bill ensures 
mothers who want to use a breast pump to express milk during their 
workday without fear of being fired by their employer have the right to 
do so. However, flight crews were specifically excluded from the bill 
at the behest of airlines. The Woman in Aviation Advisory Board 
recommended the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) explore ways to 
accommodate nursing mothers who work in the aviation industry, 
especially pilots and flight attendants while on flying duty.

    Question 1. What can Congress do in this year's FAA reauthorization 
bill to make the aviation industry more accommodating to nursing 
mothers?
    Answer. In Recommendation 40, the Women in Aviation Advisory Board 
(WIAAB or the Board) recommended that the FAA research and develop best 
practices and/or regulations to accommodate nursing while on flying 
duty, in particular for women who do not qualify for existing 
protections. Nursing, for the purpose of this recommendation, is 
defined as providing reasonable break time and an appropriate 
environment to express breast milk. Nursing mothers should be given 
ample time to express in a clean, private environment.
    The Board also recommended the formation of an advisory group to 
oversee this research and make recommendations to the FAA. Congress can 
support this research by ensuring a permanent advisory committee is 
directed and funded.
    A permanent advisory committee will allow for continued focus, 
coordination, and implementation oversight for all of these 
recommendations. This committee will also be able to evaluate the 
effectiveness of these recommendations to determine the level to which 
resources are meeting targeted goals.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Ben Ray Lujan to 
                           Dr. Rebecca Lutte
    Topic. Dr. Lutte, thank you so much for joining us today to discuss 
the great work aviation technology programs across the country do to 
prepare our aviation maintenance workforce. New Mexico is home to 
several institutions--including Eastern New Mexico University Roswell 
and Central New Mexico Community College--that are part of this vital 
effort.
    These are high-paying, high-demand jobs that will continue to be in 
demand in every corner of our country--but as you noted in your 
testimony, there's an awareness problem. Not enough people know about 
the benefits and the pathway to an aviation maintenance career, and, as 
a result, the entire aviation industry faces workforce shortages.

    Question 1. Dr. Lutte, do you believe that uplifting and supporting 
diversity in aviation workforce programs will help to fill the jobs 
opening up in this sector?
    Answer. Yes. As the Women in Aviation Advisory Board (WIAAB or the 
Board) wrote, ``Identifying and recruiting talent from underrepresented 
groups is an obvious and necessary strategy to address workforce needs 
throughout the industry.'' Improving workplace culture and recruiting, 
retaining, and advancing individuals from underrepresented groups will 
improve access to all those seeking opportunities in aviation.
    Aviation maintenance, a critical component for safety and 
operational efficiency, is facing a significant workforce shortage. 
Only 3 percent of FAA certificated mechanics are women.\3\ According to 
the most recent ATEC Report on the maintenance workforce pipeline,\4\ 
38 percent of the mechanic population is over the age of 60 and 
maintenance technicians are retiring at a rate that is outpacing new 
mechanics.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Aviation maintenance continues to experience the greatest gender 
gap in aviation. Women and members of underrepresented groups are an 
obvious part of the solution to the workforce challenges.
    Funding workforce programs to include expanding outreach, 
recruiting, and reducing training barriers (cost) is essential to 
address the maintenance workforce shortage. Additionally, establishing 
a permanent advisory committee as requested by the WIAAB will ensure 
continued collaboration, attention, and sharing of best practices to 
address the maintenance shortage.
    To close the gap, however, Congress and the FAA also need to 
address culture, funding, career retention, and advancement. If we 
don't address culture, we will not only fail to recruit, but 
critically, industry will also fail to retain its existing workforce. A 
primary cultural barrier continues to be discrimination/harassment and 
bias, including in the workplace. As noted below, 71 percent of women 
in aviation surveyed reported experiencing sexual harassment in the 
workplace or an aviation setting--81 percent reported witnessing it.\5\

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    To improve aviation's culture, the Board made several 
recommendations, including establishment of an industry-wide 
independent reporting program for gender bias, gender discrimination, 
and sexual harassment. In addition, the Board recommended that the FAA 
and industry improve the visual representation of women in aviation 
careers including maintenance. The Board also recommended that the FAA 
and industry ensure aviation uniforms and professional appearance 
standards, including for maintenance technicians, are inclusive of 
women.
    Another serious concern highlighted by the Board is underreported 
sexual abuse during FAA medical examinations. Examples of abuses 
include unwarranted breast and pelvic examinations, and skin checks 
requiring the removal of clothing. The impacts of these unacceptable 
violations of trust can be life-altering, as evidenced by the USA 
gymnastics team testimony on abuse during medical examinations. 
Aviation Medical Examiners are in unique positions of power for such 
exams because they have the ability to confer or deny a required FAA 
medical certificate, which can impact an applicant's ability to start 
or continue to work. Experiencing inappropriate or abusive actions 
during a flight physical can deter women from pursuing aviation 
careers.
    We know women experience abuse during exams. What we do not know is 
the frequency of inappropriate actions during FAA medical examinations 
and the effectiveness of existing processes for reporting misconduct. 
There are two specific recommendations that address this issue. First, 
the WIAAB calls on Congress to require the Government Accountability 
Office to investigate and report on the frequency of inappropriate 
actions during FAA medical examinations and the process for reporting 
misconduct, investigating reports, and taking corrective actions. The 
results of investigations should be made public. Second, the Board 
recommended the creation of enhanced FAA medical process information 
and reporting procedures, including resources for applicants and 
required displays for AME offices.

    Question 2. What can Congress and the FAA do to raise awareness 
about aviation maintenance careers in order to close the gap?
    Answer. The Women in Aviation Advisory Board (WIAAB or the Board) 
makes several recommendations to Congress and the FAA specific to 
improving outreach, education, and awareness about aviation careers, 
including maintenance. Youth outreach is essential. The Board proposed 
13 recommendations specifically targeting Outreach, Awareness, and 
Education, because introducing young girls to aviation careers and 
education paths early on has been shown to empower and enable them to 
consider career paths that might otherwise feel unavailable or 
unachievable. Over half of women in aviation surveyed (54 percent) 
reported that exposure to aviation as a child influenced their decision 
to pursue a career in aviation.\7\ Outreach should specifically focus 
on aviation. Research shows that girls are attracted to aviation for 
the adventure and challenge,\8\ and not all careers in aviation require 
STEM skills.

    We must do more to create awareness of these attainable, rewarding, 
high-demand jobs in maintenance. As an example, a few years ago, at a 
Women in Aviation, Girls in Aviation Day event in Houston, a group of 
young women from a local maintenance training program brought a typical 
piston engine used in general aviation aircraft and stood around the 
engine answering questions and talking about being an aviation 
maintenance technician. The women in maintenance with the engine for 
the girls to explore were a big draw! The Girls in Aviation Day 
attendees were fascinated and interested. We need to expand outreach 
and recruitment to put this job pathway on the radar of those who may 
not have ever considered such an option. To that end, the WIAAB 
recommends the creation of a ``one stop shop'' Virtual Resource Center 
(VRC) to help inform students, parents, teachers, and volunteers about 
career pathways, educational and scholarship resources, and engagement 
opportunities including for girls and women who want to pursue careers 
in aviation.
    Closing the workforce gap in maintenance also requires emphasis on 
retaining talent. According to the recent ATEC report on maintenance 
workforce,\9\ 42 percent of aviation maintenance training school 
graduates do not take the exams necessary to receive certification and 
30 percent of those who finish accept employment in another field. As 
an industry, we are losing the trained maintenance workforce who were 
recruited into the field. The WIAAB made several recommendations to 
address retention, including a focus on workplace policies, scheduling, 
and mentoring.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Raphael Warnock to 
                           Dr. Rebecca Lutte
    HBCU Partnerships. Georgia represents both the world's busiest 
airport and a major U.S. airline, with Hartsfield-Jackson International 
Airport and Delta calling the state home. I believe that is important 
that we work with airlines and airports to advance opportunities to 
grow and diversify their talent pipeline through partnerships with 
universities, pilot training schools, and non-profit organizations. 
Currently, the only public undergraduate aviation program in Georgia is 
at Middle Georgia State University. Expanding access to different types 
of aviation programs could help to make the aviation workforce more 
inclusive of rural Georgians, veterans, women, and economically 
distressed populations.

    Question. Can you speak to the important role that HBCUs, HSIs and 
other minority serving institutions offer as the aviation industry 
seeks to attract and retain more diverse aviation talent?
    Answer. The Women in Aviation Advisory Board (WIAAB) recognized the 
significant contribution of collegiate programs including minority 
serving institutions such as HBCUs and HSIs to the future of the 
aviation workforce. Collegiate programs not only provide essential 
credentialing and professional development, they provide numerous 
benefits such as clear career pathways through industry agreements and 
partnerships, internships, student support organizations, and mentoring 
programs. A key benefit of collegiate programs is the ability to 
address the cost barrier to entry through access to financial aid and 
scholarships. However, the amount of financial aid does not meet the 
needs of aviation students, particularly flight students. Flight 
students require an added $60,000 to $80,000 for flight training in 
addition to the cost of the degree. By comparison, the maximum Pell 
Grant award is $6,895. Increasing the amount of financial aid available 
to students will increase the workforce pipeline.
    The aviation workforce lacks diversity in race/ethnicity as noted 
in the table below.\1\ HBCUs and Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) 
will help reach a more diverse population of students, including women, 
with support for access to aviation training to meet aviation workforce 
needs.

    For example, aviation maintenance, a critical component for safety 
and operational efficiency, is facing a significant workforce shortage. 
According to the most recent ATEC Report on the maintenance workforce 
pipeline, 38 percent of the mechanic population is over the age of 60 
and maintenance technicians are retiring at a rate that is outpacing 
new mechanic entrants.\2\ Only 3 percent of FAA certificated mechanics 
are women and only 11 percent are Black or African American.\3\ 
Increasing the numbers of underrepresented groups is an obvious part of 
the workforce solution.

    HBCUs and MSIs provide career pathways, financial support, and 
supportive campus climates to assist in recruitment and retention of 
underrepresented groups in aviation higher education. And yet, of the 
107 HBCUs, only 10 have active aviation programs. The result is an 
opportunity to not only expand existing programs but develop new 
programs to provide greater access. Doing so will require resources and 
the ability to hire quality faculty and instructors.
    To meet the workforce needs of the aviation industry, more access 
to aviation education and training is needed, including access for a 
wider pool of students. Some states lack a sufficient number of 
collegiate aviation programs. Many existing programs struggle in the 
ability for capacity to meet demand. Capacity challenges can include an 
adequate number of faculty, flight instructors, insurance costs, 
aircraft acquisition, and infrastructure needs such as ramp and hangar 
space.

  <bullet> establishing a grant program for minority-serving 
        institutions to expand or establish aviation-related programs

    Note: Recommendation 31 could also apply to faculty and staff from 
additional underrepresented groups.

  <bullet> creating a permanent advisory committee to ensure continued 
        oversight (Recommendation 14).

    Question. How can we increase the number of flight training 
programs and aviation education programs at these institutions and make 
them more affordable to pursue?
    Answer. The WIAAB made several recommendations to address the 
training barriers including cost and access as noted in the response 
above. Key elements include increased access to financial aid for 
students, increased funding for program expansion and development with 
emphasis on MSIs, and increased funding for workforce development grant 
programs. An additional recommendation is to restore the ability of 
veterans to use funding from the GI bill for private pilot 
certification, the entry to the professional pilot track.

        accreditor should qualify to receive additional funds to cover 
        flight training toward commercial certificates. Currently, the 
        funds provided by the GI Bill schools barely cover the cost of 
        one training certificate (Recommendation 32).

    Skills-First Alternatives to 4 Year Degree Programs. Historically 
college degrees have served as a barrier to entry for many seeking 
career opportunity and advancement, particularly among Black and 
Hispanic populations.

    Question. Can you speak to the importance of valuing training and 
skills gleaned through work experience, apprenticeships, and targeted 
coursework as a means of expanding and diversifying the aviation talent 
pipeline?
    Answer. The WIAAB provided recommendations that support the use of 
a variety of education related aviation activities including 
internships and field experiences. Targeted coursework, including 
opportunities for high school students to complete aviation coursework 
and even earn an FAA certificate is recommended and will launch the 
careers of our next generation aviation workforce. A call for funding, 
in the form of Workforce Development Grants to support such experiences 
is included.

        careers (Recommendation 23).

    Question. How can we better publicize these opportunities and 
ensure that frontline talent are being considered for multiple career 
pathways across the aviation industry beyond entry level roles?
    Answer. Lack of career pathway awareness was a recognized barrier 
to entry by the WIAAB. Without intervention, this lack of awareness and 
access to information about career opportunities in aviation, as well 
as the educational pathways that lead to those opportunities will 
continue to negatively impact our ability to recruit the next 
generation of aviation professionals. This ``awareness gap'' also 
extends to influencers including parents, counselors, and teachers. A 
primary recommendation from the WIAAB was the call for a virtual 
resource center ``one stop shop'' for information. The model for the 
virtual resource center is included at the end of this response.\7\

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito to 

                           Dr. Rebecca Lutte
    Question 1. Dr. Lutte, as you know the vast majority of aviation 
careers are not visible or well-known but are just as important as 
maintenance workers, air traffic controllers, and engineers.
    From your academic perspective, can you tell us about the ways that 
these types of careers can be better promoted to female students?
    Answer. The Women in Aviation Advisory Board (WIAAB or the Board) 
report identifies lack of awareness of aviation careers as a barrier to 
entry for women in aviation. This barrier also applies to additional 
underrepresented groups.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It is essential that we start the introduction to aviation at an 
early age. Early exposure to aviation is highly influential; 
accordingly, youth outreach has an important positive impact on 
recruitment into aviation. The survey of women in aviation found that 
54 percent of respondents reported that exposure to aviation as a child 
positively influenced their decisions to pursue aviation careers.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The ``awareness gap'' also extends to parents, teachers, and 
counselors who are influencers to young people exploring careers in 
aviation. According to a survey of women in aviation, parents were 
strong positive influencers on the decision to pursue aviation careers. 
High school counselors were not rated highly (84 percent responded no 
influence/NA), and when counselors did play a role, it was more 
negative than positive, underscoring an opportunity to provide more 
support to and through counselors on aviation opportunities.\3\ If not 
addressed, this gatekeeping moment where a young person expresses 
interest may result in losing that potential next generation aviation 
leader simply due to lack of career guidance information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As an example, we had a young woman in our university aviation 
program who shared her story with me. Growing up she ``caught the 
aviation bug'' and wanted to become a professional pilot. She didn't 
know anyone in the field, so she went to her high school counselor and 
was told that the only viable route was military. The counselor was 
unaware of the many career paths that could have led the student to her 
goal because as an industry, we haven't done enough to inform the 
influencers. This young woman was defeated, but on her way out the door 
of the counselor's office happened to see a magazine back cover 
advertising for our university aviation program. Purely by chance, she 
learned of our program, enrolled, and is now flying for a regional 
airline.
    Additionally, a Board-initiated survey of professional women not 
currently working in aviation (discussed further below) found that the 
most common reason women had not considered working in an aviation 
career was a lack of familiarity with the options available to them.
    We can do better.
    The WIAAB called for several recommendations to address this 
awareness gap. We called on the FAA to create a marketing campaign 
featuring women in aviation to help girls envision themselves in 
aviation careers. Additionally, we ask for the creation of a virtual 
``one stop shop'' online resource center. This resource center would 
provide key information (e.g., youth outreach events, career pathways, 
education options, financial aid options, scholarships) for our future 
and current aviation workforce, teachers, parents, counselors, etc. A 
model for the virtual resource center is included at the end of this 
response.\4\ This same recommendation was also included in the FAA 
Youth Access to American Jobs in Aviation Task Force Report.\5\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    We can increase awareness by introducing aviation in K-12. The 
WIAAB report recommends increasing awareness of opportunities by 
offering students the ability to complete an aviation program or earn 
an FAA certificate in high school.
    Coordination of nonprofits, another WIAAB recommendation, will also 
allow for greater awareness of the many benefits of these organizations 
including their outreach and scholarship programs. Many nonprofits are 
currently implementing outreach and awareness campaigns including 
programs targeted at underrepresented groups. We can capitalize and 
expand on what is already working.
    Expanding Workforce Development Grants is also essential for 
increasing awareness. The programs discussed here will require funding 
and should include collaboration amongst groups who are already 
conducting successful outreach and recruiting programs, including 
industry, nonprofits, and educational institutions.
    Finally, a permanent advisory committee will provide critical 
continued focus, coordination, and implementation oversight for all of 
these recommendations. This committee will also be able to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the Board's recommendations in order to provide 
continued course correction looking forward.

    Question 2. In the Women in Aviation Advisory Board's report, I was 
surprised to see that 64 percent of women in aviation decide to enter 
the field before the age of 20. Meaning that 36 percent of women in 
aviation decided to go into the field after the age of 20.
    What are the best ways to attract girls to aviation and what are 
the best ways to help women transition from other careers into the 
aviation industry?
    Answer. Because a complex system of barriers impedes the 
recruitment of girls and women into aviation, there is no ``silver 
bullet.'' For this reason, the Board issues several different 
recommendations to address recruitment--in particular focused on 
culture; economic barriers; and outreach, awareness, and education. The 
creation of a permanent advisory committee will provide the necessary 
consistent focus and coordination to best ensure the success of efforts 
to improve recruitment into aviation, including the Board's 
recommendations.
    Addressing lack of awareness was discussed in the previous response 
with suggestions for outreach and recruitment. This response will focus 
on the additional barriers of cost of entry and culture.
    To attract and retain women in aviation, Congress and the FAA need 
to address culture. If we don't address culture, we will not only fail 
to recruit but critically the industry will fail to retain its existing 
workforce. A primary cultural barrier continues to be discrimination/
harassment and bias in the workplace. As noted below, 71 percent of 
women in aviation surveyed reported experiencing sexual harassment in 
the workplace or an aviation setting--81 percent reported witnessing 
it.\7\

[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    To improve culture the Board provides multiple recommendations 
including establishment of an industry wide independent reporting 
program for gender bias, gender discrimination, and sexual harassment. 
In addition, the Board recommended that the FAA and industry improve 
the visual representation of women in aviation careers. The Board also 
recommended that the FAA and industry ensure aviation uniforms and 
professional appearance standards are inclusive of women. WIAAB report 
recommendations to address culture also included a focus on workplace 
policies, scheduling, and mentoring.
    A serious concern highlighted by the Board is underreported sexual 
abuse during FAA medical examinations. Examples of abuses include 
unwarranted breast and pelvic examinations, and unnecessary skin checks 
requiring the removal of clothing. The impacts of these unacceptable 
violations of trust can be life-altering, as evidenced by the USA 
gymnastics team testimony on abuse during medical examinations. 
Aviation Medical Examiners are in unique positions of power for such 
exams because they have the ability to confer or deny a required FAA 
medical certificate, which can impact an applicant's ability to start 
or continue to work.
    We know women experience abusive actions during exams. What we do 
not know is the frequency of inappropriate actions during FAA medical 
examinations and the effectiveness of existing processes for reporting 
misconduct. There are two specific recommendations that address this 
issue. First, the WIAAB calls on Congress to require the Government 
Accountability Office to investigate and report on the frequency of 
inappropriate actions during FAA medical examinations and the process 
for reporting misconduct, investigating reports, and taking corrective 
actions. The results of investigations should be made public. Second, 
the Board recommended the creation of enhanced FAA medical process 
information and reporting procedures, including resources for 
applicants and required displays for AME offices.
    Addressing the cost barrier to entry requires increased access to 
financial aid and scholarships. The amount of financial aid does not 
meet the needs of aviation students, particularly flight students. 
Flight students require an added $60,000 to $80,000 for flight training 
in addition to the cost of the degree. By comparison, the maximum Pell 
Grant award is $6,895. Increasing the amount of financial aid available 
to students will increase the workforce pipeline.
    Women transitioning from other career fields offers an additional 
potential pathway to build the aviation workforce. A WIAAB initiated 
survey of professional women not currently working in aviation, 
however, found that only about 15 percent reported being exposed to 
aviation in school; 10 percent reported that they had never been 
exposed to aviation. Almost 20 percent of respondents reported no 
familiarity with any segment of the aviation industry.\8\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This survey of professional women not working in aviation also 
found that 70 percent of respondents had never considered working in 
aviation. Of those who had, most had never applied for a job in 
aviation. The most common reason for not considering an aviation career 
was a lack of familiarity with the options available to them. The 
second most common reason was that working in aviation did not appeal 
to them. The survey reinforced there are common misconceptions about 
aviation that may impact recruitment, such as believing (incorrectly) 
that aviation careers require science, technology, engineering, or 
math. The third most common reason was not knowing where to start. This 
survey reveals an additional ``awareness gap'' that needs to be 
addressed for transitioning talented professionals into aviation. The 
recommendations in response to question 1 above can assist in 
addressing those gaps.
    The WIAAB also discussed the transition from the military to the 
aviation industry. Actively marketing opportunities to transition from 
military roles to the civil aviation industry and removing barriers 
will enable an easier transition. This will help more military talent 
join and remain in the industry, including women.
    Expanding Workforce Development Grants is essential for

    Question 3. Changing gears, but staying on the importance of 
education--we have a number of excellent aviation programs in West 
Virginia including Marshall University's, Fairmont State, and Pierpont. 
I know that these flight school and maintenance technician programs are 
in very high demand and that many applicants are turned away from them.
    Can you tell us the best ways to address this kind of high demand 
and ways we can help these programs expand?
    Answer. The Women in Aviation Advisory Board (WIAAB) recognized the 
significant contribution of collegiate and technical programs including 
minority serving institutions such as HBCUs and HSIs to the future of 
the aviation workforce. Collegiate programs not only provide essential 
credentialing and professional development, they provide numerous 
benefits such as clear career pathways through industry agreements and 
partnerships, internships, student support organizations, and mentoring 
programs.
    To meet the workforce needs of the aviation industry, more access 
to aviation education and training is needed, including access 
available to a wider pool of students. Some states lack a sufficient 
number of collegiate aviation programs. The University Aviation 
Association Collegiate Aviation Guide lists 70 public and 27 private 
institutions that offer aviation programs in the U.S.\10\ Additionally, 
not all states have public institutions that offer the Restricted ATP 
FAA approved flight programs which benefit students and industry by 
providing an earlier pathway to the professional pilot workforce.\11\ 
Many existing programs struggle in the ability for capacity to meet 
demand. Capacity challenges can include adequate number of faculty, 
flight instructors, insurance costs, aircraft acquisition, and 
infrastructure needs such as ramp and hangar space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Recommendations from the WIAAB include increased funding of 
Workforce Development Grants, Federal grant programs to support and 
expand minority serving institutions, and grant funding for faculty and 
staff.
    Another strategy to address demand is to allow students 
opportunities to participate in aviation programs/courses and even earn 
FAA credentials while in high school. These opportunities will allow 
students to potentially earn credit that will benefit them on their 
career path and reduce demand for some entry level courses/training at 
institutions.

  <bullet> establish resources for secondary and postsecondary 
        institutions to develop and maintain partnerships between high 
        schools and colleges leading to FAA certification and/or 
        aviation-related certificates and degree programs

        (Recommendation 19);

  <bullet> establish a competitive Federal grant program for state-
        supported Minority Serving Institutions to expand or establish 
        aviation-related programs (Recommendation 29);

  <bullet> expand eligibility for FAA Workforce Development Grants 
        (Recommendation 30);

  <bullet> allocate grant funding to support recruiting and mentoring 
        female faculty and staff at colleges, universities, and career-
        focused training programs (Recommendation 31); and

  <bullet> create a permanent advisory committee to ensure continued 
        oversight and focus (Recommendation 14).

    Can you share more about ways that we can better support new and 
struggling programs?
    Answer. One measure of success of programs is the ability to 
recruit and retain students. It requires addressing the cost barrier to 
entry through access to financial aid and scholarships. However, the 
amount of financial aid does not meet the needs of aviation students, 
particularly flight students. Flight students require an added $60,000 
to $80,000 for flight training in addition to the cost of the degree. 
By comparison, the maximum Pell Grant award is $6,895. Increasing the 
amount of financial aid available to students will increase student 
retention.
    Revising GI Bill benefits can also contribute to program and 
student success. The WIAAB called for restoring the ability of American 
Veterans to use the GI Bill for private pilot certification at Part 141 
flight schools. Veterans conducting their flight training at Part 141 
flight schools that have been approved by a DoED-recognized accreditor 
should qualify to receive additional funds to cover flight training 
toward commercial certificates. Currently, the funds provided by the GI 
Bill schools barely cover the cost of one training certificate.
    New and struggling programs, especially those created and run by 
501c3's, are dependent on public funding. These organizations often 
find niches and gaps and have the agility to address needs faster than 
larger more bureaucratic associations. WIAAB recommendations call on 
Congress to help identify pathways to connect efforts among these orgs. 
We also support additional funding for those programs that target the 
education, outreach, workforce support, and cultural needs of women and 
underrepresented groups considering and already in aviation.

   Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to 
                              David Spero
    Federal Funding Impacts. House Republicans have floated cutting 
discretionary Federal expenditures, as high as 15 percent below enacted 
levels for this Fiscal Year, which could impact the FAA's budget for 
modernizing the air traffic systems.

    Question 1. How would a 10 to 15 percent budget cut impact the Air 
Traffic Organization's ability to safely and efficiently coordinate 
aircraft in the system?
    Answer. Within the Air Traffic Organization (ATO), PASS represents 
FAA airway transportation systems specialists, sometimes referred to as 
technicians, in Technical Operations. Systems specialists ensure the 
functionality of communications systems, computer systems, navigational 
aids and power systems vital to safe air travel and the mission of 
pilots and controllers. In addition, Flight Inspection Services (FIS) 
professionals and aeronautical professionals in Mission Support 
Services (MSS) support pilots, air traffic administrative professionals 
and aviation planners through the development and maintenance of all 
public instrument flight procedures and airways.
    Recruiting and retaining the essential ATO workforce is vital to 
the FAA's ability to safely and effectively coordinate aircraft in the 
system. Unfortunately, it is undeniably clear that the agency is 
lacking in sufficient staffing, especially in terms of its technician 
workforce. Any cut to the agency's budget would have consequences on 
the ability to maintain the current workforce and hire and train the 
workforce of the future. During the height of the pandemic, training 
for these employees was curtailed or moved to a virtual environment, 
with no hands-on experience with the equipment. The agency is still 
playing catch-up with technician training.
    The safety and efficiency of the National Airspace System (NAS) is 
dependent on the right number of people in the right space to do the 
work necessary to ensure the safe functioning of the system. PASS is 
asking that the FAA be directed to establish a Technical Operations 
Workforce Plan and consult with PASS in its creation and 
implementation. PASS believes that the abilities and skills that Tech 
Ops employees provide, if utilized and staffed properly, can provide a 
distinct improvement in the implementation of new NAS systems.
    In April 2013, when sequestration took effect, impacts were felt 
throughout the NAS. Flights across the country were delayed as a result 
of reduced maintenance and loss of system redundancy; cutbacks in 
funding for spare parts impacted the repair and maintenance of air 
traffic control equipment; aviation safety inspectors were prevented 
from overseeing commercial and general aviation industries; 
manufacturing inspectors were not inspecting aviation mechanics, 
facilities, training programs and equipment; and registration 
certificates were not issued for U.S. civil aircraft and airmen. 
Employees were furloughed and suffered financially due to the unplanned 
loss of income or worked without the guarantee of a paycheck. Cuts of 
10-15 percent would be similar to sequestration and put the gold 
standard of safety at the FAA in jeopardy.

    Question 2. How does this budget uncertainty, and the fear of a 
Federal shutdown, affect your membership and the work they perform?
    Answer. Employees represented by PASS are committed professionals 
focused on performing their job at the highest level. These men and 
women go above and beyond to ensure the safety of this country's 
aviation system.
    Unfortunately, these employees are also concerned with budget 
uncertainty and fear of a Federal shutdown. Many PASS members were 
impacted by previous shutdowns, some with life-changing results. While 
PASS-represented employees focus entirely on the work they perform, 
concerns about a shutdown or budget questions cast a shadow on 
workplace morale. This, in turn, threatens the retention of these 
trained and skilled professionals.
    In fact, during the shutdown in 2018/2019, the majority of PASS-
represented employees went 35 days without a paycheck and rising 
concerns because of mounting bills. The work these employees perform 
should be free of any distraction. They should be allowed to fulfill 
their duties free of worry about a shutdown or other politically-driven 
disagreements with the potential to impact their job and livelihood. 
Every day the Federal government was shut down equaled another layer of 
safety being peeled away. The same is true of any other budget gimmick 
that tries to save money without considering the consequences.

    Air Traffic Organization Workforce: The work of highly trained and 
skilled employees in the Air Traffic Organization is essential to 
protecting aviation safety and fulfilling the Federal Aviation 
Administration's (FAA) Mission.

    Question 1. What more needs to be done to ensure we have enough 
skilled and qualified professionals working in the Air Traffic 
Organization to meet increasing demand?
    Answer. Within the Air Traffic Organization (ATO), PASS represents 
FAA airway transportation systems specialists, sometimes referred to as 
technicians, in Technical Operations. Systems specialists ensure the 
functionality of communications systems, computer systems, navigational 
aids and power systems vital to safe air travel and the mission of 
pilots and controllers. In addition, Flight Inspection Services (FIS) 
professionals and aeronautical professionals in Mission Support 
Services (MSS) support pilots, air traffic administrative professionals 
and aviation planners through the development and maintenance of all 
public instrument flight procedures and airways.
    PASS is currently engaged with the FAA on the development of the 
Technical Operations staffing model (TSM) and, while some progress is 
on the horizon, much work is still needed. This model only addresses 
the technical employees in the field who perform preventative 
maintenance and cannot be relied upon to address staffing for other 
duties they perform. It also does not reflect the work performed by 
support personnel who are not directly interfacing with live NAS 
equipment and systems. Furthermore, the model does not take into 
account new hire training or fatigue factors. PASS does not believe 
that the TSM is a reliable tool for determining staffing for this 
workforce.
    PASS is asking that the FAA be directed to establish a Technical 
Operations Workforce Plan and consult with PASS in its creation and 
implementation. PASS believes that the abilities and skills that Tech 
Ops employees provide, if utilized and staffed properly, can provide a 
distinct improvement in the implementation of new NAS systems. The 
development of the Technical Operations Workforce Plan should serve as 
a model for other plans to follow for Mission Support Services and 
Flight Program Operations. By creating Technical Operations pilot 
programs to build business cases for insourcing work to the technical 
workforce, Congress can point the agency in a direction that will 
create lasting change for the aviation community and take a step 
forward in building confidence in the FAA's ability to provide new 
services and technologies in a fraction of the time it takes today.

    HBCU Partnerships. Georgia represents both the world's busiest 
airport and a major U.S. airline, with Hartsfield-Jackson International 
Airport and Delta calling the state home. I believe that is important 
that we work with airlines and airports to advance opportunities to 
grow and diversify their talent pipeline through partnerships with 
universities, pilot training schools, and non-profit organizations. 
Currently, the only public undergraduate aviation program in Georgia is 
at Middle Georgia State University. Expanding access to different types 
of aviation programs could help to make the aviation workforce more 
inclusive of rural Georgians, veterans, women, and economically 
distressed populations.

    Question. Can you speak to the important role that HBCUs, HSIs and 
other minority serving institutions offer as the aviation industry 
seeks to attract and retain more diverse aviation talent?
    Answer. PASS represents approximately 11,000 Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) and Department of Defense employees throughout the 
United States. PASS-represented employees in the FAA install, maintain, 
support and certify air traffic control and national defense equipment, 
inspect and oversee the commercial and general aviation industries, 
develop flight procedures, and perform quality analyses of complex 
aviation systems used in air traffic control and national defense in 
the United States and abroad.
    The membership of PASS is a diverse group of men and women from 
across the country. This notwithstanding, agencies should consistently 
strive to increase diversity and attract more diverse talent. While I 
cannot speak directly about the role HBCUs, HSIs and other minority-
serving institutions play in the FAA's recruitment efforts, I can say 
with confidence that PASS is focused on providing opportunities to all. 
Our members serve on committees, organizations and boards tasked with 
building minority interest and involvement in aviation. PASS is firm in 
our stance that the FAA must address understaffing within the agency. 
Unless the FAA's understaffing is addressed there will not be 
opportunities for students from HBCUs, HSIs and minority-serving 
institutions to grow and thrive in the United States and in Georgia. 
Georgia alone is probably understaffed by as much as 300 aviation jobs 
at the FAA. Any effort toward filling these important safety jobs, 
especially one that includes minority-serving institutions, is a step 
in the right direction.
    PASS members also participate in tradeshows and events at schools 
specifically aimed at attracting minority youth. In fact, we are 
working closely with the FAA on the Gateways Internship program, which 
is open to high school students as well as college and graduate 
students. This offers paid internships to students interested in 
learning more about a career as an FAA systems specialist. Students 
obtain an in-depth understanding of how the facilities, systems and 
equipment support the day-to-day operations of the national airspace 
system. PASS values this participation as an opportunity to interact 
with the next generation of FAA employees. This is one of the reasons 
we are determined to include diversity equity and inclusion recruitment 
in the collective bargaining agreements we are currently negotiating 
with the FAA.

    Question. How can we increase the number of flight training 
programs and aviation education programs at these institutions and make 
them more affordable to pursue?
    Answer. While PASS cannot address how to increase programs at these 
institutions, we stand ready to assist in any way possible. Our leaders 
and members participate in a wide range of industry and community 
involvement efforts. We believe that aviation education should be more 
readily available and more affordable to increase these important 
workforces. Scholarships like the ones offered by the Aero Club of 
Washington Foundation to students with an interest in aviation and 
financial need focusing on Washington, D.C. public high school students 
in one way to increase interest and affordability. This year the Aero 
Club Foundation gave out six scholarships of $5,000 each to six 
students pursuing education in flying, aircraft maintenance, 
engineering. We are also fighting to include diversity equity and 
inclusion recruitment in the collective bargaining agreements we are 
currently negotiating with the FAA.

    Skills-First Alternatives to 4 Year Degree Programs. Historically 
college degrees have served as a barrier to entry for many seeking 
career opportunity and advancement, particularly among Black and 
Hispanic populations.

    Question. Can you speak to the importance of valuing training and 
skills gleaned through work experience, apprenticeships, and targeted 
coursework as a means of expanding and diversifying the aviation talent 
pipeline?
    Answer. This is one of the reasons PASS partnered with the FAA to 
create the Gateways Internship Program which provides students the 
opportunity to join a diverse team of talented and dedicated technical 
professionals while still in school. Students receive hands-on, 
practical work experience and can learn about the national airspace 
system. These are paid internships and scholarships that allow full and 
part-time students to obtain an in-depth understanding of how the 
facilities, systems and equipment support the day to-day operations of 
the NAS. More information can be found at FAA's website: https://
www.faa.gov/jobs/students/gateways.

    Question. How can we better publicize these opportunities and 
ensure that frontline talent are being considered for multiple career 
pathways across the aviation industry beyond entry level roles?
    Answer. The aviation community as a whole needs to help publicize 
opportunities and ensure that frontline talent is being considered for 
multiple career pathways across the aviation industry and beyond just 
entry level roles. Word of mouth is not working. PASS is determined to 
include diversity equity and inclusion recruitment in the collective 
bargaining agreements we are currently negotiating with the FAA. This 
is a good first step, but not the only step.

                              David Spero
    Question 1. Mr. Spero, I want to thank you and all those that work 
to ensure our aviation system is the safest in the world. In your 
testimony you noted that FAA's current staffing model is insufficient 
and noted an IG 2021 report.
    Specifically, why does their model fall short?
    Answer. In PASS's testimony, both the technical staffing model and 
aviation safety inspector model were addressed. The union feels that 
there are issues with both models and our concerns are illustrated 
below.
    The largest PASS bargaining unit is the ATO Technical Operations 
unit, consisting of technical employees who install, maintain, repair 
and certify the radar, navigation, communication and power systems 
making up the air traffic control system.
    Within Technical Operations, PASS represents FAA airway 
transportation systems specialists, sometimes referred to more simply 
as technicians. Systems specialists ensure the functionality of 
communications systems, computer systems, navigational aids and power 
systems vital to safe air travel and the mission of pilots and 
controllers. In addition, Flight Inspection Services (FIS) 
professionals and aeronautical professionals in Mission Support 
Services (MSS) support pilots, air traffic administrative professionals 
and aviation planners through the development and maintenance of all 
public instrument flight procedures and airways.
    PASS has long called attention to not only the need for sufficient 
technical staffing but also the lack of a reliable staffing model on 
which to base staffing decisions and placement. Along with sufficient 
staffing goes sufficient training. PASS is concerned with the training 
for both current employees and new hires. New hires in these areas of 
operation undergo extensive training that can last months, if not 
years. In addition, training slowed considerably due to the pandemic, 
which delayed technical education for Technical Operations staff. While 
some online training was made available, in-person training on critical 
equipment and software that serve the National Airspace System (NAS) is 
vital. We can collaboratively develop better ways to ensure workable 
training models. Furthermore, as technicians reach retirement age, 
there aren't enough fully trained employees to step into their shoes. 
It is imperative that the agency develop a model which allows for 
sufficient training for new hires and allows more seasoned employees to 
pass along their expertise to these employees prior to retirement.
    The current FAA staffing model for technicians only addresses the 
technical employees in the field who perform preventative maintenance 
and cannot be relied upon to address staffing for other duties they 
perform. It also does not reflect the work performed by support 
personnel who are not directly interfacing with live NAS equipment and 
systems. Furthermore, the model does not take into account new hire 
training or fatigue factors. PASS does not believe that the model is a 
reliable tool for determining staffing for this workforce.
    PASS is asking that the FAA be directed to establish a Technical 
Operations Workforce Plan and consult with PASS in its creation and 
implementation. PASS believes that the abilities and skills that Tech 
Ops employees provide, if utilized and staffed properly, can provide a 
distinct improvement in the implementation of new NAS systems.
    PASS represents aviation safety inspectors and other employees 
within the FAA's Aviation Safety (AVS). Flight Standards Service (FSS) 
and Aircraft Certification Service (AIR) aviation safety inspectors are 
responsible for certification, education, oversight, surveillance and 
enforcement of the entire aviation system.
    PASS is extremely concerned about the agency's inability to 
effectively and consistently staff the FAA inspector workforce. In 
fact, according to a 2021 report by the Department of Transportation 
Inspector General (IG), an alarming 59 percent and 79 percent of 
Certificate Management Office and Flight Standards District Office 
managers, respectively, said their offices are short-staffed.\1\ Among 
the reasons cited in the IG report for understaffing are many reasons 
cited by PASS over the years. These include increasing workload, hiring 
challenges, extended hiring and training periods, and increasing 
oversight responsibility (including for the evolving UAS segment).

FAA Can Increase Its Inspector Staffing Model's Effectiveness by 
Implementing System Improvements and Maximizing Its Capabilities, 
August 11, 2021, p. 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Regarding the aviation safety inspector staffing model, PASS does 
not believe the current model effectively and consistently staffs the 
FAA inspector workforce. Understaffing of this workforce can be 
attributed to a number of factors, including increasing workload, 
hiring challenges, extended hiring and training periods, and increasing 
oversight responsibility (including for the evolving UAS segment).
    PASS is asking that the FAA be directed to revise its inspector 
staffing model in consultation with PASS. PASS is also requesting that 
the FAA increase the number of safety-critical positions in Flight 
Standards.
    In addition, PASS is currently in contract negotiations with AVS 
for a new collective bargaining agreement. This should serve as a 
perfect vehicle to promote recruiting and retention. However, it is 
regrettable that no meaningful dialogue or progress has been made in 
bargaining to address the agency's needs for recruiting and retention. 
And since the hearing, AVS announced and advertised a program to pay a 
$25,000 recruitment incentive bonus to external, entry-level ASIs, 
effective April 3, 2023, and based on requirements/guidelines that the 
agency unilaterally created. In some situations, it also includes a 
$10,000 Permanent Change of Station (PCS). We have had proposals on the 
table which address recruitment by current employees, on the job 
training incentives and retention pay since January of last year. 
Instead of bargaining over the matter, the agency is disrespecting the 
entire collective bargaining process.

    Question 2. Do you think this is a pattern of FAA's oversight?
    Answer. Related to the staffing condition in Aviation Safety (AVS), 
which include aviation safety inspectors, PASS has long been concerned 
with the FAA's oversight capabilities. Our aviation safety inspectors 
work to ensure the agency and industry are complying with all necessary 
rules and regulations. Ensuring that this work can be done in a timely 
and safe manner, with the right number of skilled FAA employees, is 
essential.
    Rather than trying to find the right number of employees for the 
ATO and AVS, PASS thinks the FAA simply staffs to the budget it is 
given. An assessment of the jobs that FAA employees perform and the 
average time it takes to complete these jobs should translate to proper 
staffing levels. The way the FAA currently performs this assessment 
does not.

    As I alluded to during the hearing, I am troubled by a number of 
trends for American aircraft maintenance workers in recent years that 
will continue if the United States doesn't change course.
    In 2018, it was reported that almost 25 percent of all heavy

increase from 2003.\1\ Much of that maintenance has been offshored to 
Latin America, but some has moved to Asia, event to China.\2\

    There is now an anticipated shortfall of between 12,000 and 18,000 
aviation maintenance workers over the next ten years.\4\ Some estimates 
peg that number at 43,000, or a 24 percent shortfall.\5\

    Question 1. What economic and public policy factors lead to the 
offshoring of the airline maintenance industry?
    Answer. PASS does not represent aircraft maintenance employees. 
However, the union is deeply concerned about FAA oversight of U.S. 
aviation offshored maintenance facilities. In fact, for decades PASS 
has been drawing attention to oversight issues of foreign facilities 
performing work on U.S. aircraft. The FAA's current enforcement 
practices incentivize offshoring aircraft mechanic jobs. U.S. airline 
mechanics are subject to drug and alcohol testing, background checks, 
certification minimums, and random inspections--all of which come with 
a cost on both the mechanic and their employer. Even though the FAA 
certifies facilities outside of the United States. with the same rights 
and privileges of those within, facilities outside of the country do 
not have to meet the same standards. This unfair structure makes it 
cheaper than it otherwise would be for airlines to offshore mechanic 
jobs onto lower safety standards.
    Since work performed overseas on U.S. aircraft cannot be guaranteed 
to the same standard as U.S.-based work, inspection of the facilities 
and those performing the work is essential. Unfortunately, this 
oversight is seriously lacking. Aviation safety inspectors represented 
by PASS are not able to do proper inspections at these facilities since 
the visits are announced in advance, which gives the facility time to 
prepare. The FAA also no longer has international field offices, making 
access to these facilities even more difficult.
    Oversight of maintenance work is critical to ensuring the work is 
performed in accordance with FAA regulations and FAA-approved aircraft 
maintenance programs. PASS believes any facility or individual 
performing work on U.S. aircraft should face the same level of 
scrutiny. We stand ready to work on improving oversight of these 
facilities.

    Question 2. Beyond the current shortage of airline mechanics, what 
other factors pose a barrier to the reshoring of the airline 
maintenance industry?
    Answer. Last year, the FAA certified 11,022 new aircraft mechanics 
and 2,515 new repairmen.\6\ At the current rate of certification, these 
13,500+ workers are more than enough to meet the Department of Labor's 
estimated 13,100 job openings per year through 2031.\7\ However, the 
industry is still extremely male dominated, with fewer the 3 percent of 
Airframe & Powerplant (A&P) certificate holders being women.\8\ 
Increasing women's participation in the mechanic workforce to just 10 
percent would create more than 24,000 new mechanics over and above the 
existing trends--more than enough workers to exceed all but the most 
extreme estimates of what the industry will need for the foreseeable 
future.

    Question 3. More than a third (35 percent) of all domestic aviation 
maintenance workers are between 55 and 64 years old. Given current 
projections, the number of retirees is too much to be offset by current 
hiring practices alone. How can we recruit the next generation of 
aircraft mechanics and engineers in the United States?
    Answer. While PASS cannot speak to the next generation of aircraft 
mechanics, we are urging members of Congress to encourage the 
recruitment and retention of FAA employees represented by PASS, 
including systems specialists and aviation safety inspectors. These 
groups of employees are also facing a large number of retirements. The 
process of hiring and training these employees is extensive. Additional 
employees must be hired immediately in order to ensure a consistent and 
reliable number of employees.
    PASS is asking that the FAA be directed to establish a Technical 
Operations Workforce Plan and consult with PASS in its creation and 
implementation. PASS believes that the abilities and skills that Tech 
Ops employees provide, if utilized and staffed properly, can provide a 
distinct improvement in the implementation of new NAS systems.
    Regarding the aviation safety inspector staffing model, PASS does 
not believe the current model effectively and consistently staffs the 
FAA inspector workforce. Understaffing of this workforce can be 
attributed to a number of factors, including increasing workload, 
hiring challenges, extended hiring and training periods, and increasing 
oversight responsibility (including for the evolving UAS segment).
    We stand ready to work with the agency on all recruitment and 
retention efforts.

  Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Marsha Blackburn to 
                            Dr. Sheree Utash
    In your testimony, you state that between 2022 and 2040, the global 
civilian aviation sector will need over 600,000 new technicians to 
support the commercial fleet over the next 20 years. You also cite a 
study by the Aeronautical Repair Station Association that found the 
technician shortage is costing the repair station industry $100 million 
per month.

    Question 1. What can we do to help encourage students, as young as 
middle school, to prepare for careers in the aviation ecosystem?
    Answer. ATEC (Aviation Technician Education Council) has a program 
that they are trying to create called Choose Aerospace. The emphasis of 
this program is to build pipelines to A&P programs with high school 
curriculum. This could be achieved if the Aviation Workforce Grants 
were increased from their current funding to that of $75-100M. This 
would provide funding for institutions like WSU Tech and Tennessee Tech 
to provide statewide opportunities for high school students to be 
exposed to careers and training in aviation while in high school. For 
middle school students we must do a better job of summer camps for 
exposure to aviation careers, Federal recognition of National 
Manufacturing Month (October), funding for youth employment programs 
and recognition of STEM careers at the elementary and middle school 
age. These endeavors could be enhanced with grant dollars from DOE, DOL 
or DOC.

    Question 2. How can tech schools, like WSU Tech and Tennessee Tech, 
collaborate on these efforts?
    Answer. Certainly, there are opportunities of best practices that 
can be shared. Tennessee and Kansas are number 14 and 17 of students by 
state with aviation programs. Both states have seen increases in number 
of students, but there continues to be a lack of awareness of jobs/
careers within the aviation industry in our states compared to the 
states that are in the top 10. A multi-state consortium grant would 
also be a way to collaborate and create progress towards filling the 
workforce needs across the Nation and in each of our states.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito to 

                            Dr. Sheree Utash
    Dr. Utash, aviation maintenance technicians are essential to our 
system. That's why I worked with my colleagues to ensure updated 
standards for part 147s that were included in the Aviation 
Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act of 2020. In your 
testimony you noted that the expansion into high schools is a great way 
to expand the reach of maintenance training.

    Can you tell us more about the ways you see this opportunity 
playing out?
    Answer. With the recent updated standards for Part 147's in the 
Aviation Certification Act WSU Tech plans to expand across the state 
with our high school program. Prior to the new standards we were unable 
to reach out to high schools that were not located within our immediate 
county. With the new standards we can now create exposure programs for 
high school students across the state and then upon graduation they can 
complete their program at our institution. We anticipate this will be a 
game changer for earlier exposure in rural areas and cities that don't 
have exposure to the aviation industry as they would in Wichita, Ks. 
Additionally, we would advocate for additional funding on the Aviation 
Workforce Grants so that we could partner effectively with high schools 
across the state and engage in ATEC's (Aviation Technician Education 
Council's) CHOOSE AEROSPACE program where the intention is to build 
pipelines to A&P programs with high school curriculum to improve 
exposure and awareness.

    Are there other opportunities from this AMTS guidance that you are 
excited about?
    Answer. We are also going to take advantage of the new guidance 
with regards to seat time and the opportunity to modernize our program 
with a hybrid model of delivery. We have re-written our program 
curriculum and just received FAA approval to move forward with this new 
delivery. This will be aligned with today's learners and gives us the 
ability to deliver our labs and classroom curriculum in ways to improve 
learning outcomes, create efficiencies and effectiveness.
