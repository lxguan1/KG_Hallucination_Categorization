            Parish, Louisiana;

    <bullet> H.R. 8206 (Rep. Franklin), To ensure that Big Cypress 
            National Preserve may not be designated as wilderness or as 
            a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, 
            and for other purposes; and

    <bullet> H.R. 8219 (Rep. Tokuda), ``Lahaina National Heritage Area

a.m. in room 1334 Longworth House Office Building.

    Member offices are requested to notify Will Rodriguez 
(Will.Rodriguez @mail.house.gov) by 4:30 p.m. on Wednesday, June 26, 
2024, if their Member intends to participate in the hearing.

I. KEY MESSAGES

    <bullet> The Republican bills on today's hearing have broad support 
            in their local communities and represent locally-led 
            efforts to promote each area's unique natural and cultural 
            resources.

    <bullet> Legislation offered by Representatives Scalise and 
            Stefanik would expand existing heritage areas to bolster 
            local economies without allowing the federal government to 
            acquire land or impose new regulations.

    <bullet> Bills offered by Representatives Hill and Franklin 
            highlight the dichotomy between conservation designations 
            with and without local support. Representative Franklin's 
            legislation would prevent the potential designation of 
            hundreds of thousands of acres of wilderness in southern 
            Florida. This proposed wilderness designation is opposed by 
            a bipartisan coalition of Members of Congress, the local 
            community, and Tribal stakeholders. In contrast, 
            Representative Hill's legislation would add new lands to 
            the existing Flatside Wilderness and is supported by a 
            broad coalition of state and local stakeholders.

III. BACKGROUND
H.R. 390 (Rep. Stefanik), ``Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley 
        National Heritage Area Enhancement Act''

    In 1984, President Reagan signed bipartisan legislation 
establishing the country's first national heritage area (NHA), which 
broadly ``recognize certain areas of the United States that tell 
nationally significant stories [and] conserve, enhance, and interpret 
those nationally significant stories and the natural, historic, scenic, 
and cultural resources of areas.'' \1\ Today, there are 62 NHAs in 36 
states that ``illustrate significant aspects of the heritage of the 
United States.'' \2\ NHAs are unique public-private partnerships that 
allow for the promotion of natural or cultural resources without 
federal management or ownership.\3\ In the typical NHA, land is not 
federally owned but is instead held by state or local governments, 
private landowners, or some combination of those groups.\4\ As such, 
NHAs are not units of the National Park System, although the National 
Park Service (NPS) may provide NHAs with financial and technical 
assistance. Because NHAs are ``lived-in landscapes,'' they are designed 
to empower locally-led approaches to resource conservation and economic 
development.\5\ To elevate grassroots-level decision-making, Congress 
frequently assigns a local coordinating entity (LCE), such as a state 
or local agency or non-profit organization, to be an NHA's lead 
management organization.\6\

    NHAs receive funding from varied sources, including private 
charities and donors, state and local governments, and federal 
appropriators.\7\ Federal funding is usually divided during the annual 
appropriations process between direct grantmaking support for 
individual NHAs and general administrative costs for the overall NHA 
program.\8\ NPS then distributes authorized federal funds to NHA 
entities, typically through the designated LCEs.\9\ In turn, the LCEs 
are generally required to match all federal funding received one-to-
one.\10\ Once distributed, federal funds can be used for locally guided 
projects, such as rehabilitating important sites, developing tours, 
establishing exhibits and programs, and improving public awareness of 
the NHA.\11\ Most NHAs are subject to an annual funding limit of $1 
million, but actual expenditures have historically tended to be lower 
than that amount.\12\

    After NHAs exploded in popularity, Congress passed the ``National 
Heritage Area Act'' (NHA Act) during the 117th Congress to formalize 
the NHA System and protect private property rights.\13\ The NHA Act 
established the National Heritage Area System, set formal criteria for 
designating NHAs, and created uniform funding and management 
standards.\14\ Through these changes, the NHA Act sought to minimize 
the differences and administrative inefficiencies that had resulted 
from creating NHAs under separate enabling acts.\15\ The NHA Act also 
set forth stringent requirements protecting private property rights and 
development activity in NHAs, ensuring that designations did not confer 
any regulatory or land use authority to the local LCE.\16\ In addition 
to NHA Act requirements, an individual NHA's enabling statute often 
includes provisions that protect the rights of existing property owners 
within the designated area and prevent any federal land 
acquisitions.\17\

    Established in 1996, the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley 
National Heritage Area (Hudson River Valley NHA) was among the earliest 
NHAs to be designated by Congress.\18\ Following the Hudson River for 
154 miles of its course through New York state, the Hudson River Valley 
NHA encompasses 10 counties, 250 communities, and approximately 3 
million acres of diverse geography, woods, and farmland.\19\ From north 
to south, the Hudson River Valley NHA extends from the confluence of 
the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers near Albany down to the northern suburbs 
of New York City.\20\ This vast region contains 107 distinct heritage 
sites, reflecting the Hudson River Valley's natural, historic, and 
cultural contributions to the nation.\21\ This includes sites related 
to the American Revolutionary War, Civil War, and Underground 
Railroad.\22\

    Recognizing the vital importance of this region to the national 
story, H.R. 390, the ``Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National 
Heritage Area Enhancement Act,'' would expand the boundaries of the 
Hudson River Valley NHA to include all of Saratoga and Washington 
Counties. Large portions of these counties are already within the 
Hudson NHA, and this legislation would bring the federal boundaries of 
the NHA in line with the state's boundaries.\23\ H.R. 390 would help 
enhance the interpretation of the Hudson River Valley NHA and expand 
opportunities for Saratoga and Washington Counties to attract more 
tourism and support local economic development.\24\ This bipartisan 
bill is led by Representatives Elise Stefanik (R-NY) Paul Tonko (D-
NY).\25\

H.R. 3971 (Rep. Hill), ``Flatside Wilderness Additions Act''

    The Ouachita National Forest (ONF) is the oldest and largest 
national forest in the southern United States, spreading across nearly 
1.8 million acres in Arkansas and Oklahoma.\26\ The U.S. Forest Service 
(USFS) manages the ONF for a variety of uses, including timber 
harvesting, wildlife habitat conservation, outdoor recreation, and 
resource protection.\27\ The ONF's large expanses of hickory and pine 
draw an estimated 670,000 visitors annually.\28\ Congress has 
designated six wilderness areas within the ONF, which account for 
little more than 65,000 acres, or a mere 3.6 percent of the ONF's total 
area.\29\ This includes the 9,507-acre Flatside Wilderness area near 
the ONF's eastern boundary.\30\ The Flatside Wilderness contains 
portions of the 223-mile Ouachita National Recreation Trail and ``a 
popular, 1,550-foot-high rock outcropping called Flatside Pinnacle that 
overlooks the Ouachita Mountains.'' \31\

H.R. 6826 (Rep. Mfume), To designate the visitor and education center 
        at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine as the 
        Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education Center.

    H.R. 6826 would name the visitor and education center at Fort 
McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine (Fort McHenry) in 
Baltimore, Maryland, as the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education 
Center.'' Fort McHenry is known as the site of the 1814 attack by 
British troops against 1,000 American soldiers, a battle which inspired 
Francis Scott Key to write the Star-Spangled Banner.\36\ The Honorable 
Paul S. Sarbanes served the State of Maryland in the House of 
Representatives for six years and in the U.S. Senate for three decades. 
During his tenure, Senator Sarbanes helped secure funding for 
constructing the new visitor center at Fort McHenry, increasing 
capacity and visitor access.\37\ Naming the visitor and education 
center at Fort McHenry would honor Senator Sarbanes's long history of 
service to Maryland and his connection with the Fort McHenry site. This 
bipartisan legislation is cosponsored by the entire Maryland 
Congressional delegation.

H.R. 6843 (Rep. Scalise), To expand the boundaries of the Atchafalaya 
        National Heritage Area to include Lafourche Parish, Louisiana.

    In 2006, Congress established the Atchafalaya National Heritage 
Area (ANHA), encompassing 14 parishes in Louisiana to promote the 
``local cuisine, music, traditions, language, and cultural landscapes 
of the Atchafalaya Basin in south central Louisiana.'' \38\ The 
Atchafalaya is the nation's largest river swamp, containing almost one 
million acres of vibrant bottomland hardwoods, swamps, bayous, and 
backwater lakes.\39\ The area features a diverse range of physical 
resources, such as ancient live oaks, towering cypress, sugarcane, and 
cotton.\40\ The region is also home to a diverse population of people 
of European, African, Caribbean, and Native American descent that 
collectively contribute to the area's widely recognized ``Cajun 
Culture.'' \41\ By promoting heritage development and ecotourism, the 
ANHA offers amenities for residents and visitors that highlight the 
region's varied culture and physical resources while contributing to 
the local economy.\42\ Through the ANHA, projects have been funded to 
build kayak launches and install new signage along the Mississippi 
River that promotes the area's heritage.\43\ H.R. 6843 would expand the 
boundaries of the ANHA to include Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. By 
expanding ANHA to include Lafourche Parish, H.R. 6843 aims to enhance 
the interpretation of Louisiana's diverse heritage while creating jobs 
and celebrating the region's rich natural and cultural resources.

Atchafalaya National Heritage Area Report, NHA.

H.R. 8206 (Franklin), To ensure that Big Cypress National Preserve may 
        not be designated as wilderness or as a component of the 
        National Wilderness Preservation System, and for other 
        purposes.

    In 1974, Congress created the 729,000-acre Big Cypress National 
Preserve (Big Cypress) in southern Florida as the nation's first 
national preserve.\44\ At the time, Big Cypress was ``a new land 
management concept'' designed to facilitate compromise in land uses 
after significant controversy erupted over the proposed construction of 
an airport.\45\ To avoid the stifling land-use restrictions and lack of 
access characterized by other land designations, such as wilderness 
areas, Congress created Big Cypress with explicit protections for 
certain specified activities.\46\ Foremost among these are the 
traditional and customary uses of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of 
Florida and Seminole Tribe of Florida.\47\ Protected tribal activities 
include using timber to build traditional shelters, called 
``chickees,'' harvesting plants, and sustainably hunting wildlife.\48\ 
Other specified uses of Big Cypress include the exercise of existing 
private property rights, operating off-road vehicles, conducting 
limited oil and gas exploration, grazing cattle, and hunting.\49\

    Despite these popular and enduring comprises, the unique nature of 
Big Cypress is now under threat from the Biden administration. In 
August 2022, NPS released a planning document entitled ``Big Cypress 
National Preserve Supplemental Draft Backcountry Access Plan/ 
Wilderness Study/Environmental Impact Statement,'' which contemplates 
creating a new wilderness designation within Big Cypress.\50\ While 
NPS's ``preferred option'' for planning would designate about 25 
percent of the preserve as wilderness, the 2022 document concludes that 
roughly 43 percent of Big Cypress is eligible for a wilderness 
designation.\51\ While the exact percentages vary, each of the NPS's 
three plans for Big Cypress would create a new wilderness area within 
the preserve.\52\

    NPS's plans to designate portions of Big Cypress as wilderness have 
drawn stiff opposition due to concerns the designation would limit 
access for the public and outdoor recreationalists, disrupt invasive 
species eradication work, and impinge upon traditional Tribal 
practices.\53\ In particular, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of 
Florida expressed significant concerns the wilderness designation would 
limit the ability of Tribal members to access Big Cypress and visit 15 
historic cultural sites and numerous active ceremonial grounds. In a 
letter to NPS, Chairman Cypress wrote: ``Rather than imposing arbitrary 
lines on a map to keep our people out, the [National Park Service] 
would be well-served exporting to its other parks Big Cypress's 
capacity for multiple uses, freedom of access, and respect for 
Indigenous rights.'' \54\ Bipartisan Members of Florida's Congressional 
delegation also wrote a letter to Secretary Haaland expressing concerns 
on behalf of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and 
Florida Department of Environmental Protection that a wilderness 
designation would harm the ability to address more than 900 non-native 
plant and animal species in the preserve, including pythons.\55\ In 
response, Representative Scott Franklin (R-FL) introduced H.R. 8206, 
bipartisan legislation that would prevent any part of Big Cypress from 
being designated as a wilderness area.\56\ This legislation would 
ensure Big Cypress continues to provide important benefits to outdoor 
recreation communities, achieve diverse conservation goals, and remain 
undisturbed as a sacred site to the Miccosukee and Seminole Tribes.

H.R. 8219 (Rep. Tokuda), ``Lahaina National Heritage Area Act''

    The town of Lahaina, located in Maui County, Hawaii, has a rich and 
storied history. The former capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom under King 
Kamehameha I and his successors from 1820 to 1845, Lahaina was 
historically an economic and tourism hub with incalculable cultural and 
historic significance for the people of Hawaii.\57\ The downtown 
Lahaina Historic District held numerous cultural sites, including the 
Lahaina Jodo Mission (a Buddhist temple), Pioneer Inn (the oldest hotel 
in Lahaina), Waiola Church, and Old Courthouse.\58\ Lahaina is also 
famous for its 150-year-old Banyan Tree, considered the largest in the 
country, which remains at the center of town.\59\ Unfortunately, on 
August 8, 2023, a wildland fire catastrophically damaged Lahaina and 
became the deadliest wildfire in over a century.\60\ The scenic 
waterfront, including much of the city center that served as a symbol 
of the town's illustrious history, was left unrecognizable. Ultimately, 
the fire destroyed more than 2,200 structures and caused approximately 
$5.5 billion in damages.\61\ Many of the damaged and destroyed 
structures lost dated back centuries and held immeasurable value to 
Lahaina's people and culture.

    As the town continues to recover from the trauma of a devastating 
natural disaster, local leaders have been exploring options that would 
allow the community to honor its past while promoting its natural and 
cultural resources post-fire. H.R. 8219 would require the Secretary of 
the Interior, in consultation with state and local partners, to study 
the suitability and feasibility of designating the town of Lahaina as 
an NHA. A feasibility study is generally the first step of an NHA 
designation and ensures that the designated area meets the appropriate 
criteria. Under the NHA Act, studies must assess whether an area's 
resources reflect aspects of American heritage, whether an area would 
benefit from public-private management, and which entities would be 
capable of working together to support the proposed heritage area.\62\

STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM TIFFANY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS 
                  FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

    Mr. Tiffany. Today's hearing includes several pieces of 
legislation that recognize the importance of local communities 
in Federal decision making. As Chairman of this Subcommittee, I 
have worked tirelessly to ensure the perspectives of local 
communities are included in both the decision-making process 
and the subsequent management of our Federal lands. Our work 
has shone a light on the need for Federal land management 
agencies to meet their requirements to coordinate, not just 
consult, with local partners.
    Why is this so important? Because the rural communities 
located closest to our Federal lands are typically their best 
stewards. Their residents have an unrivaled interest in 
ensuring that nearby public lands are properly managed for 
generations to come.
    One of the bills we will be considering today, 
Representative Franklin's bipartisan H.R. 8206, embodies this 
ethic by preventing an unpopular wilderness designation from 
being established in Big Cypress National Preserve in Florida.
    Fifty years ago, a group of local stakeholders, including 
tribes, conservationists, and sportsmen and women, came 
together to create the nation's first national preserve with 
Big Cypress. This new model reflected the unique needs of the 
community, and has proven to be a lasting compromise that 
balances multiple uses of the land, including outdoor 
recreation, tribal practices, and environmental protection. 
That balance is now in jeopardy, due to the Biden 
administration's efforts to designate one-quarter of the 
preserve as a wilderness area.
    In a letter to the National Park Service, one of our 
witnesses here today, Chairman Cypress of the Miccosukee Tribe 
of Indians of Florida, stated, ``Rather than imposing arbitrary 
lines on a map to keep our people out, the National Park 
Service would be well served exporting to its other parks Big 
Cypress' capacity for multiple uses, freedom of access, and 
respect for Indigenous rights.''
    I could not agree more with this sentiment. We have heard 
time and time again from this Administration that they value 
tribal voices and consult with tribal communities. Yet, from 
Alaska to Florida, coast to coast, it is clear that this 
Administration is only interested in listening to tribes when 
it is convenient for them. It is high time for Federal land 
managers to respect multiple uses of our public lands, and 
access for the American public to those lands. And Federal land 
managers who continually fail to coordinate with local 
officials and members of the community will face the 
repercussions of those decisions in this Committee.
    While I have legitimate concerns about certain components 
of the legislation on today's agenda, I do want to thank all of 
today's bill sponsors for working on their respective pieces of 
legislation, and I look forward to hearing their perspective 
throughout the hearing.
    We will also hear about two bills being led by 
Representatives Scalise and Stefanik that expand existing 
National Heritage Areas.
    Representative Scalise's bill adds the Lafourche Parish to 
the National Heritage Area that was established in 2006 by 
including the Lafourche Parish, which was omitted from the 
original designation. The region will be able to offer 
additional programs highlighting the unique Cajun culture and 
history that have made southern Louisiana famous around the 
world.
    Representative Stefanik's bill expands the boundaries of 
the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area to include all 
of Saratoga and Washington Counties. This boundary will put the 
National Heritage Area in line with state maps, and provide 
more tools to promote the region to tourists who visit the 
area.
    Additionally, we are considering a bill sponsored by 
Representative Tokuda. The Lahaina National Heritage Area Act 
requires the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability 
and feasibility of designating the Town of Lahaina as a 
National Heritage Area.
    Last August, I visited Lahaina and witnessed the utter 
devastation left by a wildfire that destroyed 2,200 structures 
and caused approximately $5.5 billion in damages. As the 
community rebuilds from this tragic event, I look forward to 
hearing how the National Park Service plans to work with local 
officials to honor and protect this town's rich and storied 
history.
    While National Heritage Areas are managed locally and not 
federally owned, we must ensure that the planning process does 
not impede private property rights or restrict responsible 
development. Only then can these designations be supportable.
    I want to thank Members on both sides of the dais for their 
work on today's bills.
    I also want to express my appreciation to the witnesses who 
have traveled long distances to offer their expert testimony.
    With that, I now recognize the Ranking Member, who is not 
in attendance at this point. We will move on.
    I will now recognize the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Hill, 
to share with us information in regards to H.R. 3971.
    You are recognized, sir.

   STATEMENT OF THE HON. J. FRENCH HILL, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARKANSAS

    Mr. Hill. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the time this 
morning. I thank you and my good friend from Arkansas, the 
Chairman of the Full Committee, Bruce Westerman, for working 
with me and including the Flatside Wilderness Additions Act to 
this hearing.
    As a ninth-generation Arkansan and a lifelong outdoorsman, 
I have enjoyed many extraordinary natural places across our 
state throughout my life. From hiking, to hunting, to camping, 
to canoeing as a boy, those were critical years, and ingrained 
the ethos of a critical objective of conserving our resources 
and preserving our natural habitat.
    Throughout my nearly decade in Congress, I have worked 
tirelessly to support our natural landscape, expand 
recreational outdoor opportunities in the 2nd Congressional 
District of Arkansas for both Arkansans and the many millions 
of visitors to our state. This morning, I would like to share a 
story with you, a story that goes back to the 98th Congress, 
back in 1984.
    On a cold, snowy day four decades ago, in the winter of 
1983, I had the pleasure of visiting a remarkable corner of the 
rugged Arkansas Ouachita National Forest. The Ouachita 
stretched west from my district all the way to eastern 
Oklahoma. That day, I climbed a very sharp sandstone top called 
Flatside for the first time, that lends its name to this area. 
Efforts to protect Flatside and expand the recreation in the 
area began with my predecessor, Congressman Ed Bethune, who 
worked to add Flatside to the proposed Arkansas Wilderness Act 
that Congress.
    At that time, I was a staffer on the Senate Banking 
Committee, working for John Tower of Texas. Through my 
connection to the outdoors in Arkansas, I persuaded Senator 
Tower to co-sponsor the Senate version of Ed Bethune's bill, 
Senator Dale Bumpers' bill, which was in fact signed into law 
in October 1984 by President Reagan. That bill created Flatside 
Wilderness, which is located in Perry and Saline Counties.
    When I came to Congress in 2015, I started working on 
strategies to enhance Flatside, and was successful in adding 
640 acres to the western edge of the wilderness area when my 
bill, the Flatside Wilderness Enhancement Act, was signed into 
law by President Trump in 2019.
    Following that success, John Boozman, our senior Senator, 
and I worked on a study by the U.S. Forest Service to see if 
additional lands adjacent to Flatside were eligible for 
inclusion in the area. That study was completed in the summer 
of 2021, and recommended the study areas contained in this bill 
for wilderness designation. These proposed additions were among 
those originally proposed back in 1984 that were not included 
in the original Act, and are currently managed by the Forest 
Service as potential wilderness in accordance with the Ouachita 
National Forest Management Plan.
    After working with Chairman Westerman, his team, and 
Chairman Tiffany over the last 2 years, I introduced the 
Flatside Wilderness Additions Act last June. This bill would 
add approximately 2,200 U.S. National Forest acres to Flatside 
Wilderness. The bill would be the second and final iteration to 
expand the wilderness area at Flatside.
    Flatside is a beautiful area of the natural state, noted 
for its ridges and summits that are part of the Ouachita 
Mountains and rise above the forest to provide visitors with 
amazing views. The wilderness houses multiple creeks, 
tributaries, and waterfalls that provide an important source of 
life to the area, and includes, importantly and interestingly, 
a 9-mile section of the 223-mile-long Ouachita National 
Recreation Trail.
    My work to expand Flatside has been complemented by the 
efforts of the state to grow and expand our outdoor recreation 
in many ways. Related work was in June 2021. Then-Governor Asa 
Hutchinson and I reached an agreement with the Ouachita 
National Forest to transfer operation of their Lake Sylvia 
Recreation Area to the state of Arkansas. It is now part of the 
Arkansas State Park system, opening up this beautiful area in 
the Ouachita to campers and visitors on an all-year-long 
operation.
    My legislation, Mr. Chairman, is fully supported by our 
state's conservation and outdoor recreation advocates. 
Additionally, the leadership of our state supports it, with 
formal letters of support from Governor Sarah Sanders; the 
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission; the Arkansas Department of 
Parks, Heritage, and Tourism; and our local Perry County judge.
    There is something really special about hiking, camping, 
and hunting deep in the back country of our state that feels 
like it has gone untouched by human hands. Finishing the 
expansion of the wilderness area at Flatside will bring more 
opportunities for both Arkansans and the many visitors to our 
state to explore more of our natural qualities.
    I am grateful for Chairman Tiffany's work. I appreciate the 
Committee's consideration of H.R. 3971, and I hope today's 
testimony can help progress this bill along the way to 
enactment.
    With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Representative Hill. And now I 
believe we are going to move on to our second panel.
    Let me remind the witnesses that under Committee Rules, you 
must limit your oral statement to 5 minutes, but your entire 
statement will appear in the hearing record.
    To begin your testimony, please press the ``on'' button on 
the microphone.
    We use timing lights. When you begin, the light will turn 
green. At the end of 5 minutes, the light will turn red, and I 
will ask you to please complete your statement.
    First of all, thank you for your patience this morning, and 
being here in a timely basis while I was not.
    First, I would like to introduce Ms. Joy Beasley, Associate 
Director for Cultural Resources, Partnerships and Science at 
the National Park Service.
    Associate Director Beasley, you are recognized for 5 
minutes.

    STATEMENT OF JOY BEASLEY, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, CULTURAL 
 RESOURCES, PARTNERSHIPS, AND SCIENCE, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, 
           DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, WASHINGTON, DC

    Ms. Beasley. Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and 
members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to 
present the views of the Department of the Interior on five 
bills on today's agenda. I would like to submit our full 
statement for the record, and summarize the Department's views.
    Two bills would expand the boundaries of National Heritage 
Areas. H.R. 390 would expand Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River 
Valley National Heritage Area to include Saratoga and 
Washington Counties in New York. H.R. 6843 would expand 
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area to include Lafourche Parish 
in Louisiana.
    The Department recognizes that there could be potential 
benefits to expanding these National Heritage Areas, but 
recommends that the Committee defer action on the bills until 
such time as the National Park Service determines if each 
proposed boundary addition is appropriate. The National Park 
Service recommends that the local coordinating entity for each 
National Heritage Area submit a justification for the 
respective boundary additions, and to document that there is 
local public support for the expansion.
    H.R. 6826 would designate the visitor center at Fort 
McHenry National Monument and National Shrine as the Paul S. 
Sarbanes Visitor and Education Center. Senator Sarbanes was a 
champion of Fort McHenry throughout his long career. He helped 
to promote the fort's objectives of commemorating the Battle of 
Baltimore, while facilitating public enjoyment and 
understanding of the historic events and people connected to 
the site.
    The National Park Service generally discourages naming of 
park features, except when there is a compelling justification 
and when at least 5 years have elapsed since the death of the 
person. However, we recognize that Congress may also 
specifically authorize the placement of such recognition, and 
in this instance the Department defers to Congress and does not 
object to H.R. 6826.
    H.R. 8206 would prohibit Big Cypress National Preserve from 
being designated as wilderness, or as a component of the 
National Wilderness Preservation System. The Department opposes 
H.R. 8206.
    This bill appears to be intended to pre-empt any proposal 
from the Administration or any congressional decision to enact 
a wilderness designation within the Preserve. If Congress does 
not wish to designate wilderness in the Preserve, it can 
achieve that goal by not acting on any legislation designating 
wilderness within the Preserve, as only Congress can designate 
wilderness.
    Additionally, the National Park Service has not recommended 
wilderness in this area, and therefore this legislation is 
unnecessary.
    The establishment of the Preserve remains a remarkable 
example of unity and compromise among diverse stakeholders, 
including local conservationists, government representatives, 
outdoor recreationists, environmental advocates, and the 
Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and the Seminole Tribe of Florida. 
The law designated the Preserve as a unit of the National Park 
System, ensured protection of resources, while simultaneously 
providing for hunting, fishing, off-road vehicle use, private 
camp ownership, and traditional use and occupancy rights for 
Native American tribes.
    The NPS remains committed to working with stakeholders, 
local and state officials, and tribes on all issues of concern 
within the Preserve.
    H.R. 8219 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to 
conduct a study to assess the suitability and feasibility of 
designating a Lahaina National Heritage Area. The Department 
supports H.R. 8219, with amendments.
    Lahaina has a rich history, and was the capital of the 
Kingdom of Hawaii from 1820 to 1845. Tragically, in August of 
last year, the area was struck by one of the deadliest 
wildfires in U.S. history. Several Department bureaus were part 
of immediate response efforts, including staff from Haleakala 
National Park. The Department, the National Park Service, and 
Haleakala National Park will continue to support the long-term 
recovery efforts of the Maui community.
    We would like to work with the sponsor and the Committee on 
an amendment that would identify a local organization to serve 
as the NHA management entity. Identification of a local 
management entity would indicate on-the-ground support and 
capacity for engaging in the NHA feasibility study process.
    We also recommend an amendment that would require 
consultation with Native Hawaiian organizations and the Native 
Hawaiian community, state and municipal government entities, 
and the local community on the appropriate timing for 
initiating the study so as not to interfere with ongoing 
recovery efforts.
    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, this concludes my 
statement. I would be happy to answer any questions you or 
other members of the Subcommittee may have. Thank you.

    [The prepared statement of Ms. Beasley follows:]
    Prepared Statement of Joy Beasley, Associate Director, Cultural 
                 Resources, Partnerships, and Science,
         National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior
      on H.R. 390, H.R. 6826, H.R. 6843, H.R. 8206, and H.R. 8219

                                H.R. 390

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the 
Department of the Interior on H.R. 390, the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson 
River Valley National Heritage Area Enhancement Act.
    The Department recognizes that there could be potential benefits in 
expanding the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage 
Area (NHA), but recommends that the committee defer action on H.R. 390 
until such time as the National Park Service (NPS) determines if this 
proposed expansion is appropriate.
    H.R. 390 would expand the boundary of the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson 
River Valley NHA to include Saratoga and Washington Counties in the 
State of New York. Both counties are located within the Champlain 
Valley National Heritage Partnership, and portions of both counties are 
within the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor.
    The Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area 
NHA was authorized in 1996, to help preserve, protect, and interpret 
the history and resources of the Hudson River Valley. The region played 
an important role in the American Revolution and gave birth to 
significant developments in American art and architecture. It was 
important in the iron and textile industries and housed the first 
women's labor union and secondary school. The NHA includes National 
Historic Sites, National Historic Landmarks, New York State Parks, and 
over 1,000 sites listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
The Hudson River Valley Greenway (Greenway) is the management entity 
for the NHA and is comprised of the Hudson River Valley Greenway 
Communities Council and the Greenway Conservancy for the Hudson River 
Valley.
    Prior to beginning any effort to designate an area as a national 
heritage area, the NPS recommends that a feasibility study be conducted 
to assess several factors, including: whether the landscape has an 
assemblage of natural, cultural, historic and scenic resources that, 
when linked together, tell a nationally important story; whether an 
organization exists with the financial and organizational capacity to 
coordinate heritage area activities; and whether there is significant 
support for designation within the region.
    A 1996 special resource study was conducted of 10 counties along 
the Hudson River. It found that the area's resources were nationally 
significant and provided insight into the effect of natural landscapes 
on settlement, commercial and industrial growth, and into the 
development of our national political and cultural identity. The study 
found that the area, which had demonstrated successful partnership 
management, qualified as a national heritage area. The NPS recommends 
that the Greenway submit an addendum to the study that includes a 
boundary justification for the inclusion of Saratoga and Washington 
Counties. The addendum would document that the Greenway has reached out 
to the affected communities and that there is public support for the 
inclusion of their counties in the boundary of the NHA. Additionally, 
the addendum will demonstrate that the proposed inclusion of the 
counties supports the original intent of the NHA.
    Once the Greenway completes the study addendum, the NPS will 
undertake its evaluation. The NPS recommends that the committee defer 
action on H.R. 390 until the study addendum is completed and the NPS 
can make a determination on the proposed expansion.

                               H.R. 6826

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the 
Department of the Interior on H.R. 6826, which would designate the 
visitor and education center at Fort McHenry National Monument and 
National Shrine the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education Center''.
    The visitor and education center is located at Fort McHenry 
National Monument and Historic Shrine in Baltimore, Maryland, just 
outside the fort's primary historic area, and is accessed from its main 
entrance on East Fort Avenue. The visitor and education center serves 
as the first contact station for visitors entering the park and offers 
an orientation film and exhibits regarding the Battle of Baltimore and 
the history of the ``Star-Spangled Banner.'' Fort McHenry National 
Monument and Historic Shrine is also one of the key sites on the Star 
Spangled Banner National Historic Trail.
    Senator Sarbanes was a tireless champion of preserving Fort Mc 
Henry throughout his long career. In so many different ways, he helped 
to promote the fort's chief objectives of commemorating the events of 
the Battle of Baltimore while facilitating public enjoyment and 
understanding of the historic events and people connected with the 
site. Over decades, the Senator secured millions of dollars in federal 
funds to enable critical repairs to the fort's deteriorating seawall, 
masonry, and foundations, ensuring the site would be safe to visit for 
generations to come. He also envisioned Fort McHenry's inclusion in the 
Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail, championing legislation 
to study and eventually create a National Trail to highlight the 
British burning of the White House and Capitol in Washington, DC, the 
Battle of Baltimore, and the bombing of Fort McHenry, which inspired 
Francis Scott Key's composition of ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
    Senator Sarbanes also worked to elevate the history of the War of 
1812 in the national consciousness by introducing federal legislation 
to commemorate the war's bicentennial. Through his service as Vice-
Chair of the Maryland War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission from 2007 to 
2015, the Senator helped improve and protect relevant historic sites 
like Fort McHenry and coordinated public and private events to 
celebrate the anniversary. Finally, in the 2000s, the Senator was 
integral in securing the funds that enabled the construction of a new 
visitor and education center at the fort, replacing the old visitor 
center from the 1960s with an ADA- compliant building that today 
welcomes hundreds of thousands of visitors a year as they learn about 
one of the defining moments in our nation's history.
    H.R. 6826 would designate the visitor and education center at Fort 
McHenry National Monument and National Shrine as the ``Paul S. Sarbanes 
Visitor and Education Center.'' The NPS generally discourages the 
naming of park features except when there is a compelling justification 
and at least five years have elapsed since the death of the person. 
However, we recognize that Congress may also specifically authorize the 
placement of such recognition. In this instance, the Department defers 
to Congress and does not object to H.R. 6826.

                               H.R. 6843

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the 
Department of the Interior on H.R. 6843, a bill to expand the 
boundaries of the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area to include 
Lafourche Parish, Louisiana.
    The Department recognizes that there could be potential benefits in 
expanding the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area (NHA), but recommends 
that the committee defer action on H.R. 6843 until such time as the 
National Park Service (NPS) determines if this proposed expansion is 
appropriate.
    H.R. 6843 would expand the boundary of the Atchafalaya NHA to 
include Lafourche Parish and would add one member to the Atchafalaya 
Trace Commission. The NHA was authorized in 2006, to help preserve the 
local cuisine, music, traditions, language, and cultural landscapes of 
the Atchafalaya Basin in south central Louisiana. The area is among the 
most culturally rich and ecologically varied regions in the United 
States, home to the widely recognized Cajun culture as well as a 
diverse population of European, African, Caribbean and Native-American 
descent. The NHA includes a part of Jean Lafitte National Historical 
Park, Lake Fausse Pointe State Park, Cypremort Point State Park, a part 
of Natchez Trace Parkway and National Scenic Trail, and the Atchafalaya 
Water Heritage Trail. The Atchafalaya Trace Commission was authorized 
as the management entity of the NHA and is composed of 14 members 
appointed by the governing authority of each parish within the heritage 
area.
    Prior to beginning any effort to designate an area as a national 
heritage area, the NPS recommends that a feasibility study be conducted 
to assess several factors, including: whether the landscape has an 
assemblage of natural, cultural, historic and scenic resources that, 
when linked together, tell a nationally important story; whether an 
organization exists with the financial and organizational capacity to 
coordinate heritage area activities; and whether there is significant 
support for designation within the region.
    A 1998 special resource study found the Atchafalaya Basin to be an 
outstanding example of a natural resource, possessed exceptional value 
in illustrating and interpreting many key natural and cultural themes 
of our nation's heritage, and offered exceptional opportunities for 
recreation, public use and enjoyment, and scientific study. The NPS 
recommends that the Commission submit an addendum to the study that 
includes a boundary justification for the inclusion of Lafourche 
Parish. The addendum would document that the Commission has reached out 
to the affected communities and that there is public support for the 
inclusion of their parish in the boundary of the NHA. Additionally, the 
addendum will demonstrate that the proposed inclusion of the parish 
supports the original intent of the NHA.
    Once the Commission completes the study addendum, the NPS will 
undertake its evaluation. The NPS recommends that the committee defer 
action on H.R. 6843 until the study addendum is completed and the NPS 
can make a determination on the proposed expansion.

                               H.R. 8206

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the Department 
of the Interior's views on H.R. 8206, a bill to ensure that Big Cypress 
National Preserve may not be designated as wilderness or a component of 
the National Wilderness Preservation System, and for other purposes.
    The Department opposes H.R. 8206.
    H.R. 8206 would prohibit Big Cypress National Preserve (Preserve) 
from being designated as wilderness or a component of the National 
Wilderness Preservation System. The bill appears to be intended to 
preempt any proposal from the Administration, or any Congressional 
decision, to enact a wilderness designation within the Preserve. If 
Congress does not want to designate wilderness in the Preserve, it can 
achieve that goal by not acting on any legislation designating 
wilderness within the Preserve, as only Congress can designate 
wilderness. Additionally, the National Park Service has not recommended 
wilderness in this area. Therefore, this legislation is unnecessary.
    The historical establishment of the Preserve remains a remarkable 
example of unity and compromise among diverse stakeholders, including 
local conservationists, government representatives, outdoor 
recreationists, environmental advocates, and the Miccosukee Tribe of 
Indians and Seminole Tribe of Florida. In the 1960s, these groups 
united to protect the Big Cypress Swamp from a major jetport 
development that posed a threat to the area's invaluable natural and 
cultural assets. Their collective efforts led to the establishment of 
the Preserve, our nation's first national preserve, in 1974. The law 
designating the Preserve as a unit of the National Park System ensured 
protection of these resources while simultaneously providing diverse 
public land uses, including hunting, fishing, off road vehicle use, 
private camp ownership, and traditional use and occupancy rights for 
Native American Tribes. The NPS remains committed to working with 
stakeholders, local and state officials, and Tribes--the Miccosukee 
Tribe of Indians and the Seminole Tribe of Florida--on all issues of 
concern within the Preserve.

                               H.R. 8219

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the 
Department of the Interior on H.R. 8219, a bill to require the 
Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to assess the suitability 
and feasibility of designating certain land as the Lahaina National 
Heritage Area, and for other purposes.
    The Department supports H.R. 8219 with amendments.
    H.R. 8219 would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct 
a study, in consultation with appropriate State and local entities, to 
assess the suitability and feasibility of designating an area in Maui 
County, Hawai'i as the Lahaina National Heritage Area. The study area 
would encompass the boundaries of the census-designated place of 
Lahaina. The study would gather information to help determine whether 
the area contains an assemblage of natural, historic, and cultural 
resources that represent distinctive aspects of the heritage of the 
United States; is worthy of recognition, conservation, interpretation, 
and continuing use; and would be best managed through partnerships 
among public and private entities. The study would include public 
engagement and be conducted in consultation with the various 
stakeholders in the area.
    The Lahaina census-designated place, located on the northwest coast 
of Maui, encompasses Lahaina town, Ka'anapali and Kapalua beaches, and 
the lower slopes of the West Maui mountains. Lahaina has a rich history 
and was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawai'i from 1820 to 1845. The 
Lahaina Historic District, which encompasses downtown Lahaina, Front 
Street, and its vicinity, was designated a National Historic Landmark 
in 1962. Tragically, in August 2023, the area was struck by one of the 
deadliest wildfires in U.S. history. The fire destroyed approximately 
80% of Lahaina, and over 100 people lost their lives. Several 
Department bureaus were part of immediate response efforts, including 
staff from Haleakala National Park. The fires directly impacted 
National Park Service employees, and several have familial and 
community ties to the Lahaina area. The Department, the National Park 
Service, and Haleakala National Park will continue to support the long-
term recovery efforts of the Maui community.
    We would like to work with the sponsor and the Committee on an 
amendment that would identify a local organization in the legislation 
that would serve as a national heritage area management entity. 
Identification of a potential local management entity would indicate 
on-the-ground support and capacity for engaging in the national 
heritage area feasibility study process. We also recommend an amendment 
that would explicitly require consultation with State and local 
historic preservation officers, State and local historical societies, 
State and local tourism offices, and other appropriate organizations 
and governmental entities, on the appropriate timing for initiating the 
study so as not to interfere with ongoing recovery efforts.

    Chairman Tiffany, this concludes my testimony. I would be happy to 
answer any questions you or other members of the subcommittee may have.

                                 ______
                                 

    Questions Submitted for the Record to Ms. Joy Beasley, Associate
 Director--Cultural Resources, Partnerships, and Science, National Park
                Service, U.S. Department of the Interior

Ms. Beasley did not submit responses to the Committee by the 
appropriate deadline for inclusion in the printed record.

            Questions Submitted by Representative Westerman

    Question 1. Regarding H.R. 8219, how does the National Park Service 
plan to accommodate ongoing efforts to rebuild Lahaina as it conducts a 
study to determine whether this area should be designated as a National 
Heritage Area?

    Question 2. Will the National Park Service commit to not 
designating any portion of the Big Cypress National Preserve as a 
wilderness area or wilderness study area? If no, why not?

    Question 3. Will the National Park Service commit to consulting 
with Tribes prior to managing any area in the Big Cypress National 
Preserve for potential inclusion in the National Wilderness 
Preservation System?

    Question 4. How has the National Heritage Area Act impacted the 
administration of National Heritage Areas?

    Question 5. How many times has the National Park Service spoken to 
the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida to discuss the implications 
of turning portions of the Big Cypress National Preserve into a 
wilderness area?

    Question 6. How many times has the National Park Service spoken to 
the Seminole Tribe of Florida to discuss the implications of turning 
portions of the Big Cypress National Preserve into a wilderness area?

    Question 7. In your testimony, you recommended that prior to 
expanding two existing National Heritage Areas in Louisiana and New 
York, the National Park Service first complete studies of these 
expansions. How long does the National Park Service expect these 
studies will take to complete?

    Question 8. What process is involved in putting together studies to 
expand existing National Heritage Areas, and how do they incorporate 
feedback from the local community?

    Question 9. How would H.R. 390 improve ongoing planning efforts to 
commemorate America's upcoming 250th anniversary?

    Question 10. In your testimony, you stated that ``The Department, 
the National Park Service, and Haleakal? National Park will continue to 
support the long-term recovery efforts of the Maui community.'' Can you

    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Associate Director Beasley, for 
your testimony.
    Votes have been called, and we will be heading to the 
Floor. I would guess we are going to be on break here for about 
an hour, because we do have quite a few amendment votes that 
are going to be done in this series. So, there will be a 
significant break here.
    And once again, we really appreciate your patience in 
helping us with this, because we really do look forward to your 
testimony on these bills.
    The Subcommittee stands in recess, subject to the call of 
the Chair.

    Dr. Gosar [presiding]. I want to thank Representative 
Scalise, and I will now recognize Representative Mfume for 5

    STATEMENT OF THE HON. KWEISI MFUME, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MARYLAND

    Mr. Mfume. Thank you, Chairman Gosar, and to Ranking Member 
Neguse in his absence for hosting this legislative hearing, and 
including my bipartisan bill, H.R. 6826, which honors the 
former long-standing U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland by 
designating the Visitor and Education Center at Fort McHenry 
National Monument and Historic Shrine as the Paul S. Sarbanes 
Visitor and Education Center.
    Fort McHenry, the National Monument and Historic Shrine, is 
a unit of the National Park Service, and it resides in the 
heart of my congressional district in Baltimore. As most of us 
know, the fort was the site of the Battle of Baltimore in 1814, 
which inspired Francis Scott Key to write the words to the 
Star-Spangled Banner. Each year, hundreds of thousands of 
people visit the fort to engage in outdoor recreation and to 
learn more about one of the most defining moments of our 
nation's history.
    The late Senator Sarbanes was a champion of Fort McHenry, 
and he firmly believed that the site is critical to 
understanding and appreciating our national heritage and our 
national identity. Throughout his career, the Senator worked 
tirelessly to facilitate public enjoyment and real 
understanding of the historic events and the people who are 
still connected with that site.
    Senator Sarbanes, as many of us will note, was a true 
American patriot. He secured millions of dollars in Federal 
funds to enable critical repairs to the fort's deteriorating 
seawall, its masonry, and its foundations, and he worked for 
the construction of a new visitor center. He also introduced 
numerous bipartisan bills that eventually established the Star-
Spangled Banner National Historic Trail as the 26th such trail 
in our nation.
    As we know, Congress may at any time authorize placement of 
a commemorative work, such as naming the Center in cases where 
there is a compelling justification for the recognition that 
would permanently express the noteworthy and nationally 
relevant association between both the person and the site. I 
believe, Mr. Chair, such is the case in this instance, and 
passing H.R. 6826 would be both a fitting tribute to the 
Senator's memory, and an appropriate acknowledgment of his 
connection to and advocacy for this site, the state, and the 
nation.
    And I would ask and seek, Mr. Chair, our unanimous consent 
that the Friends of Fort McHenry, which is the organization 
that has been there forever supporting it, sent a letter in to 
this Committee and to our delegation in enthusiastic support 
for this bill, and with unanimous consent I would offer it for 
the record.
    Dr. Gosar. Without objection, so ordered.

Re: Friends of Fort McHenry--Support for the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor 
        and Education Center''

    Dear Members of the Maryland Congressional Delegation:

    We write today to express our enthusiastic support for a proposed 
effort to name the visitor and education center at Fort McHenry in 
memory of the late Senator Paul S. Sarbanes. With our stewardship role 
at Fort McHenry, we were honored to have Senator Sarbanes as a tireless 
champion of the fort throughout his long career. In so many different 
ways, he helped to promote the fort's chief objectives of commemorating 
the events of the Battle of Baltimore while facilitating public 
enjoyment and understanding of the historic events and people connected 
with the site. For all these reasons, we urge you to advance 
legislation to designate the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education 
Center'' at Fort McHenry.
    Senator Sarbanes' legacy of public service can be felt across the 
country, but nowhere is it stronger than at Fort McHenry, which he 
often described as his favorite national park. The Senator considered 
the site to be one of the great public gathering places in our state--a 
guardian of our national heritage and a key recreational and 
environmental resource for the residents of Baltimore.
    Over decades, the Senator secured millions of dollars in federal 
funds to enable critical repairs to the fort's deteriorating seawall, 
masonry, and foundations, ensuring the site will be safe to visit for 
generations to come. He also envisioned Fort McHenry's inclusion in the 
Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail, championing legislation 
to study and eventually create a National Trail to highlight the 
British burning of the White House and Capitol in Washington, DC, the 
Battle of Baltimore, and the bombing of Fort McHenry, which inspired 
Francis Scott Key's composition of ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
    Senator Sarbanes also worked to elevate the history of the War of 
1812 in the national consciousness by introducing federal legislation 
to commemorate the war's bicentennial. Through his service as Vice-
Chair of the Maryland War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission from 2007 to 
2015, the Senator helped improve and protect relevant historic sites 
like Fort McHenry and coordinate public and private events to celebrate 
the anniversary. Finally, in the 2000's, the Senator was integral in 
securing the funds that enabled construction of a new visitor and 
education center at the fort, replacing the old visitor center from the 
1960's with an ADA-compliant building that today welcomes hundreds of 
thousands of visitors a year as they learn about one of the defining 
moments in our nation's history.
    The Board of the Friends of Fort McHenry, a non-profit organization 
dedicated to ensuring the widest possible appreciation of Fort 
McHenry's enduring legacy and the fort's survival as an ``historic 
shrine'' for future generations of Americans, is very grateful that 
Senator Sarbanes so steadfastly shared our passion and goals for the 
fort. We wholeheartedly believe that designating the fort's welcome 
center as the ``Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education Center'' would 
be a fitting tribute to the Senator's life and career and serve as a 
permanent expression of his close association with the fort.

            Best,

                                                Patty Dowd,
                                                           Director

                                 ______
                                 

    Dr. Gosar. Does the gentleman yield back?
    Mr. Mfume. I do, Mr. Chair, I am sorry. Thank you for being 
so gracious, and allowing me to waive on to this Committee. I 
appreciate it.
    Dr. Gosar. We are happy to have you.
    Mr. Mfume. Thank you.
    Dr. Gosar. Always a smiling face. I now recognize 
Representative Franklin for 5 minutes.

   STATEMENT OF THE HON. SCOTT FRANKLIN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA

    Mr. Franklin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate 
your attention to this important matter that affects the Big 
Cypress National Preserve and many constituents in my district. 
I also thank you for your Committee's willingness to consider 
my bipartisan bill, H.R. 8206, which would protect this 
preserve from Federal Government overreach in the Miccosukee 
Tribe's access to their sacred lands.
    Before I go any further, I would like to take a brief 
moment to welcome Talbert Cypress, Chief of the Miccosukee 
Tribe, serving as our witness today. Chairman Cypress grew up 
on the reservation, and understands better than anyone the 
adverse effect a wilderness designation would have on the 
preserve and the Miccosukees' way of life. He has also been a 
great partner, and I am pleased others will have the pleasure 
of hearing from him today.
    In the 1960s, plans emerged for the construction of an 
airport in the heart of the Everglades. This project promised 
to spur further commercial development that threatened Big 
Cypress. In a compromise effort to protect their region, 
conservationists, environmentalists, tribes, and gladesmen 
teamed up to lobby Congress, and the result was our nation's 
first national preserve, the Big Cypress National Preserve, 
authorized by Congress in 1974. Representative James Haley from 
my state was integral in that process.
    Upon designation of the Big Cypress, Congress provided the 
National Park Service with the authority to study the 
wilderness suitability of the lands. This study was completed 
in 1979, and concluded that there was no wilderness-suitable 
acreage in the Big Cypress National Preserve, but NPS vowed to 
restudy the preserve in the future, and in 2006 they began that 
process. They released the findings publicly in the Big Cypress 
National Preserve supplemental draft in August 2022, which 
proposed that Congress could designate as much as 32 percent of 
the Preserve as wilderness, the operative word being ``could 
designate.''
    The ambiguity in the statute, though, that the land could 
be eligible for wilderness designation has led the Park Service 
to begin managing these areas in what they like to refer to as 
the ``little W wilderness'' in the interim, as though Congress 
had authorized that, which is not the case. Currently, they are 
managing approximately 148,000 acres of land, which is 25 
percent of the Preserve, as wilderness.
    And a wilderness designation sounds like a beneficial thing 
until you really start to look into the details. This 
qualification creates burdensome restrictions on Federal land, 
including no inhabitants, no permanent structures, and no 
motorized vehicles whatsoever. And due to the size and 
geography of Big Cypress, which is essentially the size of the 
state of Rhode Island, limiting traffic there means the 
Miccosukee Tribe won't have access to their sacred burial 
sites, hunters won't be able to help manage Florida's ongoing 
invasive python invasion, and gladesmen who have used the land 
for generations will have their access to the land severely 
restricted.
    And my bill, H.R. 8206, would release lands in the Big 
Cypress National Preserve from further wilderness 
consideration. If the Department of the Interior decides to 
move forward with proposing wilderness at Big Cypress, it will 
be against the will of not only the Miccosukee Tribe, but also 
the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the Florida 
Fish and Wildlife Commission, and Hendry and Collier Counties, 
in which the Preserve is within their boundaries.
    Executive overreach like this is why many Americans are 
frustrated with the Federal Government. The Supreme Court seems 
poised to scale back, or even return some of that authority to 
Congress as it is looking at the Chevron deference case, and I 
hope they do. Congress will be required to reclaim its Title I 
authority and do the job it was always intended to do under the 
Constitution. It will require all of us to be clearer and more 
precise in the laws we write, and it will also expose the 
absurd ways the Federal Government has exploited ambiguity or 
wiggle room in statute to satisfy their own agendas, and much 
of that has come at the expense of Americans. More legislation 
like this will be necessary to clarify congressional intent and 
agency authority, and I am fairly certain Congress never 
intended the Park Service to have that level of authority to 
manage Big Cypress as a wilderness without express approval of 
Congress.
    As an avid outdoorsman, I appreciate the need to strike a 
balance between conservation and public access. And in Florida, 
we know that often the best way to protect our state's natural 
beauty is to leave it in the care of those who have been 
charged with preserving it for generations. Agency decisions 
should respect the will of Congress while benefiting our 
cherished lands and the public's trust.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

    Dr. Gosar. I thank you, Representative Franklin. I now 
recognize Representative Tokuda for her 5 minutes.

   STATEMENT OF THE HON. JILL N. TOKUDA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN 
               CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF HAWAII

    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you. Chair, members of the Federal Lands 
Subcommittee, thank you for including H.R. 8219, my Lahaina 
National Heritage Area Act, in today's hearing, and mahalo for 
the opportunity to speak in support of this important bill.
    To Subcommittee Chair Tiffany, I want to thank him 
personally for joining Chairman Westerman and other members of 
this Committee in coming out to Lahaina in the immediate 
aftermath of the fires to see the destruction firsthand and 
offer words of support and comfort to our grieving community.
    On August 8, 2023, Lahaina experienced a devastating 
wildfire that destroyed the entire town and claimed the lives 
of 102 members of our community. In just a single day, 
centuries of history and culture were reduced to ashes, causing 
significant physical damage and emotional trauma that will be 
felt in Lahaina, on Maui, and throughout our entire state of 
Hawaii for generations to come.
    As we approach the 1-year anniversary of the fire, debris 
cleanup continues and thousands of survivors remain in short-
term housing, many scattered across our islands and even the 
continent, focused on rebuilding their lives. It is at this 
moment in time that we reflect on how to honor the people and 
places lost, and support our community in its recovery.
    While this tragedy will be felt by our Hawaii ohana for 
generations, it compels us to reflect on Lahaina's rich 
cultural history and environmental beauty, elements that the 
wildfire could never destroy. While Lahaina has been known 
worldwide as a premier tourist destination, it holds a deeper 
historical, cultural, and ecological significance that predates 
its modern reputation. Lele, or Lahaina, as it has become 
known, has always been a place of immense historical and 
cultural importance, serving as the capital of the Kingdom of 
Hawaii and the birthplace and home to many ali'i. As we look to 
rebuild, it is about grounding this place in the history and 
heritage from which it came.
    Of the 62 National Heritage Areas in the United States, 
none are in Hawaii. I can think of no better place to designate 
as Hawaii's first National Heritage Area than Lahaina. This is 
why I am proud to introduce the Lahaina National Heritage Area 
Act, which would direct the National Park Service, in 
consultation with state and local partners, to study the 
suitability and feasibility of this designation for Lahaina. 
Designating Lahaina as a National Heritage Area would 
complement and sustain community-driven efforts being led by 
lineal descendants and local leaders to preserve Lele's rich 
history, tradition, and culture for future generations.
    While I am humbled to introduce this bill, the idea and 
effort to recognize and protect this special place comes from 
those who have called Lahaina home for generations. During my 
visits to Lahaina following the fires, it has become customary 
to end my visits at Malauulu, once the home of King Kamehameha 
the Third, and then walk over to the birthing stones in Lahaina 
Harbor. Conversations held here with lineal descendants like 
Archie Kalepa and Keeaumoku Kapu allowed us to imagine a future 
where Moku'ula and Mokuhinia are restored, and Kihawahine is 
finally returned to her home in Lahaina.
    In recognizing the significance of this bill and its 
sensitivity to survivors, I have personally spoken with 
Governor Josh Green, Mayor Richard Bissen, and local cultural 
practitioners. All support this bill and would be key to its 
execution when passed. And I would like to ask unanimous 
consent to enter their written testimonies into the record.
    Dr. Gosar. Without objection, so ordered.

                        Statement for the Record
                       Honorable Josh Green, M.D.
                    Governor of the State of Hawai'i
       Statement on H.R. 8219--Lahaina National Heritage Area Act

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, Members of the 
Subcommittee:

    Mahalo for the opportunity to submit testimony on H.R. 8219, the 
Lahaina National Heritage Area Act. I write to you in my capacity as 
the Governor of the State of Hawai'i.
    On August 8, 2023, strong easterly winds caused by Hurricane Dora 
to the south of the State of Hawai'i strengthened various wildfires 
across the Counties of Maui and Hawai'i. The wildfire that began in the 
western part of Maui Island decimated the town of Lahaina and is the 
deadliest wildfire in U.S. history in the last 100 years. As of today, 
the incident has resulted in 101 fatalities; billions of dollars are 
estimated to have been lost to properties, facilities, and 
infrastructure. Hundreds of businesses were destroyed, and hazardous 
environmental conditions were created as a result of the fires.
    This act would help to provide cultural significance and ensure the 
preservation of important sites as we continue to work to rebuild 
Lahaina and restore its heritage.
    We greatly appreciate the subcommittee's time and attention to this 
matter. Beginning the process of a heritage designation through a 
feasibility study by the Department of the Interior would provide an 
important step in recognition for the people and history of our state.
    I would like to commend Congresswoman Tokuda for her time and 
dedication for Lahaina's recovery. I am grateful that this legislation 
was introduced by her.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide support for this 
meaningful piece of legislation. My administration stands ready to 
support the Department of the Interior with the feasibility study and 
will continue to work with the County of Maui, Mayor Bissen, and 
Congresswoman Tokuda for the people of the State of Hawai'i and 
Lahaina.

                                 ______
                                 
                        Statement for the Record
                         Richard T. Bissen, Jr.
                         Mayor, County of Maui
       Statement on H.R. 8219--Lahaina National Heritage Area Act

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking MemberNeguse, members of the 
subcommittee:

    Thank you for allowing me to submit a statement on behalf of H.R. 
8219, the Lahaina National Heritage Area Act. My name is Richard T. 
Bissen, Jr. and I have been Mayor of Maui County since January 2023. 
Prior to becoming mayor, I grew up, went to school, worked as a 
prosecutor and judge on Maui and have called it home for many years.
    Eight months after taking office, the town of Lahaina on the island 
of Maui endured unspeakable tragedy. On August 8, 2023, wildfires 
spread so quickly across Lahaina that some people were unable to 
evacuate. Many others barely made it out or managed to survive, homes 
and businesses were destroyed.
    In total, 101 people died from the fires. Our beloved Front Street, 
home to local businesses and a centerpiece of the memories of many who 
have visited our island, is no longer recognizable. So much of what we 
had is now gone, but we have started to recover and figure out what it 
will take to rebuild and restore Lahaina for its new future.
    One thing the fires could not take away is the historic and 
cultural importance of Lahaina. Lahaina was once the capital city of 
the Kingdom of Hawaii and served as the center of government for 50 
years. Lahaina served as the residence of King Kamehameha I for decades 
and was where kings and queens were buried. Its harbor was the 
cornerstone of whaling and fishing for the Hawaiian Islands. Lahaina 
also served as the location for so many firsts, such as the first high 
school west of the Rocky Mountains and the first lit navigation tower.
    I can think of no better place to be the first National Heritage 
Area in the State of Hawaii.
    This designation would provide critical assistance to bring back 
important sites and help highlight the cultural significance of so many 
locations throughout Lahaina. This will not only help us in our efforts 
to rebuild and bring back Lahaina, but it is also a clear testament to 
Lahaina's rich heritage and a recognition of its importance to our 
people, our history, and to Hawaii.
    H.R. 8219, the Lahaina National Heritage Area Act would begin the 
process of this designation by initiating a feasibility study to be 
conducted by the Department of Interior. If this designation is 
approved in the future, the County of Maui stands ready to administer 
and support accordingly. I wholeheartedly support its passage and thank 
Congresswoman Tokuda for her all her time and attention toward 
Lahaina's recovery and for introducing this legislation.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of H.R. 8219. I 
look forward to the advancement of this bill and I am happy to answer 
any questions the subcommittee may have.

                                 ______
                                 

                        Statement for the Record
                          Mr. Ke`eaumoku Kapu
  Cultural Program Coordinator, Na`Aikane o Maui Community Foundation
       Statement on H.R. 8219--Lahaina National Heritage Area Act

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, members of the 
subcommittee:

    My name is Ke'eaumoku Kapu, a lifelong Native Hawaiian cultural 
practitioner and the cultural program coordinator at the Na`Aikane o 
Maui Community Foundation. Since 2011, our organization has been 
dedicated to helping guide Lahaina's future generations with our 
traditional knowledge and practices.
    I also serve as chair of the Native Hawaiian Historic Preservation 
Council of the State of Hawai'i's Office of Hawaiian Affairs. Our role 
is to perpetuate the cultural identity of Native Hawaiian people 
through responsible stewardship of our traditions, practices, values, 
and cultural and historic resources.
    West Maui has been the ancestral home of my family for generations. 
To the hills east of Lahaina lies the Kaua'ula Valley in which you can 
find the plot of land that my ancestors were awarded in the Great 
Mahele, which introduced private property ownership to Hawai'i for the 
first time in our history. Doing so separated many Native Hawaiians 
from the ancestral lands they lived on, including my own family. 
Reclaiming this land where my family and I now live has been a decades-
long journey, but it shows how deeply we are tied as a people to the 
`aina.
    That is why I am proud to testify in support of Representative Jill 
Tokuda's bill, H.R. 8219, the Lahaina National Heritage Area Act. For 
kanaka maoli like me whose ties to West Maui span generations, Lahaina 
has long been a spiritual and cultural capital for our people, even as 
it was transformed from wetlands into sugar plantations and then into 
the famous tourist hub it was for most of my life.
    The fires last August changed everything. Our Na`Aikane o Maui 
Cultural Center on Front Street was among the thousands of buildings we 
lost. With it, hundreds of artifacts documenting the history of our 
people were lost, including traditional feathered capes, historical 
maps, and old land deeds that could have helped other Native Hawaiian 
families reclaim their ancestral lands.
    Despite all this loss, the work of Na`Aikane o Maui in protecting 
our culture and traditions will not cease. We will rebuild and continue 
our work. In the meantime, I have been focused on supporting our local 
people and serving as a cultural advisor to our federal and state 
relief and recovery efforts.
    The fires have given us a new opportunity to rebuild and restore 
Lahaina in a way that reflects its rich history and cultural heritage. 
The community has rallied around the restoration of Moku`ula, a sacred 
island once surrounded by the freshwater pond Loko o Mokuhinia and 
formerly the site of King Kamehameha Ill's royal palace, that has long 
been buried.
    Establishing a National Heritage Area for Lahaina would go a long 
way in supporting the community's efforts to preserve and protect this 
place that is central to our history and culture, especially after the 
fires last August. There is already a community-driven effort to 
accomplish this, and the National Heritage Area designation would help 
tell the important stories that Lahaina has to share with the rest of 
Hawai'i, the United States, and the world.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide written testimony in 
support of H.R. 8219. I would be pleased to answer any additional 
questions the subcommittee may have on this bill.

                                 ______
                                 

    Ms. Tokuda. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    I want to also thank them for their testimony and support 
of this designation.
    I also would like to thank my colleagues who co-sponsored 
this bill, especially members of this Natural Resources 
Committee, including Ranking Member Neguse and Congressmen 
LaMalfa, Huffman, Sablan, and Case. Your support is deeply 
appreciated. Mahalo.
    Lastly, I want to thank the National Park Service, which 
has truly created a first-of-its-kind national model for 
cultural consultation throughout the cleanup and recovery 
process in Lahaina. The steps they have taken to meaningfully 
engage with the local Native Hawaiian community and incorporate 
the community's traditional practices in their plans has given 
me confidence in their ability to effectively implement this 
study with the kind of respect and honor that Native Hawaiians 
and other Indigenous people deserve.
    I hope this bill is the very first step in ensuring that 
Lahaina finally gets the recognition that she has long 
deserved. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I yield back.

    Dr. Gosar. I thank the gentlelady. I will now recognize the 
Chairman of Miccosukee Tribe of the Indians of Florida.
    Chairman Cypress, you have 5 minutes. Thank you.

  STATEMENT OF THE HON. TALBERT CYPRESS, CHAIRMAN, MICCOSUKEE 
          TRIBE OF INDIANS OF FLORIDA, MIAMI, FLORIDA

    Mr. Cypress. Good morning, Chair, Ranking Member, and 
members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to 
appear before you today. I am Talbert Cypress, Chairman of the 
Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the federally 
recognized tribe in the heart of the Everglades and Big Cypress 
National Preserve. I appreciate the opportunity today to 
discuss the importance of the Big Cypress National Preserve to 
the Miccosukee people, and how wilderness designations in the 
Preserve threaten our way of life.
    The Miccosukee Tribe supports H.R. 8206, which would 
prevent the Big Cypress National Preserve from being designated 
as wilderness. The impact of wilderness designations too often 
is to dispossess Native people of their lands in the name of 
conservation. That is because the Wilderness Act is designed to 
prevent occupancy, permanent improvements, or mechanized 
vehicle usage on designated lands. As a result, Natives still 
living on traditional lands have been removed, harassed, and 
convicted of crimes related to their traditional practices 
under the Wilderness Act.
    The Wilderness Act must not be applied to the Big Cypress 
National Preserve, ever. By preventing a wilderness designation 
we can ensure that Big Cypress will continue to serve the 
purposes for which it was created, with Indigenous inhabitants 
to steward its lands, access for the public to experience its 
abundance and beauty, and effective management of invasive and 
exotic species.
    Big Cypress is home to the Miccosukee and Seminole people. 
There are 15 remaining traditional Miccosukee and Seminole 
villages in Big Cypress National Preserve, as well as several 
ceremonial grounds, burial grounds, and gathering sites in 
every park unit within the Preserve. We live in Big Cypress, 
and our ancestors fought and died there. They are buried there. 
The Big Cypress is a part of us, and we are a part of it.
    Our ancestors taught us and we teach our children that it 
is the duty of every Miccosukee to preserve and protect our 
lands. To that end, we are involved in multiple projects to 
protect, preserve, and restore our ancestral lands. We are 
finally in the driver's seat, and our voice is at the center of 
Everglades restoration. By placing a legal obstacle between 
tribes and their rights to use and occupy ancestral lands, the 
government will pose an impossible choice: complying with 
restrictions that impede our ability to use and manage our 
ancestral lands, or risk prosecution and incarceration.
    Application of the Wilderness Act to the Big Cypress can 
prevent motorized access by Miccosukee tribal members to their 
ancestral lands, large gatherings at our sacred ceremonial 
grounds in the Big Cypress, and can prevent adequate management 
of the invasive pythons and tree species that threaten the 
ecosystems within the Big Cypress.
    More fundamentally, a wilderness designation hinders our 
ability to influence the management of these lands and 
threatens to obstruct our traditional religious observance and 
way of life. Our children will not be able to enjoy the fruits 
of their ancestral lands, they will not see her beauty up 
close, we will not be able to harvest our medicine, we will not 
be able to bury our dead traditionally. Our annual religious 
ceremonies will only continue on Federal lands if we violate 
Federal law. That is injustice, and does not reflect the 
highest ideals of the United States in the 21st century of 
fulfilling promises made to sovereign tribes.
    The Big Cypress is the sacred land of the Miccosukee. This 
is our home and our responsibility. Don't just force regulation 
and designations on my people. Follow our lead, permit us to 
guide you to the right path forward in the Big Cypress, our 
home. Through all of this, I am still optimistic that the 
Tribe, Congress, and the Park Service can do what is right for 
the Everglades and our sacred land. But designating or 
proposing to designate any part of the Big Cypress as 
wilderness is not the answer.
    I truly appreciate the opportunity to address this 
Subcommittee and thank you for your support that you have shown 
to tribes and their sovereignty. I look forward to any 
questions you may have.

Prepared Statement of Talbert H. Cypress, Chairman, Miccosukee Tribe of 
                           Indians of Florida
                              on H.R. 8206

    Good morning, Chair Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and members of 
the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you 
today. I am Talbert H. Cypress, Chairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of 
Indians of Florida, a federally-recognized tribe located in the heart 
of the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve. I appreciate the 
opportunity to discuss the importance of the Big Cypress National 
Preserve to the Miccosukee people and how wilderness designations in 
this Preserve would fundamentally alter our way of life.
    The views expressed herein are those of the Miccosukee Tribe, a 
sovereign tribe recognized pursuant to the Indian Reorganization Act of 
1934.
    We support H.R. 8206, which would prevent Big Cypress National 
Preserve from being designated as wilderness. While wilderness 
designations are in theory designed as conservation tools, they have 
developed a troubling history with respect to their impact on 
Indigenous peoples. Wilderness designations have plagued Indian Country 
ever since the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. The impact of 
wilderness designations, too often, is to dispossess native people of 
their lands in the name of conservation. That is because the Wilderness 
Act is designed to prevent occupancy, permanent improvements, or 
mechanized vehicle usage on designated lands. As a result, Natives 
still living on traditional lands have been removed, harassed, and 
convicted of crimes related to their traditional practices under the 
Wilderness Act. Big Cypress National Preserve is one of the few places 
in the nation where Tribal rights reserved by treaty or statute are in 
conflict with a proposed wilderness designation.
    The Tribe supports H.R. 8206, which would prevent the Wilderness 
Act from being applied in the Big Cypress. The Wilderness Act must not 
be applied to the Big Cypress National Preserve, ever. Big Cypress, 
occupying an area larger than the State of Rhode Island, was created as 
the nation's first multi-use preserve. Congress's intent was to allow 
for uses that would be prohibited in typical National Parks. The 
essential reasons for creating a multi-use Preserve are in complete 
tension with the limited uses allowed in wilderness areas. By 
preventing a wilderness designation, we can ensure that Big Cypress 
will continue to be serve the purposes for which it was created, with 
indigenous inhabitants to steward its lands; access for the public to 
experience its abundance and beauty; and effective management of 
invasive and exotic species.
Big Cypress is home for Native American People

    There are 15 remaining traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages 
in Big Cypress National Preserve, as well as several ceremonial 
grounds, burial grounds and gathering sites in every park unit within 
the Preserve. We live here. Our ancestors fought and died here. They 
are buried here. The Big Cypress is part of us and we are a part of it. 
The 1974 Enabling Legislation of Big Cypress National Preserve 
recognizes this history, providing that ``members of the Miccosukee 
Tribe of Indians of Florida and members of the Seminole Tribe of 
Florida shall be permitted, subject to reasonable regulations 
established by the Secretary, to continue their usual and customary use 
and occupancy of Federal or federally acquired lands and waters within 
the preserve and the Addition, including hunting, fishing, and trapping 
on a subsistence basis and traditional tribal ceremonials.'' Public Law 
93-440 (Oct. 11, 1974).
    Our ancestors determined that it is the duty of every tribal member 
to preserve and protect our lands. To that end, we are leading or 
partnered on multiple projects to protect, preserve, and restore our 
ancestral lands. We are negotiating a co-management agreement with the 
National Park Service so that we can police the entire Preserve, 
protect it from poachers and polluters, and provide support for the 
enforcement of Preserve regulations. We are also working with the Army 
Corps of Engineers to rehydrate the Western Everglades, including parts 
of the Big Cypress National Preserve through the Comprehensive 
Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). We are finally in the driver's 
seat.
    Now, the National Park Service is proposing a 147,000-192,000-acre 
wilderness designation on top of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians and 
Seminole Tribe of Florida's reserved rights within Big Cypress National 
Preserve. We have been forced to gather the support of several other 
tribes and Native non-profits to oppose this taking of tribal rights. 
Nevertheless, we fear that the National Park Service is now awaiting an 
opportune political moment to utilize the Wilderness Act to erode 
Miccosukee tribal sovereignty.
Miccosukee have seen this before

    It should come as no surprise that the Miccosukee experience with 
federal policy surrounding our homelands has been, historically, 
negative and rife with prejudice. For example, a 99,000-acre 
reservation in Monroe County, granted to the Miccosukee, was revoked 
when Everglades National Park was created. The Tribe no longer has 
hunting and fishing rights within Everglades National Park and must get 
permission to access historic tree islands within the Park for 
religious, cultural, or burial purposes. In Everglades National Park, 
we rely on the charity and good grace of the federal government. We 
understand and appreciate the trust responsibility that continues to be 
honored, but we are cognizant of the fact that shifts in society, 
policy, the law of the land, or even a new Superintendent can threaten 
our way of life.
    This is what is at stake in Big Cypress for Miccosukee. This is 
what a Wilderness Designation can affect. Wilderness is a threat to 
tribal sovereignty because the plain language of the statute prohibits 
``permanent improvement,'' human habitation, and requires the federal 
government to make ``the imprint of man's work substantially 
unnoticeable.'' The Miccosukee experience tells us that we shape the 
land, we live within it, and we should make it better with our lives 
for future generations.
    This is why we see the Wilderness Act's statutory framework as 
being in direct conflict with our way of life: instead of relying on 
tribal knowledge and resources to ensure that land can continue to be 
managed and used in accordance with the traditional ways, a wilderness 
designation seeks to separate land from its Indigenous stewards.
Wilderness isn't always good for tribes or for conservation: Examples 
        of Legal Conflicts in other Park Units

    Placing a legal obstacle between tribes and their rights to use and 
occupy ancestral lands means that tribal members face an impossible 
choice: complying with restrictions that impede their ability to use 
and manage their ancestral lands, or risking prosecution.
    This isn't just conjecture. Federal courts have grappled with these 
very issues before, and the rulings have not come down in favor of 
tribes. Federal courts have created a ``minimum requirements test'' 
that has a very narrow allowance for any deviation from the black 
letter standards of the Wilderness Act. In United States v. Gotchnik, 
222 F.3d 506 (8th Cir. 2000), two members of the Bois Forte Band of 
Chippewa Indians were prosecuted for using motorized vehicles to cross 
wilderness areas to exercise their treaty-protected rights to tribal 
fishing waters. They were tried and convicted.
    Relatedly, wilderness designations have in some cases been used by 
environmental groups as tools to prevent agencies from taking actions 
to save species or adequately manage invasive species. In Wilderness 
Watch v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife, 629 F.3d 1024 (9th Cir. 2010), the 
U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service built two water tanks on Wilderness lands 
to help save the Bighorn Sheep population from severe drought in Kofa 
National Wildlife Refuge. The Ninth Circuit rejected the adequacy of 
the Service's analysis and deemed the tanks in potential violation of 
the Wilderness Act without further justification by the Service.
    Negotiations or accords do not reliably yield adequate 
accommodations for tribes when attempted. The Ramah District of Navajo 
Nation entered into an agreement with the Bureau of Land Management to 
access their ancestral lands at El Malpais National Conservation Area 
attempting to comply with the minimum requirements test set by federal 
courts related to wilderness lands. This agreement allowed tribal 
citizens to use a vehicle on the outer perimeter of the area but 
limited the times of year for potential access, prohibited large 
gatherings of tribal citizens, and required permission from Bureau of 
Land Management staff to access their ancestral lands. The federal land 
manager reported that the Ramah Navajo did not request access to El 
Malpais for their ceremonies for 12 years after this narrow and 
restrictive agreement was reached.\1\

Wilderness designation applied to the Big Cypress threatens all of 
        these harms to Miccosukee and the environment

    There have been assurances from the National Park Service and from 
the administration that their application of the Wilderness Act would 
not affect tribal rights to use and occupancy guaranteed to the 
Miccosukee and Seminole Tribe in the Big Cypress enacting legislation. 
But the National Park Service's policies on wilderness state that 
special management protocols start early in the process of considering 
an area for designation as wilderness. According to National Park 
Service Director Order #41, ``[t]hroughout the study process, eligible 
lands continue to be managed to preserve their eligibility for 
designation by protecting their wilderness character,'' and we would 
anticipate that this policy would support many more restrictions on 
tribal activity in Big Cypress than are in place today in order to 
create the conditions required for a wilderness designation.
    We fear that application of the Wilderness Act to the Big Cypress 
would prevent motorized access by Miccosukee tribal members to their 
ancestral lands. We fear that wilderness will prevent continued large 
gatherings at our sacred ceremonial grounds in the Big Cypress. We fear 
that wilderness will prevent adequate management of the invasive 
pythons that permeate Big Cypress wetlands and hammocks. We fear that 
wilderness will prevent the Miccosukee, the State of Florida, and 
federal agencies from addressing invasive and exotic flora (e.g. 
Brazilian Pepper, Melaleuca) which covered more than half the Preserve 
in the 1990s and have only been pushed back by mechanical means, 
resulting in an altered ecosystem within the Big Cypress and thwarting 
the progress made to stop their spread over the last 50 years.
    More fundamentally, our concern with a wilderness designation is 
that it hinders our ability to influence management of these lands, and 
threatens to obstruct our traditional religious observance and way of 
life. Our children will not be able to enjoy the fruits of their 
ancestral lands. They will not see her beauty up close; we will not be 
able to harvest our medicine, and we will not be able to bury our dead 
traditionally. Our annual religious festivals will only continue on 
federal lands if we violate federal law. That is injustice and does not 
reflect the highest ideals of the United States in the 21st century of 
fulfilling promises made to sovereign tribes.

This is the sacred land of the Miccosukee, this is our home, this is 
our responsibility. Don't just force regulation and designations on my 
people, follow our lead. Permit us to guide you to the right path 
forward in the Big Cypress.
Conclusion

    I am optimistic that the Tribe, Congress, and the Park Service can 
continue to do what's right for our Mother Everglades and our sacred 
land, the Big Cypress. But designating, or proposing to designate, any 
part of the Big Cypress as wilderness is not the right answer.
    I truly appreciate the opportunity to address this Subcommittee and 
thank you for the support you have shown to tribes and their 
sovereignty. I look forward to any questions you may have.

    Dr. Gosar. Thank you very much, Chairman Cypress. I now 
recognize Justin Lemoine, the Executive Director of the, I am 
going to try to get this right, Atchafalaya National Heritage 
Area.
    Mr. Lemoine, you now have 5 minutes.

 STATEMENT OF JUSTIN LEMOINE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ATCHAFALAYA 
         NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA, BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA

    Mr. Lemoine. Good morning, members of the Subcommittee. My 
name is Justin Lemoine. I am the Executive Director of the 
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area.
    I want to thank Congressman Scalise for introducing H.R. 
6843, and for his ongoing support of our heritage area program.
    I am respectfully submitting this testimony to support 
expanding the boundaries of the Atchafalaya National Heritage 
Area to include Lafourche Parish.
    Lafourche Parish leadership approached our staff in 2021 
with the desire to expand the boundary of our heritage area to 
include their parish, as it was not included in the original 
2006 legislation. Lafourche is the only parish through which 
Bayou Lafourche flows that is not included in the heritage 
area. Bayou Lafourche represents the eastern boundary of the 
historic Atchafalaya Basin. This effort is supported by 
Lafourche Parish Government; Nicholls State University; our 
governing body, the Atchafalaya Trace Commission; the Louisiana 
Landowners Association; the office of Lieutenant Governor Billy 
Nungesser; many private entities, community groups, and all of 
the cities and towns within the parish.
    Our program is housed within the Louisiana Department of 
Culture, Recreation, and Tourism, and works closely with the 
Offices of Tourism, Parks, and Cultural Development. We also 
work very closely with the State's Coastal Protection and 
Restoration Authority, Louisiana Economic Development, the 
Department of Education, the National Park Service, public 
universities, and many local municipalities throughout our 14 
parishes.
    Our work annually leverages the Federal investment at well 
above the one-to-one required match. The program provides 
technical and financial assistance to local communities, and 
helps to lead efforts related to cultural interpretation, 
environmental stewardship, recreation enhancement, historic 
preservation, and strengthening the region's identity. Our 14 
parishes in south central Louisiana began at the confluence of 
the Mississippi and Red Rivers, where 41 percent of the waters 
in North America drain. From there, the Atchafalaya winds south 
through the Acadiana region, paralleling the Mississippi River 
as it heads to the Gulf of Mexico. Like the Atchafalaya River, 
Bayou Lafourche is also a tributary of the Mississippi River.
    The heritage area is comprised of four regions: the upper; 
the area between two rivers; the Bayou Teche Corridor; and 
finally, the coastal region. If this legislation is passed, 
Lafourche Parish will join the parishes of Saint Mary, 
Assumption, Terrebonne, and the coastal region. Lafourche 
covers most of the length of Bayou Lafourche, and abuts 
immediately Ascension and Terrebonne Parishes and the Gulf of 
Mexico. It was originally the northern part of Lafourche 
Interior Parish which consisted of the present-day parishes of 
Lafourche and Terrebonne. The parish is tied closely to 
Assumption and Ascension parishes, both culturally and 
physically, through its connection with the Bayou Lafourche.
    The Fresh Water District manages water quality, 
accessibility, drinking water, and agricultural supplies, and 
much more, while the friends group raises awareness and 
importance of Bayou Lafourche and its revitalization through 
education, outreach, and recreation improvements. ANHA has a 
long-standing partnership with both organizations in Assumption 
and Ascension Parishes, and hopes to continue that work through 
Lafourche Parish.
    The heritage area is a partner in the recently-designated-
by-NOAA Estuarine Research Reserve, with partners like the 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette and LUMCON, the Louisiana 
Marine Consortium of Universities. Nicholls State University, a 
university in Lafourche Parish, would be an addition to that 
team, and the Atchafalaya Heritage Area Program would be a 
foundational partner in this network for education and 
interpretation of this habitat and its connection to our 
culture.
    Lafourche Parish and its many cultural and natural assets 
weave together with Terrebonne, Assumption, Ascension, and the 
other heritage area parishes to preserve and promote the 
authentic and important regional culture. The addition of 
Lafourche Parish, a region that so fully honors our water story 
and our French language cultural themes throughout the entire 
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area, would allow the program to 
tell a more complete story of this unique piece of the nation's 
history. Thank you.

                              on H.R. 6843

    Chairman Westerman, Ranking Member Grijalva, Subcommittee Chairman 
Tiffany, Vice Chairman Curtis, and other distinguished members of the 
Subcommittee, my name is Justin Lemoine, and I am the Executive 
Director of the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area (ANHA), a nationally 
significant landscape stretching from the confluence of the Mississippi 
and Red Rivers in Central Louisiana to the Gulf of Mexico at Morgan 
City.
    Your past and continued support of the National Heritage Area 
program is greatly appreciated. I am respectfully submitting testimony 
to support H.R. 6843, To expand the boundaries of the Atchafalaya 
National Heritage Area to include Lafourche Parish, Louisiana 
introduced by Representative Steve Scalise. S. 3542, a companion bill, 
has been introduced by Senator Bill Cassidy.
    Constituents of Lafourche Parish approached Atchafalaya National 
Heritage Area staff in 2021 with a desire to expand the boundary of the 
heritage area to include the region as, though physically and 
culturally connected to the heritage area, it was not included in the 
original 2006 enabling legislation. A review by ANHA staff revealed 
that Lafourche is the only parish through which Bayou Lafourche flows 
that is not included in the heritage area. Bayou Lafourche represents 
the eastern boundary of the historic Atchafalaya Basin. The Louisiana 
Landowners Association, Lafourche Parish Government, Nicholls State 
University, the Atchafalaya Trace Commission (governing body of the 
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area), the Office of Lieutenant Governor 
Billy Nungesser, private entities, community groups, and the cities and 
towns within Lafourche Parish have offered support of this boundary 
expansion legislation.
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area Overview

    The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area (ANHA) program is housed 
within the Louisiana Office of Cultural Development, an office of the 
Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism. The ANHA 
program works closely with the Office of Tourism, the Office of State 
Parks, and the many divisions within the Office of Cultural Development 
to amplify their work and fulfill the ANHA program's goals of 
supporting cultural, natural, and recreational resource preservation 
and enhancement. Outside of its state agency, ANHA also works closely 
with the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, 
Louisiana Economic Development, the Louisiana Department of Education, 
and other state agencies, local municipalities, and public educational 
institutions in fulfillment of its mission. ANHA's work annually 
leverages the federal investment at well above the 1:1 match 
requirement. Since its authorization, the program has provided 
technical and financial assistance to local communities throughout its 
parishes and helped to lead efforts related to cultural interpretation, 
environmental stewardship, recreation enhancement, historic 
preservation, and strengthening the region's identity.
    The ANHA is comprised of 14 parishes in south central Louisiana. 
The heritage area was first conceptualized as a driving loop called the 
Atchafalaya Trace with a path looping around the Atchafalaya Basin 
floodway. This path would highlight this signature water resource and 
its role in the region's culture and economy. In the late 1990s, the 
Louisiana legislature designated the Atchafalaya Trace as a state 
heritage area. With broad local and state support, in 2006 the 
Atchafalaya National Heritage Area was designated by Congress.
    As the namesake of the heritage area, the Atchafalaya River and 
Basin is the centerpiece of a region whose extensive network of 
waterways strongly influence the region's culture and identity. South 
Louisiana's water story is a core theme of the ANHA program. Those who 
called the region home throughout history cultivated and continue to 
nourish a unique culture along these waterways. Often identified by the 
popular terms `Cajun' and `Creole,' the regional identity is a result 
of the intersection of Native American, African, European, Caribbean, 
and Acadian exiles whose language and traditions come together in this 
dynamic alluvial region. The strong language influence of these 
cultures developed the local Louisiana French dialect and the Kouri-
Vini languages. Woven with other regional cultural characteristics, 
like the food and music, and this area has earned its moniker 
`America's Foreign Country.'
The Geographical History of the Heritage Area

    At its northern end, the heritage area begins with the Mississippi 
River delta and the historic confluence of the Mississippi and Red 
Rivers. From there, the Atchafalaya River winds through the Acadiana 
region, paralleling the Mississippi River as it winds south to the Gulf 
of Mexico at Morgan City. This southern portion of the heritage area is 
often called Bayou Country. Like the Atchafalaya River, Bayou Lafourche 
is also a distributary of the Mississippi River. This key waterway, a 
former path of the Mississippi River, has historically been used for 
commercial and recreational navigation. Bayou Lafourche also provides 
clean drinking water to thousands in the region and serves the 
agricultural economy. The bayou contributes to marsh nourishment and 
land building along Louisiana's delicate coastline thanks to the 
sediment and nutrient-laden waters it receives from the Mississippi 
River at Donaldsonville.
    At the junction of the Mississippi, Red, and Atchafalaya Rivers, 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Old River Control Complex 
for flood mitigation. Built over the course of nearly half a century, 
this 5-structure complex was intended to stabilize the Mississippi 
River's path and maintain regional navigation for commercial shipping 
vessels. If not for the construction of this complex in the 20th 
century, the Mississippi River would most certainly have changed 
courses from its current path to that of the Atchafalaya River, 
bypassing major port cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans and 
adversely impacting commerce and industry for the entire central United 
States.
    The complexity of the Atchafalaya Basin's water story goes further 
back in time and includes the history of Louisiana's native peoples, 
early European settlers' use of it for navigation, and ultimately the 
ongoing fight for flood control. This fight began as efforts of 
individual property owners, then local and state entities. After the 
Flood of 1927, Congress mandated flood control and mitigation as the 
responsibility of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The continued 
efforts to manage the Mississippi River and its many tributaries and 
distributaries help to ensure that the lands in the states along their 
many courses are inhabitable and that their fertile delta soils are a 
productive part of the United States' robust agricultural economy.
    After decades of public input, the U.S. Congress and the Corps 
transformed the largest freshwater swamp in North America, the 
Atchafalaya Basin. What was once an area that stretched from Bayou 
Teche on the west to Bayou Lafourche on the east was now a fraction of 
its original size. This new floodway became a critical component of the 
USACE's efforts to control flooding along the Mississippi and Red 
Rivers which drain 41% of the continental US.
The Regions of the Heritage Area

    The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area is comprised of four 
regions: the Upper Region, the Area Between Two Rivers, the Bayou Teche 
Corridor, and the Coastal Region. Each region's relationship to water 
is based upon its location along the Atchafalaya's varied hydrologic 
system.

    The Upper Region, which forms the beginning of the ANHA, includes 
the parishes of Concordia, Avoyelles, and Pointe Coupee. Concordia 
Parish, the northernmost point of the Upper Region, has rivers on three 
sides that merge into one river. The parish is contained within levee 
borders except for one side and has 300 miles of waterbodies 
surrounding it. Lakes and rivers provide an abundance of water sports 
and recreation while wildlife refuges make hunting and fishing popular. 
Fertile, rich soil makes agriculture, music, historical agricultural 
homesites, and museums the area's main attractions. Vidalia sits on the 
banks of the Mississippi River.
    Avoyelles Parish is south of Concordia Parish and contains the 
banks of the old Mississippi River channel. Avoyelles Parish is home to 
Grand Cote National Wildlife Refuge, Lake Ophelia National Wildlife 
Refuge, Spring Bayou Wildlife Management Area, and other public lands. 
ANHA's work in Avoyelles includes recreation improvements for paddle 
access within public lands and creative placemaking initiatives in the 
form of public art. The area was originally settled in 300 BC and today 
is known for its traditions in music, food, and culture. Native 
Americans play a significant role in this area evidenced by the 
presence of three large pre-historic burial mounds. The parish is home 
to the federally recognized Tunica-Biloxi Tribe of Louisiana.
    Pointe Coupee Parish is home to one of the oldest settlements in 
the Mississippi River Valley and enjoys Creole culture at its finest. 
False River, a lake located in the parish, is an example of an oxbow 
lake formed when the Mississippi changed its course and cut off its 
former path. The landscape in Pointe Coupee consists of prairies and 
back swamp and also includes the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge. 
It is the physical location of the Morganza Spillway, one of the main 
control systems the Army Corps of Engineers has in place to handle 
major flooding. It is designed to divert water during floods from the 
Mississippi River to the Atchafalaya Basin. The Morganza Spillway is a 
human-made structure designed to prevent the Mississippi River from 
forming a new channel to the Gulf of Mexico via the Atchafalaya River. 
Here, ANHA interprets the water story through a series of interpretive 
kiosks and supports community festivals and events.

    The Between Two Rivers region consists of four parishes: East Baton 
Rouge, West Baton Rouge, Ascension, and Iberville. The Baton Rouge 
parishes were originally settled in 8000 BC. These parishes were home 
to the Houmas and Bayougoula tribes. Baton Rouge, the capital of 
Louisiana, is in East Baton Rouge Parish, and it is also home to a 
state rural life museum, Louisiana State University, and Southern 
University.
    Across the river, West Baton Rouge Parish is home to the Cinclare 
Plantation Historic District, a sugar cane mill with a town of its own, 
and Port Allen. In Port Allen, you will find the Port Allen Lock which 
connects the Mississippi River to the Intracoastal Waterway. It also 
has several sites of interest including the West Baton Rouge Museum, 
the city of Port Allen Railroad Depot, Mississippi Riverfront 
Development, Scott's Cemetery, and the Port of Greater Baton Rouge.
    Iberville Parish is a rural parish that is emblematic of humans 
living in harmony with the natural environment. Waterways are a 
dominant theme in the parish. The Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge 
is found in Iberville parish as well as the Mississippi River, bayous, 
and entrances to the 800,000 acres of the Atchafalaya Basin. Here, ANHA 
has partnered with community groups to host cultural festivals, develop 
multi-use cultural museums, and enhance outdoor recreation.
    Ascension Parish covers over 300 square miles and spans both banks 
of the Mississippi River. Several Native American tribes settled in 
this area as hunters and farmers. They were known to use pottery, 
baskets, and ceramics. Later, they were joined by the Acadians from 
Nova Scotia who were exiled and eventually settled in this part of the 
region. These groups were joined by many diverse settlers, such as 
French, Italian, Spanish, German, African, and English, to name a few. 
Once again, traditions melded together to create the rich Cajun culture 
of the area.

    The Bayou Teche Corridor consists of four parishes: St. Landry, St. 
Martin, Iberia, and Lafayette. St. Landry Parish has a long history 
dating back to prehistoric times. Two distinct Native American tribes, 
the Appalousa, and the Attakapas, lived between the Atchafalaya and 
Sabine Rivers. This area later became home to Acadians, French, 
Spanish, Caribbean, French Creoles, Spanish Creoles, and Africans. In 
1805, it was established as the largest parish in Louisiana but later 
was divided into six parishes that include Calcasieu, Evangeline, Jeff 
Davis, Beauregard, and Allen. Nationally protected areas in St. Landry 
Parish are the Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge and the Jean 
Lafitte National Historical Park Site. ANHA partners with cultural 
organizations to preserve the area's unique Zydeco and Cajun music 
assets and native plant groups to interpret the delicate Cajun prairie 
ecosystem.
    St. Martin Parish is unique in that it has three distinct 
geographical areas--the Atchafalaya Basin, the prairie, and the Bayou 
Teche area. St. Martin Parish reflects the beauty of nature in its bald 
cypress trees, oak trees, moss, sugarcane fields, low-lying swamp, and 
endless environment of lakes and rivers. ``Evangeline'' by Henry 
Wadsworth Longfellow, tells of a young woman sitting on the banks of 
Bayou Teche. The ANHA program has helped to interpret the story of 
Evangeline while helping to preserve historic sites and enhance access 
to cultural resources within the parish.
    Originally settled by the Spanish, Iberia Parish is known for its 
Cajun, Creole, and Asian cuisine. It also has several tourist 
attractions such as tropical tours on tranquil islands, swamp tours, 
stately home tours, outdoor sport and recreation options, the famous 
Tabasco factory tours, festivals, fais do do street dances, fishing 
rodeos, cook-offs, and much more.
    Concluding the Bayou Teche Corridor parishes is Lafayette Parish, 
the smallest parish in Louisiana. The French-speaking Acadians and 
Creoles of African, West Indian, and European descent settled in this 
area and brought their Roman Catholic belief system. Lafayette is the 
heart of Acadiana and the Cajun and Creole cultures are its lifeblood. 
It is a place where music, dance, love of family, storytelling, food, 
and joie de vivre reign supreme. Lafayette is a place that reflects the 
past through the present with beautiful scenery and a culture that 
lives on but adapts to the challenges of each season with strength and 
a determination to survive. Lafayette is also the home of the 
University of Louisiana at Lafayette (ULL). Here, ANHA partners with 
the Center for Louisiana Studies at ULL to compile the stories that 
make up Louisiana's cumulative history and ensure that resources are 
available in person and print for generations to come.

    The parishes of St. Mary, Assumption, and Terrebonne make up the 
Coastal Region. St. Mary Parish is 613 square miles of land and 506 
square miles of water and is recognized as a gateway to the Atchafalaya 
Basin. This parish is also home to Bayou Teche and the Bayou Teche 
National Wildlife Refuge. The earliest settlers of the coastal region 
were the Chitimacha Tribe who settled near the area bayous. Their name 
means ``people of many waters.'' Their diet consisted of corn for 
hominy meal, fish, wild game, and shellfish of the area. The tribe is 
well-known for its baskets made with wild cane reed dyed naturally and 
woven into geometric designs. Today the reservation encompasses 283 
acres of land with 350 tribal members. Other groups that settled in 
this parish were Dutch, English, Acadians, German, Danish, and Irish. 
The numerous sugar plantations and sugar mills made this area an 
important sugar port. The sugar industry continues to thrive today 
through modern agricultural practices. St. Mary Parish has also been a 
vital source of shrimp, fish, seafood processing, salt, boat building, 
oil, gas, carbon black, and was once home to the world's largest 
cypress sawmill.
    Assumption Parish has natural waterways that connect the 
Mississippi Industrial Corridor to the north and the Gulf of Mexico in 
the south, while also providing a gateway to the Atchafalaya Basin. 
Assumption Parish is known for its rivers, bayous, sugar, agriculture, 
estuaries, scenery, recreation, historic communities, agricultural 
industry, and ties to the French and Spanish cultures. The Louisiana 
French language is still spoken throughout the parish and will be a 
feature of a new interpretive center in development by local community 
champions through a partnership with ANHA.
    Terrebonne Parish is the second largest parish in Louisiana and its 
entire southern coast is on the Gulf of Mexico. Over ninety percent of 
the parish is wetlands or open water. The parish is home to the 
Mandalay National Wildlife Refuge and Terrebonne Bay, as well as many 
bayous and waterways including the Intracoastal Waterway. The 
inhabitants of Terrebonne, like those of neighboring Lafourche, have 
always lived on what nature provided. Terrebonne oysters are known 
internationally as some of the finest oysters in the world. Seafood (20 
percent of all Louisiana seafood), wildlife (hunting and trapping), 
sugar cane, sugar mills, fur trading, logging, and oil and gas have 
long provided a livelihood for the residents. Terrebonne Parish is 
recognized as being a gateway port for one of the heaviest 
concentrations of offshore oil service companies in the state. The 
Houmas tribe were some of the first settlers in this area, followed by 
the Acadians (exiled French colonists) and the Spanish. The authentic 
Acadian culture, diverse environment, wildlife, agriculture, historic 
homesteads, seafood, natural mineral resources, and unique location 
offer many educational, recreational, and economic opportunities in 
today's world.
Lafourche Parish

    Lafourche Parish covers nearly all the length of Bayou Lafourche 
and immediately abuts Assumption and Terrebonne parishes and the Gulf 
of Mexico. Early European settlers explored the waterway known as 
``LaFourche Des Chetimachas,'' the fork of the Chitimachas, which was 
eventually shortened to ``Lafourche,'' hence the name of the parish and 
the bayou that bisects it. The parish is located within the Barataria 
and Terrebonne estuaries. Bayou Lafourche, or Fork Bayou, is a 
distributary of the Mississippi River. Lafourche has 1,068 square miles 
of land area and 406 square miles of open water and is the eighth-
largest parish in Louisiana by total area. It was originally the 
northern part of Lafourche Interior Parish, which consisted of the 
present parishes of Lafourche and Terrebonne.

    Louisiana's coastal parishes house a wealth of economic industries 
ranging from oil and gas to seafood to water-based recreation and 
hunting. Lafourche Parish is home to many public waters and public 
lands including East Timbalier Island National Wildlife Refuge, Lake 
Boeuf Wildlife Management Area, and Pointe-aux-Chenes Wildlife 
Management Area. Port Fourchon, a bustling port terminal where Bayou 
Lafourche meets the Gulf of Mexico is not only a hub for the state's 
energy industry, but also an access point for recreational activities 
with developed recreational infrastructure.

    Lafourche Parish is home to many historic communities including the 
city of Thibodaux and the towns of Lockport and Golden Meadow. E.D. 
White State Historic Site, a public museum located along Bayou 
Lafourche, depicts the history of the parish, the agricultural industry 
in the region, the many cultures of Lafourche, and the enslavement of 
peoples as a part of the region's agricultural development. The site is 
a reminder of the region's past that intrinsically ties the present to 
life on the water. The parish is filled with dozens of historic sites, 
all connected to the cumulative cultural identity of the Atchafalaya 
region.

    The Jean Lafitte National Park and Preserve Wetlands Acadian 
Cultural Center (WACC) is located on Bayou Lafourche in Thibodaux, the 
seat of the parish. The WACC tells the story of the Acadian exiles who 
settled along Louisiana's bayous and created a distinctive Cajun 
culture based on life in a watery realm. The center shares their way of 
life through a film, special and permanent exhibits, musical 
performances, and boat tours of Bayou Lafourche that connect to other 
important sites like the E.D. White State Historic Site.

    Bayou Lafourche, which begins at Donaldsonville in Ascension 
Parish, is the parish's central waterway. Once a natural distributary 
of the Mississippi River, it now is controlled by a pump station where 
it begins at the Mississippi. Lafourche is inextricably tied to 
Assumption and Ascension Parishes culturally and physically through 
Bayou Lafourche. The Bayou Lafourche Fresh Water District (BLFWD) is 
tasked with management of the waterway. The district balances water 
quality, water quantity, recreational accessibility, drinking and 
agricultural water supplies, and coastal nourishment through a 
comprehensive management strategy. The Friends of Bayou Lafourche is a 
nonprofit organization whose mission is to raise the awareness of the 
importance of Bayou Lafourche and its revitalization through education 
and informational outreach, and by the creation of recreation and 
beautification opportunities along the bayou. ANHA has partnered with 
both organizations in nearby Assumption and Ascension parishes 
throughout its history and would continue that work into Lafourche 
Parish upon approval of boundary expansion.

    The commercial fishing industries in Lafourche Parish are strongly 
connected to those in neighboring parishes within the ANHA. The coastal 
fishing industry has been active for as long as the region has been 
inhabited. Native Americans lived off the land and flourished in this 
watery region. Their foodways and cultural traditions continue to this 
day. Early Europeans and newly re-settled Acadians made home along 
Bayou Lafourche. Their lifeways of hunting, fishing, and trapping have 
been handed down through time. Many commercial operations are family-
owned and have been passed down from generation to generation. These 
fishermen are often born and raised in the area and rarely leave the 
bayou region. They are the torchbearers of the bayou culture of 
Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes and the seafood they catch 
contributes to the state's robust seafood industry. Lafourche lies in 
the heart of the state's vast coastal wetlands. These bayous, 
marshlands, and fertile farmlands are defining features of this area 
and create an ideal environment for many seafood species including 
shrimp, crabs, oysters, and finfish.

    Water-based recreation along the coast includes recreational 
fishing, ecotourism, and passive recreational boating throughout the 
vast wetlands and marshes. These waterways play a vital role in the 
culture and the region's sportsman economy. Tour groups and charter 
fishing businesses work with the parish's tourism agency, Louisiana's 
Cajun Bayou and those in Terrebonne, Assumption, and St. Mary parishes 
to teach residents and visitors about the value of the ecosystem. 
Nicholls State University is situated in the city of Thibodaux. The 
university is currently building a new coastal center that, together 
with other state universities, will drive research and innovation on 
best practices for coastal management. The University, along with the 
Barataria Terrebonne National Estuary Program (BTNEP), utilizes an 
applied science approach along with community engagement to help tackle 
the many challenges facing this delicate region. ANHA has a seat on 
BTNEP's quarterly management conference board.

    The Louisiana National Estuarine Research Reserve site, recently 
designated by NOAA, further offers unique opportunities for partnership 
between the ANHA and organizations located in the heritage area's 
coastal parishes. The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium 
(LUMCON), Nicholls State University, the heritage area, and other 
regional groups in St. Mary, Terrebonne, and Lafourche parish, will 
work with the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority 
(CPRA) to partner on educational, outreach, and research opportunities 
for implementation of the LaNERR management plan. The Atchafalaya 
National Heritage Area serves as a vital partner in this network for 
historical and ecological interpretation as the estuarine environment 
provides yet another example of the critical waterbodies of the 
heritage area and the culture it nourishes. The history of the region's 
development, how the people have lived off the land, and the challenges 
they continue to face in a dynamic coastal environment are what weave 
these coastal parishes together like a traditional Chitimacha basket.

    The Cajun identity that is strong throughout the Atchafalaya region 
is found in Louisiana's Cajun Bayou: Lafourche Parish. Cajun music is 
an art form unique to South Louisiana. While the once robust Cajun 
music scene has faded over time, advocates are working hard to sustain 
these traditions for future generations. The Cajun Music Preservation 
Society (CMPS) was formed to ensure that traditional Cajun music 
remains part of the vibrant culture in Lafourche for decades to come by 
promoting traditional Cajun music, hosting live Cajun jams, and hosting 
the Swamp Stomp Music Series. Adding Lafourche to the heritage area 
boundary will enable the program staff to better engage with 
organizations like CMPS to further preserve and enhance these cultural 
organizations and amplify their impact. Lafourche is also home to the 
Cajun Heritage Festival, a yearly event where locals express their 
memory and talent in the form of wooden carvings. This event serves as 
an educational program to teach younger generations about the wildlife 
and culture of the region.

    Lafourche Parish and its many cultural assets weave together with 
Terrebonne, Assumption, and Ascension parishes to preserve and promote 
the authentic and important Cajun culture. Incorporating Lafourche 
Parish into the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area will enable the 
program to support, preserve, and enhance the cultural, natural, and 
recreational resources as it does throughout the area. To best serve 
the bayou area, the program must be able to work throughout the entire 
community. Water and culture know no boundaries. The addition of 
Lafourche Parish, a region that so fully honors the water and French-
language themes of the Atchafalaya National Heritage Area, would allow 
ANHA staff to tell a more complete story of this unique piece of the 
nation's history.

                                 ______
                                 

    Dr. Gosar. Thanks, Mr. Lemoine. I now recognize Ms. 
Katherine Andrews, the Director of the Office of Outdoor 
Recreation at the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, and 
Tourism.

    Director Andrews, you have 5 minutes. Thank you.

  STATEMENT OF KATHERINE ANDREWS, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF OUTDOOR 
RECREATION, DEPARTMENT OF PARKS, HERITAGE, AND TOURISM, LITTLE 
                         ROCK, ARKANSAS

    Ms. Andrews. Good afternoon, and thank you to my fellow 
Arkansans, Chairman Bruce Westerman and Congressman French 
Hill, and the entire Committee for inviting me here today. My 
name is Katherine Andrews, and I serve as Director of Arkansas' 
Office of Outdoor Recreation within the Arkansas Department of 
Parks, Heritage, and Tourism. I also chair the Confluence of 
States, a bipartisan group of my outdoor recreation 
counterparts across the United States.
    It is a particular honor to appear before the Natural 
Resources Committee again, and I am delighted to testify today 
in support of H.R. 3971, the Flatside Wilderness Additions Act.
    Arkansas is known as the Natural State for a reason. Our 
pristine streams, unspoiled wilderness, and diverse outdoor 
recreation opportunities including hiking, biking, floating, 
and climbing. Our state boasts the Mountain Bike Capital of the 
World, the Duck Hunting Capital of the World, the Trout Capital 
of the USA, and we are rapidly becoming the Climbing Capital of 
the South. We have the world's longest bayou, the highest 
waterfall between the Rockies and the Appalachians, and the 
nation's first national river, the Buffalo National River. 
Additionally, Arkansas is the only state where you can hunt 
both an elk and an alligator in the same state.
    Our mission at the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, 
and Tourism is to protect and promote the state's natural, 
cultural, and historical resources, contributing to a thriving 
economy and enhanced quality of life. There are numerous 
benefits associated with areas rich in outdoor recreation, such 
as business attraction, workforce retention, public health and 
wellness, getting kids outside and off screens, and the 
conservation and preservation of our natural assets.
    In addition, a robust outdoor recreation industry is not 
just a luxury. It is essential and highly impactful. In 2022, 
4.3 million visitors, a number larger than the population of 
the entire state of Arkansas, spent an estimated $278 million 
in local gateway regions while visiting National Park Service 
lands in my state. These expenditures supported 3,900 jobs, 
$107 million in labor income, and $362 million in economic 
output for the Arkansas economy. Visitors and citizens alike 
flock to places where they can spend time outside.
    Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders has prioritized 
improving outdoor experiences, and I, along with the Arkansas 
Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism, am working 
tirelessly to create outdoor recreation opportunities from our 
incredible state parks to communities across the state. Their 
executive order, the Natural State Initiative, has adopted a 
bold approach, involving multi-agency and private partners 
working together to break down silos and invite innovation into 
our work and public lands.
    Access to outdoor recreation inspires generations of 
Arkansans to care for and champion the future of our natural 
places, ensuring that we remain the Natural State. Our office 
serves two main groups: industry and community partners. For 
industry partners like bike shops, boat manufacturers, and 
outfitters, we provide resources and help overcome growth 
barriers. For community partners such as towns and advocacy 
groups, we highlight the economic benefits of outdoor 
recreation, and assist in securing grants and funding to 
enhance their natural assets and infrastructure to attract 
visitors and outdoor enthusiasts. This brings me to the reason 
I am here today.
    I am here to offer the Arkansas Office of Outdoor 
Recreation's support of Congressman Hill's legislation, which 
would designate approximately 2,200 acres as wilderness, and 
add it to the Flatside Wilderness Area, part of the Ouachita 
National Forest. The Flatside Wilderness Additions Act 
represents the second and final phase to expand the wilderness 
area at Flatside. The surrounding area is either part of the 
Ouachita National Forest and unsuitable for wilderness 
designation, or privately owned, therefore deserving 
protection.
    The addition to Flatside Wilderness will be a tremendous 
benefit to central Arkansas, providing a fantastic destination 
for hiking, camping, fishing, and other outdoor activities. 
This addition will serve as a cherished outdoor haven, 
enriching the quality of life for Arkansans and attracting 
nature enthusiasts from far and wide.
    As the population of Arkansas grows, the need to expand 
outdoor access becomes crucial. Increased access to outdoor 
spaces fuels the outdoor economy by encouraging activities like 
buying hunting and fishing licenses, hiring guide services, and 
purchasing outdoor gear. Additionally, fostering a larger 
community dedicated to conservation ensures that these places 
and many others will remain protected.
    This legislation will open numerous opportunities for young 
families and new residents, while providing seasoned residents 
with joy and adventure in a cherished location. It will also 
offer access to the rugged Ouachita Mountains and clear 
streams, providing hiking and other recreational opportunities 
for all.
    On behalf of the Office of Outdoor Recreation and the 
Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage, and Tourism, we support 
this proposed legislation and ask for your support, as well. 
Thank you.

    Mr. Tiffany [presiding]. Thank you, Director Andrews.
    Finally, I would like to recognize Mr. Sean Kelleher, 
Historian for the town of Saratoga in New York.
    Mr. Kelleher, you have 5 minutes.

   STATEMENT OF SEAN KELLEHER, HISTORIAN, TOWN OF SARATOGA, 
                       SARATOGA, NEW YORK

    Mr. Kelleher. Thank you to the Committee for allowing this 
testimony. My name is Sean Kelleher. I am the Historian for the 
Town of Saratoga, and I am here to urge your support for H.R. 
390, the Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National 
Heritage Area Enhancement Act.
    This is a critical piece of legislation that will help 
preserve our country's history and drive economic growth in the 
Hudson River Valley. The Town of Saratoga is committed to 
initiatives that enhance our economic, historic, and 
environmental well-being. The inclusion in the Hudson River 
National Heritage Area will significantly bolster our efforts 
to preserve our rich heritage, while fostering sustainable 
development and tourism.
    The opportunity is particularly timely as we approach the 
250th anniversary of the American Revolution, and in 2027 will 
commemorate the pivotal events of the Battles of Saratoga. 
These battles played a critical role in shaping our nation's 
history, and continue to be a source of pride and education not 
only for our country, but across the world.
    The Saratoga campaign in 1777 was a pivotal act of the 
American Revolutionary War. British General John Burgoyne led 
an army to seize control of the significant Hudson River 
Valley. However, that campaign culminated with a defeat at the 
Battles of Saratoga, forcing a surrender to the American 
General Horatio Gates on October 17, 1777. This was an 
unprecedented event. It was the first time in world history a 
complete British army surrendered, and it had far-reaching 
consequences. It enabled Benjamin Franklin to secure vital 
foreign assistance, especially from France, that made the 
various countries coming to the American cause, but it also 
transformed our American Revolution into a global war spanning 
North America, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia, and Europe.
    The Battles of Saratoga were monumentally significant, and 
it breathed life into the ideals set forth in our Declaration 
of Independence. Until this point, the principles of freedom 
and self-governance were merely words on a page, on a piece of 
paper. But the American victory at Saratoga demonstrated the 
viability of these ideas not just for our fledgling nation, but 
for all of humanity. And it proved that the concepts of liberty 
and independence could be triumphed against what were seemingly 
insurmountable odds, and it set a powerful precedent for future 
generations.
    The Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area was 
established 28 years ago. It encompassed 10 counties in the 
Village of Waterford in Saratoga County. The primary purpose of 
this heritage area was to commemorate the American Revolution 
and highlight the ongoing commitment to the fundamental human 
rights of liberty, equality, and dignity.
    However, the original heritage area boundaries were 
determined based upon congressional districts, rather than 
recognizing the historical significant areas within the Hudson 
Valley. Over time, the heritage area location has evolved 
administratively to incorporate Saratoga National Historical 
Park, which our county would like to see renamed as Saratoga 
National Battlefield. But it is crucial to note that, while the 
national park was added, the surrounding communities, which 
witnessed some of the actual combat and where the British 
surrendered, were not included. So, this is an opportunity for 
Congress to expand that area to include that.
    In conclusion, this law calls for the expansion of three 
simple words, but it will allow and empower our communities to 
better collaborate with both Federal and state agencies and 
achieve our common goal. By supporting H.R. 390, you won't 
throw away your shot to correct this historical oversight, and 
we can boost our local economies and ensure a future that can 
be fully appreciated.
    I invite you to visit Saratoga County and witness our 
historical significance, and see our community as we are 
preparing for the 250th commemoration of the Battles of 
Saratoga.
    Thank you for allowing me the opportunity for this 
testimony. And if you are interested in more information, we 
have a great website: Saratoga250.com.

control of the strategically crucial Hudson River Valley. However, his 
campaign culminated in defeat at the Battles of Saratoga, forcing his

unprecedented event--the first surrender of an entire British army in 
history--had far-reaching consequences. It enabled Benjamin Franklin to

National Battlefield Park. It's crucial to note that while the National 
Park was added, the surrounding communities that also witnessed actual 
combat and the British surrender were not included.
    We deeply value Saratoga National Historical Park, its dedicated 
staff, its stunning landscape, exceptional preservation efforts, and 
outstanding interpretive programs. However, we recognize that the park 
is distinct from the communities where part of the Battles of Saratoga 
actually unfolded. Our towns and villages in Saratoga and Washington 
counties, each with their unique heritage and historical significance, 
bear the responsibility of preserving this vital part of American 
history. Unlike the National Park Service, our communities lack 
substantial resources to fulfill this important duty effectively.
    The proposed Enhancement Act would expand the Heritage Area to 
include all locations where fighting occurred, where patriots made the 
ultimate sacrifice, and where American independence was secured. This 
region is of international importance, and our communities require your 
support to continue this critical conservation work and develop 
economic independence. By including these areas, we can ensure a more 
comprehensive preservation and interpretation of the events that shaped 
our nation's history.
    The proposed addition of Saratoga and Washington Counties to the 
Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area through H.R. 390 is crucial 
for preserving and promoting our region's rich history. This inclusion 
aligns perfectly with the goals of the Saratoga County 250th 
Commission, established by the Saratoga County Board of Supervisors to 
educate the public about the Battles of Saratoga, increase heritage 
tourism, and enhance infrastructure at historic sites.
    The 250th anniversary commemorations of the Battles of Saratoga 
will be landmark events featuring gatherings of patriotic 
organizations, parades, reenactments, fireworks, and scholarly 
symposiums. Inclusion in the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area 
would significantly enhance these efforts by providing additional 
resources, expertise, and national recognition. This designation would 
improve coordination with other Revolutionary War sites along the 
Hudson, facilitate access to federal funding, and expand commemorative 
events.
    The goals of the County's 250th Commission complement those of the 
Maurice D. Hinchey Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area. 
Inclusion in the Heritage Area will increase visibility for historic 
sites, potentially leading to higher visitation and improved 
preservation efforts. It will also foster collaboration with other 
sites in the heritage area, enhancing the coordinated 250th-anniversary 
celebrations along the Hudson River.
    Our communities stand to benefit economically from increased 
heritage tourism. For instance, Schuylerville is transitioning from an 
aged mill community to a heritage tourism center. The Heritage Area can 
bring resources to assist this transformation by improving 
infrastructure and supporting preservation efforts. Additionally, it 
can provide expertise in creating enhanced educational resources for 
local schools and communities.
    The economic impact of National Heritage Areas is significant. A 
2018 report to Congress stated that these areas leveraged $5.50 for 
every $1 of federal funding received and created approximately 920,000 
jobs nationally. By joining the Hudson River Valley National Heritage 
Area, Saratoga and Washington Counties can tap into these benefits, 
fostering economic growth and preserving our historical legacy for 
future generations.

its initiatives, please visit Saratoga250.com.
    National Heritage Areas have generally been considered successful 
across the United States, and the Hudson Valley National Heritage Area 
has had specific successes. Studies have shown that national heritage 
areas contribute significantly to local economies. A 2012 study found 
that they contribute $12.9 billion annually to the national economy by 
supporting job creation, particularly in the tourism and preservation 
sectors. The Hudson Valley National Heritage Area has supported the 
preservation and interpretation of numerous historic sites, including 
those related to the American Revolution. In addition, the Hudson 
Valley National Heritage Area has supported efforts to preserve and 
celebrate the diverse cultural heritage of the Hudson Valley, including 
Native American, Dutch, and African American histories, which are also 
important themes of the American Revolution. Most importantly, the 
Hudson Valley National Heritage Area has helped to strengthen regional 
identity and pride in the Hudson Valley's heritage. The Hudson River 
Valley is the identity of our communities. The Hudson River defines our 
community.
    In conclusion, adding three simple words to existing legislation 
will empower and facilitate our communities' better collaboration with 
federal and state agencies to achieve our common goals. By supporting 
H.R. 390, you will not throw away your shot to correct a historical 
oversight, thus boosting local economies and ensuring that future 
generations can fully appreciate the birthplace of American 
independence. I invite you to visit Saratoga County and witness our 
heritage's significance and preparations for the 250th Commemoration of 
the Battles of Saratoga.

    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you, Mr. Kelleher. I now recognize 
Members for 5 minutes for questions.
    The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Franklin, you are up for 5 
minutes, if you choose.
    Mr. Franklin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Beasley, I appreciate you being here today to respond 
on these, has Congress ever granted the Park Service Authority 
to manage areas of Big Cypress National Preserve as wilderness?
    Ms. Beasley. No, sir. Only Congress has the authority to 
designate wilderness.
    Mr. Franklin. So, when Big Cypress was first created, it 
was specifically going to be a preserve, and not used as 
wilderness. So, it was commentary at the time that the Park 
Service was planning to do a subsequent study at some point in 
the future to look at the feasibility of designating some of 
those lands as wilderness, and I think it was 2022 the study 
was released, and it listed three options in there. The third 
option, the Alternative 3, would propose that Congress 
designate approximately 147,910 acres of land, which was 25 
percent of the original preserve, as wilderness.
    Has the Park Service ever come forth to Congress to submit 
that proposal, and request that it be redesignated as 
wilderness?
    Ms. Beasley. No, there is not a proposal currently for 
designation as wilderness.
    Mr. Franklin. OK. Would you agree that the Park Service is 
currently managing that land, the 147,910 acres, as wilderness?
    Ms. Beasley. Well, the Wilderness Act directs Federal 
agencies to study their lands for potential inclusion in the 
National Wilderness Preservation System, so we seek to follow 
that mandate. The National Park Service's management policies 
direct us to manage areas that are found eligible or are 
proposed for wilderness to be managed as wilderness.
    Mr. Franklin. As the Park Service has determined eligible, 
or as Congress has approved?
    Ms. Beasley. Based on the findings of a wilderness study, 
as directed by the Wilderness Act.
    Mr. Franklin. OK, so the Park Service will conduct its 
study, make its determination, but without them getting 
subsequent approval from Congress, will just go forth and carry 
that out as though it had Congress' permission.
    Ms. Beasley. Well, again, the Wilderness Act directs 
Federal agencies to study their lands for potential inclusion 
in the National Wilderness Preservation System. The National 
Park Service seeks to preserve wilderness qualities in order to 
allow for a future potential designation, should Congress 
choose to make a formal designation.
    Mr. Franklin. I understand and appreciate that. But you do 
appreciate, though, that that final authority should rest with 
Congress. Do you agree with that?
    Ms. Beasley. Yes, sir. Only Congress has the authority to 
designate wilderness.
    Mr. Franklin. Thank you. And in fairness, from the 
conversations we have had, the relationship currently is very 
amicable, but there is concern about the future, what that 
could evolve to, eventually, and particularly in the absence of 
any official designation by Congress.
    Chairman Cypress, I would like to hear your thoughts, your 
concerns about the future of what this could hold for these 
tribal lands. And then also, could you comment on other areas 
of tribal lands around the country where this maybe has not 
worked out so well for the tribes?
    Mr. Cypress. Yes. We have had a more amicable relationship 
with the National Park Service of late, but this designation, 
we believe, is the wrong answer to some of these issues that 
are being brought up, and the Tribe is willing to co-manage 
with the Park Service, and use our resources to help out. And 
we have had discussions, internal discussions. But this 
designation seems to be one of the major pushes that they are 
making.
    And in the written testimony we have examples of certain 
areas that have been designated wilderness, like I think with 
the Chippewas, and they lost access to their lands. So, we 
don't want to end up in that same situation. We have been given 
assurances by the National Park, but assurances don't coincide 
with the language in the Wilderness Act.
    Mr. Franklin. Thank you, Chairman Cypress.
    And Mr. Chairman, I would urge the Committee's strong 
consideration of support for this bill. There is a time and a 
place for wilderness areas, but it needs to be done properly 
and in accordance with the way Congress has set this process 
out. And in this case, we feel that that has not been followed, 
the will of Congress has been thwarted, and I would urge our 
colleagues' adoption of my bill.
    Mr. Tiffany. So, is it correct, Mr. Franklin, that you or 
no Member of Florida has introduced a bill to take some of 
these lands that are in question and put them into wilderness?
    Mr. Franklin. No. In fact, this bill would specifically 
prevent this.
    Mr. Tiffany. But no one from Florida has introduced a bill 
to move this into wilderness?
    Mr. Franklin. No, and quite the contrary, this is very 
bipartisan with our delegation.
    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you for your questioning.
    Mr. Franklin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Tiffany. I am going to take a few minutes here for 
questioning also.
    Ms. Beasley, management plans for the National Heritage 
Areas involve partnerships between the National Park Service 
and state or local groups. While these designations can be used 
for tourism purposes, there are also concerns about if it 
infringes on private property rights. What assurances does the 
Park Service have that National Heritage Area designations or 
expansions will not restrict any type of private development or 
private property rights?
    Ms. Beasley. Thank you for your question, sir. This is an 
important point, and an important distinction to make.
    Designation as a National Heritage Area does not confer any 
ownership or other authority to the Federal Government to 
restrict what private property owners may or may not do with 
their property. It does not require private property owners to 
participate in national heritage activities, or to allow, for 
example, public access to their land. And most authorizing 
legislation for National Heritage Areas includes specific 
provisions for the protection of private property rights.
    And I will also note that the National Heritage Area System 
Act also contains specific and stringent provisions protecting 
the rights of private property owners.
    Mr. Tiffany. And there are no buffers or boundaries that 
are set up under a National Heritage Area that could infringe 
on someone's property, restricting their ability to be able to 
use that property?
    Ms. Beasley. No, sir. Again, designation as a heritage area 
does not put any restrictions on private property owners. It 
does not create specific requirements for private property 
owners that are within the National Heritage Area.
    Mr. Tiffany. Thank you.
    Chairman Cypress, in your testimony you stated that Natives 
still living on traditional lands have been removed, harassed, 
and convicted of crimes related to their traditional practices 
under the Wilderness Act. Can you expand on this concern, and 
highlight a few issues that may surprise people who generally 
support the idea of conservation, but might not understand some 
of the unanticipated consequences of wilderness designations?
    Mr. Cypress. Yes, I don't have the specific incidents where 
it has happened. It is in my written testimony that I have 
submitted to the Committee. But I know, for us, the Tribe, we 
have had the experience of the Everglades National Park being 
established, and stripping away thousands of acres from the 
Miccosukee Tribe when that happened. So, that is just one 
instance of where the Park Service has done an action that they 
don't listen to the tribes when they move forward with some of 
these issues.
    Mr. Tiffany. Does it surprise you, or have you heard that 
we have seen that the Biden administration, via I believe it 
was the Bureau of Land Management, did not fully take into 
account consultation with tribes up on the North Slope of 
Alaska? First of all, have you heard about that?
    Mr. Cypress. No, not----
    Mr. Tiffany. Does it surprise you that the Federal 
Government has not taken into account their concerns, that they 
did not go through the official consultation process?
    Mr. Cypress. Yes, that is surprising. They have been very 
good about meeting and consulting with us, but I don't believe 
we are being listened to on some of these issues. I think true 
consultation means taking our advice that we give, and using 
that when they propose these different ideas.
    Mr. Tiffany. As the Chairman of Federal Lands, it has been 
very surprising to me when we hear an administration that talks 
all the time about, boy, we consult, we coordinate, and we work 
with the tribes, we always consider them pre-eminently in our 
discussions when we make decisions, and to see issues like this 
that fly in the face of those words, that they are actually not 
consulting with the tribes.
    Ms. Andrews, it is good to have you back here before the 
Committee. And your office recently sent a letter with more 
than 250 organizations calling for the Senate to pass the 
EXPLORE Act.
    Can you explain why it is so important for the Senate to 
take up and pass the EXPLORE Act? Give us a couple of examples 
of why you think it is really important for this to move to the 
President's desk.
    Ms. Andrews. Yes. Thank you for the question, and first I 
would like to congratulate you all on moving that through the 
House. That has been years in the making by hundreds and 
hundreds of people working on that bill. So, the momentum right 
now that we have is critical to be able to get that and move 
that through the Senate.
    For us and in the Office of Outdoor Recreation, the access 
to public lands is critical. The growth of the outdoor economy, 
public health and wellness, all of the benefits related to 
economic development, we see that when outdoor recreation 
access is achieved. And by passing the EXPLORE Act through the 
Senate, that will ensure that for future generations all of 
this will come to pass. So, I look forward to seeing that pass 
through the Senate very soon.
    Mr. Tiffany. Well, it is certainly a consistent message in 
regards to access. We have been hearing it across the country, 
people looking for access to our Federal lands and also not 
denying access, as we are hearing today in testimony.
    Mr. Lemoine, in your role as Executive Director, how do you 
partner with local outfitters to promote partnerships that 
provide jobs and opportunities?
    Mr. Lemoine. Thank you for your question. We partner with a 
number of different community groups, recreation groups, and 
fresh water districts on a number of different waterways 
throughout the heritage area not only to help develop strategic 
plans for action for their waterways, for restoration, for 
recreation enhancements, but we also do a lot of work in 
partnership building within those different parishes and within 
the different state agencies to sort of help make sure that the 
people in our smaller communities have access to the technical 
and financial resources that are available to them both on the 
state and Federal level.
    Our work often acts as the go-between to make sure that the 
people in our smaller communities, who don't often get access 
to the technical knowledge, are given those connections.
    Mr. Tiffany. Yes. Another really consistent message we have 
heard throughout this Committee is local communities, 
oftentimes small communities that are near these areas, that 
they get the opportunity to thrive also.
    Mr. Kelleher, I really appreciate your testimony. I love 
hearing about Burgoyne and the Redcoats and Saratoga, and all 
the rest here, taking us in the way-back machine to the history 
books, back in grade school. And tell us how Representative 
Stefanik's legislation will help the Town of Saratoga as you 
prepare for the 250th anniversary just a couple years down the 
road.
    Mr. Kelleher. Thank you, Chairman, for the question.
    It is really an opportunity to help our collaboration up 
and down the Hudson River. When you look at communities 
planning for the 250th anniversary, the strongest ones in our 
area are Westchester County and Saratoga County. 
Geographically, we are pretty distant. But what we have in 
common is we have the Hudson River. It is what defines our part 
of the state, it defines our area. And that is what this 
heritage area does.
    And we are able to use these strengths through the heritage 
area, whether it be Westchester County or Saratoga County, we 
are able to bring along some of the other counties that may not 
have as much strength. So, we can kind of rise that boat in the 
Hudson River all together by working through this partnership 
which gets facilitated by the National Park Service.
    Mr. Tiffany. We look forward to visiting in 2026.
    Mr. Kelleher. Thank you. We look forward to having you.
    Mr. Tiffany. Yes, I want to thank the witnesses here today. 
Lots of stuff going on here, a little delay, and I appreciate 
your patience. Most of all, I appreciate you taking the time to 
come here, oftentimes from far distances. We appreciate that 
more than you know.
    Members of the Subcommittee may have some additional 
questions for our witnesses today. If they do, we will ask that 
the witnesses respond to those in writing.
    Under Committee Rule 3, members of the Subcommittee must 
submit questions to the Subcommittee Clerk by 5 p.m. on 
Tuesday, July 2, 2024. Getting close to the Fourth of July, 
aren't we? The hearing record will be held open for 10 business 
days for those responses.
    And if there is no further business, without objection, the 
Subcommittee on Federal Lands stands adjourned.

    [Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

            [ADDITIONAL MATERIALS SUBMITTED FOR THE RECORD]

                        Statement for the Record
                          U.S. Forest Service
                     U.S. Department of Agriculture
            on H.R. 3971--Flatside Wilderness Additions Act

    Chairman Tiffany, Ranking Member Neguse, and Members of the 
Subcommittee, thank you for inviting the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's (USDA) Forest Service, to discuss H.R. 3971, the 
``Flatside Wilderness Additions Act.''

    H.R. 3971 amends the Arkansas Wilderness Act of 1984, adding 2,215 
acres in the Ouachita National Forest as wilderness under the National 
Wilderness Preservation System. This parcel would be an addition to the 
existing Flatside Wilderness. The bill also renames the newly expanded 
Flatside Wilderness, including the 2019 addition, as the ``Flatside-
Bethune Wilderness.''

    USDA recognizes the importance of wilderness areas, and the Forest 
Service embraces its mission to steward and safeguard wilderness 
character in Congressionally designated wilderness. USDA supports H.R. 
3971 and would like to work with the Subcommittee and the sponsor of 
this bill to address some technical concerns.

    The Forest Service would like to draw attention to the 720 acres of 
non-federal mineral rights underlying the proposed wilderness, all 
believed to be in private ownership. The proposed wilderness would be 
subject to pre-existing mineral rights and potential development even 
if Congress were to designate these additional parcels as wilderness. 
We are currently exploring options for consolidating these mineral 
rights into federal ownership and would like to work with the 
Subcommittee as we explore options.

    The legislation as written establishes a 60-foot setback for Forest 
Service Road 793. The Forest Service recommends changing this setback 
to 66 feet, which would make the proposed wilderness addition 
consistent with the current Flatside Wilderness boundary legal 
description.

    Renaming all portions of the wilderness, including the existing 
Flatside Wilderness, the 2019 addition, and the current proposed 
addition to ``Flatside-Bethune Wilderness'' will allow the Forest 
Service to maintain consistency in signage and minimize confusion. The 
Forest Service supports this consistent naming convention.

    Thank you for the opportunity to testify on H.R. 3971. I welcome 
any questions from the Subcommittee.

                                 ______
                                 

Submissions for the Record by Rep. Neguse

Prepared Statement of the Hon. Joe Neguse, a Representative in Congress 
                       from the State of Colorado

    Thank you, Chairman Tiffany.

    Good morning, everyone. It's been another busy week for the Federal 
Lands Subcommittee, with a legislative hearing on six bills today.

    From historic sites associated with the War 1812 to studying new 
heritage areas in Maui and designating new wilderness in Chair 
Westerman's home state of Arkansas, I'm sure we'll cover a lot of 
ground today.

    The bills on today's docket serve as a reminder of the wide range 
of benefits and uses associated with our parks and public lands--they 
protect natural ecosystems, safeguard our cherished cultural heritage, 
and provide the backdrop for a wide range of outdoor recreational 
activities.

    So, it is imperative that we continue to identify new places worthy 
of conservation and we fight to secure sufficient resources so that 
federal land managers have the resources they need to steward and 
protect them for present and future generations to come.

    As members of the Federal Lands Subcommittee, we collectively have 
the opportunity to champion new conservation opportunities--something I 
was proud to lead when I served as Chair of this Subcommittee, and 
continue to advocate for today.

    Despite the debate and disagreements we often engage in regarding 
the management of our public lands, it is clear that we need to do more 
to protect the health of our public lands.

    As made clear by today's hearing, there are still plenty of places 
throughout the country that deserve increased protection and 
conservation, and I'm eager to learn more about each of these bills.

    Importantly, this is one of the first hearings we have held in the 
entire 118th Congress that features conservation designations.

    This is a great first start, and I thank the Chairman for including 
these measures in today's hearing. But I would also like to remind my 
friends across the aisle that there is a long running list of 
additional bills--sponsored by members of both parties--to create new 
national parks, designate new wilderness and withdrawals, and protect 
some of the most special places across our great nation.

    This includes my CORE Act, which I've talked about many times in 
this Subcommittee, and so many more. Our constituents support real 
conservation, enhanced recreational opportunities, and even ways to 
accelerate tribal co-stewardship and enhance protections for sacred 
sites.

    But first, let's turn to today's agenda.

    H.R. 309 and H.R. 6843 expand the boundaries of existing National 
Heritage Areas, while H.R. 8219 will direct the Secretary of the 
Interior to conduct a study to determine the suitability and 
feasibility of designating Lahaina as a National Heritage Area.

    Driven by grassroots initiatives, National Heritage Areas preserve 
areas of significant importance to communities through natural, 
cultural, and historic resources. These sites also serve the community 
by providing recreational and economic opportunities. I'm particularly 
glad to see H.R. 8219 from my friend Rep. Tokuda on today's agenda, as 
I am a proud original cosponsor of the bill.

    Then we have H.R. 6826 to redesignate the visitor and educational 
center at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine in honor 
of Paul S. Sarbanes, who was instrumental in ensuring the preservation 
of the vaunted site. This is a fitting tribute.

    Finally, turning to the other key topic on today's agenda: 
wilderness.

    Enacted in 1964, the Wilderness Act established the National 
Wilderness Preservation System to protect the natural environment, 
which today stands at approximately 111 million acres of protected 
land.

    Only Congress can designate new wilderness, and while many have 
supported these designations throughout the country over the years, as 
is the case with H.R. 3971, which would expand the Flatside Wilderness 
Area in Arkansas, new designation also come with concerns regarding 
limitations on access for historical and traditional uses.

    H.R. 8206 serves as an example of these potential concerns and 
conflicts. This legislation would prohibit any future wilderness 
designations within the boundaries of the Big Cypress National Preserve 
in Florida.

    My understanding is that this bill was developed as a response to 
the National Park Service draft Backcountry Access Plan for future 
management in this area.

    In particular, the Miccosukee Tribe has expressed specific concerns 
about their traditional access and use of Big Cypress.

    I look forward to hearing directly from Chairman Talbert Cypress 
and hope that we can identify a solution that allows the planning 
process to proceed.

    With that, I yield back.

                                 [all]
