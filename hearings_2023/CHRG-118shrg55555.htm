                     REFORM THE PERMITTING PROCESS



                    FOR ENERGY AND MINERAL PROJECTS

                              ----------                              


                         THURSDAY, MAY 11, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:00 a.m. in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin 
III, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. Today we are going to continue our 
conversation about the opportunities for and the need to reform 
the permitting process for all types of energy projects. We 
have talked with the Secretaries of Energy and Interior and the 
FERC Commissioners about this important topic over the last 
several weeks. But this effort to improve our permitting 
process really took off last summer, when I secured a 
commitment from the President and Democratic Congressional 
Leadership to support permitting reform and bring a bill up for 
a vote, and we did. After working with a small bipartisan group 
of members, making some adjustments to incorporate feedback 
from Republicans that both sides could accept, the Senate voted 
on the resulting legislation in December of last year.
    Forty Democrats and seven Republicans supported that bill, 
which sets permitting deadlines for energy and mineral 
projects, expedites litigation, requires different agencies to 
coordinate on reviews, ensures that we get two billion cubic 
feet per day of natural gas into the market through the 
Mountain Valley Pipeline, and much more. This is the only 
comprehensive energy permitting reform legislation that has 
received bipartisan support in the Senate. It received support 
from a majority of members on this Committee and both the 
Chairman and Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works 
Committee. I reintroduced that bill last week to kick-start 
bipartisan negotiations again this Congress because we 
absolutely need to get permitting reform done for the good of 
our country. Is the bill perfect? Absolutely not. Could we go 
further? Of course. But I was the only Democrat on record 
supporting the majority of the provisions that Republicans are 
pushing that weren't included in our compromise legislation.
    But to get legislation through the Senate, we have got to 
get 60 votes. That is the process. We can't let the perfect--or 
the politics--be the enemy of the good and continue to live 
with an outdated permitting process that kills much-needed 
projects across the spectrum. Whether you are more inclined 
towards renewables or fossil, towards pipelines or transmission 
lines, you can't get anything done unless we can do it in a 
timely fashion. And we desperately need to get permitting 
reform done for our country to maintain its status as the 
leader of the free world. So I am happy that there is a strong 
bipartisan interest in permitting reform in this Committee and 
this Congress. We all know that to build an energy system fit 
for the 21st century, we will need to ensure our permitting 
agencies are conducting effective reviews focused on the most 
important issues, getting to decisions much faster, and put a 
stop to this endless second-guessing of those decisions in 
court.
    Now, I am a believer in an all-of-the-above energy policy, 
which is what Congress has consistently reaffirmed as American 
energy policy through the Energy Act of 2020, the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, and the Inflation Reduction Act. We know 
that we will need to produce and transport more energy than 
ever in the coming decades, and that is energy of all types. 
The Energy Information Administration indicates that the demand 
for our fossil energy--oil, gas, and coal--will increasingly be 
driven by our allies and trading partners who want a reliable 
supplier able to produce cleaner than anywhere else. So this 
means we will need to build pipelines, export terminals, and 
more energy transportation infrastructure, or our partners may 
have to source their fuel from other countries that do not 
share our democratic or environmental values. I think the only 
thing you need to look at is the Ukraine War.
    As all four FERC Commissioners told us last week, we cannot 
eliminate coal today or in the near future if we want to have a 
reliable electric grid system. We also need to mine and process 
minerals here in the United States if we are actually serious 
about lessening our current dependence on China for energy 
technologies. If we do not, this dependence will get worse. I 
have been clear that I do not agree with the Administration's 
effort to push an accelerated climate agenda in a way that puts 
our transportation sector and some components of our energy 
sector in the hands of China. As the superpower of the world, 
with abundant natural resources and a strong workforce, there 
is no reason that we should be asking others to do what we 
won't do for ourselves. But producing the American energy that 
we need--and the world needs--is nearly impossible with our 
current permitting system. For example, it takes decades to 
permit a new mine. It is a failure, and it is setting us up to 
rely on countries who are hostile to our way of life. You know 
we have a broken system when getting a domestic mine permitted 
in less than ten years is like winning the lottery, but it 
takes less than a year to begin importing products full of 
critical minerals mined in a way much more harmful to the 
environment or processed in China.
    The Mountain Valley Pipeline has been undergoing permitting 
litigation for more than eight years. That includes eight NEPA 
reviews and nine court cases in the Fourth Circuit. Siting, 
permitting, litigation, and decision-making on how to pay for 
long-distance, high-voltage transmission lines tie up these 
projects for over a decade, if they ever get built. These 
challenges threaten the reliability of our grid system. Some 
reforms will help all sectors, such as setting and enforcing 
deadlines, expediting litigation, et cetera. Some will require 
sector-specific fixes, but no energy sector is immune to 
permitting roadblocks, despite every Administration and 
Congress in recent memory and every sector of the energy 
industry identifying permitting reform as a vital need. The 
problem is getting worse, not better. As shown in the chart 
behind me, we are slowing down in building both pipelines and 
transmission lines. According to the Energy Information 
Administration, in 2022, we had the lowest amount of FERC-
regulated natural gas pipeline infrastructure built since EIA 
began tracking in 1995.
    [The chart referred to follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT

    The Chairman. And the story is the same on transmission. In 
2021, we built the fewest miles of high-voltage transmission in 
any year going back to 2010. We all know it's possible to do 
better than five, ten, or fifteen-year timelines without 
bypassing important environmental protections and community 
input. Our allies in Australia and Canada have permitting 
processes designed to finish in three years or less. And in 
Europe, which has a reputation for being even more difficult to 
build in than in the U.S., the weaponization of energy by 
Russia forced them to realize that they have a problem. 
Recently, the EU has rolled out new targets for timelines--nine 
months to two years for energy, manufacturing, and minerals 
projects. I repeat, nine months to up to two years maximum for 
energy, manufacturing, and minerals projects.
    Our Committee has a real responsibility to address energy 
and minerals permitting reform. It's the agencies under our 
jurisdiction doing most of the permitting for these projects. 
Over 80 percent of NEPA Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) 
for energy and minerals projects are completed by agencies 
under this Committee's jurisdiction--and that is almost half of 
the EISs done across the entire Federal Government. 
Environmental Impact Statements are extremely cumbersome and 
take an awfully long time, and are the most intensive form of 
NEPA reviews intended for major projects with the potential for 
significant impacts. They take 4.5 years on average, and often 
several years beyond that. So the agencies our Committee 
oversees are responsible for a large portion of the Federal 
Government's most significant and time-consuming environmental 
reviews. Members of this Committee have a wide range of views 
regarding what the future of American energy should look like, 
but no matter what you want to build, it simply takes too long.
    This is why the bill that I introduced and 47 bipartisan 
senators voted for last year would set enforceable timelines 
for agencies to complete reviews, limit the length of these 
reviews, and require agencies to coordinate on one government-
wide, simultaneous review of multiple, uncoordinated reviews. 
It would accelerate the court process for energy projects by 
requiring courts to set these cases for expedited review, and 
it would shorten deadlines to bring lawsuits from six years to 
less than six months. This will provide certainty that if 
agencies approve a project, it will not then get delayed by 
endless litigation, and the bill would also make sure agencies 
spend most of the time on the most important reviews by 
ensuring that simple projects are not subject to drawn-out 
reviews.
    I was pleased to see similar ideas in the bills recently 
introduced by my Republican colleagues and my Ranking Member, 
Senator Barrasso. On electric transmission, our bill recognizes 
that states have primary authority to site and allocate the 
cost for transmission projects. But we made reasonable 
improvements to FERC's authority to step in in cases where 
states cannot reach agreement after one year, so that long-
distance, interstate transmission that is in the national 
interest and needed for the reliability of our nation's grid 
can still move forward. And I have heard my Republican friends' 
concerns about how costs are allocated, so we put language in 
there to make sure that only those who actually see electric 
benefits in their states would be required to pay, and that is 
going to be proportional.
    By the way, even the oil and gas industry agrees that 
electric transmission reforms are a central part of 
comprehensive permitting packages. Six of the leading oil and 
gas trade groups sent us a letter this morning outlining their 
top priorities and acknowledging the importance of pairing 
transmission reforms with steps like improving NEPA and 
judicial reforms. So it's time for us to all roll up our 
sleeves and do our jobs. As the Chairman of the Committee, I am 
committed to continuing to convene my colleagues for open 
dialogue and negotiations. At this point, we had the 
legislation I filed that received bipartisan support, the House 
and Senate Republican proposals, and Senator Carper's 
forthcoming proposal on the table.
    Now, just as we did with the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
bill, we all need to sit down and negotiate in good faith. We 
need to take our names off the bill and go back to a bipartisan 
permitting reform bill. That is the only way that we can take 
politics out of this. It's not me. It's not John. It's not any 
of our colleagues. It's getting permitting done for the sake of 
our country. So I will do everything I can to make that happen. 
And make no mistake, actually getting something done will 
require a lot of compromise and prioritization. Many ideas that 
are prioritized for some senators are strongly opposed by 
others. We need to respect that in a civil manner. But we can't 
let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This is our time to 
do this.
    I am grateful to our witnesses who have joined us today to 
help discuss what this Committee's priorities should be for 
permitting reform. They represent a diverse group of interests 
who all stand to gain from common-sense, bipartisan energy 
permitting reform.
    With that, I turn to my friend, Senator John Barrasso, for 
his opening remarks.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman, for 
your very thoughtful remarks. Thanks for holding the hearing 
today.
    You know, I think back 13 years ago, 2010, nearly two years 
after President Obama signed his economic stimulus bill into 
law, he seemed to be shocked to discover something that every 
project developer already knew, and that is, he said, ``There 
seems to be no such thing as shovel-ready projects.'' And that 
is because it can take almost forever to get a federal permit. 
In the 13 years since President Obama's comment, things have 
not really gotten any better, and under the Biden 
Administration, in my opinion, and in many opinions, they have 
gotten a lot worse. Our federal permitting process moves in 
slow motion--too often, no motion at all. Even if a project 
makes it through the thicket of red tape, it can expect to face 
years of costly litigation after the permitting process. The 
more time it takes, the more money it costs, the more the 
likelihood that a developer is just going to pull the plug and 
not proceed with the project. That means that investments 
aren't made. It means jobs do not materialize. It means new 
energy and mineral production just does not occur.
    Late last year, the Economist published this chart.
    [The chart referred to follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT

    Senator Barrasso. And it shows that for the past several 
years, more miles of interstate natural gas pipelines have been 
canceled than have been built. More miles canceled than have 
been built. And as a country we have become better at canceling 
than at building. The result is what you would expect--higher 
prices, abandoned projects, and stubborn inflation. And it is 
an absolute disgrace. So last week, Senator Capito and I 
introduced legislation to expedite the permitting process while 
preserving environmental safeguards. The House has passed 
comprehensive permitting reform. Chairman Manchin has also 
reintroduced his bill from last year, so there is no shortage 
of ideas. That makes it all the more important to debate these 
ideas and move legislation through regular order. I am glad, 
Mr. Chairman, you are committed to doing that because we have 
to get it right.
    Getting it right means adhering to some fundamental 
principles. First, the legislation must benefit the entire 
country, not a narrow range of special interests, favored 
technologies, or a limited group of projects. Reforms must 
apply equally to all energy sources, traditional and 
alternative. Second, it must include enforceable timelines to 
ensure environmental reviews do not drag on for years. Third, 
it must place limitations on legal challenges to prevent 
endless litigation intended to kill projects. And finally, it 
must stop the executive branch from hijacking the permitting 
process to advance its own narrow and frequently extreme 
agenda. No longer should the Biden Administration get away with 
reinterpreting legislative language to frustrate the will of 
Congress. Our amendments must leave no ambiguity in what the 
law requires.
    The bills that Senator Capito and I introduced last week 
meet these criteria. My bill, the Spur Permitting of 
Underdeveloped Resources--the SPUR Act--is co-sponsored by 
every member of this Committee on Energy that are Republicans. 
Our bill will revitalize America's energy sector, lower costs 
for families, and reduce our dependency on China and on Russia. 
It will hold the Secretary of the Interior to her legal 
obligations on oil, natural gas, and coal leasing on federal 
lands. No longer should this or any other administration be 
able to deny, defy, and disregard the law. Our bill will ensure 
access to minerals essential for renewable and for battery 
technologies. The United States and Wyoming, my home state in 
particular, are blessed with large deposits of minerals. 
Responsible use of these resources enhances our national 
security.
    Lastly, Mr. Chairman, our bill will provide companies a 
more predictable permitting process for pipelines, for 
liquefied natural gas export facilities, and electric 
transmission lines. Mr. Chairman, we can't let this opportunity 
pass without enacting anything less than comprehensive reform. 
Now, I believe we can pass bipartisan legislation that 
unleashes American energy and American mineral production that 
creates good-paying jobs, that lowers consumer prices, and 
boosts our national security. So today's hearing, Mr. Chairman, 
is an important step in that direction.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.
    And now, we are going to hear from our panel.
    We have Mr. Jason Grumet, President and CEO of the American 
Clean Power Association.
    We have Ms. Elizabeth Shuler, President of the American 
Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
    We have Mr. Rich Nolan, President and CEO of the National 
Mining Association.
    And we have Mr. Paul Ulrich, Vice President of Jonah Energy 
and a member of the Wyoming Energy Authority Board of 
Directors.
    It's great to have all of you here.
    And Mr. Grumet, we will start with you first.

                STATEMENT OF JASON GRUMET, CEO, 
                AMERICAN CLEAN POWER ASSOCIATION

    Mr. Grumet. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, it is really an 
honor to be here with you and Senator Barrasso and this entire 
Committee, and of course, the colleagues here at this panel.
    I am Jason Grumet. I am the CEO of the American Clean Power 
Association. Our 800 companies provide utility-scale clean 
power from all forms and also spend a tremendous amount of time 
and resources investing in battery storage and transmission--
when we are allowed to build it. I should also note, Mr. 
Chairman, that the largest producers of clean power in this 
country also often have commercial interests in oil resources, 
natural gas, nuclear, and a wide variety of energy sources. So 
we come to you with a big tent. I have already apologized to 
your staff for the 20 pages of detailed testimony we submitted. 
With your indulgence, if I breathe a couple times, I may 
transgress on the red light by 90 seconds or so. So just a 
little self-awareness up front.
    The Chairman. Do your best.
    Mr. Grumet. Mr. Chairman, we have seen what this nation can 
do when innovation, investment, and our world's greatest 
workforce is supported with rational, sound public policy. In 
2005 and 2007, this Committee led landmark pieces of 
legislation that reclaimed America's role as an energy 
superpower, improved public health, and dramatically reduced 
greenhouse gas emissions. I believe we are on the precipice of 
another breakthrough, where we can combine the strength of 
traditional energy resources with massive deployment of 
renewable power and storage--if we can simply get out of our 
way and build it. So despite differences and occasional rancor, 
I think your two opening statements, Mr. Chairman and Mr. 
Ranking Member, demonstrated that we are in fact coalescing 
around a shared vision, and that is a vision that prizes 
innovation and investment over regulation and deprivation.
    I would comment to you and to Senator Murkowski that I 
think fondly about the many, many times you invited me to 
testify here, probably between about 2005 and 2015, where I 
profoundly failed to convince you and your colleagues of the 
benefits of carbon pricing as the anchor of American energy 
policy. And I credit you and this Committee with the 2020 
Energy Act, which set forth a true imagination of an all-of-
the-above innovation policy. I also note, Senator Barrasso, the 
pleasure I had testifying before you and Senator Carper in 2020 
on, I believe it was the American Transportation Innovation 
Act, and my favorite hearing title ever--``Better, Faster, 
Cheaper, Smarter, and Stronger: Infrastructure Development 
Opportunities to Drive Economic Recovery and Resiliency.'' So 
you didn't bury the lead. But what you did at that hearing, 
along with your colleagues, was talk about the critical 
importance of permit reform and the ways in which that would 
also improve environmental quality.
    So I believe that these efforts, three years ago, enabled 
the bipartisan breakthrough on the infrastructure bill as well 
as the transition from regulation to innovation that has guided 
the IRA and our conversation here today, and so, the 
breakthrough. Now that we actually have line of sight to 
better, to cleaner, to cheaper, to smarter, and stronger, we of 
course want it faster. So what I would like to do now is say a 
few words about some proposals around NEPA reform as well as 
transmission siting, and building that, I think, can actually 
move us in that direction.
    So first on NEPA--we support the series of proposals that 
have kind of anchored the House and Senate legislation, 
Senators Manchin, Barrasso, Capito, as well as H.R. 1, as well 
as what the Administration put forward yesterday. 
Fundamentally, it includes time limits on NEPA actions, 
elimination of duplicative reviews, and giving lead federal 
agencies actual authority to drive the process. We also share 
your view and commitment that none of these changes will 
undermine bedrock protections in our environmental laws. And 
while NEPA reform is necessary, it is unfortunately not 
sufficient, and so, I want to close by discussing the 
imperative to strengthen and expand our electric grid.
    Now, this is a topic where Congress and ACP's diverse 
membership have both struggled to build consensus. And so, I 
want to offer some ideas that hopefully will stir the pot in a 
constructive direction. The data is overwhelming that absent 
strengthened and expanded transmission capacity, we are going 
to fall short of achieving our climate, our economic, and our 
security goals. Recent years have also demonstrated and made us 
painfully aware that our inability to transfer power between 
regions can literally be a matter of life and death in 
emergency situations. So over the past several months, we have 
challenged ACP's ``big tent'' membership to confront our 
internal differences over permitting, planning, and paying, and 
have provided a discussion framework, which we attached to the 
back of our testimony.
    And I will say a word about interstate siting and then cost 
allocation.
    In 17 years, the backstop authority enabling federal action 
to permit projects of national significance has been used 
successfully exactly never. And if it were employed, it would 
take a decade or longer to site and permit a long-distance 
line. So today, we are proposing reforms that can ensure timely 
action while respecting the role the states still play in this 
process. Our proposal would reduce the time required to permit 
this limited number of interstate lines from a decade to 
between three and four years, and ensure that this to-date 
unused authority would serve the purpose Congress intended. I 
need to note that while supporting these reforms, many ACP 
members believe that providing FERC with plenary authority to 
directly permit these high-impact lines would be a more direct 
and efficient path to increase grid reliance and low-cost, 
clean power.
    On cost allocation, while FERC Order No. 1000 created a 
workable approach for the lines that exist within a region, the 
process for planning for transmission that spans more than one 
region is unworkable. It subjects project developers to an 
impossible triple hurdle, requiring separate approvals by each 
region and then a ``coordinated, interregional approval 
process,'' which is literally designed to fail because 
different regions apply different evaluation metrics and have 
no obligation or incentive to consider full project benefits. 
If this is hard to envision, I would like to think of it as the 
efficiency of the United Nations, just take away the 
translators.
    Finally, Mr. Chairman, the proposal we are offering for 
consideration provides a system that is designed to succeed by 
obligating regions to jointly evaluate these lines following a 
set of criteria established by FERC, so the true benefits of 
these lines will be, in fact, appreciated and not ignored. Now, 
in the last 24 hours, some friends and even some ACP family 
have criticized our proposal, arguing that even a well-designed 
path forward will fall victim to parochial interests. Others 
have embraced the pragmatism of the approach, while suggesting 
that more is needed. For example, adding a minimum transfer 
capacity requirement. And still, others believe that even this 
approach inappropriately transgresses upon state and federal 
prerogative. So I am not aware of a single one of my 800 
members who believe we are proposing a perfect solution, but 
everyone recognizes the status quo is harming our national 
interest, and are eager to accelerate constructive debate.
    In closing, Mr. Chairman, all energy technologies have 
weaknesses. I am convinced that if we combine the collective 
strength of the diverse array of energy resources in this 
country, we can create a new energy economy by mid-century that 
addresses our economic security and climate imperatives. At the 
end of the day, this process has to do two things. First, the 
solution needs to work. It has to be meaningful. And second, it 
needs to pass. ACP is eager to work with this Committee to come 
up with a practical consensus that can open the next chapter of 
America's energy dominance.
    I appreciate the time.

          STATEMENT OF RICH NOLAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 
                  NATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION

    Mr. Nolan. Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, and members of the Committee, it is a pleasure to be 
here. I will endeavor to stick with the time limit.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Mr. Nolan. We will see how it goes.
    The National Mining Association appreciates the opportunity 
to discuss the urgent need to strengthen our domestic supply 
chains, to secure American energy resources, and to protect 
reliable electricity generation. Domestic mining conducted 
under world-leading environmental safety and labor standards is 
essential to virtually every supply chain, and the right 
policies are needed to unlock our full potential from 
resources--not overseas, but right here at home. Uranium and 
coal, which provide 40 percent of the nation's electricity, are 
key sources of baseload power--generation that is available 24 
hours a day, seven days a week. Copper, cobalt, lithium, and 
silver are essential components to EV batteries and the 
electrification of the economy. Seventy percent of the world's 
steel requires metallurgical coal for its production, and it 
takes 100 metric tons of met coal to build a wind turbine. 
Barite and moly support oil and gas production. In short, a 
strong domestic mining industry makes America's energy security 
possible.
    The mining industry is also a source of high-paying, 
stable, and often unionized jobs that provide generous 
benefits. We directly employ more than 475,000 people who make 
an average wage of $85,000 a year. These direct jobs support an 
additional 800,000 indirect jobs. Each year, our industry 
generates more than $119 billion in revenues for the U.S. 
economy, paying more than $18 billion in federal, state, and 
local taxes. Last year, federal coal production produced over 
$576 million in revenue for federal and state governments. 
Demand for mined materials is expanding exponentially, but we 
have not seen corresponding actions to support increased 
production of these critical mined materials. Instead, we have 
deepened our reliance on foreign sources of mined materials. 
And in 2022, the U.S. reached its highest level of mineral 
import reliance. We are more dependent now than ever on China, 
Russia, and other countries for mined materials we should be 
sourcing right here at home.
    Each new announcement of a blocked domestic mine locks in 
our competitive weakness and weakens our national security. 
Without permitting reform, we will be watching the global 
competition for minerals and energy control from the sidelines. 
Providing additional funding or tax incentives for programs 
that will never be approved by our government does nothing. It 
takes an average of ten years to permit a new mine, one of the 
longest permitting timelines in the world. As Mining 
Subcommittee Chair Cortez Masto has long said, ``We can protect 
the environment and still do the mining that is necessary.'' 
However, our unwieldy and needlessly complex permitting process 
can trap promising mining projects in the limbo of duplicative 
and endless costly reviews. On federal lands, U.S. coal 
producers are experiencing a moratorium on leasing for thermal 
coal and delays in granting metallurgical coal leases. Thermal 
coal producers are feeling the impact of federal regulation, 
issued at a rate that experts, such as FERC, warn threatens our 
grid reliability. Chairman Manchin has consistently stated 
there is an overwhelming bipartisan recognition that our 
current permitting system is not working. NMA firmly agrees.
    This Congress has a unique opportunity to enact meaningful 
permitting legislation. The American Energy Security Act, the 
SPUR Act, and the RESTART Act are common-sense solutions. These 
bills prioritize development and certainty to mining 
communities, companies, and manufacturers and investors. 
Establishing lead agencies, coordinating state and federal 
processes, improving the timeliness of reviews, and maintaining 
mineral access and shoring up the reliability of the electric 
grid are all essential. We have abundant mineral and coal 
resources right here at home, and the U.S. mining industry 
stands ready to supply our country with a full range of mined 
materials needed to move our nation forward.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

    The Chairman. Thank you, sir.
    And now, we will go to President Shuler.

     STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH H. SHULER, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN 
  FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS

    Ms. Shuler. Thank you, Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member 
Barrasso, and members of the Committee, for the chance to speak 
to you today on this very important topic. I am bringing the 
voices of 12.5 million working people with me into the room 
today, 60 different unions across every sector of the economy, 
here with me as part of the AFL-CIO.
    Permitting reform is a top priority for the AFL-CIO. Every 
job in every part of the energy sector and the manufacturing 
sector depends on permitting and siting--mining of critical 
minerals that we need for the transition, electricity 
transmission which is key to expanding renewable energy, 
pipelines, and other infrastructure that we need for hydrogen 
and CCS, manufacturing, power generation, especially wind, 
solar, and nuclear.
    Thanks to the Biden Administration and this Congress, we 
have a historic opportunity to create more than a million good 
union jobs, make our infrastructure world-leading, and set our 
country on track for secure domestic supply chains in mining, 
energy, and manufacturing. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 
the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act are 
that opportunity. They set us on a path toward a clean energy, 
high-tech economy. Permitting reform is absolutely necessary to 
realize the full job creation and emissions reduction potential 
of these three bills. Full implementation of the IRA alone will 
create more than a million new jobs and bring down emissions 
across the economy. But without permitting reform, job creation 
will be more modest and emissions could actually go up.
    So let me give you an example of how delays in permitting 
can affect job creation and emissions. The TransWest express 
transmission project is a $3 billion transmission line. Once 
built, it will add 3,000 megawatts of transmission capacity 
across four states to ship more renewable power to areas of 
high demand in the West. Construction will create approximately 
700 International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers jobs alone. 
It took 18 years for this project to get final approval. 
Eighteen years of additional costs for the developers and 18 
years of lost economic opportunities for workers during this 
period. I mentioned construction and manufacturing, but I want 
to point out that this issue affects all of us, every worker 
and every American. Do we want our children to be able to drink 
clean water, hold off the worst impacts of climate change, 
rebuild our roads, our bridges, our crumbling infrastructure, 
set up our economy to win for the next 100 years? I think that 
answer is yes. All of that requires us acting with urgency and 
justice.
    And if I can leave you with one thought today, it is that 
we can do both. We can make this process more effective and 
efficient. We can make sure that good union jobs lift up black 
workers, brown workers, vulnerable communities, Americans who 
have been left behind for far too long. When things move too 
slowly, when projects take over a decade to permit, we all get 
hurt. Fewer good-paying union jobs, fewer opportunities for 
workers of color, and progress on union jobs and clean energy 
that is just too slow for communities that desperately need 
change. I want to be very clear: that does not come at the 
expense of the rights of states, tribes, communities, or other 
stakeholders to have an effective voice in the process or to 
formally intervene. Public participation is key. It is a key 
feature of the permitting process. So we urge Congress to 
preserve it while also significantly improving the efficiency 
of the process.
    But I can say unequivocally, on behalf of the labor 
movement, we need three things. We need, number one, certainty. 
We need to know when a final decision will be made and that it 
is, in fact, final. That certainty is what allows companies to 
make commitments to suppliers, to contractors, and workers. It 
is how communities can really believe that investment and jobs 
are coming. The second thing, we need speed. We need to deploy 
a full range of clean energy technology much faster than we 
ever have, and this requires more transmission and more 
critical minerals so we can have secure, domestic supply chains 
and not depend on China. And third, we need consistency, as 
much as possible. We are looking for a standardized process 
that can apply to all forms of permitting for all technologies. 
So the bottom line here is that we have a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity right now, thanks to the IIJA and the IRA, that you 
and the Biden Administration worked so hard to get through. We 
can protect ourselves from the climate crisis, bring justice to 
workers and communities, create more than a million new, good 
union jobs, and set our entire country up for success, and 
American workers are ready to do our part.
    Thank you so much.

    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Now, Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    I would like to introduce Mr. Paul Ulrich, who is here as 
one of our witnesses for today's hearing. Paul, thanks for 
traveling in from Pinedale, Wyoming to be with us here in the 
nation's capital. Paul is on the Board of Directors, and is the 
former President of the Wyoming Energy Authority, which leads 
our state's energy strategy. Paul is also Vice President of 
Government and Regulatory Affairs at Jonah Energy, one of the 
largest natural gas producers in Wyoming. Paul has worked in 
the oil and natural gas sector for almost 25 years. He is an 
expert on operating on federal lands. Before his career in the 
energy sector, Paul was an intelligence specialist in the 
United States Navy.
    We are deeply grateful for your service to the country and 
to the State of Wyoming as well as for an opportunity to hear 
from you today. Please proceed.

STATEMENT OF PAUL ULRICH, VICE PRESIDENT, JONAH ENERGY; MEMBER, 
          WYOMING ENERGY AUTHORITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS

    Mr. Ulrich. Thank you, Chairman Manchin, and a special 
thank you to my U.S. Senator, Ranking Member Barrasso, for the 
invitation to speak. I really appreciate it.
    Jonah Energy is an oil and gas exploration and production 
company, and we operate, as the good Senator said, in the Jonah 
and Pinedale fields up in Wyoming. Our business is producing 
natural gas in an environmentally responsible manner, and I 
think that is critical. I am really immensely proud to be part 
of a team at Jonah Energy with that shared vision, providing 
some of the nation's cleanest natural gas, all on federal 
lands. The Wyoming Energy Authority is responsible for 
advancing our diverse energy strategy--all-of-the-above--in 
Wyoming, and empowering our nation with our goal in Wyoming of 
a net-zero energy mix down the line. Clean natural gas 
projects, wind projects, CO<INF>2</INF> sequestration, 
pipelines, and believe it or not, even wildlife conservation 
efforts are severely limited by unacceptably long review times, 
endless litigation, and ever-changing regulations.
    Today, Congress has an opportunity to lead our nation into 
a cleaner and a lower-carbon economy through meaningful permit 
reform. The world needs affordable and reliable energy, and 
those needs are growing. I think it is important that we also 
acknowledge that all energy sources have an environmental 
impact, and stop the bias against hydrocarbons. It is important 
to recognize the work being done to provide natural gas that is 
produced in a less impactful way, and we get better and better 
and better every day. We must address permitting and litigation 
challenges that continue to hamper our ability to progress both 
domestically and globally. We must also enhance our LNG export 
capacity in order to provide our low-emission American natural 
gas to the world. States in the west with a large amount of 
public land are at a decided disadvantage to other parts of the 
country. Leasing, environmental reviews, permitting, and 
ultimately any source of energy development can take years, if 
not decades longer than on private land.
    Some examples--the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy 
Project--12 years of NEPA permitting. TransWest was just 
discussed. That is critical new infrastructure from Wyoming--
and Wyoming wind--to deliver renewable resources to California, 
Nevada, and Arizona, nearly 15 years of NEPA permitting alone. 
In the past 15 years, the timeframes for environmental analysis 
on oil and gas projects range from 6 to 10, 12 years. The 
average time to process an APD to drill a well has increased by 
124 percent from 2018 to 2022, averaging 271 days. The effects 
of litigation on federal and oil and gas permitting in Wyoming 
are also significant. Several lawsuits challenge lease sales in 
Wyoming as well as lease sales in other states held between 
2015 and 2020. The bottom line is, the effect of these cases is 
that the BLM isn't approving drilling permits or any other 
action on 2.1 million acres of oil and gas leases in Wyoming 
today, and will not be for the foreseeable future. For most of 
these acres, BLM is effectively self-enjoining itself from 
approving development. This is new and unprecedented and has 
effectively halted any development on valid, existing rights, 
with no end in sight.
    Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member--supply matters. With the 
additional natural gas pipelines, we can develop a market for 
low-emission American natural gas that will support global 
climate goals through export as LNG and also support our 
allies' growing need for a reliable source of energy. And we 
can build this infrastructure that enhances our existing 
natural gas backbone and provides for the potential of green 
hydrogen and ammonia export.
    So recommendations: enact meaningful leasing and permitting 
reform; amend, strengthen, and protect our foundational energy 
statutes; limit or eliminate the ability of agencies to enact 
moratoriums or other administrative roadblocks; and as always, 
adhere to enforceable deadlines and strengthen our mandate of 
multiple use; expedite judicial review periods; limit venue 
shopping; enact a reasonable statute of limitations; and 
certainly require agencies to rigorously defend their decisions 
in a timely manner. And obviously, Mr. Chairman, Ranking 
Member, we want to prioritize and accelerate approval for new 
interstate natural gas pipelines, LNG terminals, and related 
infrastructure.
    In closing, Wyoming resources support our national strength 
and our security in a fundamental way. We are also leading 
efforts to significantly reduce environmental impacts from all 
sources of energy. We can and must work together to achieve 
meaningful permitting reform. It is necessary to achieve our 
full potential of energy reliability and security, as honestly, 
we in Wyoming, and we in this nation, lead the globe in a 
cleaner energy evolution.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ranking Member.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Ulrich follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT

    
    The Chairman. Thank you all for your testimony. I 
appreciate it very much. I am going to ask very quick questions 
because we only have a limited time.
    Have you all seen an uptick in the last year or two since 
we have passed pieces of monumental legislation--Bipartisan 
Infrastructure, IRA--have you seen more investments, more 
activity, more desire to do more in America than ever before, 
or have you not?
    Mr. Grumet. Mr. Chairman, uptick would be an 
understatement. There has been a surge of activity in just the 
last nine months. Private sector capital, $150 billion of 
announced investment in clean energy. Forty-seven domestic 
manufacturing facilities between September and April. Eleven 
more since we put this--we can't put the report out monthly 
anymore. We have to update it weekly. So there is an incredible 
opportunity, but I have to say, as you pointed out, it's going 
to get harder, not easier, unless we open up the space.
    The Chairman. Well, we all know that there will be a lot of 
money that will be stranded and never get out the door because 
we ran out of time and the time element to do the things to be 
done and we will still be trying to figure out how to permit 
and nobody will be happy.
    Mr. Nolan, real quick.
    Mr. Nolan. Absolutely. We have seen a rush--a gold rush, as 
a matter of fact, in some battery materials investments in 
mines in the United States. However, the permitting juggernaut 
is proving to be extremely difficult. I believe we learned just 
yesterday that only, really, two mines have been approved, the 
rest have been some exploration work----
    The Chairman. So you are seeing the uptick, basically in 
renewables, but not the aggressiveness as far as the uptick in 
fossil?
    Mr. Nolan. Correct.
    The Chairman. Ms. Shuler.
    Ms. Shuler. I would say yes. We are talking a lot at the 
national level about the opportunity coming our way and trying 
to ramp-up training and workforce readiness and looking at that 
talent pipeline that is going to be needed. But I will say, you 
know, we have heard promises before from the Federal 
Government, and workers are, you know--the best way that we can 
show them that this is different is to get the shovels in the 
ground and get the projects moving. Make it a reality.
    The Chairman. Mr. Ulrich.
    Mr. Ulrich. Mr. Chairman, the desire is there. Certainly, 
in Wyoming, we are in an all-of-the-above state. We are eager, 
ready, willing, and able to get to work producing some of the 
cleanest energy, whether it be natural gas, coal, wind, et 
cetera.
    The Chairman. Well, let me just say this--the people have 
to understand--the IRA legislation was done in a balanced way. 
We have to have the horsepower to run the country for today 
with the investments to develop and mature the technologies for 
tomorrow. And right now, they are having a hard time, you 
follow me? One wants more of this. One wants less of this. One 
wants more of this or less of this. We tied them together so 
that you are not going to be able to put wind or solar anywhere 
unless we are extracting the resources that we have to in a 
balanced way for the ten-year period that we all agree that we 
need to stabilize the grid.
    So I would ask all of you, not right now, I could ask you 
to rapid fire, but I want you to think about this. Before we 
end this Committee hearing, I want you to put your top three 
impediments, whether it be for renewables, whether it be for 
gas, oil, and coal, whatever. What are the top three 
impediments that you think need to be--your highest 
priorities--that need to be changed in a permitting bill?
    What we have is, we have different variations of 
permitting. We have things in Senator Barrasso's bill that we 
agree on and maybe have challenges we do not agree on. We have 
things in our bill--they agree or don't agree. We are going to 
figure out what is a bipartisan bill that all of us can agree 
on and come out of this Committee. And that is what will give 
us the momentum we are going to need to make this happen. So 
your input is going to be absolutely, unbelievably helpful for 
us to get through this maze. And as we do it, and I will just 
say for the Committee's sake, we are intending to get this bill 
and have a bill on the floor before we have a recess this 
summer. That is pretty aggressive. We are going to get it done. 
We are going to get it done. It is imperative, and we lead the 
rest of the world.
    So with that, I have, let me see. I had another question. 
And just, I just want to throw this out to you real quickly, 
Mr. Nolan, on hardrock mining--nothing has been changed for 
years. No, I can't believe it. I come from the mining industry 
and understand mining very well. We pay for everything. They 
pay for nothing. There's no royalties. There's no nothing. 
There's no bonding for tailings and this and that. If we are 
going to do mining reform, don't you think it should be done 
across the board, so everyone is treated fair?
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Nolan. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman. I will 
attempt an answer.
    We are happy to work with the Committee in a bipartisan 
way----
    The Chairman. That is all we can ask for.
    Mr. Nolan [continuing]. To improve the process of mining in 
this country to make sure we are globally competitive----
    The Chairman. What we are saying is, basically, simply 
this--when we are mining, we have our waste from our mining. It 
should be done and disposed of in a proper way and reclaimed 
properly. You should have a bond that basically says you will 
do it, and in case you go bankrupt, that bond is sufficient to 
cover what you didn't do. And if you are mining, extracting 
resources that we, the people of America, own under BLM lands, 
shouldn't you pay some royalty, the same you would pay for a 
private owner?
    Mr. Nolan. Happy to work with you, sir.
    The Chairman. Okay.
    I don't think that was a good question, was it? That was 
just pretty much a statement I have been trying to make. I am 
sorry I had to use you for my prop, okay?
    Mr. Nolan. Appreciate it.
    The Chairman. With that, I am going to turn to my Ranking 
Member, Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Ulrich, you know, your testimony described a number of 
obstacles to developing oil and gas on federal lands at home in 
Wyoming. One of the most significant is uncertainty around the 
Bureau of Land Management, their lease sales. Since President 
Biden took office, the Bureau has defied the law and held only, 
what, one lease sale in the last nine quarters? So almost two 
years. What changes to the Bureau's leasing process would be 
most effective in providing some certainty for producers going 
forward?
    Mr. Ulrich. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Barrasso, first 
things first--actually holding quarterly lease sales and 
adhering to that mandate would be critical. Also, a very 
significant issue with the entire NEPA process is layer upon 
layer upon layer of NEPA analysis. If we had up-to-date, 
effective, and timely resource management plans to address all 
of our resources and expedite lands that should and should not 
be leased, that would be very effective as well.
    Senator Barrasso. So before the Bureau can hold an oil and 
gas lease sale, it needs to conduct multiple rounds of 
environmental analysis. The reviews determine which lands are 
open to be leased and under what conditions. Before the Bureau 
can approve drilling permits on these leases, it conducts 
further rounds of environmental analysis. Can you talk about 
this duplicative process and the protracted environmental 
review process in terms of oil and gas production on federal 
lands and explain how Congress can help fix this broken 
process?
    Mr. Ulrich. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Barrasso, the 
process is laborious to say the least. Clearly, prior to lands 
being leased, there is an environmental review. Prior to that, 
there are overreaching resource management plans on federal 
lands that are set in place to guide development and 
conservation and all other environmental resources for a very 
long period of time. Once you get a lease, you either go 
through an EA or a five- to ten-year process for an EIS. After 
that, typically, you will have to go down to an APD level where 
you might need to get an environmental assessment and other 
impact analysis as well.
    So Mr. Chairman, you can see the challenge. If we had 
stronger, more effective resource management plans and we could 
tier from those resource management plans and tier from one 
solid set of environmental reviews, and process quickly with 
hard deadlines, you could save an enormous amount of time 
throughout the entire process.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you.
    Mr. Nolan, the Biden Administration wants to have a 
``carbon-free electric grid by 2035 and a net-zero carbon 
economy by 2050.'' It plans to reach this goal through the 
widespread adoption of electric vehicles and solar and wind 
electric generation. Electric vehicles use over six times more 
minerals than vehicles with internal combustion engines. Solar 
panels require roughly five times more minerals than natural 
gas generation per megawatt-hour. Offshore wind requires 
roughly 12 times more minerals than natural gas generation per 
megawatt-hour. So under the current permitting laws, is there 
any way in the world to meet the President's goals without 
dramatically increasing America's dependence on China and on 
Russia?
    Mr. Nolan. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    Global investment in U.S. mining has dropped in half over 
the past 20 years. Industry surveys on where to invest continue 
to report that the U.S. has lost attractiveness due to the 
uncertainty in the permitting process and the regulatory and 
legal environment and tort system. So I would say, you know, 
the Chinese started this process of investments from mining, 
both at home and overseas, as well as standing up a robust 
processing and smelting platform in China. So they are 20 years 
ahead of us, and it is now time for us to catch up if we are 
going to meet the needs of electrification of the economy and 
the EVs.
    Senator Barrasso. So how critically important is access to 
federal lands right here in the United States for future 
mineral production in this country if you are going to want to 
meet these goals that the Administration has come up with?
    Mr. Nolan. Incredibly important. The minerals are where 
they are. We don't get to decide that. There are certain areas 
that we have to look out for and be very careful with, and we 
are. We have the highest labor/environmental standards in the 
world here at home. So your point is well taken.
    Senator Barrasso. Mr. Grumet, do you disagree with anything 
that Mr. Nolan just said?
    Mr. Grumet. I appreciate the opportunity, Senator. No--we 
agree both with the frame of your question and Mr. Nolan's 
answer. And I think that fundamentally our only opportunity, 
not just to achieve our climate goals, but our security goals, 
is going to require significant investments in infrastructure, 
in mining, in production, in manufacturing. And I think that is 
good news for the country.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Now we have Senator King.
    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    As I listen to this discussion, I can't help but be 
reminded of an incident in the Old Testament that isn't widely 
known. When God came to Moses and said, ``Moses, I have good 
news and bad news.'' Moses said, ``What's the good news, God?'' 
God said, ``I am going to enable you to part the waters of the 
Red Sea and let my people go free. Then the parted waters of 
the Red Sea will recommence and bury Pharaoh's army.'' Moses 
said, ``That's wonderful, God. What's the bad news?'' God said, 
``You prepare the environmental impact statement.''
    [Laughter.]
    Senator King. I think it's important, as I listen to the 
discussion here today, no one, not a single witness and no one 
at this dais has talked about lowering environmental standards. 
I have not heard a word about that. When I was Governor of 
Maine, my mantra was the highest environmental standards in the 
country and the most timely and predictable permitting process. 
Those two things are not inconsistent, and the outline of what 
we are discussing here today, it seems to me, is pretty clear--
deadlines, some limitation on the length of time that 
litigation takes, one-stop shopping so that there is a rational 
process that's not serial, but parallel. The outline is pretty 
clear.
    I come at this as a person who has been involved in the 
environmental movement for 40 years. In order to achieve our 
environmental goals, we have to build things. You cannot love 
EVs and hate lithium mines. This is a national security issue 
as well as an environmental issue. Eighty-seven percent of the 
lithium today in use in EV batteries, the processed lithium 
comes from China. That is a national security issue. It is 
also--we are talking about environmental issues--Bill McKibben 
had a very important article just a week ago in Mother Jones. 
The name of the article is, ``Yes in Our Backyards.'' And he 
talks about his evolution as an environmental leader that 
started from blocking things in the 60's and 70's and realizing 
that in order to achieve an environmental future, whether it is 
transmission or mining critical minerals, in order to achieve a 
green energy future, we have to build things. And so I welcome 
the testimony that you all have provided today. The 18 years 
for the transmission line is a perfect example.
    Whenever my staff tells me it's going to take a couple of 
years to do something--I will share this with you--I always 
remind them that Eisenhower retook Europe in 11 months. That 
was a pretty daunting task. And I believe that what we need to 
do is talk about whether it should be two years or three years 
or what it should be, and also shorten the time limit to file 
litigation, as the Chairman said, the litigation should be on a 
fast-track docket. Not to deny people their voice, but to be 
sure that they speak up in a timely way because we cannot 
achieve the environmental goals that many of us share without 
permitting reform.
    So one specific question--Mr. Grumet, the Federal 
Permitting Council--I am worried about the future of that. Do 
you see that as a useful organization? Could they be the 
wrangler here that could help us to move this process forward?
    Mr. Grumet. Thank you, Senator King.
    I think FPISC, the Permitting Council, has actually proven 
shockingly effective, right? I think if you look at things 
like, I guess it was the SunZia line, a big power line that had 
been stuck for about 15 years. There were a lot of DOD 
concerns. It got put on the dashboard and it got done in two 
years. So I think bringing that kind of focus, you know, you 
manage what you measure. And so, I think we have joked that at 
times we have had challenges when it comes to science, and 
sometimes we are having challenges when it comes to math, 
right? We need to have actual limitations to ensure that we get 
these projects built.
    I think what the Administration released yesterday also 
confirms this idea that a two-year expectation, regardless of 
the number of agencies involved, is appropriate. So I think 
FPISC having authority to drive that process forward makes a 
lot of sense.
    Senator King. What about shortening the time period for 
litigation from years to months?
    Mr. Grumet. I don't think we have a formal position on 
judicial reform, but I will note that no deadlines, which 
basically allows a six-year window to challenge a process, 
seems a little unnecessary. I think that the FAST Act, which 
moved that deadline to two years for transportation projects 
seems like a constructive direction. I know Senator Manchin's 
legislation has even stricter--so I can't give you a month, but 
72 is probably too many.
    Senator King. I think one of the things that is important 
to realize here is that we are all talking about projects that 
get delayed or take a long time, and it's a lengthy and 
cumbersome process. What we don't know are all the projects 
that never even get to the stage of being proposed, the 
opportunity cost, if you will, because if a utility or a 
developer or a mining company is contemplating a project, one 
of their considerations is how long will it take and how much 
will it cost before I can actually start to realize any return 
on the investment.
    So I think, Mr. Chairman, this is an important hearing. I 
appreciate your bringing it forward, and as a card-carrying 
environmentalist, I look forward to working with you to solve 
this problem. Thank you.
    The Chairman. You are a pragmatist.
    Anyway, we have Senator Hyde-Smith next.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    We are certainly at a critical moment in time with 
permitting reform, and I am from Mississippi. For the past two 
years, we have seen the negative effects of permitting delays 
on domestic energy production, and consequently, the high 
energy prices paid by American families and American industry, 
American businesses. But for issues such as offshore oil and 
gas leasing, to NEPA reform and onshore electric transmission, 
permitting should be streamlined to get us back on track to 
becoming energy independent.
    Mr. Grumet, with respect to transmission facilities, there 
are proposals under consideration that would limit a state's 
role in these projects that are deemed by the Federal 
Government to be of national interest. What roles do you 
believe states should have in planning electric transmission 
projects, and do you think it's appropriate to reduce or 
eliminate the state's ability to participate in that planning, 
especially if the customers they represent will be required to 
pay for a portion of the project's cost?
    Mr. Grumet. So Senator, that is the crucible of the 
question, and there are about 17 pages of my testimony that I 
will now try to summarize in about 45 seconds. The current 
system does not work. Fundamentally broken. We have a 
balkanized power grid that is isolating communities of the 
country from one another, and that is why when we have 
tragedies like we saw with Winter Storm Uri, people are dying 
because we do not have connections between the different power 
grids. So the key to making our nation stronger, cleaner, and 
more secure, is to connect those regions together. And so the 
question we have to ask is, well, why is it not happening? It's 
not happening because the current processes don't create any 
incentive for the different regions to work together.
    And so, the status quo does not work. Moving to a direct 
federal preemption, I think, is going to be very hard to 
convince this Committee to agree to. So we have proposed what 
we think are some pretty thoughtful process steps that would 
maintain the state's role, both in permitting and also in the 
efforts to connect these regions, but put some process behind 
it that is rational. So on siting, instead of having to wait 
for the states to move forward, we can use the backstop 
authority that was already put into law, give states the chance 
to move forward with that permitting, but have the Federal 
Government have a response if states fail to act. It's not 
taking them out of the process, it's just requiring them to 
work within the process.
    On the issue of cost allocation, which is more complicated, 
we believe that the regions have a role to play, but we believe 
that they have to play that role. They can't rope-a-dope the 
nation into energy insecurity. And so, we think there is a way 
forward that does not either accept the dysfunctional status 
quo or accept what I think people fear is an over-
federalization, and it's time for the Congress to, I think, dig 
in and find those solutions.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. In your opinion, how should 
transmission planners determine whether an electric 
transmission project is a high-impact transmission project or 
of national interest?
    Mr. Grumet. So I think that the criteria that were set out 
in EPAct, I think, and reinforced by IIJA, and I think Senator 
Manchin adds to that, we can get a list of what we think are 
the criteria to understand what a national interest project 
looks like, but that does not dictate approval. I think once 
you are in that process, then what the states need to do is 
look, in a coordinated way, at the benefits within their own 
borders and then also at the regional benefits that both the 
United States and regions would benefit from with those 
connections, but they should be the regular ways we look at the 
benefits of power. It should be economic. These are not trying 
to figure out a kind of woke national agenda. It is basically 
providing economic development, jobs, safety, security, 
resilience, reliability. They should use the system that they 
are working through right now, but they actually have to speak 
the same language.
    Right now, there is no incentive for any region to think 
about the full benefits of a project. And as a result, the 
whole country is suffering.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Well, should promoters of these 
projects, should they be required to show that the projects 
resolve a specific, identified customer need?
    Mr. Grumet. Every one of these projects has to be justified 
based on the benefits to customers being greater than the 
costs. There is absolutely no reason to move forward with a 
project that does not do that. But we have to recognize that 
there are benefits greater than what you are paying per 
kilowatt-hour. It is a benefit for your lights not to go out. 
It is a benefit for your region to be able to be saved with 
power if you have a terrible storm. It's a benefit for you to 
have the capacity to bring new industries into your region. 
It's a benefit to have low-cost power brought to you from other 
parts of the country.
    So I think as long as we have an honest conversation, 
anchored in economic benefits, we can make the decisions that 
protect all of our shareholders and consumers.
    Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you for your answer.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Next, we have Senator Kelly.
    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to 
all of you for being here today.
    Let me start with Jason--Mr. Grumet. As you may know, I 
supported the efforts to permanently reauthorize the FAST-41 
permitting process, which, I think, is a really critical tool 
that helps large projects navigate the federal permitting 
process, and it's especially critical that the federal 
permitting process does not needlessly delay projects that 
could help us secure the domestic supply of critical minerals 
that help us fight climate change.
    So earlier this year--there is a project called the South32 
Hermosa Critical Minerals Project, which will become the first 
mining project added to the country's FAST-41 process. And the 
Hermosa project is a proposed zinc and manganese mining and 
processing operation in Santa Cruz County, Arizona, near the 
U.S.-Mexico border, and demand for manganese for the battery 
sector is predicted to increase at the fastest rate of any of 
the industry's key metals. And this Hermosa project is the only 
advanced mine development project in the nation that can 
produce two federally designated critical minerals, making it 
essential for securing the country's domestic supply of 
critical minerals. You know, making the rigorous environmental 
review and permitting process for this type of project more 
transparent, timely, and predictable is going to help us 
establish the country as a responsible producer of critical 
minerals and renewable energy.
    So Mr. Grumet, how does the expansion of the program into 
mine approval benefit the clean power sector, and will it 
strengthen our supply chain with American resources?
    Mr. Grumet. Senator Kelly, I appreciate the question. I 
appreciate your leadership on FAST-41, and to the core of my 
testimony that the nation is coalescing now around a shared 
vision, I bet that Mr. Nolan and I would answer this question 
exactly the same. Fundamentally, our capacity to address our 
economic, climate, and security needs requires more mining, 
particularly of critical minerals. We cannot achieve our goals 
for electrification of transportation and we cannot achieve our 
goals for battery storage, which is necessary to provide 
resiliency for our intermittent renewable resources, without 
projects just like the Hermosa Project. FAST-41 works. You put 
the spotlight on something and the government responds.
    And so, if it works for a power line, if it works for a 
solar facility, if it works, you know, for an offshore wind 
farm, it should work for mining. And so I think we 
fundamentally support that all-of-the-above competition, but it 
has to be a competition towards national goals. So we would 
like every single technology and all of the resources and 
infrastructure that support those technologies to have the same 
federal support, but we have to recognize that we have open 
mines, not empty mines, to achieve security, economic 
resilience, and climate imperatives.
    Senator Kelly. And how much time does the FAST-41 program 
typically save?
    Mr. Grumet. Two years has become, I think, the kind of 
default idea of how you can run rigorous NEPA processes, bring 
in community involvement, and come up with a decision.
    Senator Kelly. Okay.
    And then, what can we do to work with states to incentivize 
them to participate in FAST-41 to keep these projects on track?
    Mr. Grumet. So you know, at the end of the day, it all 
comes down to federalism. And I think we obviously have to 
provide encouragement for states to want to be part of that 
federal process. And the idea around revenue recycling, where 
some of the resources from the permit applications are brought 
back into the states, I think, is a very smart way to move 
forward. Also, early consultation. It is always good to talk to 
people at the front end, whether that is a state regulator, 
whether that is the environmental justice community, whether 
that is a local farmer or landowner. So I think with revenue 
recycling and with efforts that bring the voices to the front 
of the process, and then with demonstrated success, I think you 
are going to see states much more eager to be part of those 
solutions.
    Senator Kelly. Well, thank you.
    And in my remaining time I want to just ask Ms. Shuler, I 
am sure you are aware of the Navajo generating stations, the 
situation here and the closure in 2019, and this is associated 
with the Kayenta mine project and it is, you know, it did 
provide very high-paying jobs in an area that has high 
unemployment. So how is permitting reform connected to well-
paying jobs in communities that may already have, you know, 
some issue with a transition like the closure of a power 
station?
    Ms. Shuler. Absolutely, and some of those folks were union 
members. So I am familiar with that situation. And I think this 
is what we are talking about as older energy assets are phased 
out, closed. We need to have the promise of good union high-
wage, high-road jobs available. It is what people keep calling 
``just transition.'' But we have yet to see a truly just 
transition. And so that is why the investments that are coming, 
IRA in particular, have such promise for places like the Navajo 
Nation, where there are special incentives that can be targeted 
in places that are already primed and ready to go. And we want 
to make sure that there are good, high-wage standards attached 
to these incentives so that, indeed, they do produce, you know, 
this apples to apples kind of--if you are leaving a good high-
wage job, you don't want to land in a job that is actually 
going to be a dead-end job. So that is why it's so important to 
get those right.
    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Ms. Shuler.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Now we have Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to 
the panel. Thank you for sharing your views, your comments on 
the importance of the priority of permitting reform. You know, 
you feel like you have reached that sweet spot when everybody 
is talking about permitting reform for all of the right 
reasons. And so I think this puts us at a good place to 
actually, hopefully, get something done.
    I want to take us back just a couple of years ago because 
it's not like we have been sitting on our hands when it comes 
to permitting. We were able to put in place what I consider 
some common-sense mineral permitting reforms in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law. We kind of pulled this from the American 
Mineral Security Act that I was able to work on with the 
Chairman here. It was certainly a first step. Maybe it was too 
small, but what we were trying to do was to give the 
Administration some new tools to work with.
    Let me direct this to you, Mr. Nolan. Have you seen any 
meaningful steps that the Administration has taken to utilize 
its new authorities under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 
and is there more that we can be doing out there? I recognize 
what we are talking about today is all of the follow-on that we 
need to do, but are there things that we have actually put into 
law that perhaps we have not amped up or ramped up enough?
    Mr. Nolan. Well, first off, I want to commend you, Senator 
Murkowski, for all your historical work on permitting reform 
and the legislation that passed as part of the Infrastructure 
Act, working with the Chairman. Unfortunately, the 
Congressionally mandated report about improvements that could 
be made to our mining process was due under statute to the 
Congress on November 15th of 2022. So we are still waiting for 
that analysis, and that would be very helpful to the process 
before us again here today. Instead, the Interior has wrapped 
that----
    Senator Murkowski. We need to urge them along on that 
report then.
    Mr. Nolan. Yes. They have wrapped that, complying with that 
important provision to the Interagency Working Group on Mining 
Laws, Regulations, and Permitting, and that is really not what 
the directive was from this Committee. So there is a little 
frustration. It has been six months now since they missed the 
deadline, and we would love to see that come forward so we can 
get going.
    Senator Murkowski. Okay. That is a good heads-up for us.
    I am going to put this out to all of you. We've got four, 
essentially, primary bills here in the Senate that would work 
to reform permitting. You've got the House-passed bill. You've 
got Chairman Manchin's measure. You have Ranking Member 
Barrasso's SPUR Act, and then you have Ranking Member Capito's 
RESTART. So, great to have four good bills. I think they 
provide a lot of good ideas and good opportunities to really 
move us forward. But we all know around here you are not going 
to get anywhere if you've got four bills and everybody is kind 
of jockeying for position, or I want to have mine over somebody 
else's. So I think we are going to have to figure out what this 
actually looks like.
    So I was going to frame the question as how can we all get 
on the same page with permitting reform with the things that 
have to be in it? Maybe the most important thing to think about 
is what can't be in it. In other words, you know, there may be 
some things that we are seeing in other areas that we are 
looking at and saying, this is not going to be helpful to us. 
Is there anything out there that you are looking at when we are 
thinking about permitting reform, and you are saying from our 
perspective, whether from a workforce perspective, from a 
clean, renewable, or from a mining perspective, that this 
shouldn't just, shouldn't be part of the deal? So I am going to 
ask you to think what shouldn't be in rather than what should 
be.
    Anybody have any comments there?
    You are all smiling like ``I don't want to talk.''
    Mr. Grumet. Senator, I think we all understand where the 
commonality is, right?
    Senator Murkowski. Right.
    Mr. Grumet. It's about time limits. It's about avoiding 
duplication. It's about making sure that we have a process to 
pay for things, particularly transmission. You could turn the 
dials too far on any one of those issues. Those all, though, 
are the three legs of the stool. And I think we all, in 
different ways, said the same thing, which is that you can do 
it in two years, and you can do it in two years without 
transgressing on good process, while making it possible for 
states and localities and tribes and communities to be part of 
that process.
    And so I think our argument is just take the win.
    Senator Murkowski. Don't dial it too hard. Okay, yes.
    Anybody? Anything else?
    Mr. Nolan.
    Mr. Nolan. Yes, I think what Jason said is spot-on. There 
is obviously a massive consensus coming together here that I 
think we can all build on. There are things that we all want, 
but maybe that does not come this time around. Now, the miners 
are very patient, but we would love to see this advance and of 
course, first, do no harm. There are suggestions about turning 
the mining platform into a leasing system, which would be very 
devastating to the industry.
    Senator Murkowski. Yes.
    From a workforce perspective?
    Ms. Shuler. Yes, I would agree with what Jason said about 
turning the dials too far in one direction. I mean, we 
definitely still need that, you know, the ability for 
communities and states and tribes to participate, but we want 
strict timelines because we need to get things built. So do 
something. That would be what the workers would say is, get 
something moving through Congress so that we can get more 
projects unleashed and have this promise of good jobs become a 
reality.
    Senator Murkowski. Good.
    Mr. Ulrich.
    Mr. Ulrich. Mr. Chairman, Senator, very simply, please 
don't add another layer of bureaucracy throughout any of these 
measures. Obviously, protecting our foundational energy 
statutes and making changes there is important, but what has 
gotten us to the situation we are in today is too much, too 
much, too much. We have a great opportunity to modernize and 
really create efficient permitting processes.
    Senator Murkowski. Good. Thank you. Thank you, all.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Cantwell.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to 
the panel for being here.
    Hydropower makes up one-third of the renewable energy 
generated in the United States and two-thirds in my state, so 
there is no way, in my opinion, that we can reach our net-zero 
emission reduction goals without maintaining our existing 
hydroelectric generating capacity. I see already Mr. Grumet 
nodding there. Not only that, but hydro's ability to provide a 
firm, dispatchable power, which is needed most--a key 
ingredient when you are talking about intermittent power. So 
it's just the baseload of baseloads, in my opinion. However, 
current licenses for over 450 hydro facilities, including 
pumped storage projects, will expire in 2035. That is 17 
gigawatts of clean energy in jeopardy. In my state alone, there 
are 18 facilities whose licenses expire in 2035, representing 
1.3 gigawatts of capacity.
    So I understand that right now, on average, relicensing 
hydro facilities takes seven years. Now, I say, Mr. Chairman, 
my colleague Larry Craig and I worked on this, and at the time, 
we thought the average was more than ten years. We did a hydro 
relicensing bill, but I guess we shaved off three years. So now 
let's see what we can do given that we have these urgent needs 
to do even more.
    Yesterday, Senator Daines and I introduced a comprehensive 
hydro relicensing reform bill. It is supported by the National 
Hydropower Association, the National Congress of American 
Indians, both Democrat and Republican FERC Commissioners, 
American Rivers, and utilities like Seattle Light. It would 
streamline the permitting process, increase tribal engagement 
and oversight, expedite low-impact projects, consider future 
climate impacts, promote healthy habits, and coordinate the 
federal decision.
    Mr. Grumet or Ms. Shuler, do you agree that baseload power 
is a key ingredient to the grid's future, and would you support 
legislation such as I just described in being part of the 
permitting reform process?
    Mr. Grumet. Clean, non-carbon baseload power is essential. 
Hydro is kind of the unsung hero of our clean energy system 
right now and we really appreciate your leadership, as I know 
our colleagues do in the Hydro Association. The scope and scale 
of the challenge is profound. We cannot lose any non-carbon 
power, and that is the same for hydro, for nuclear, for the 
renewables industry. I think the legislation that you have 
proposed, which also focuses a lot on hydro and pumped storage, 
is going to be essential to maintaining reliability. So I think 
the Clean Power Association very much supports your efforts and 
those of Senator Daines.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    And Ms. Shuler, if I could add, do you also support--I know 
you are going to answer that question--but do you also support 
adding more needed transmission capacity, because I think in 
the underlying H.R. 1, they don't address transmitting, 
permitting reform, and this, too, is a big component of what we 
need to do. I say this because I am so proud that you, as the 
first AFL-CIO woman chair, but you come from an electricity 
background, from Portland General Electric, I think, right? So 
I think this is a subject you know well.
    Ms. Shuler. Yes, and growing up in the shadow of the 
Bonneville Dam and being very familiar with hydro in the 
Northwest and the workforce that it takes to maintain the 
system and the frustration that we see when we can't get 
transmission expanded and make sure our supply is affordable 
and reliable. So I would just say, to echo your concerns, you 
know, having 30 percent of our renewable energy supply come 
from hydro, we need to protect it. We need to do better. We 
need to speed up the process. So we absolutely agree with your 
assessment. And just knowing that these hydro plants need to be 
periodically relicensed, right? And I think it's 450 dams with 
17 gigawatts of clean power that need to be relicensed by 2035, 
as I think you said. So we need to do better, and we support 
that.
    Senator Cantwell. And transmission reform. Should 
transmission permitting as part of this reform bill be 
considered as well?
    Ms. Shuler. Yes, exactly.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Senator Daines.
    Senator Daines. Chairman Manchin, thank you.
    The National Environmental Policy Act's current regulations 
impose significant time and significant cost burdens with an 
environmental impact statement, adding an average now of over 
$4 million to each project, and taking four and a half years to 
complete. For hardrock mining, it routinely takes now over ten 
years and a billion dollars in startup capital before a company 
produces any product in America. And that is if they ever get 
through the permitting process. More often than not, we've got 
a situation where projects, like the Libby Exploration Project 
that used to be Montanore, it is in Northwestern Montana--they 
have been in an endless cycle of permitting and litigation now 
for 34 years. It is going to be producing minerals and metals 
that are needed for the future renewable energy economy. There 
is no end in sight.
    This forces us to depend on countries like China and the 
Democratic Republic of Congo for critical minerals and 
materials. Permitting reform is needed now and it needs to be 
comprehensive. It needs to include forestry reforms to prevent 
unnecessary delays from endangering our forests and hydropower 
reforms so we can continue to use and benefit from this clean, 
low-cost energy source. Next week, we are taking up my 
bipartisan Ninth Circuit Cottonwood fix and passing it in 
Committee. This needs to be part of permitting.
    Yesterday, Senator Cantwell and I introduced the Community 
and Hydropower Improvement Act. That was a year in the making. 
This bill is the largest hydropower bill in two decades, and I 
thank Senator Cantwell for being a great partner. Two Senators 
from the northwestern part of the United States that understand 
the importance of hydropower. It streamlines----
    Senator Wyden. I would like to join you both.
    Senator Cantwell. Yes.
    Senator Daines. We would love to have you.
    Senator Wyden. Thank you.
    Senator Daines. It streamlines----
    The Chairman. Without any discussion there, we are going to 
add Senator Wyden.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Daines. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    It streamlines the permitting and licensing process. It 
increases tribal consultation and balances stream and species 
protection with increased support of hydropower production. You 
know, hydropower produces a third of all renewable energy and 
over six percent of all electricity in the United States. This 
bipartisan permitting bill must be included in any package that 
comes before the U.S. Senate.
    Mr. Grumet, pumped hydropower storage is the largest and 
most valuable storage solution for intermittent wind and solar. 
The Community and Hydropower Improvement Act makes many 
permitting challenges, including creating an expedited three-
year process for pumped storage. Can you speak about the need 
to include hydropower reform in the permitting discussion, and 
specifically the importance of expediting pumped storage?
    Mr. Grumet. Well, thank you, Senator Daines. I think, you 
know, broadly, as I shared with Senator Cantwell, it is hard to 
imagine a solution that addresses our security, economic, and 
climate challenges by mid-century that does not have a 
significant reliance on continued hydropower. We certainly 
cannot move backward. And pumped storage is now an essential 
component of that transition because, as you point out, it's 
essential to make sure that the grid is reliable while we have 
increasing amounts of wind and solar. We are also very 
optimistic about efforts underway with battery technology. And 
so, we think the combination of pumped hydro and the tremendous 
growth in battery storage is going to provide that kind of 
resilience.
    And I think in terms of permitting, the timelines, maybe 
just to take this more broadly, you know, the challenge we have 
had over permitting is that some people have seen it as a way 
to slow things down because they felt like what we were 
building was not consistent with our national needs. What has 
changed, and I give this Committee the credit for making this 
happen, is now we all have a vision of what success looks like. 
Hydro is part of that success. Hardrock mining is part of that 
success. Onshore wind, offshore wind, battery storage. And now 
that we all have line of sight toward success, I think we all 
want to come together and get things done. And I think two 
years has kind of landed as that reasonable space to make these 
decisions in a way that involves communities and respects 
outcomes and actually delivers for the American people.
    Senator Daines. Thanks for those thoughtful comments.
    Mr. Nolan, permitting reform without litigation reform, in 
this Senator's opinion, is pointless. It doesn't matter how 
long it takes to get a permit if that permit is going to be 
endlessly litigated by a radical outside group. And Montana 
mines are not alone. The litigation cycle is a problem across 
the United States. I bring in this chart of the Rock Creek 
timeline to remind my colleagues of the problem. That chart 
starts in 1987. I used to work for Procter and Gamble. I used 
to make things like shampoo. That is lather, rinse, repeat, 
right there. Over and over and over again. That started in 
1987. And here we are in 2023.
        [The chart referred to follows:]
         GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT

        
    Senator Daines. Mr. Nolan, how can we fix the litigation 
problem, and do you agree we need to have this at the forefront 
of our discussions?
    Mr. Nolan. Senator Daines, thanks for the question. I 
believe you are spot-on. It currently takes seven to ten years 
to get through the permitting process alone, and with your 
example aside, on average it is another three to five years of 
litigation. Now, we are not saying that challenges and the 
right of the people to make their point should be eliminated, 
but that challenge should be within scope and targeted to 
substantial matters and up-front so that the project can be 
adjusted and public concerns addressed. So I fully agree that 
without legal reform and judicial reform in this package, the 
permitting process improvements are going to have a very 
limited impact.
    Senator Daines. Yes, and I am over time, but I am very 
concerned that we could spike the ball with a great permitting 
reform bill, get it passed, and then find out we are at the 
mercies of this continuous litigation cycle here and obstruct 
these projects in court.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. Thank you.
    Senator Wyden.
    Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and it's 
wonderful to have Elizabeth Shuler in the house. She and I have 
known each other since I was co-director of the Oregon Gray 
Panthers, the senior citizens group. She was coming up in the 
labor movement. We are so proud that she holds this position. 
It's just wonderful to have you here today, point one.
    Point number two, and then I've got a question.
    June 2012 was a really big time in the debate about energy 
policy. I want Chairman Manchin to hear this in case I make a 
mistake in history. Chairman Manchin invited Senator Murkowski 
and I to come to West Virginia to take a tour of all of the 
energy sources and kind of talk about where we were going. So I 
spent a lot of time thinking about the issue and we started 
talking to Chairman Manchin's staff. This was over a decade 
ago. And we saw a variety of sources and I spent a lot of time 
boning up on some of the things that Chairman Manchin was 
talking about. And he was very interested in the concept of 
technological neutrality. That is now the permanent position of 
the United States with respect to energy policy. Everybody's 
in. Technological neutrality really grew out of those meetings 
that we started in June 2012.
    Then we said we are going to have a private-sector-built 
system--not just going to have a full array of choices, but 
it's going to be built around the private sector. And then, 
because I read a bunch of Chairman Manchin's speeches, I said 
we are going to have a coalition. We are going to have to bring 
together Democrats and Republicans, as Chairman Manchin talks 
about. I said, and I held my breath, we also ought to say the 
more you reduce carbon emissions, the bigger your tax savings. 
And I was pretty junior on the Senate Finance Committee and I 
certainly was not thinking about being the Chair in the next 
ten minutes. But Chairman Manchin said then, and he was not the 
Chairman of the Committee, that is something that rewards 
people in the private sector.
    And so, for ten years we nurtured that concept along--
private sector, technologically neutral, reward in the private 
sector people who reduce carbon emissions. And now, we have 
seen, this is the biggest investment in climate, and as 
Chairman Manchin has always talked about, a sensible energy 
policy for the future. It brings together both sides. And I 
just put it in the context of energy security and climate, 
making a beginning at tackling climate.
    So now, we face the question of what comes next. And I am 
very troubled about the fact that after we made all that 
progress over ten years, we still get held up in red tape and 
bureaucracy for solar and wind and geothermal, which is, as 
President Shuler knows, a big deal in our part of the world. 
And Chairman Manchin and I talked about that back then, and I 
have supported this effort for permitting reform. And I think 
the question I would like to ask you, Ms. Shuler, is what is 
the extra benefit your members get from permitting reform, 
because it strikes me, we have all been kind of talking around 
that, but you always speak the language of working families and 
working people. So I would like you to kind of spell out for 
the Committee, representing Oregon and the country as it 
relates to working families, what is the extra plus that your 
members get from the kind of efforts we are making on 
permitting reform?
    Ms. Shuler. Well, and thank you, Senator, and to you, Mr. 
Chairman, and all of you really thinking about workers and 
making this a worker-centered issue, because often worker's 
perspectives are left behind, especially when we are talking 
about changes in the energy industry. And I earlier had 
mentioned this notion of just transition. Everyone talks about 
it, but we need to make it a reality. And if we cannot get 
these projects built, workers get frustrated. They lose hope. 
They see the potential, but they don't see the actual jobs 
manifesting themselves in their communities. And so I think 
it's a ``both/and.'' We can do permitting reform and speed up 
these processes and we can continue to make sure we are hearing 
from the right perspectives--workers included--who live in 
communities where these changes are taking place. But we need 
to do it with speed. We need to do it with certainty. And we 
also know that it takes time to train workers to get prepared 
for these jobs.
    And so if we have certainty, developers are actually going 
to be attracting investment. And so work will then be certain 
and then we can start training workers to make sure that we 
have good, high-quality jobs for the future.
    Senator Wyden. Well said, and my time is up. Going all the 
way back to those conversations that began in June 2012, we 
always said that the needs of workers and energy security and a 
sensible climate policy, these were not mutually exclusive. We 
could have all three with the right kind of policy. We are now 
started in that direction.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    I just want to clarify one thing. The whole purpose of the 
IRA is energy security. This Administration has been unable to 
use the word energy security, all they use is climate, and I 
have corrected them, and I will continue to correct them. It's 
energy security. We can't run this country without the 
horsepower of clean fossil. We can't do it. And we are not 
going to basically put our grid system and the reliability in 
jeopardy.
    With that, we can walk and chew gum. And that is what we 
have been saying from day one. We can invest in the technology 
of the future that we are all going to need and mature that, 
but we are not going to eliminate something before we have 
something to replace it with. And if you don't like what we are 
doing and you think we are doing something wrong by having 
fossil and clean technology, go look at Europe, look at what 
happened. We are not going to repeat that mistake.
    Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thanks 
to the witnesses for being here.
    Ms. Shuler, I want to start with you and talk a little bit 
about permitting reform for mining critical minerals, but 
before I get to that, I just want to say, thank you to you and 
to the rail workers that you represent for their work in 
transporting much of this nation's critical energy supply. And 
I just want to reiterate that I think that the deal, so-called, 
that the rail workers were forced to accept at the hand of this 
Congress last year where they were not given one additional 
sick day--one--that they were requesting, is frankly 
outrageous. So I voted against it. I would have amended it to 
include the sick days that the rail workers were looking for 
and I think, frankly, the idea that the rail workers of this 
country who risk their safety in many cases, day in and day 
out, and certainly put their health on the line to provide for 
their families and do so much for our energy sector and could 
not have one additional sick day while probably half of the 
Federal Government still isn't showing up to work because they 
are afraid they might get sick is just, frankly, outrageous. So 
thank you for your advocacy on their behalf.
    Let me ask you about mining critical minerals here in the 
United States. You are the president of a trade association 
that represents labor unions. Can you give us just a thumbnail 
sketch, and I apologize if you have already been asked this, 
but can you give us a thumbnail sketch of some of the 
protections that domestic workers here in the United States get 
for mining projects? Then talk to us about the labor 
protections that we have in this country to help keep them 
safe.
    Ms. Shuler. Well, as you know, the mining industry is one 
of the most union-dense industries. We have safety protections 
because of the fact that it is highly unionized, and we have 
been able to negotiate, over time, very strong protections in 
their union contracts.
    Senator Hawley. So let's talk about where much of the 
world's critical mineral supply comes from if it's outside of 
the United States, and that is Chinese mines and the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. And I bet you are aware of the labor 
conditions there in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For 
instance, it has been recently reported that about 40,000 
children are working in the mines in the southern Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. A recent NPR article called those labor 
conditions ``modern day slavery.'' Would you agree with me that 
our labor protections in this country are a heck of a lot 
better--they may not be perfect--but they are a heck of a lot 
better than labor protections in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, if they exist at all?
    Ms. Shuler. Yes, and that is why we need a more robust 
domestic supply chain.
    Senator Hawley. You have made my point for me. I could not 
agree with you more. And this is why I have to say I don't 
understand this Administration's decision to sign an agreement 
just last month to fund critical mining projects in the Congo 
while at the same time they are denying permits for domestic 
mining here in this country. And I had the chance to talk with 
the Secretary of the Interior about this just the other day. In 
that connection--can I just ask you, maybe, for your personal 
opinion? Do you think that we have too many good-paying union 
jobs in this country, too many good-paying blue-collar jobs?
    Ms. Shuler. I think that is rhetorical, right?
    Senator Hawley. I would hope so. I would hope so, but I am 
asking----
    Ms. Shuler. You never have too many good-paying union jobs.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you. Yes, thank you.
    Well, I am asking because when I raised this issue, 
specifically as it relates to opening up more mines in this 
country with our protections, creating more good-paying jobs in 
this country, the Secretary of the Interior told me last 
month--she pointed out to me that, well, there are 1.9 jobs for 
every American in the country, so there are a lot of jobs. And 
right now, you know, we've got too many jobs. I just think that 
that is outrageous. I just think it's totally outrageous. We 
need more good-paying jobs in this country, which is why we 
need realistic, serious permitting reform that will make those 
jobs available, secure our critical supply chains, and get our 
workers back to work.
    Thank you for the work you are doing in that respect.
    In my few remaining minutes here--seconds rather.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hawley. The Chairman, already--I have hardly been 
on this Committee, and already I have a bad reputation with the 
Chairman.
    The Chairman. No, not bad.
    Senator Hawley. Yes, all right. I am going to try to stay 
within my bounds.
    Mr. Grumet, let me just ask you about the Grain Belt 
Express. Are you familiar with this transmission project called 
the Grain Belt Express?
    Mr. Grumet. Yes.
    Senator Hawley. A company called Invenergy, as you know 
then, has been trying to build. It's a wind energy transmission 
project that runs across my state, Missouri, and also Kansas 
and Illinois. It has been subject to multiple steps of approval 
process in the State of Missouri, and I am sure in the 
neighboring states, but I am more familiar with Missouri. These 
are state-level agencies. My question to you is, do you think 
that states ought to have the authority in transmission 
projects like this to review and grant approval or not?
    Mr. Grumet. So now, I am not going to get you in trouble by 
answering your question, right, Mr. Chairman?
    So absolutely, the states have a role and have to have a 
role. But that role has to be guided with the same kind of 
deliberate national interests that we have been talking about. 
When Congress passed EPAct in 2005 and said that there were 
transmission interests that were in the national interest, it 
recognized that we are one nation, that electricity moves very 
quickly, covers far distances, and we have to be able to bring 
that larger vision so that we actually protect ourselves as a 
nation and as a community. So I think it is not a yes or no. It 
is not an either/or. The current system is not working to 
protect the State of Missouri or the State of Texas or the 
State of Vermont because we are balkanized. The answer is not 
federalization. We have proposed a number of specific reforms 
that we think can find the right way to balance those two 
things so that we actually have an electric grid that does 
protect our population, keeps the lights on, keeps businesses 
humming, and provides clean power.
    Senator Hawley. I would agree with you that the answer is 
not federalization. And I will just say that I think it's vital 
that we allow state agencies that are responsive to farmers and 
ranchers in the state to be able to review and have a say in 
this process and not just be ramrodded and railroaded, if you 
like, by something----
    Mr. Grumet. I bet we could come up with a set of criteria 
that would make us all feel pretty good.
    Senator Hawley. I hope so.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you 
all for being here and for all your efforts and service.
    Mr. Grumet, global clean energy development trends have 
flipped in the last decade and really not in a good way for the 
United States. A lot of us are very concerned that the United 
States and the European Union are in a race with the People's 
Republic of China on clean energy, and we are not coming out as 
well as one would have expected, even in the recent past. One 
example, last year China installed more rooftop solar than any 
other country, installed rooftop solar, utility-grade wind and 
utility-grade solar, all combined. I know your organization is 
watching the renewable development around our geopolitical peer 
rivals abroad. How did this change happen, and what can we do 
to reverse it?
    Mr. Grumet. Thank you for the question, Senator. I think 
it's worth reflecting--we spent the beginning of this 
conversation talking about permitting and transmission, and now 
we are talking about the third fundamental challenge to 
success, which is supply chain. You are absolutely right that 
20 years ago we started to cede authority to China. Well, the 
goal of the permanent normalization of trade relations was that 
it was going to open their markets to ours and it was going to 
reform their human rights. It fundamentally failed. So now, 
game-on. It's time for America to start fighting back and 
bringing these resources back to this country.
    The only way that is going to happen though, is if our 
government works with our industry. So for the last several 
years, we have been dealing with, basically, punitive tariffs, 
thinking that the way we are going to support American 
companies is by somehow punishing them for trying to build 
domestic manufacturing. I think there is a huge opportunity now 
with the incentives for advanced manufacturing that are coming 
out of recent Congressional efforts to bring those companies 
back. Just in the last nine months, we have had 30 new domestic 
solar manufacturers announced in this country--30, right? In 
nine months. Almost one a week. That is the trend that we have 
to continue, but that is only going to continue with 
partnership, and we also have to be realistic. You can't turn 
off 20 years of a vicious cycle in 15 days. We are going to 
have to acknowledge that a dramatic amount of infrastructure 
and intellectual property is no longer in this country.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right.
    Mr. Grumet. And we are going to have to work to bring it 
back.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Appreciate that. Thank you.
    Ms. Shuler, in your written testimony you talked about the 
TransWest line that is being built in Wyoming. As the former 
Governor in the state just to the south of Wyoming, I am fully 
aware that part of that line goes through northwestern 
Colorado, and that it took 18 years. Finally, it looks like we 
are going to get it done. As someone who has a child, an infant 
at home, that child is going to be in college by the time 
someone can do a similar process to permit a single 
transmission line.
    Can you speak to the opportunity for America's labor force 
that building a large-scale transmission line like this, what 
it means, what it represents, and what we leave on the table 
when our federal policy does not allow this to happen?
    Ms. Shuler. Yes, I mean, transmission is central. It's 
critically important to everything we want to do in this 
country, especially with all these investments coming down the 
pike. And so, shortening the siting process is absolutely 
critical. And we all know, as Jason was saying, that we need 
lots of different forms of supply coming into our system and 
they are often generated long distances away from where the 
load centers are. So that's why it's so essential that we turn 
our attention to this and we do it urgently. The other thing, 
from a worker perspective, I mentioned this earlier, is this 
notion of making sure we have the skilled workforce to handle 
it. Transmission is complicated, right? It's--you don't just 
make a power lineman overnight. And especially in the higher 
end of the spectrum on high-voltage transmission.
    So we need that certainty to be able to plan for the 
trajectory of the talent pipeline that we are going to need. 
And so, I think that permitting reform piece is going to unlock 
a lot of opportunity for workers of the future.
    Senator Hickenlooper. All right, well, thank you. And I 
don't have enough time for other answers, but I will leave you 
with a question because it applies to each one of you, and you 
have all talked about this, whether talking about transmission 
lines or natural gas pipelines, or talking about opening 
mines--the workforce challenges are apparent for every one of 
you. And I think we--I would love at some point, by this same 
group, to be able to talk about where these kids are going to 
come from. How do we get to them soon enough and allow them the 
opportunity to see which trade, which profession, which career 
they would be happiest in and then make sure they get the 
training in real time, because I think that is going to come 
down over these next few years as being one of the single most 
fundamental challenges and obstacles in front of us in terms of 
achieving what each of you have been talking about.
    So file that away. I will put it in as a written question.
    Mr. Grumet. Liz and I have a plan. We will stop by.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Hickenlooper. Perfect.
    I yield back to the Chair.
    The Chairman. Oh, thank you. Well, you have always been 
kind on your time. I appreciate it.
    Senator, it's so good to see you. Senator Hoeven, hi. 
You're up. Sorry, you're up. Go for it.
    Senator Hoeven. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for 
holding the hearing today. I ask unanimous consent to enter 
into the record a letter from the National Rural Electric 
Cooperative Association, dated May 8, 2023, regarding the 
Association's principles for permitting reform.
    I ask for UC.
    The Chairman. Without objection.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    [The letter referred to follows:]
     GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT

    
    Most North Dakotans are served by rural electric 
cooperatives, which are non-profit entities whose mission is to 
provide reliable electric service to rural customers at the 
lowest possible cost. At last week's hearing with the FERC 
Commissioners, Senator Lee raised concerns over proposals that 
would socialize the cost of large transmission lines and 
potentially force ratepayers in states to pay more for 
electricity without any benefits. In the letter, the NRECA 
emphasizes that any changes to the transmission, permitting, 
and siting process should ensure that any costs are only 
allocated to ``those who receive tangible and quantifiable 
benefits.'' I share these concerns raised by the rural electric 
cooperatives. North Dakotans should not be forced to pay for 
transmission lines that simply benefit other states and not 
North Dakota as well.
    With that, Mr. Ulrich, I've got a bill we call the BLM 
Mineral Spacing Act, and essentially what it says is that if 
the Federal Government owns no surface acres and a minority of 
the mineral acres then it should not be a requirement that they 
are involved in the permitting process so that the state can go 
ahead and permit it and not have to do federal permitting as 
well.
    Would you agree with that, and would that help us produce 
more energy for this great nation?
    Mr. Ulrich. Yes, Senator, I am not familiar with your bill, 
but with the concept, absolutely. Those are challenges we have 
in the eastern parts of the State of Wyoming, where a federal 
agency has a minority of interest in the lease hold, if any, 
but there is a federal nexus. Thus, what should be a very 
simple arrangement between the private landowners and mineral 
owners and the operator becomes very complicated, costly, and 
timely, in the tune of years, for a permitting process, which 
is completely unnecessary.
    So Senator, yes, without understanding, clearly, the 
language of the bill, I love the philosophy.
    Senator Hoeven. Yes, right on.
    So Mr. Nolan, rare-earth elements. So yes, in lignite coal, 
which we have in our state, the lignite contains high 
concentrations of rare-earth elements, and that is true even as 
in relation to other types of coal. Our North Dakota Geological 
Survey has released a series of studies examining locations of 
potential resources, and the University of North Dakota is 
researching how to more efficiently and affordably extract 
these rare-earth elements from lignite coal. Do you agree that 
leveraging coal-derived, rare-earth, and critical minerals is 
needed to address the supply chain disruptions and lessen our 
reliance on China?
    Mr. Nolan. Thank you for that question, Senator Hoeven. 
Absolutely, we need all mineral sources we can find. The 
forecast for future demand from world resources demanding 
minerals, whether it's lithium or cobalt or rare-earth 
elements, is going to explode exponentially. So we need all 
sources, including rare-earth elements from coal and lignite.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay
    How do we improve the technology so that we can 
commercialize this and do it in a commercially viable way and 
sync that up with how we are utilizing this coal to produce 
low-cost electricity? We are capturing the CO<INF>2</INF> with 
these new technologies. And then if we can come back and 
capture these rare-earth elements, it seems like a triple win 
for the citizens of this country rather than getting our energy 
from somebody else, right?
    So how do we do that? What are your ideas to help----
    Mr. Nolan. I mean, it's a challenge of getting it to scale. 
The amount and the size of those elements in the geology is 
very small, so you really have to move a lot of earth to get to 
it, and then it's really important to re-shore our processing 
capabilities so we don't have to----
    Senator Hoeven. Okay now you have identified the challenge. 
I appreciate that. I would rather have you identify a solution.
    Mr. Nolan. We have to invest in the processing of those 
rare-earth elements here at home so we are not shipping them to 
China and coming back.
    Senator Hoeven. What does that mean, invest in processing?
    Mr. Nolan. Standing up the facilities that can actually 
take the raw rare-earths, break them apart into their elements, 
so they are marketable.
    Senator Hoeven. So when Chairman Manchin comes to you and 
says, what is the single best thing he could do to get this 
done, you would tell him to do what? And I know he would 
certainly respect your advice on this.
    Mr. Nolan. Well, he has done a tremendous amount of work in 
this space already and has invested a heck of a lot of federal 
resources in the technology.
    Senator Hoeven. So it's the R&D?
    Mr. Nolan. It's really how we get it to scale, which I 
believe was your question.
    Senator Hoeven. Yes.
    Mr. Nolan. And that is to build an industry that can take 
the raw material and process it here, not overseas.
    Senator Hoeven. And is that a function of R&D, or what is 
it?
    Mr. Nolan. It's R&D. It's FEED. It's capital investment. 
It's permits.
    Senator Hoeven. Okay. Thank you very much.
    Mr. Nolan. Absolutely.
    Senator Hoeven. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    The Chairman. Thank you, sir.
    And now we have, finally, the great Senator from Nevada, 
the senior Senator from Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you to the Chairman. Thank you 
to the panelists. It has been an incredible discussion today, a 
bipartisan discussion. I think there is room for agreement that 
I have heard on several areas here today.
    Many of you know Nevada. It is the growing nexus for our 
clean energy and critical mineral future because it really is 
the only state in the United States that encompasses nearly 
every facet of the critical mineral advanced battery economy, 
from the mining of the critical mineral deposits, to the 
research and development, to the processing and manufacturing, 
and finally, to the recycling operations, all done with union 
labor. And so this really is a great opportunity where we can 
all work together as we take the necessary steps to address 
climate change. We have to do so in a fashion that makes 
America more productive, secure, and self-sufficient. That is 
what I have heard today. And I agree with it.
    At the very basic level, this means we must produce 
minerals in the United States and not solely rely on foreign 
sources. I believe we can do this in a way that incorporates 
robust engagement with all stakeholders and still looks to 
protect the environment. Does anybody disagree with that on the 
panel?
    Everybody is shaking their head ``no.''
    Correct, because I think there is that opportunity. Thank 
you.
    Mr. Nolan, let me start with you. The Administration, the 
Biden Administration, has repeatedly referenced the importance 
of domestically sourced critical minerals, noting that, and I 
quote ``critical minerals provide the building blocks for many 
modern technologies, like batteries, electric vehicles, wind 
turbines, and solar panels, and are essential to our national 
security and economic prosperity. Global demand for these 
critical minerals is set to skyrocket by 400 to 600 percent 
over the next several decades, and for minerals such as lithium 
and graphite, demand will increase by as much as 4,000 
percent.''
    So Mr. Nolan, how is our ability to meet what you just 
heard, the Biden Administration's climate goals, how is that 
impacted by the 9th Circuit, the Rosemont Decision, and how is 
our ability to develop domestic critical minerals impacted by 
that decision?
    Mr. Nolan. Senator, thank you for the question.
    First off, I want to congratulate your State of Nevada for 
being the number one destination, worldwide, for minerals 
investment, just announced this year. So congratulations.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Mr. Nolan. The Rosemont Decision has had a significant 
chilling effect on projects being able to expand and move 
forward. I think there is a very important piece of legislation 
that you brought forward to clarify the important regulations 
and codify them that allows for insular use on public lands to 
make sure that we can continue to produce and meet the minerals 
and necessary needs that are currently now being sourced back 
and forth from China to the United States. So I appreciate your 
leadership on that issue and leadership on the Subcommittee on 
Mining for this Committee.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    And I want to note that we just had--there is a recent 
editorial in the Las Vegas Sun saying that Rosemont is a wake-
up call. And it referenced the decision and it said, and I 
quote, ``The mining industry needs to work harder on 
environmental issues and also pressure the bad actors among 
them to reform their ways. Simultaneously, environmentalists, 
who want to see the green energy revolution continue, suddenly 
have a deeply vested interest in the success of mining for 
minerals essential for that future.'' We have labor. We have 
clean energy. We have mining at the table before us. Let me ask 
you, and Mr. Nolan, maybe start with you. What will your 
industries be doing to work with all the stakeholders to find 
that path? Because I do think there is a path forward.
    Mr. Nolan. We are constantly outreaching in the local 
communities with our members to make sure that we are doing 
front-end consultation with tribes, with local community 
stakeholders, to make sure that we have the input as these 
projects come forward, because there has been a sea change in 
understanding about the importance of what we need to do to get 
these minerals to the marketplace so that we can bring forward 
these new technologies and really support the electrification 
of the economy.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Anyone else regarding that 
engagement? I am curious.
    Mr. Grumet. Just in terms of the moment we are in, you 
know, I am here on behalf of the Clean Energy Industry, which 
is the energy industry. The scope and scale of what we have to 
achieve in this country can only happen if all of the different 
aspects of the energy industry are coming together, and that is 
why we are working closely with regional organizations, with 
the American Petroleum Institute, with the National Gas 
Association, with the Nuclear Energy Institute, because the 
equation is that we need clean energy for security and climate. 
We need critical minerals for clean energy. There is no way 
around that equation. And if we don't do it here in the U.S., 
we don't achieve those national security benefits.
    So look, I think we have given you all an easy job here to 
simply just put all of this consensus together into a nifty 
piece of legislation.
    [Laughter.]
    Mr. Grumet. Mutual.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Mr. Ulrich.
    Mr. Ulrich. Senator, from a natural gas perspective, we 
need to ensure that we have credible and transparent emission 
reduction measures and numbers in place. We are doing that at 
Jonah Energy. That is why we signed on to the oil and gas 
methane project, first U.S. based company to do it. The 
American public--you, and everybody else--deserves to have a 
very clear understanding of where we stand with emission 
reductions and how good we can get. And we are well on our way.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    I know my time is almost up. Can I just touch on the 
workforce piece? Because I think this is crucial. It is 
important that we include that development, that partnership, 
that we are including that workforce in this future. And so, 
Ms. Shuler, do you have any other thoughts on how we continue 
to support that workforce?
    Ms. Shuler. Well, workers will be at the center of all of 
this. I said in my opening that permitting reform affects every 
aspect of the economy, if you think about it, and we have not 
talked a lot about manufacturing and siting a lot of these 
facilities, these chip fabs, you know, the battery and EV 
facilities, but I think the idea here is constructive 
partnerships. And you have seen it here, and we think labor can 
actually be a bridge, can be the place where everybody can, you 
know, coalesce. So we want to play that role and we want to 
help you get there.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    And Mr. Chair, I know my time is up. One final thing. You 
touched it on your opening. Royalties.
    The Chairman. Always, always.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Let me just say, thank you for the 
hearing we had last Congress because we had that discussion. We 
had mining at the table. And if I recall, mining was willing to 
be a part of that discussion and a part of how we address that 
issue of your concern. Yes.
    The Chairman. I know we can do this. Let me just, first of 
all, say on behalf of the entire Committee here, I want to 
thank you all. It has been a wonderful hearing. I think 
everyone has enjoyed it. The most important thing is, we are 
going to make something happen and you are going to be a very 
big part of that.
    I hope you all have been thinking about the first question 
I asked you about the three. If you would share that with us, 
the three that you have--and I want to say a few other things 
that the Senator brought up, so many good points.
    The whole thing that we are trying to do is mature an 
industry. I want people to know that also, carbon capture and 
sequestration, if the EPA does not give us permits for Class VI 
wells, which they have not, that means they are trying to 
strangle you with a thousand cuts. They're trying to go one way 
without the other. They know it is a balanced approach. So 
don't tell me that you are going to invest in carbon capture 
and sequestration when we can't get a permit to basically 
sequester the carbon that we capture. These are the games being 
played. I know it. They know I know it. And we are not going to 
let them get away with it. And we will shut everything down 
until they start playing exactly how the bill was written and 
the intent.
    So I want all of you to know that very clearly. So if you 
can talk to the Administration, tell them we are all on the 
same side. We want energy security. We want fossil cleaner than 
anywhere in the world. And we want to develop the new 
technology for the future. That's not too hard to understand in 
that bill. That is what we call energy security.
    So reveal to us your three top picks.
    Mr. Ulrich, we will start with you.
    Mr. Ulrich. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and okay.
    The Chairman. Number one, two, and three.
    Mr. Ulrich. Yup, Number one--meaningful NEPA reform.
    The Chairman. Got you.
    Mr. Ulrich. And that is certainly on tiering. Obviously, 
expedite judicial review periods--two.
    The Chairman. Review periods. Got you.
    Mr. Ulrich. Three--prioritize LNG exports out of the 
Rockies to the West Coast.
    The Chairman. Great.
    President.
    Ms. Shuler. Echo that. Timelines for NEPA reviews. 
Deadlines for those environmental impact statements so that we 
can create certainty for developers. The second thing, I guess, 
with enabling the President to designate a list of priority 
projects for permitting so that we can raise up critical 
minerals and transmission as part of that. Expand eligibility 
for federal permitting improvements during committee programs 
to include energy projects, new technology, and critical 
minerals, mining, et cetera. Those are the three.
    The Chairman. Mr. Nolan.
    Mr. Nolan. Well, first, I want to echo your comments about 
CCS. If that does not work, it is a dead end for us, so.
    The Chairman. Well, yes, it is no different than what we 
have done with capturing methane. And let me just tell you the 
crazy thing about--I have to bring this up. I could not figure 
it out. I said, why are we flaring so much out West on public 
lands? Why are we flaring so much? And then they basically want 
to shut everybody down because you are flaring methane. That's 
a marketable product. They cannot get a permit for a pipeline 
to take the methane off so they are killing them with a 
thousand cuts. So we said fine, there is no fine. You cannot 
fine them if you will not give them a permit to take the 
product to market. Just common-sense stuff, right?
    Go ahead, I am sorry.
    Mr. Nolan. So in hardrock, I guess it would start with 
ancillary use and clarifying that provision in that decision. 
We need to get that fixed. We have talked a lot about legal 
challenge limitations. Two-year EIS is something that, I think, 
you have supported in the past, and then certainly, this 
Committee has done a lot of work with their concern about the 
reliability issues of the grid and making sure we can keep our 
optionality open with the coal fleet.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Mr. Grumet.
    Mr. Grumet. Senator Manchin, I want to start by saying I 
agree with you on CCS. Also, I should tell you that my wife 
started working at EPA about six months ago. So you may be 
undermining marital bliss in this situation.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. We got hope now, maybe we got hope.
    Mr. Grumet. The top three. Transmission with a focus on 
connecting the balkanized interregions together. NEPA reform, 
but I will also add with a focus on public lands, particularly 
the Outer Continental Shelf. We are really losing opportunities 
when it comes to the tremendous offshore wind possibility. And 
then, I am going to add a little more on the spiritual side--
all-of-the-above competition with purpose, right? The place 
where this debate goes off the rails is when people think that 
all-of-the-above means we have empty mines. We don't have empty 
mines. We want a competition of all these different 
technologies to achieve security, economic growth, and climate 
security.
    And so, I think if we understand that--if the people 
outside of this room understood that that is what you were all 
saying, we would be in a much better place.
    The Chairman. And finally, I will say this before we 
adjourn. I would like for all of you and everyone in the room 
here, if you will, when you leave this room, support bipartisan 
permitting reform--not my bill, not Senator Barrasso's bill, 
not Senator Capito's bill, not Senator Carper's bill or whoever 
is putting bills in. We need a little bit of all four of them 
to make this work. And if we go out and say, well, I support 
this one and that one, it just divides us further. We can get 
together much quicker if we are all in this. And I think we 
are. We want this done and everybody wants it done.
    With that, the Committee will have until the close of 
business tomorrow to submit additional questions for the 
record. Again, thank you all.
    The meeting is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
