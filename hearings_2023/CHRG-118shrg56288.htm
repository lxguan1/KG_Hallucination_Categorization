                        QUESTIONS FOR THE RECORD

       Response by Shawn Fain (UAW) to Questions of Senator Lujan
                             senator lujan

    Topic: As a child and grandchild of union workers, I know the power 
of a union job and I'm immensely proud of your fight for what workers 
deserve, and the historic wins you have negotiated to date.

    Workers face large wealth gaps. Unions help to close those gaps, 
and I want to make sure Americans see this in action. UAW recently 
reached ratified agreements with the Big Three after concluding its 
Stand-Up Strike, fighting for record contracts that matched companies' 
record profits.

    We have seen automakers rack in record profits. Over the last 
decade, profits at the Big Three increased about 92 percent, but this 
hasn't trickled down to their workers. Over the past 4 years, average 
worker pay at these companies rose barely 6 percent. Meanwhile, Big 
Three CEOs are making between 281 to 365 times more than their average 
worker.

    Question 1. How will UAW's agreements, which include a worker pay 
raise of at least 25 percent over 4 years, help to close this wealth 
gap for 150,000 plus workers?

    Answer 1. The 150,000 UAW autoworkers at the Big Three won back 
major provisions such as cost-of-living adjustments (COLA), annual 
bonuses for retirees, and the elimination of wage tiers. Our members 
will see raises of at least 33 percent, after COLA and compounded wage 
increases, ranging up to over 160 percent for some of the lowest-paid 
workers over the life of the contract.

    At all three companies, we won a 3-year wage progression to top pay 
rate, down from 8 years, which restores the progression in place before 
the 2011 contract.

    Stellantis agreed to reopen an assembly plant in Belvidere, 
Illinois, that Stellantis shuttered in February and committed to build 
a $3.2 billion battery plant there employing more than a thousand union 
workers.

    Current retirees will receive annual bonuses for the first time in 
15 years, a $1.25 billion boost in their benefits. That is a billion 
dollars more than the union won for retirees than the last four 
contracts combined.

    Question 2. Have non-union companies also offered pay hikes for 
their workers?

    Answer 2. Volkswagen will increase pay by 11 percent for non-union 
production workers at its Chattanooga assembly plant in Tennessee 
starting December 2023.

        <bullet>  Nissan will raise top wages for workers at U.S. 
        manufacturing plants by 10 percent in January, impacting about 
        9,000 U.S. workers. Nissan is also eliminating wage tiers for 
        U.S. production workers.

        <bullet>  Hyundai will raise wages for non-union production 
        workers at its Alabama factory by 25 percent by 2028, impacting 
        4,000 hourly workers.

        <bullet>  Honda will increase pay for production workers at its 
        U.S. facilities by 11 percent starting in January 2024 and 
        would also cut the time it takes factory workers to get to the 
        top-wage tier to 3 years from six.

        <bullet>  Toyota will raise the wages of non-union U.S. factory 
        workers, with hourly manufacturing workers at top pay will 
        receiving a raise of about 9 percent starting January 2024.

        <bullet>  Subaru will raise the wages of its U.S. plant workers 
        in Lafayette, Indiana. The company is yet to determine the 
        amount of the raise.

    We call it the UAW bump: that stands for ``U. Are. Welcome.'' Non-
union auto companies have used fear, uncertainty, and division to break 
union drives in our industry.

    Question 3. Can you discuss how UAW's Stand Up Strike has helped to 
close the wealth gap for not only its union members, but for non-union 
workers as well?

    Answer 3. Our Stand Up Strike launched on September 14 against the 
Big Three. This was a new strategy to take on corporate greed at Ford, 
General Motors, and Stellantis. It allowed us to center our members in 
a national campaign where worker strikes strategically grew and 
escalated over time, giving our union's bargaining teams maximum power 
to negotiate and win a record contract.

    We won terms in this contract that our industry hasn't seen in 15 
years or more. We won victories that will instantly change the lives of 
thousands of families across this country. Over time, it will transform 
communities, adding thousands of jobs and massively boosting the 
purchasing power of working-class families.

    Question 4. What role do you see UAW and other unions playing to 
ensure wealth is distributed equitably, not just handed out to wealthy 
CEOs?

    Answer 4. We are organizing to help thousands of autoworkers in 
this country, primarily in the South, to raise the living standards for 
the working-class and join our union.

    When union members win, we all win. The UAW bump has proven that 
and now it's time to get non-union automakers the full benefits of 
joining a union.

    The UAW's new contracts covering 146,000 workers at the Big 3 are 
strategically set to expire on May 1, 2028. We're calling on everyone 
in the labor movement to align their own expirations for that date, 
setting up a battle with some of the country's biggest corporations in 
four-and-a-half years.

    Still, we need your help. The working class needs this Committee, 
and the entire Congress to step up. Not only in supporting our fights 
and other fights like ours. But to finish the job for economic and 
social justice for the entire working class.

    Topic: It's vital that union membership grows not only to keep 
America's economy strong, but to close the gap between the rich and 
poor. Unions today are enjoying a surge of support, particularly among 
younger and more diverse workers.

    Question 5. How do unions help their members, especially young 
people, Black, and Hispanic workers, achieve economic security?

    Answer 5. Unions give workers the collective power to demand their 
fair share and fair treatment from their employer. Without a union, a 
worker has to deal with the boss on her own. And we all know how that 
goes. At the UAW, we bargain not only over things like wages, benefits, 
and work schedules, but also over benefits in the case of a layoff, 
tuition assistance, paternity leave, DEI training and certification, 
and much more. Unions help young, Black, and Hispanic workers achieve 
economic security by giving them the power to secure the conditions 
they need for themselves.
      Response by Sean O'Brien (IBT) to Questions of Senator Lujan
                             senator lujan
    Topic: Despite these historic contract victories and increases in 
worker organizing in recent years, many workers can't exercise their 
right to form and join unions because of union-busting campaigns waged 
by wealthy corporations.

    Earlier this year, the Committee examined tactics used by Starbucks 
to combat organizing and workers' fight for a first contract, including 
those at the only unionized Starbucks in New Mexico.

    Question 1 Have your unions experienced similar resistance trying 
to get to a first contract? And how do these tactics hurt union and 
non-union workers, and America's economy, when left unchecked?

    Question 2 Why is it important that Congress close these loopholes, 
which companies exploit to avoid or delay negotiating first contacts 
and bargaining in good faith, by passing the Protecting the Right to 
Organize (PRO) Act?

    Answer to Questions 1 and 2. Yes, weaknesses in the NLRA that 
permit an employer to delay first contract and avoid bargaining in good 
faith are a problem. Yes, it is a problem that all workers, including 
Teamster members have had to grapple with. Loopholes and weaknesses in 
the NLRA permit an anti-union employer to effectively wage two separate 
anti-union intimidation campaigns. First, to obstruct a successful 
union election and then to obstruct first contract. The longer the 
employer can drag both out, the better chance they have of effectively 
achieving their goals by exhausting and intimidating their employees 
who understandably fear the loss of their jobs and income.

    The PRO Act would require collective bargaining to begin within 10 
days of the certified union's request to do so; mediation if no 
contract is reached within 90 days; and mandatory arbitration of a 2-
year contract if no contract is reached through mediation. The PRO Act 
also requires the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to order the 
employer to bargain if the union wins the election, or if the employer 
interferes with the election and a majority of employees have already 
designated the union as their desired bargaining representative. These 
provisions, if enforced would help to level the playing field for 
workers who exercise their right to form their union.

    Response by Sara Nelson (AFA-CWA) to Questions of Senator Lujan
                             senator lujan
    Topic: We need to recognize the importance of what unions do for 
working families across the country. But it's also important to 
recognize the wider impact that our unions have making every industry 
they represent safer. As we continue to work to pass a full FAA 
reauthorization, and legislation to make crucial updates to our rail 
system, unions have been at the front lines fighting to make our 
transportation systems safer.

    Question 1. Can you speak briefly to the role that your union plays 
in making our aviation system safer?

    Answer 1. The Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA), in 
partnership with the Association of Professional Flight Attendants 
(APFA), advocated for numerous policy priorities in both the House and 
Senate 2023 FAA Reauthorization bills that will have a positive impact 
on the health and safety of airline crew and passengers, such as: 
improving the air quality in the cabin, regulating the cabin 
temperature so it is not too hot or too cold, reviewing the emergency 
evacuation procedures to ensure all passengers and crew can exit in a 
safe and timely manner, among others.

    Also, our union has a vital role in closing an existing loophole. 
JSX and SkyWest airlines are attempting to bypass critical safety and 
security measures involving scheduled commercial flights through the 
public charter flight rules. We are fighting to stop a new business 
model from expanding in the U.S. and bypassing safety and security 
regulations. This new business model, once confined to private jet 
charters, now threatens to take over a large part of the air services 
industry. SkyWest has an application pending before the U.S. DOT/FAA 
seeking an exemption to use Part 135 safety regulations instead of 
complying with Part 121 safety standards. We have submitted public 
comments, alongside all other aviation unions, opposing their efforts. 
We encourage you and your colleagues to contact the DOT and urge them 
to stop airlines from trying to operate as Part 135 flying operations 
but operating as Part 121 in name through an allowed DOT scheduling 
authority loophole. We must stand in solidarity to uphold critical 
aviation safety and security measures. A copy of our submission to the 
docket is attached for your review.
                                 ______
                                 
    Response by Sean O'Brien (IBT) to Questions of Senator Marshall
                            senator marshall
    President O'Brien. At the most recent HELP hearing, you were asked 
about the events and actions that have led to the recent demise of 
Yellow Corp. It is my understanding, based on your abbreviated 
testimony that Teamster members working at Yellow have, over more than 
a decade given back more than $5 billion in wage and benefit 
concessions to keep this mismanaged company in business, in an effort 
to protect their own jobs.

    Question 1. Can you give a detailed timeline and explanation of the 
concessions that Teamster Members have given Yellow Corp. over the 
years?

    Answer 1. In 2009, after the ink was barely dry on the 2008-13 
collective bargaining agreement, the Yellow (formerly YRCW) companies 
faced bankruptcy and liquidation and sought and obtained concessions 
from the more than 29,000 Teamster-represented workers in 2009. These 
concessions included a 10 percentwage cut. Teamster members working at 
the Yellow companies voted on and ratified these concessions but only 
after receiving assurances by Yellow executives and management that the 
concessions were temporary and that they would enable the Yellow 
enterprise to stabilize.

    Those assurances went unfulfilled. The next year, in 2010, the 
Yellow Companies sought additional wage, benefit and work rule 
concessions from their Teamster-represented employees. Again stating 
that they were on the brink of insolvency, the Yellow companies sought 
and obtained significant economic concessions from the Teamster-
represented employees. These additional concessions included an 
additional 5 percent wage reduction and a 75 percent reduction in the 
pension contribution.

    Through an extension agreement in 2014 obtained yet again under the 
threat of liquidation and new collective bargaining agreement in 2019 
(that does not expire until 2024), the membership continued to grant 
the Yellow operating companies concessions and received only modest 
wage increases--far below industry standards. Their 75 percent pension 
concession has essentially remained in effect.

    The concessions made by the Teamster members over the last 14 years 
have exceeded 5 billion dollars in terms of wage and pension 
contributions alone. Much of those concessions was attributed to the 
pension cuts, and those cuts have been devastating. The pension 
concessions are not eliminated or even mitigated by the American Rescue 
Act of 2021. Thus, since 2010, a member hired at one of the Yellow 
operating companies on and after 2010 would essentially have to work 
100 years to obtain what previously would have been a 25-year pension 
(i.e. 25 percent of the 2009 contribution). It should also be noted, 
that by the time the Yellow Companies stopped operating in July 2023, 
the Teamster members' wages were also below industry standard. The 
effect on the Teamster families was significant.

    Finally, in an effort to divert attention from its mismanagement 
and squandering of more than $5 billion in worker concessions, as well 
as its conduct in securing a highly controversial $700 million Cares 
Act loan Yellow from the Treasury Department in 2020, Yellow has filed 
a lawsuit against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and 
various of its affiliates. In light of that pending litigation, further 
comment is not appropriate at this time.

    Question 1. In your opinion is there anything else that the 
Teamsters can do to protect jobs at Yellow Corp?

    Answer 1. At this time, a U.S. bankruptcy court has permitted a 
sale which will parcel out a number of the Yellow Corp.'s shipping 
centers to multiple buyers. The Teamsters Union remains committed to 
supporting our members who have been displaced due to Yellow's decades 
long mismanagement by identifying and placing these members in good 
union jobs with comprehensive health and welfare benefits.

    Question 2. More importantly, is there anything that Congress or 
the Biden administration can do to protect the more than 22,0000 jobs 
that are threatened by the Yellow bankruptcy filing?

    Answer 2. The Teamsters Union is grateful to House and Senate 
Members who have fought this year to protect Teamster members at Yellow 
Corp. by supporting efforts of buyers interested in operating Yellow 
Corp. as a ``going concern''. Unfortunately, the terms of the company's 
CARES Act loan, while well intentioned, obstructed these efforts. At 
this time, a U.S. bankruptcy court has permitted a sale which will 
parcel out a number of Yellow Corp.'s shipping centers to multiple 
buyers. However, there are still buyers who are interested in operating 
a portion of Yellow Corp.'s centers as a ``going concern.'' We will 
keep Members in both the House and Senate apprised as these buyers move 
forward.

    Question 3. Working people are having a hard time in the current 
economy. They have to deal with inflation and have a harder time making 
paychecks cover what they need. I have particular concerns about the 
way that hidden credit card fees increase inflation and reduce the 
buying power of workers' hard-earned money. Is that an area of concern 
for the Teamsters and your members?

    Answer 3. Yes. The Teamsters fight to secure fair wages, high 
quality of life, and a dignified retirement for our members in each of 
our collective bargaining agreements. While our members substantially 
outperform their non-union peers in terms of wages and financial 
security, any dollar coming out of their pocket due to the unchecked 
greed of large corporations will always be a core concern for our union 
and our membership.

    Question 4. One piece of legislation that is a priority for me is 
the Credit Card Competition Act which I am cosponsoring with Senator 
Durbin. It seems to me that bringing some market competition to a 
broken market might help with the $1,000 the average American family 
pays in these hidden fees each year. Do you have a position on that 
legislation?

    Answer 4. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters is proud to 
endorse the Credit Card Competition Act. The existing duopoly in the 
credit card market has created an environment in which there is no 
incentive for competition on interchanges fees. As a result, both 
merchants and consumers pay the price while the largest multibillion 
dollar financial institutions in the country rake in profit. The 
Teamsters thank Senators Marshall and Durbin for leading this important 
legislation, and support its enactment into law.

     Response by Sean O'Brien (IBT) to Questions of Senator Murphy
                             senator murphy
    As you know, Amazon bills their Delivery Service Partner (DSP) 
program as a program that's designed to ``empower leaders'' who are 
interested in running their ``own delivery business.'' However, in 
practice, the DSP program has created a largely unregulated business 
model that has given Amazon way too much control over these delivery 
partners. DSP drivers are placed under immense pressure to meet 
delivery quotas--in some cases, this has caused drivers to turn off 
their safety apps as they try to deliver packages faster.

    DSP managers have also been incentivized to request that drivers 
bypass daily inspections and to not report certain types of safety 
issues with their vans. And workers are paying the price: One report 
analyzing OSHA data showed that, in 2021, nearly 1 in 5 DSP drivers 
were injured on the job. Worse still, Amazon is alleged to have 
committed numerous violations of workers' rights, including refusing to 
recognize and bargain with the Teamsters and threatening workers who 
engage in union activity.

    Amazon is relying on a network of contracted DSP drivers to meet 
unrealistic delivery quotas, and they're willing to sacrifice the 
drivers' safety if it means delivering more packages. All the while, 
they're shirking any responsibility for worker safety, since DSP 
drivers are technically contract workers employed by another company. 
Drivers in many states--including Connecticut--have started to 
recognize the egregiousness of what Amazon is doing and have started 
picketing Amazon warehouses over these unfair practices.

    Question 1. What would union representation and protection mean for 
these workers, who are risking their safety and the safety of others to 
meet Amazon's delivery quotas? How does a model like Amazon's DSP 
program deny workers their basic rights?

    Answer 1. Hundreds of thousands of Amazon delivery vans and trucks 
operate on neighborhood streets and roadways in countless communities 
across our Country. These delivery drivers wear Amazon vests, drive 
Amazon-branded vehicles, deliver Amazon packages, and log their 
progress on an Amazon app. But when Amazon delivery drivers dare to 
organize a union and fight for improvements in their wages and working 
conditions, Amazon has refused to bargain with them in good faith. For 
workers to effectively exercise their right to collectively bargain on 
the job, they need to be able to negotiate with every entity that 
exercises meaningful control over the terms and conditions of their 
work.

    Amazon controls virtually every aspect of the work that a DSP 
driver does, including the routes they drive, and subjects them to 
intensive surveillance on the job. Still, the company insists that 
these drivers are not its employees. Amazon claims that DSP drivers are 
the employees of supposedly independent businesses (Amazon's Delivery 
Service Partners) that contract with Amazon. The truth is that many DSP 
owners face tremendous financial difficulties because they are not 
independent. DSP owners have discretion over very few aspects of their 
business, but they shoulder all the employment responsibilities and 
risk that should rightfully be Amazon's to bear.

    A growing body of reporting and expert analysis shows that Amazon's 
system of control without responsibility poses major risks to drivers, 
and the public. One recent analysis cites that ``drivers delivering 
packages for Amazon DSPs were injured at an astounding rate of nearly 
one injury per five full-time-equivalent workers in 2021 (18.3 per 100 
workers)--a nearly 40 percent increase above the previous year's injury 
rate.'' By exploiting weak or under enforced laws governing labor, 
health and safety, Amazon has created a delivery system that is driving 
down wages and safety standards across the logistics industry, posing a 
threat to communities, workers and responsible high road business 
owners.

    In August, rank-and-file Teamster members voted by an overwhelming 
86.3 percent to ratify the most lucrative contract in the history of 
the Teamsters at UPS. The agreement passed by the highest vote ever for 
a Teamsters contract at UPS. This 5-year contract protects and rewards 
more than 340,000 UPS Teamsters in the United States and Puerto Rico, 
raising wages for full-and part-time workers, creating more full-time 
jobs, and securing important workplace protections, including--for the 
first time--air conditioning in new package cars and heat shields and 
ventilation ducts in existing vehicles, which will protect the safety 
and health of our members. The Amazon DSP business model robs DSP 
drivers of their rights under the NLRA. As a member of the Teamsters 
Union, a DSP driver would have the power of 1.3 million men and women 
standing with them and fighting with them to demand the same wages and 
working conditions that Teamsters at UPS have rightfully achieved.

    Response by Sara Nelson (AFA-CWA) to Questions of Senator Murray
                             senator murray
    President Nelson, you described the incredible work that your union 
has done to fight gender inequality and improve safety, not only for 
the members of your union, but also for the flying public.

    Question 1. How do collective bargaining and unions help ensure the 
safety of workers, including the 4,887 Association of Flight Attendants 
members in Washington, and the safety of passengers?

    Answer 1. Flight Attendants, pilots, air traffic controllers, TSA 
agents, mechanics, baggage handlers, gate agents, food caterers, 
airport concessions, and many other critical positions that are part of 
the aviation industry workforce ecosystem are safer when we have labor 
contracts in place that protect, workplace rights, and we are 
sufficiently staffed to carry out our duties safely and efficiently. 
Union protections are critical to empower workers to speak up, identify 
concerns/risks, and press for solutions. Today, we have serious 
concerns about the integrity of aviation safety with continued threats 
of government shutdowns and continuing resolutions that fail to provide 
the necessary support for hiring, training, infrastructure, and 
technology advancements. AFA urges the Senate to pass an FAA 
Reauthorization bill to maintain and improve aviation safety for crew 
and passengers. In addition to the fundamental need for shoring up our 
national air transportation system, AFA has pressed for specific safety 
initiatives included in the bill: improving cabin air quality, 
establishing Aircraft cabin Temperature Standards, Pumping Guidance, 
support for Flight Attendants to attend Crew Member Self Defense 
Training, updating aircraft emergency evacuation standards, reducing 
exposure to air turbulence, studying and reducing the risks of 
radiation exposure, deterring crew member interference by disruptive 
passengers, and review of Medical Equipment on Board.
      Response by Shawn Fain (UAW) to Questions of Senator Murray
                             senator murray
    The recent UAW contracts have shown the power of unions to win big 
for their members and make a real difference in the lives of workers 
and their families.

    Since January 2021, there have been 72 strikes in Washington state. 
As you are all too aware, strikes require workers to risk their 
livelihoods because labor law is simply inadequate to protect them--
that's a big part of why I first wrote the PRO Act.

    Question 2. How would the PRO Act help protect workers who choose 
to exercise their right to strike?

    Answer 2. The PRO Act protects employees' right to strike by 
preventing employers from hiring replacement workers, and from 
discriminating against employees who supported or participated in a 
strike. It also prohibits any lockouts from occurring prior to a 
strike. Under current law, employers may offensively lockout employees 
by prohibiting them from returning to the worksite, until they accept 
the employer's offer.

    It does more than solely protecting workers who strike. It empowers 
future union members and unions to exercise our freedom to organize and 
have a seat at the table to bargain wages, health and safety and 
benefits. Workers would be able to reach a first contract quickly after 
a union is recognized. The Act would end managements' practice of 
punishing striking workers by hiring permanent replacements.

    Speaking up for labor rights is within every worker's rights--and 
workers shouldn't lose our jobs for it. We need to hold corporations 
accountable by strengthening the National Labor Relations Act and 
allowing the government to significantly penalize employers who 
retaliate against working people in support of forming a union. We need 
to repeal ``right to work'' laws--that lead to lower wages, fewer 
benefits, and more dangerous workplaces.

    The PRO Act is more than labor law reform, it's protecting your 
rights in the workplace. A union contract is the single best tool we 
have to close racial and gender wage gaps, and to ensure dignity and 
due process for workers. When we expand collective bargaining, we 
increase protections for women, people of color, immigrants, and the 
LGBTQ community in areas where our laws are still falling short. The 
UAW has led the way on these issues through bargaining protections in 
workplace contracts and the PRO Act would significantly improve our 
ability to expand this work.
     Response by Sean O'Brien (IBT) to Questions of Senator Murray
                             senator murray
    It was great hearing about how the Teamsters wins at the bargaining 
table are helping to improve the lives of members and their families.

    However, we know that all too often, workers struggle to bring the 
employer who really controls their life at work to the table. That is 
why I have strongly supported the NLRB's Joint-Employer Rule, and led a 
comment letter with 21 of my colleagues in support of the proposed 
rule. This standard is also codified in the PRO Act.

    Question 3. President O'Brien, how would this important protection 
help workers?

    Answer 3. For workers to effectively exercise their right to 
collectively bargain on the job, they need to be able to negotiate with 
every entity that exercises meaningful control over the terms and 
conditions of their work. The NLRB rule outlines a process to determine 
when two or more entities will be considered a ``joint employer,'' by 
considering their control over workers' compensation, hours of work, 
disciplinary rules, assignment, and supervision of duties to be 
performed. When properly applied, this rule will guarantee that large 
corporations cannot avoid their responsibility to bargain with the 
workers that they ultimately control, when those workers choose to form 
a union.

    Companies like Amazon, for example should be held responsible as a 
joint-employer of their over 275,000 Delivery Service Partner (DSP) 
drivers. These drivers wear Amazon vests, drive Amazon-branded vehicles 
and log their movement on an Amazon app. Amazon controls virtually 
every aspect of a DSP driver's working life, but the company insists 
that these drivers are solely employed by supposedly independent 
businesses (Amazon's Delivery Service Partners) that contract with 
Amazon. The truth is that DSPs have discretion over very few aspects of 
their business, while shouldering the employment responsibilities that 
should rightfully be Amazon's to bear. When companies exploit weak 
labor law to avoid liabilities and shift costs to their supposed 
subcontractors, they are also harming small business owners by stifling 
entrepreneurship and fair competition. Enforcing the strongest possible 
joint employer protections will help to remedy this unfair practice.
