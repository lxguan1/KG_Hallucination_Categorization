                         THURSDAY, JUNE 8, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
                 Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:00 a.m. in 
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joe Manchin 
III, Chairman of the Committee, presiding.

          OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III, 
                U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA

    The Chairman. The Committee will come to order.
    This morning we are here to discuss the federal response to 
escalating wildfires. As it so happens, wildfire smoke from the 
wildfires burning right now in Canada has been affecting the 
skies, as you can see outside, and if you have been outside, 
you can sure taste it. Some of my colleagues on the Committee, 
particularly those from the western states, have much more 
firsthand experience with the impact of wildfires than some of 
us. Those impacts are numerous and range from devastating loss 
of life and property to air pollution. For example, the 
Government Accountability Office recently reported that smoke 
from U.S. wildfires now makes up 30 percent of the United 
States emissions of particulates, and things are not improving. 
In fact, in the last two decades, the top four largest 
wildfires in human history have occurred in both the Northern 
and Southern Hemispheres. In the U.S., more than half of the 
most destructive wildfires in our history have occurred since 
2018. Also, the acres burned annually have doubled in the past 
30 years and are forecasted to double again in the next 30 
years.
    Our Committee has discussed at length the impacts of 
climate conditions and past mismanagement of forests that have 
ushered in a new era of fuels and wildfires. We have 
essentially created a perfect storm. And as a result, we have 
witnessed an increase in the occurrence of megafires, with 
communities across the West suffering from tragic loss of life 
and property. While agency leaders have talked about correcting 
this course for some time, it unfortunately seems that with 
each passing year we continue to slip further behind. Because 
most of our Committee members are now intimately familiar with 
the causes and impacts of wildfires, we are going to spend much 
of our time this morning focusing on the firefighter workforce.
    As we are at the beginning of fire season for a large part 
of the U.S., let me first take a moment to thank all of the 
federal wildland firefighters for their service. These men and 
women bravely serve our country day-in and day-out, working 
long, grueling hours in a dangerous job. Despite the risk, they 
choose to continue to serve, and we all owe them a debt of 
gratitude and our support. My staff and Ranking Member 
Barrasso's staff have been talking directly with wildland 
firefighters and their family members, as well as several 
firefighter organizations to ensure that we fully understand 
what federal wildland firefighters are experiencing and how we 
can improve the federal capacity. We are particularly grateful 
to the Grassroots Wildland Firefighters and the National 
Federation of Federal Employees for working with us to ensure 
that we understand the issues permeating the workforce, as well 
as the pros and cons of potential solutions.
    Over the last two years, Congress has provided record 
levels of funding--over $10 billion--to help the federal 
agencies achieve a paradigm shift in the way they manage the 
wildland firefighting workforce and our public lands. So I look 
forward to hearing from our witnesses today about the 
bottlenecks the agencies are facing, because we must get to 
work changing the status quo. Not only is the safety of our 
communities and health of our forests at stake, but also the 
lives of the men and women who serve in our fire service. There 
are several proposals existing today that offer some creative, 
common-sense solutions for addressing the problems facing our 
firefighting workforce. For example, last year, Ranking Member 
Barrasso and I introduced the Promoting Effective Forest 
Management Act, which directs the agencies to undertake a range 
of activities aimed at reducing fire risk on federal lands. The 
bill also significantly modifies a current federal policy 
related to retirement benefits for firefighters.
    In previous hearings, we have discussed how if a federal 
firefighter has longer than a three-day break in service over a 
20-year career, he--or more often she--unconscionably must 
forfeit previously made retirement contributions. This is a 
policy that is impacting our workforce, and we must fix it. 
Also, I wanted to acknowledge that the Administration submitted 
a legislative proposal with its Fiscal Year 2024 budget request 
that would reform the way federal firefighters are paid. While 
this is a complicated issue, it is clear a great deal of 
thought and effort went into this proposal. I greatly 
appreciate that, and we believe we need to work to ensure that 
we get whatever the solution is right. I am sure we will 
discuss both of these in more detail this morning as our 
Committee looks at ways to increase retention in our shrinking 
wildland firefighting workforce.
    I want to thank our witnesses for being here today, and I 
look forward to hearing your perspectives on the situation that 
we find ourselves in with wildfires and our firefighters, as 
well as your perspectives on the potential solutions that we 
need.
    With that, I am going to turn it over to Ranking Member 
Barrasso for his opening statement.

           OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO, 
                   U.S. SENATOR FROM WYOMING

    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman. 
Thanks so much for holding this hearing today. Wildfires in 
Canada have ushered in smoke and poor air quality right here in 
Washington, DC this morning. This is what we have been 
experiencing far too frequently in Wyoming and throughout the 
West, and it is a sobering reminder that we must manage our 
forests to make them more resilient to catastrophic fires. In 
recent years, our western states have endured wildfires of 
unprecedented scale and destructiveness. These fires ravage 
forests, destroy communities, and upend lives and livelihoods. 
On average, roughly eight million acres burned each year 
between 2017 and 2022. Now, that is more than double the 
average annual acreage burned in the 1990s. Western states are 
again bracing for what will likely be another devastating 
wildfire season this summer.
    As fire seasons have become longer and more destructive, 
fire suppression costs have increased dramatically. Over the 
last five years, suppression costs averaged $2.86 billion a 
year. In 2021, agencies spent a record of over $4 billion on 
suppression activities. It is unsustainable to keep throwing 
more and more money and resources at suppression without 
dramatically increasing mitigation. Waiting for our forests and 
communities to burn is not a defensible strategy. America's 
wildfire crisis will continue to escalate until our forests are 
properly managed. Our forests are overgrown and they are 
unhealthy. This is due to decades of misguided policies, 
including a hands-off approach to management and associated 
declines in sawmill infrastructure.
    Between Forest Service and Department of Interior lands, 
over 100 million acres are at elevated risk to high-intensity, 
catastrophic fires. Mr. Chairman, that is more than six times 
the size of West Virginia. Fires on federal lands are typically 
much larger and much more destructive than fires that ignite on 
state or private lands. In a report from last summer, the 
Congressional Budget Office concluded that fires on federal 
lands are five times larger than those on non-federal lands. 
And that is why, in this Committee, we have heard time and time 
again that federal agencies need to increase the pace and scale 
of fire mitigation. These increases cannot be incremental. 
Mitigation needs to increase by orders of magnitude. This 
includes the removal of hazardous fuels through mechanical 
thinning and prescribed burn projects.
    We have heard from both the Forest Service and the 
Department of the Interior that a paradigm shift is needed. 
Congress has given agencies billions of dollars in additional 
taxpayer funding. And we have heard ambitious rhetoric. We have 
seen lines drawn on maps. What we have yet to see is progress 
at the pace necessary to actually address the problem. We know 
that too often such progress is stopped by regulatory red tape 
and by harmful litigation that prevent critical fire mitigation 
projects from moving forward. This Committee has considered 
legislative solutions to cut red tape and stop frivolous 
lawsuits. They include Senator Daines's bill to undo the 
disastrous Cottonwood decision, which has tied up important 
fire prevention in the courts, and Senator Risch's FIRESHEDS 
Act, which would enhance collaboration and cut regulatory red 
tape in high-risk, fire-prone areas. And Mr. Chairman, the bill 
you mentioned earlier, the bill that you and I have together, 
the Promoting Effective Forest Management Act, would increase 
agency transparency and require the use of streamlined 
authorities. And I am hopeful that in this Congress we can 
actually act on these badly needed reforms.
    One of the major consequences of the wildfire crisis is the 
effect it has had on brave firefighters. A recent Government 
Accountability Office report concludes that increased wildfire 
activity across the West is straining the federal wildland 
firefighting workforce. Factors such as low pay, poor work/life 
balance, and mental and physical health challenges from 
fighting longer and more brutal fire seasons, all are hurting 
the firefighting workforce. For years, our firefighters have 
been asked to do too much for too little in return. The only 
way to ensure that we have enough firefighters to defend our 
forests into the future is to ensure that they are fully 
supported and compensated. These are the issues we need to 
address.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to today's hearing 
and testimony.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Barrasso.
    We have a great panel assembled this morning. Today, we 
have Mr. Jeffery Rupert from the Department of the Interior's 
Office of Wildland Fire.
    We have Deputy Chief Jaelith Hall-Rivera from the Forest 
Service.
    We have Ms. Kelly Norris, the Interim State Forester of 
Wyoming.
    And we have Mr. Cardell Johnson from the Government 
Accountability Office.
    And Mr. Rupert, we will start with you.

 STATEMENT OF JEFF RUPERT, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF WILDLAND FIRE, 
                U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

    Mr. Rupert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Good afternoon Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, 
and members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to 
appear before you this afternoon to provide testimony on the 
federal response to escalating wildfires and Interior's efforts 
to reform land management and wildland firefighter recruitment 
and retention. The discussion today will convey Interior's most 
pressing wildland fire needs and our efforts to support 
compensation for our wildland firefighting workforce as well as 
to reduce risk and effectively manage wildfire response now and 
into the future. The climate continues to play an oversized 
role in the extreme fire weather we are experiencing across the 
nation and across the continent. A drier and hotter climate 
results in low field moisture that frequently leads to extreme 
conditions that produce these large and intense wildfires and 
megafires.
    The June 2023 National Significant Wildland Fire Potential 
Outlook assesses fire potential throughout the country for the 
next four months. Portions of Alaska, Oregon, Washington, 
Nevada, Idaho, Montana, the Great Lakes, and the Northeast are 
predicted to have above normal significant wildland fire 
potential over the next four months. And I would just make the 
obvious observation, as Chairman, you and the Ranking Member 
opened, the smoke that we are having and the impact that tens 
of millions of us are experiencing right now, are an extension 
of that fire potential across eastern parts of North America 
and what is occurring in Canada right now and that our friends 
and fellow citizens in the West have frequently experienced in 
recent years. We are tackling this climate crisis and working 
to improve the wildfire resiliency of our nation's lands with 
the help of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). It 
provides Interior with nearly a billion and a half dollars of 
funding over five years. So this support is being used 
collaboratively with our partners to increase the pace and 
scale of fuels management, treatments to rehabilitate lands 
damaged by wildfires, fund wildland fire related research, and 
to increase wildland firefighter pay.
    With this funding, and annual appropriations, Interior is 
accomplishing risk reduction. Last year, we accomplished 1.9 
million acres of priority reduction treatments, which was a 20 
percent increase over 2021. And this year, our goal is to treat 
2.1 million acres. These longer, more intense fire years and 
the need to actively manage and reduce fuels across 
increasingly flammable landscapes has increased the demand and 
pressure on our workforce. It is widely recognized that a new 
model is needed to address wildland firefighter recruitment and 
retention and provide better pay, more career stability, better 
upward mobility, and much better work/life balance. With the 
passage of the BIL in 2022, Interior and the Forest Service 
implemented temporary special pay supplements for federal 
wildland firefighters. In Interior, over 3,800 wildland 
firefighters received support last year. This year, that 
support is going to more than 4,000 Interior wildland 
firefighters.
    To further advance these wildland firefighter pay reforms, 
this year's budget proposal includes an increase for Interior 
of $72 million to raise the base pay of DOI and tribal wildland 
firefighters. To implement these reforms, the Administration 
has also proposed legislation that would establish a new 
special base pay rate for firefighters, create a new premium 
pay category, as well as propose a new annual pay cap. The 
budget also includes funding to hire additional Interior 
firefighters as well as tribal firefighters. Without the 
additional funding and reforms, we are facing a pay cliff, as 
the bill funding is estimated to run out at the end of this 
fiscal year. That could have a devastating effect on not only 
our firefighter morale, but certainly, our ability to recruit 
and retain firefighters.
    We are working closely with the Forest Service to provide 
much-needed mental health support as well. We know that mental 
health is affecting firefighters. They are at elevated risk. 
And we just held a behavioral health and well-being summit in 
Boise that is being used inform the development of a joint 
program moving forward. No single entity can solve the crisis 
alone. The Wildland Fire Leadership Council has recently 
updated the National Cohesive Wildland Fire Strategy that 
reinforces the need to collaborate. And we very much appreciate 
Congress's willingness to support these efforts and help 
Interior effectively address this wildland fire crisis so that 
we can continue to work with our federal, tribal, state, and 
local partners to protect communities, people, and resources.
    This concludes my statement. I am happy to answer any 
questions. Thank you.

    The Chairman. Thank you, sir.
    And now, we will have Ms. Rivera.

   STATEMENT OF JAELITH HALL-RIVERA, DEPUTY CHIEF OF STATE, 
       PRIVATE, AND TRIBAL FORESTRY, USDA FOREST SERVICE

    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Thank you.
    Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and members of 
the Committee, thank you for this opportunity to testify on the 
upcoming 2023 fire year, the ongoing wildfire crisis, and how 
we are working to improve forest health and protect 
communities. I have seen firsthand the destruction that 
wildfires have on communities, infrastructure, and our natural 
resources, and, of course, today, we can look right outside 
here in Washington, DC and see those impacts. Wildfire risk has 
reached crisis proportions and wildfires are having more and 
more impacts each year.
    I want to personally thank our partners who answer our call 
for assistance to bolster our capabilities. We are grateful for 
all of our partners around the country and around the world, 
who continue to pitch in to help our nation through each 
difficult year, as we are doing this year in Canada. As the 
size and severity of fires has grown, so too has our need for 
fire personnel. As we approach the busiest part of the 2023 
fire year, the Forest Service aspires to hire 11,300 wildland 
firefighters nationwide. As of May 30, we have hired 10,068 
firefighters, or about 89 percent of our goal. We are 
cautiously optimistic we will reach our hiring goals. We know 
that that is still not enough. That is why the President's FY24 
budget proposes funding to hire 970 additional firefighters in 
the Forest Service. In addition, for the 2023 fire year, the 
Forest Service will have up to 24 next-generation air tankers, 
more than 200 helicopters, and more than 900 engines available 
to manage wildfires.
    Wildland firefighters are the backbone of our ability to 
protect communities and vital infrastructure from wildfires. 
The only way that we are going to attract people to this 
challenging and hazardous work is to pay them fairly. Federal 
wages for firefighters have not kept pace with wages offered by 
state, local, and private entities. The workforce reforms 
proposed in the President's FY24 budget request in supporting 
legislation will increase federal and tribal firefighters' pay, 
invest more in their mental and physical health and well-being, 
improve their housing options, and expand the number of 
permanent firefighters. These reforms build on the temporary 
pay increase provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act. And thanks to that legislation, more than 14,000 Forest 
Service firefighters received a temporary pay increase. 
However, the funding for that pay supplement will be spent by 
the end of September 2023 unless Congress intervenes to avert 
the pay cliff.
    To ensure pay continuity in the FY24 budget, we are 
proposing a permanent base pay increase for all firefighters. 
Our budget proposal includes a request for $180 million in the 
Forest Service in support of a special base rate salary table 
for firefighters and incident standby pay for all responders 
that are mobilized to an incident. This new pay table was 
calculated to increase the total annual compensation to a level 
commensurate with state and private-sector wildland 
firefighters. For example, an entry-level firefighter would 
receive at least a 34 percent increase in pay under the new pay 
table. And unlike the temporary increase in BIL, a permanent 
base pay increase is an investment in our firefighters' future, 
as an increase in basic pay leads to an increase in retirement 
benefits. We will need Congress to pass special legislation 
that authorizes this new pay table, and I look forward to 
working with all of you on that. We are working to make a 
difference and improve the lives of Forest Service 
firefighters. Together, we can make a difference in the quality 
of life for our firefighters who protect our own quality of 
life.
    In addition to paying firefighters fairly, we must support 
their mental and physical health. Our FY24 budget proposal 
calls for an increase of $10 million to enhance support for our 
firefighters' mental and physical health and well-being. The 
budget also proposes a $50 million investment in housing. We 
recognize that addressing the housing crisis must happen now, 
as it impacts our ability to recruit and retain our workforce. 
Together, these efforts would help address longstanding 
recruitment and retention challenges. These investments, 
totaling $569 million for the Forest Service, will help us 
ensure we can continue meeting evolving mission demands, as 
both the frequency and intensity of catastrophic wildfires are 
expected to increase.
    Long-term, we must address work on the ground to ultimately 
address the wildfire crisis. Over the last two decades, we have 
witnessed what has become a new normal--bigger and more 
destructive wildfires that are extremely costly and challenging 
to suppress. The growing wildfire crisis created the need for a 
new land management strategy, and we are in the second year of 
carrying out our 10-year Wildfire Crisis Strategy in the Forest 
Service. The strategy aims to increase science-based fuels 
treatment by up to four times previous levels, calling for up 
to 20 million acres to be treated in the National Forest System 
over the coming decade and working with partners to have 30 
million additional acres to be treated in the next decade. The 
Forest Service is very grateful to Congress for providing the 
resources through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
and the Inflation Reduction Act to seed our initial work and 
put the wildfire crisis strategy in motion.
    In closing, I want to reiterate the agency's commitment to 
keeping our communities and firefighters safe as fire seasons 
grow longer and more severe. The dedication, bravery, and 
professional integrity of our firefighters and support 
personnel is second to none. We greatly appreciate the 
significant resources Congress has provided to take the initial 
steps to address the wildfire crisis and we look forward to 
working with the Committee to continue providing world-class 
suppression response and reducing the severity of wildfires in 
our country.
    Thank you.

    The Chairman. Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks so much, Mr. Chairman.
    I would like to introduce Kelly Norris, who is here from 
Wyoming. And Kelly, I am so pleased you could join us today 
with such short notice.
    Kelly is currently a resident of Cheyenne, Wyoming. She has 
lived around the state in her work with the Forestry Division. 
Kelly has worked for the Wyoming State Forestry Division for 
more than 13 years. She has a degree in forestry from the 
University of Wisconsin, and in January, Governor Gordon 
appointed her to serve as our Interim State Forester for the 
State of Wyoming. Kelly has incredible experience working as a 
forester for both the State of Wyoming, and before that, the 
U.S. Forest Service. So she has years' worth of critical on-
the-ground knowledge and is a valuable resource for the many 
issues that we are going to be discussing here today.
    Kelly, congratulations, again, on your appointment. Thanks 
so much for joining us today from Wyoming, in Washington.

  STATEMENT OF KELLY NORRIS, INTERIM STATE FORESTER, WYOMING 
                    STATE FORESTRY DIVISION

    Ms. Norris. Thank you.
    Thank you, Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and 
members of the Committee for the opportunity to testify on 
behalf of the Wyoming State Forestry Division. My name is Kelly 
Norris and I am the Interim Wyoming State Forester.
    The integration and cooperation of federal, state, and 
county cooperators has been a success for Wyoming. Our 
firefighter entities have adapted and evolved over decades to 
become a more effective and efficient alliance whose main focus 
is protecting life and our valuable communities, 
infrastructure, grasslands, and forests. Wyoming State Forestry 
is tasked with wildfire suppression and management on 3.5 
million acres of state trust land and coordinating suppression 
on 29 million acres of private land. Forty-eight percent of the 
state is federally owned. The BLM manages 18 million acres, the 
Forest Service manages 9 million acres, and the BIA manages 2.2 
million acres, each having their respective suppression 
responsibilities.
    Wyoming State Forestry is an extremely small organization. 
We depend almost exclusively on local county volunteers and our 
federal partners for initial attack. State Forestry supports 
the state's initial attack response with our helitack single-
engine air tankers and the inmate conservation crew. In 
Wyoming, we believe in the ``closest resources response'' 
concept. Typically, that means our county cooperators will be 
the first firefighters arriving to the wildfire. Other times it 
might be the BLM or U.S. Forest Service firefighters who are 
responding first to a wildfire. Everyone coordinates to 
suppress wildfire, no matter the jurisdictional responsibility. 
A great example of interagency cooperation is our aviation 
program. We contract our helicopter and manage our program with 
one permanent and four seasonal employees. The Medicine Bow-
Routt National Forest and Thunder Basin National Grasslands 
support our helitack program by providing a trained employee to 
assist us in managing it. Two detailers are also provided by 
the local national forest to help support the program.
    The Committee is aware of the immediate issue with 
recruitment and retention of federal firefighters. This is also 
a challenge for our state and county fire districts. As veteran 
firefighters retire, they are not being replaced at the same 
rate. The need to effectively recruit within our county 
volunteer fire districts is a big concern that Wyoming is 
looking to address. We need to work together to find solutions 
that meet the needs of our wildland fire community. There will 
not be a one-size-fits-all solution, as the need will have to 
be addressed at all levels.
    I would like to transition the conversation to proactively 
managing for the health of Wyoming's forests. A recent study 
from the Nature Conservancy found that Wyoming's forests 
provided approximately $26 billion of economic value every 
year. Our forests are the headwaters to four of the nation's 
main river basins and provide more than just board-feet sold. 
They should be managed appropriately for the values they 
provide, such as water supply and storage, wildlife habitat, 
recreation and tourism, and carbon storage. Wildfire and forest 
health threats know no boundaries and there is an urgent need 
for active forest management. Last year's Fish Creek Fire, 
located in the Black Hills, was stopped in a fuel break 
treatment area. The fuel break saved multiple homes while 
helping bring the fire down in intensity and gave our 
firefighters the opportunity to control the wildfire safely and 
effectively.
    State agencies must be a part of the solution to getting 
more management done on the ground with our federal forests. 
Wyoming State Forestry has increased its Good Neighbor 
Authority (GNA) program successfully, and sold 11 million 
board-feet of federal timber in our 2022 Fiscal Year. However, 
GNA can be more than assisting federal partners with timber 
sales. GNA can provide flexibility needed through our state 
contracting systems to complete a wide variety of projects for 
our federal partners.
    In conclusion, thank you for the opportunity to appear 
before the Committee today. Wildland fire response continues to 
be one of the most challenging problems our agency faces. This 
primary mission is further complicated by the persistent 
challenges with recruitment and retention of our wildland 
firefighters. The other side to the wildfire response problem 
is long-term, as it relates to the health of our forests. We 
need to address how we continue to manage our forests by making 
strategic investments in them. We must continue to implement 
more active forest management on all ownerships.
    Thank you.

    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Mr. Johnson.

 STATEMENT OF CARDELL JOHNSON, DIRECTOR, NATURAL RESOURCES AND 
       ENVIRONMENT, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE

    Mr. Johnson. Thank you.
    Chairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and members of 
the Committee, good morning and thank you for the opportunity 
to provide testimony on this important topic. My statement 
today will provide the Committee with insight and context on 
the barriers to hiring and retaining federal wildland 
firefighters. Firefighting is demanding work, and to better 
understand these barriers and the demands they place on the 
firefighters, GAO met with several organizations that represent 
the men and women that do this work. Our analysis of these 
barriers is informed by their perspectives, as well as our 
examination of information from the land management agencies. 
The barriers identified in our November 2022 report include low 
pay, remote or expensive duty stations, poor work/life balance, 
and career advancement challenges, among others. Low pay was 
cited as the top barrier, despite federal actions to increase 
firefighter pay. Low pay impacts recruitment and retention 
because other industries, such as food service, offer equal or 
better pay for less dangerous work.
    Our analysis identified three concerns with some of the 
recent federal pay actions. The first concern being, pay does 
not reflect the hazardous physical and mental demands of the 
job. Second, that pay may not be competitive with non-federal 
entities, and the third concern being that appropriated funds 
supporting recent base salary increases will likely run out 
this fiscal year. Related to low pay is the issue of remote or 
expensive duty stations. It has been reported that some 
firefighters are living out of their cars because they cannot 
afford housing. Duty stations that are more remote may not 
always provide easy access to basic services such as grocery 
stores or even broadband coverage, which helps firefighters 
stay connected with their families while they are away. Agency 
officials and stakeholder groups told us that raising pay, as 
well as giving further consideration to incentives, could 
mitigate this barrier.
    Low pay and expensive duty stations are also poor drivers 
of work/life balance. This is another barrier cited by nearly 
all of the stakeholders we met with. Poor work/life balance 
impacts retention because it drives firefighters to take a 
break from service or leave the workforce entirely. And if that 
happens, agencies lose valuable firefighting knowledge and 
experience. Some stakeholders said that federal agencies would 
be better positioned to recruit former firefighters back to 
service if they were eligible to return to the special 
retirement system available to firefighters who worked more 
than three years in certain positions. However, eligibility for 
that special retirement system is governed by statute. So any 
changes to that eligibility would need to be made by Congress. 
Career advancement challenges pose another barrier to hiring 
and retaining firefighters. Without career advancement 
opportunities, firefighters may find it difficult to maximize 
their career earning potential. But some progress is being made 
in addressing this barrier. Agencies worked with OPM to develop 
a new occupational series aimed at providing a clearer career 
path for firefighters. However, implementation of this is 
ongoing and it really is too early to determine the outcomes.
    In conclusion, we want to recognize that land management 
agencies are actively addressing the barriers identified in our 
November 2022 report. The barriers are complex and interrelated 
and they require long-term solutions that may need support from 
Congress. Addressing temporary pay actions before they expire 
and changing retirement eligibility requirements to make it 
easy for firefighters to return to work without being penalized 
for a break in service may go a long way to support 
firefighters who risk their lives to protect our communities, 
such as from the smoke that we are experiencing today, as well 
as our critical infrastructure and natural resources.
    This concludes my oral statement, and I am happy to respond 
to questions. Thank you, Chair.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Johnson follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    The Chairman. Let me thank all of you for your insight and 
your addresses. I will start my questions with Ms. Norris.
    I understand you previously worked for the Forest Service, 
and I am curious to hear why you decided to leave the Forest 
Service and instead work for the great State of Wyoming's State 
Forestry Division. And Mr. Johnson, in your testimony, you 
mentioned that the current retirement system might affect the 
agency's ability to attract former firefighters to return to 
the federal service. So this question is for both of you. Can 
you tell us more about the issues, Mr. Johnson, you are 
referring to, and Ms. Norris, tell us why you left.
    Senator Barrasso. And you can't have her back.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Norris. Thank you, Chairman.
    That is correct. I did leave the Forest Service. That had 
to do with the fact that my husband and I, at the time, found a 
position at the base of the Bighorn Mountains, and that is 
where I wanted to be. And so I took the State Forestry job. 
Now, I stayed with State Forestry for multiple reasons. State 
Forestry offered me a great opportunity to make a difference 
for the State of Wyoming. We are in the communities. We are 
helping do management across private, state, and federal lands. 
We are fully a part of every aspect when it comes to wildland 
fire, to planting trees in our communities and creating 
orchards, to helping a landowner learn how to actively manage 
their timber. Outside of that, the pay is just as good as the 
Forest Service, and when it gets to the point, I have a great 
group of people I get to work with, top notch.
    The Chairman. You are getting more satisfaction because you 
have more flexibility than you did with the Federal Forest 
Service?
    Ms. Norris. Yes, and I have a great culture to work with.
    The Chairman. Have you basically given any of your input 
back to the former agencies or the changes that need to be 
made? Because we have to find a working environment that 
basically enriches our Forest Service employees now, as you 
have been enriched by the State of Wyoming.
    Ms. Norris. Yes, and I agree with you, and I think it is 
all about the culture and support. I have top notch people I 
get to work for and work with.
    The Chairman. Great.
    Mr. Johnson.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you. So with the retirement system, 
firefighters who serve in a primary firefighting role are 
eligible for a special retirement system that is similar to law 
enforcement, where after 20 years of service, they are eligible 
to retire. And so, after spending that three years in that 
primary firefighting role, they are able to move on to other 
roles, so, for example, a support or fire management role. If 
they take a break in service, and let's say they want to come 
back seven years later, they have to start back over in the 
primary firefighting role, which we all recognize is a very 
stressful----
    The Chairman. That is common sense. Why hasn't that been 
changed?
    Mr. Johnson. Well----
    The Chairman. They have the ability to change it, I am 
sure.
    Mr. Johnson. Yes, so changes for that are governed by 
statute, so that would require legislative action.
    The Chairman. Thank you. Say no more.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. Yes, I think we heard you loud and clear.
    So your opinion is basically that we have to basically give 
you the direction, give you the code to do that with.
    Mr. Johnson. Yes, that is what we have heard.
    The Chairman. Have you made that request to us before 
today?
    Mr. Johnson. This is something that we have identified in 
our November 2022 report, and it is one of the things that I 
wanted to highlight in our testimony for you.
    The Chairman. Okay. Thank you for doing so. And we will--
Martin, you get right on that, okay?
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. Mr. Rupert and Ms. Hall-Rivera, I understand 
that prior to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law being enacted, 
recruitment and retention among federal firefighters was 
waning. But let's look at, as an example, an imaginary 
employee, and let's follow the money. In this example, a 
firefighter quits federal service to go to work for a state 
agency or private contractor. When a fire comes, I understand 
that when we do not have enough federal firefighters, federal 
appropriations are used to reimburse a state agency verbatim 
for their rate of pay as firefighters, or appropriations are 
used to pay the private contractor at whatever rate it wishes 
to charge. Now, with that, does that mean the firefighter is 
receiving increased pay and the Federal Government is paying 
for it? Is it better for them to work from an outside group 
than from within?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. I will start. Yes, Senator, that is 
accurate. We, of course, depend on our cooperators and our 
contractors. They are an important part of our system. But if 
we are not able to compensate our firefighters, and they leave 
and go and work for those entities, the Federal Government is 
still going to be paying for that, you know--
    The Chairman. Is that a code thing? Is that our fault, too?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. No, it's just how the system works, right? 
We all cooperate together, but you know, it's an expensive 
endeavor for the Federal Government to reimburse.
    The Chairman. We are going to pay the contractor whatever 
it costs.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Right. In a busy year--for example, take 
2021--the Forest Service paid over $470 million to state 
cooperators.
    The Chairman. Mr. Rupert, real quick.
    Mr. Rupert. I would just add two quick points to that. One, 
exactly as said, when wildfires are occurring, we must respond.
    The Chairman. Right.
    Mr. Rupert. So the response is going to occur, and two, if 
you look at structurally how that contractor support is paid 
for, it is with suppression funds. And in the case where that 
is more expensive, that is one of the direct threats to the 
``fire-funding fix'' which has functioned very well up to this 
point. And so we do have these complex relationships as well 
that are important and mean something.
    The Chairman. As I close, I will just say that basically, 
you know, we have invested $10 billion. We would like to know 
where it went to and what we are doing to prevent these 
outrageous fires that we are having that are harming so many 
people and if we have done enough there, but we are going 
through the money. I understand why Grant took Richmond, and it 
doesn't give us very good hope right now that it is being used 
as effectively as it could.
    Senator Barrasso.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, thanks, Mr. Chairman.
    Ms. Norris, so the Forest Service has come out with a 10-
year strategy to combat the wildfire crisis, and they announced 
significant spending across 21 designated areas. The dollars 
fund projects critical for reducing wildfire risk and defending 
America's forests. They are going to protect people's lives and 
livelihoods. Now, unbelievable to me, Wyoming is the only state 
located on or west of the Rocky Mountains that has not received 
any of the funding of these 21 designated areas under this 
strategy. Could you just outline the challenges that Wyoming is 
facing with respect to fire risk, as well as why you think it 
is so critical that the Forest Service works to protect 
national forests in our state?
    Ms. Norris. Thank you, Senator.
    Wyoming's forests have the same wildfire risk as any other 
forest in the western states. Our forests are overstocked. They 
have insect and disease outbreaks. We have areas of high 
mortality. And our forests are primed to burn due to drought. 
Wyoming's forests need to be protected because of the values 
they provide to our communities and also to the rest of the 
West. Our forests provide timber supply, critical wildlife 
habitat, water storage and supply. Our forests are considered 
the headwater forests because they contain the headwaters of 
four major river basins in the West. A catastrophic wildfire 
would substantially impact our communities as well as many of 
the communities further down the stream.
    Thank you.
    Senator Barrasso. So Ms. Hall-Rivera, in April, I sent a 
letter, along with Senator Lummis and Representative Harriet 
Hageman. We sent it to Chief Moore and to Secretary Vilsack. 
You may have seen it, and Mr. Chairman, I will put it in the 
record.
    [The letter referred to follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. The letter details our concern over 
Wyoming's exclusion from this 10-year strategy to address the 
wildfire crisis. Later that month, Chief Moore was here. I 
asked him directly why Wyoming was excluded. I am still waiting 
for answers. So Ms. Hall-Rivera, does the Forest Service plan 
to protect Wyoming's forests under the 10-year strategy?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Thank you for that question, Senator.
    As you probably know, we have invested $13 million in the 
State of Wyoming in the past couple of years in a variety of 
different funds, including the Joint Chiefs' Landscape 
Restoration Partnership, the Collaborative Landscape 
Restoration Program, and others. But I understand your concern 
about the wildfire crisis strategy investments. There are many, 
many places at risk in the West, as you know. The funding that 
we have received, we are very grateful for, but we have said 
multiple times that it is a down payment on all the work that 
needs to be done in this country. And as we look at further 
announcements or get additional resources, we will take a hard 
look at Wyoming.
    Senator Barrasso. Well, I believe this is an egregious 
omission, and I would ask that you continue to work to correct 
this omission.
    Ms. Norris, this morning, the Wall Street Journal published 
an editorial about the impact of forest fires on the 
environment and the need for active forest management to 
prevent catastrophic wildfires. The editorial, ``Wildfires and 
Progressive Climate-Change Deniers,'' it says, ``Government 
land management policies that prevent wildfires from spreading 
out of control, such as prescribed burns, would actually reduce 
CO<INF>2</INF> emissions more than offshore wind or electric 
vehicle mandates. Alas, this doesn't fit with the climate 
left's book of Revelation.''
    [The editorial referred to follows:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Barrasso. Do you agree that active forest 
management such as cutting trees that are at higher risk of 
burning is not only critical to saving lives and property and 
our forests, but also helps combat climate change?
    Ms. Norris. Thank you, Senator.
    I agree. That is an easy question. Yes, active management 
is needed. It is needed to help us with our mitigating the 
negative impacts from wildfire. A great example was in my 
testimony, which was in the Fish Creek Fire fuel break, where 
we were able to control that fire and stop it from burning down 
homes and affecting people's lives. So yes, active management 
is the answer.
    Senator Barrasso. So then, Ms. Hall-Rivera, I see you 
shaking your head yes. I know that the Forest Service, though, 
is spending time and money on policies like your old-growth 
inventory that promise to make active management more 
difficult, it seems to me, when clearly, increasing forest 
treatments should be the top priority.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, Senator, we absolutely agree with 
you. That is why we are focusing on significantly scaling up 
our treatments as a result of our wildfire crisis strategy. We 
absolutely need more active management in our forests if we are 
going to combat this wildfire crisis.
    Senator Barrasso. And then, Mr. Chairman, my final question 
for Ms. Norris is, we have heard today Congress will need to 
act in order to ensure the federal agencies can recruit and 
retain a wildland firefighter workforce. Can you elaborate on 
how much Wyoming depends on partnerships with wildland 
firefighters to help defend our forests in terms of how vital 
it is for Wyoming to be fully staffed?
    Ms. Norris. Thank you, Senator.
    It is vital. The Federal Government owns 48 percent of the 
state and is responsible for 48 percent of that to suppress. 
Our wildfire community is interdependent, and any reduction in 
capacity will substantially impact our ability to respond. 
Wyoming simply does not have the resources to respond to an 
additional 48 percent of the state. And we need our federal 
partners to be a dependable partner in the wildfire response.
    Senator Barrasso. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now, we have Senator Heinrich.
    Senator Heinrich. Thank you, Chairman.
    I want to start out and just say it would be irresponsible 
to have this hearing and not consider the role that climate 
change is playing in the fires that we are experiencing in the 
West, in particular, and now in Canada as well, of course. Due 
to climate change, some of the things that have changed are 
that we used to have these historic reservoirs of moisture in 
both forest soils and in standing timber. And one of the things 
we have experienced in New Mexico is that during these long 
drought periods driven by the changes we are seeing in our 
climate, there are times when there is more moisture in a two-
by-four at Home Depot than there is in a standing, live 
ponderosa pine in our forests in New Mexico.
    So for Mr. Rupert or Ms. Hall-Rivera, can you talk a little 
bit about the role that climate change is playing in the kind 
of seasons and fire behavior we are seeing, and then two, the 
issue of active management, because one of the things that I 
have seen in successful treatments where we are managing our 
forests is that the treatments we need remove the small ladder 
fuels. They oftentimes leave the large standing timber that 
sequesters most of the carbon. So if you could respond to that 
with respect to what Senator Barrasso was asking, and the 
relationship there.
    Mr. Rupert. Well, sure, I think, as you point out on the 
effect of climate, more extreme swings in how climate affects 
weather, so we go through these periods of extreme drought--
lengthy, extreme drought, and that has an effect on that fuel 
moisture that absolutely is a huge part of driving these 
catastrophic megafires that we are experiencing. Active 
management is important because another factor along with 
climate that does affect the current status of wildfire in the 
nation is related to, largely, our past practice of fire 
suppression, active fire suppression. We are really good at 
putting out fires, and granted, we have these megafires that we 
are unable to initially respond to and suppress, but in the 
average year there are between 60 and 70,000 wildfires in this 
nation. The vast majority of those fires, we put out. And 
again, the result of that is we have this accumulated fuel that 
is now drying.
    And active management is an important part of addressing 
that--all the tools in the toolbox. I would point out, to your 
point, those fine fuels, there is really good, solid scientific 
support at this point that in addition to mechanical treatment, 
in addition to all the biomass approach, we have thinning, 
grazing, prescribed fire, reintroducing fire to really address 
that point you make--those fine fuels are an important piece 
that can't be left out in these fire-adapted systems.
    Senator Heinrich. Generally agree, Ms. Hall-Rivera?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, I do. I don't think I have anything I 
could add.
    Senator Heinrich. I am running out of time, so I want to 
ask both of you to--you know, we have seen proposed from our 
colleagues in the House of Representatives potentially double-
digit cuts across many government agencies. What would those 
kinds of reductions in budget do to our wildland firefighter 
force?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Well, that, coupled with the pay cliff, 
would be pretty catastrophic for our fire workforce. We know 
that if we are not able to get a change in pay status for our 
firefighters that we are going to see many of them go to 
higher-paying jobs where they can make a living wage and 
support their families. You know, we are hearing from our 
firefighting union that we could lose 30 to 50 percent of our 
firefighting workforce. In the Forest Service, that would be 
devastating.
    Senator Heinrich. Thirty to fifty percent?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes.
    Senator Heinrich. Yes.
    Talk a little bit about the temporary pay increase and how 
important it is going to be to make that a permanent pay 
increase.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, we absolutely need that, Senator, so 
that we can keep our firefighting workforce so we can retain 
them and recruit new folks into this work, take care of them, 
help them have a healthier work/life balance, and pay them what 
they deserve to be paid for the hazardous work that they are 
doing.
    Mr. Rupert. I would just really briefly add to that. So we 
know that we have seen firefighters who have made the choice 
not to retire as a result of the pay support that we have been 
able to provide over the last two years. We have also had 
success expanding our capacity. We are seeing more firefighters 
come in. If we lose the ability to provide that pay support, as 
Jaelith points out, we recognize we are going to be impacted on 
both the recruitment and the retention side.
    Senator Heinrich. Okay. Thank you, both.
    The Chairman. Thanks, Senator.
    Senator Lee.
    Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Smoke from wildfires in Canada has blanketed the 
northeastern United States, including here in Washington. I 
checked the air quality index this morning, and it's 313, which 
is considered hazardous. This is rarely seen in the United 
States and is not healthy, to put it mildly. And I am sure many 
of us have seen pictures of the thick smoke in New York City 
over the last couple of days, which yesterday had the very 
worst air quality among all of the world's major cities. Now, 
most Easterners are not used to dealing with this level of 
smoke, and by Easterners, I mean, basically anybody to the east 
of Colorado, but----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Lee. This is an unfortunate recurring reality for 
us in the West. This is picture of downtown Salt Lake City.
    [The photograph referred to follows:]
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

    Senator Lee. Now, Salt Lake City doesn't look like this 
normally, but from time to time we have these neighbors, I 
mean, here we have Canada to deal with. We have California and 
Utah, hundreds of miles apart, and yet, they have fires. And 
when they have fires, this is what those fires do to us. They 
blanket us in this thick oppressive layer of smoke. And it can 
create dangerous air quality levels, just as this has done in 
the eastern United States this week. But that is just an August 
day when wildfires burn in places like California and then the 
smoke blows over to us.
    But western fires usually do not cause quite the national 
stir that we have seen in the last few days, even though this 
is something we deal with with some regularity. But they ought 
to be of concern to all of us because they do happen, and for 
us, they happen quite frequently. The reason these fires have 
become so severe and so frequent in the West is because of 
unwise forest management practices on land that is owned and 
controlled by the Federal Government. The reality is that over 
the last century or so, we have had this paradox unfold in 
front of us in which federal land managers have, in some ways, 
gone too far in aggressively suppressing the naturally 
occurring wildfires, leading to overgrown and unhealthy 
forests. And so, in that respect, it's overaction. In other 
areas, it's underaction--failure to undertake aggressive forest 
management practices that could control some of this. So we 
have these western forests that are dense and dehydrated, yet 
federal land managers are often prohibited from dealing with 
the situation in the way in which it requires because of 
restrictive federal land designations and permitting processes 
for active management activities.
    Ms. Norris, I would like to start with you, and as a 
Wyomingite, you are familiar with many of these problems. There 
seems to be a really stark difference between forest health on 
federal forest land and other categories of federal land 
compared to private and state-owned land with trees on it. From 
your experience in Wyoming, why is there this stark difference? 
Why is it so stark? Why do private and state-owned forests fare 
so much better in this area?
    Ms. Norris. Thank you, Senator.
    I believe it has a lot to do with the states' and private 
landowners' flexibility and being able to get things done on 
the ground quickly, and it appears sometimes our federal 
partners, through the NEPA process, through certain processes, 
it takes them much longer to get the work done on the ground, 
and things do not necessarily always end up in the desired 
condition, maybe, that they had intended.
    Senator Lee. And by flexibility, you mean it's not the 
quality of the personnel, it's the legal restrictions by which 
they are bound--what they are allowed to do is different than 
it is on federal land, is that right?
    Ms. Norris. Correct.
    Senator Lee. Now, Ms. Hall-Rivera, I suspect we can agree 
that active management--active forest management--should be a 
part of any conversation on permitting reform. What reforms do 
you think would be helpful to streamline active management 
activities like mechanical thinning and controlled burns?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, thank you, Senator. We absolutely 
agree that active management it is a critical part of the 
conversation. That is what we are focused on in our wildfire 
crisis strategy. We are taking advantage of every tool that we 
have in the tool box right now, every flexibility that we have, 
including the Secretary recently declaring emergency 
authorizations for us to use those provisions in BIL, and we 
are using those. We have six projects in so far. I have no 
doubt we will get more. If there are additional tools that you 
would like to give us in the tool box, we would be happy to 
work with you on those.
    Senator Lee. And we would love to, and my time is running 
out, but just considering the wildfire crisis in the West and 
that it is an ongoing, recurring, severe problem, do you think 
that the current approach to forest management by federal 
agencies is sustainable?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Well, what we do know is, we certainly 
need a paradigm shift and we need to significantly scale up 
that work on national forests, but also on state, private, and 
other lands as well.
    Senator Lee. Although on state and private lands, we don't 
have the same problem. It's not----
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. No, but we do need to work across 
boundaries and work in partnership, as we have talked about 
today. So we know we need to scale up. We appreciate the 
resources we have been given to start doing that. And we will 
need to continue to have resources invested in this problem in 
the future.
    Senator Lee. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Cantwell.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I think 
America is waking up, at least on the East Coast, to this 
problem, and we certainly have known all about it on the West 
Coast for some time now. I think it's time, because there is an 
opportunity for us to really break down the barriers that are 
prohibiting us from having a faster response and for us to work 
more quickly on the faster response. Unfortunately, for us, the 
latest map of the wildfire forecast for this summer, I think 
the last time we showed this at our last hearing, Mr. Chairman, 
there was a little bit of Washington in the red, but now my 
whole state is red in the forecast for this summer--being the 
epicenter of this. We know this already because we have been 
affected by the British Columbia fires that are affecting our 
state with smoke, but we also have small fires already burning 
in central Washington and a small fire in Yakima County, which 
grew to 150 acres last night.
    [The maps referred to follow:]
    [GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Cantwell. So first and foremost, I believe that we 
need better cooperation between the Forest Service and the 
state to break down any barriers that are preventing us from 
having a quick aviation response, that is, being able to--on 
the ground, we have something that is very effective in having 
people work collectively on identifying fires and responding. 
So one, we need to break down those aviation barriers to get a 
faster response. Second, we need to implement the technology 
communication tools that we asked the Forest Service about 
during the last hearing that give us, again, communication 
directly to where the fire is and what we are doing in 
response. And third, I think it's really time to engage with 
the Canadians. We can't just be sitting here thinking that we 
have solved this problem, because our continent knows no U.S.-
Canadian barrier. And if we are going to have forest 
management--and I have been a huge supporter of cross-laminated 
timber as a fire break issue. I have been a huge supporter of 
moving the time period for when we do prescribed burns. There 
is probably hardly any time now to do prescribed burns in the 
middle of summer. It just doesn't happen.
    Mr. Chairman, I think some of my colleagues probably get 
this, but literally the reason why people didn't do prescribed 
burns in the springtime was because people were like, well, 
there will be some smoke. Well, because we are not doing 
prescribed burns, we are now getting a whole lot of smoke, 
okay? So the point is, let's change our management system and 
response system so that we can reduce fire risk. This summer is 
telling us, we need to do that now.
    So Ms. Hall-Rivera, please respond on both the 
implementation of breaking down barriers on aviation response 
and getting the communication technology network up as soon as 
possible.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, Senator, thank you for all those 
points. I would agree with all of them. We absolutely need to 
break down barriers with all of our partners--states, tribes, 
counties, even between the federal agencies. We are challenged 
at times with some interoperability issues, maybe some 
different qualification standards, but we are all on the same 
team, and fire doesn't know any boundaries. We have already 
heard that today. So we absolutely need to work to break down 
those barriers. I think we are. We are absolutely committed to 
that, and we can certainly bring some attention and focus to 
that in Washington State, if need be.
    As far as the need to scale up prescribed fires and some of 
the challenges in doing so, I think you captured that very 
well. Prescribed fire is absolutely critical to getting our 
landscapes back to a place where they can receive fire in a 
healthy way. It can be challenging to get windows to do that, 
especially in the summertime, as you pointed out. So we need to 
scale up that workforce, and we need to scale up the skill sets 
across, not just the Federal Government, but across partners so 
that we can get more prescribed fire on the ground.
    Senator Cantwell. On the technology front, the U.S. Border 
Patrol recently equipped 19,000 agents with this gear without 
being obligated to do so. So if the U.S. Border Patrol can do 
it, why can't we upgrade people right away with this gear?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, thank you for that question, Senator. 
We are focused on getting tracking systems out. We have done a 
lot of pilot testing as a result of the Dingell Act, and we 
appreciate the focus and attention on this technology. We are 
going to be equipping our fire fleet with tracking devices this 
year, and we have a request for proposals coming out very soon 
so we can take advantage of those technology companies and what 
they have out in the marketplace, like you just mentioned, with 
Border Patrol.
    Senator Cantwell. Well, I think my former colleague from 
Colorado and I worked very hard on this, and we think it's long 
overdue to be implemented. I think this fire season we will 
really want it to happen. And I certainly--I don't know if I am 
being followed by my colleague from Idaho, but this good 
neighbor concept, in general, is about how do we get the front 
line--we actually have maps where we can see right up to where 
the federal line is. Why? Because the county or the community 
provided a response, but then all of a sudden could not cross 
the federal lines. I think we need to think about how we are 
going to empower local communities to help us when these kinds 
of conditions are so drastic. And so, I know my colleague from 
Idaho was working on that, and we will continue to dialogue 
with this Committee.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And Senator Risch is next.
    Senator Risch. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's really 
appropriate to be holding this hearing. For those of you who 
live on the East Coast, welcome to our air in the West. This is 
common. I don't remember a summer in Boise when we haven't had 
smoke. Sometimes it's much worse than others. We have had some 
summers that were really catastrophic in this regard. But this 
is what we live with, I mean, this is just the way it is.
    So for me, from that standpoint, this is an important 
hearing. It is an important issue. On a personal note, my 
undergrad was in forestry, specifically forest management. 
Probably not many in Congress have actually worked on the fire 
line, but I have, a number of times. In addition to that, we 
had some catastrophic fires when I was Governor that we had to 
deal with. And so, this is an issue--and of course, Boise is 
home to the National Interagency Fire Center, so if you get a 
fire, you are going to get a visit from some Idahoans to try to 
help you put it out. So this is really important.
    Look, for years, we have focused on putting out fires. And 
we were very, very successful at it, and by being successful at 
it, we have caused the problem that we have got, and that is 
that the West, particularly, burns every year. It is part of 
the natural process, but if it doesn't burn because we put the 
fires out, we control the fires, then what you get is 
catastrophic fires. Okay, so we understand that. Now, you have 
got to manage it. And that is, you have got to remove fuel or 
you have got to handle it in such a way that fuel is in places 
where, if it's in the wilderness or something like that, that 
they can let it burn. But we have got to stop wasting limited 
agency resources to needlessly redo and relitigate projects 
that have already undergone extensive environmental and public 
processes.
    Senator Daines and I have worked for quite some time to get 
the Cottonwood fix passed. I was glad to see it passed again 
through our Committee, but now it's time to get the thing 
across the finish line. We also need to make significant 
headway with fuels reduction projects. It's good to hear that 
the agencies are putting together plans, but without additional 
consistent work, we will continue to feed the flames. I 
recently introduced the FIRESHEDS Act with Ranking Member 
Barrasso and Senators Daines and Crapo to address landscapes at 
extreme high risk of catastrophic fire. My bill will allow 
states to work closely with federal agencies across the 
boundaries to conduct management projects on firesheds which 
constitute the highest risk to communities, wildlife, and 
quality management. These projects will cut through red tape 
while instituting a proactive, responsible collaborative 
process.
    Now, I think what people need to understand is, every 
landscape is different. Every acre is different. And they all 
need different attention. We are next to my friends in Colorado 
who have a roadless rule. We, in Idaho, have a roadless rule. I 
wrote it when I was Governor. And one of the things that we 
really focused on in there was that we have a lot of back 
country communities, small towns. And so, we really concentrate 
on removing fuel in a circle around those towns, and it has 
been very successful. There has been at least one dramatic save 
of an entire community because they did fuel removal. So these 
are all things we can focus on. We are getting a lot better at 
it. We are getting smarter at it. My state is home to probably 
the most famous forest fire ever, the Big Burn, back in 1910. I 
was not there. My kids think I was.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Risch. But we learned a lot of lessons from that, 
not the least of which was that we had been so successful in 
fire suppression that we just thought that if you just 
suppressed the fires, that is the end of it. That is not the 
end of it. The fuel is going to go. It's either got to be 
burned out or it has got to be removed. And that is the way we 
have got to approach these things.
    So with that, thanks for the hearing. We need to all pull 
the wagon----
    Senator Cantwell. But, my colleague, you do support cross-
laminated timber as one of the ways to reduce that?
    Senator Risch. Clearly.
    Senator Cantwell. Thank you.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Risch. I am not going under oath though. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    And now, we have Senator King.
    Senator King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    First, Ms. Norris, I want to welcome you, particularly, and 
share with you that one of my dearest friends in Maine is a 
woman named Sue Bell. And Sue Bell was the first female state 
forester in America in the early 90s. So you owe something to 
my friend Sue Bell. We are delighted to have you with us here 
today.
    Also, Senator Lee talked about where the West started and 
ended in Colorado. In New England, the Midwest starts at 
Springfield, Mass, just so you know where those lines are. At 
least that's the way we view it in Maine.
    It seems to me that the key words today that I have heard 
over and over are overstock and drought. And drought is a 
climate issue, as Senator Heinrich pointed out. And that is 
something we are working on, on a whole lot of different fronts 
in terms of reducing CO<INF>2</INF> in the atmosphere and 
reducing the drastic effects of climate change, one of which is 
wildfires.
    The overstocking though is something we can address 
directly. Between 1965 and I think 1990, the average annual 
amount of wood taken out of the federal forest was about 12 
billion board-feet. Since 2001, it has been on average 2.2 
billion board-feet. That is the problem. There is too much junk 
wood and understory in forests. And Mr. Rupert, I don't want to 
embarrass you, but you talked very proudly about how 2.1 
million acres were going to be treated next year. I figured 
that will get us to the full forest in 60 years. Come on. And 
the solution is right in front of us--there are people that 
want to harvest wood in the forest, and we should figure out a 
way to let them do so in an environmentally sound manner. I am 
convinced that can be the case because the disparity between 12 
to 13 billion and two billion, there has to be a right number 
somewhere between those two.
    So how do we significantly increase harvesting? And I think 
the testimony is accurate that we have a lot lower fire risk on 
private land and on state-owned land because it is more heavily 
managed. Mr. Rupert, how do we break through and get to the 
point where we are taking out the understory and the junk wood 
and the fuel so that we can really get at the bottom of this 
problem, and then a whole lot of other issues can become much 
more manageable?
    Mr. Rupert. Yes, thank you, Senator. And I do very briefly 
want to make the point that in Interior, we are administering 
about a half billion acres across the nation. Maybe one in five 
of those acres is forested. Four in five are not forested.
    Senator King. Yes, I understand that. My calculation was 
your forestry plus U.S. Forest Service.
    Mr. Rupert. But to your point, I think, how do we have 
more? I think if you look across the country, where we are 
having success is where we are collaborating, coordinating, and 
partnering at scale. So we talk about landscapes. We talk about 
watersheds. That is a scale where individual parties on the 
ground, local communities, local landowners, local interested 
parties, have a seat at the table to share in a strategy to 
identify shared values to protect. And I think the key is that 
scale piece.
    Senator King. But part of the shared value ought to be 
CO<INF>2</INF> in the atmosphere. And these fires are giving us 
a lot of CO<INF>2</INF> in the atmosphere that can be offset. 
And there are environmental issues surrounding cutting, I 
understand that. I am from the most forested state in the 
country. And when I was Governor, we passed a very strong 
Forest Practices Act. I get that. However, we are not taking 
cognizance of the big picture, which is the CO<INF>2</INF> 
released by these catastrophic fires. It may be that we need to 
have more cutting in order to prevent that CO<INF>2</INF> being 
released by fires.
    Do you see? I think I can make a strong environmental case 
for this argument.
    You are nodding.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, we agree, Senator.
    Senator King. Nods don't go in the record.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Right. Yes, we agree. We need to scale up 
all kinds of treatment. Hazardous fuels treatment, but also 
timber management. That is one of our critical tools in the 
tool box.
    Senator King. One of the bills I have submitted, which goes 
along with the list that Senator Barrasso gave about different 
bills addressing this is one that would say that the Forest 
Service can allow less than eight-inch trees to be removed for 
free. And it would incentivize reducing, again, the fuel load 
in the forest, because a lot of this is the smaller undergrowth 
or dead and dying trees that ought to be gotten out. So I hope 
that the Forest Service can really look at this and come back 
to us and say, okay, why did we go from 13 to 2, and how do we 
change that in an environmentally sound manner? Can you take 
that as a question for the record?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, we will absolutely do that, Senator.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Murkowski.
    Senator Murkowski. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you 
all for being here this morning. Obviously, a very, very timely 
meeting.
    You know, it's interesting following my colleague. We are 
co-chairs of the Arctic Caucus, and it has been interesting 
that as I visit with fellow Arctic Parliamentarians about the 
issues of the day in their respective countries, in these 
Arctic nations, on everyone's radar now is what is happening 
with these fires in Arctic environments. We never used to have 
to worry about that on tundra. We are just seeing significant 
changes. And as I look at the wildfire outlook, once again, 
Alaska has got way more red than we want. It's interesting, 
though, that as we speak and we are receiving the impact from 
the Canadian fires, some of our Alaska hotshot crews are 
helping out in Canada. We have sent some aircraft in Canada. 
Typically, this time of year, we can't afford to send anybody 
anything, in fact, we are asking for support, whether it's 
support from the Lower 48, from our friends in Idaho, or from 
our friends in Canada. We have got a later season. That is 
good.
    I am going to be asking you a question, Mr. Rupert, as to 
whether or not you think the late breakup that we are seeing in 
Alaska and the snowmelt indicate that we are going to see a 
lighter fire season or whether it's just going to be pushed a 
month later. But before I get to that question, I want to ask a 
little bit more about the coordination, if you will, or 
cooperation between the United States and Canada. As you know, 
in Alaska, we have a significant northern border with Canada. 
This is an area that is prone to wildfire. In fact, if you look 
at that map, that whole border is in red. How are we doing with 
just the level of coordination internationally? What more do we 
need to be doing? And then, Mr. Rupert, if you can just answer 
my question about what you see--is Alaska going to be late or 
are we going to be light? We would really like to be light 
because we are always pretty heavy.
    Mr. Rupert. Well, in terms of the relationship of Canada, 
there is a bilateral agreement in place. It has been in place 
for many years. To your point, we regularly share resources 
back and forth. We pay it forward----
    Senator Murkowski. Right.
    Mr. Rupert. All the time. So right now, fortunately, it is 
at a period where providing that support to Canada has been 
very manageable. We have had, up to this point, over 600 
personnel that have been mobilized to Canada. I think today 
there are right around 350 folks there. We have additional 
requests, additional mobilizations that are coming through 
right now, including with support specifically to eastern 
Canada, Quebec. Again, talking about all the smoke impact that 
the eastern U.S. is experiencing. Canada has provided support 
to us during really difficult times.
    Senator Murkowski. Right.
    Mr. Rupert. For example, during the pandemic, that was not 
easy. Also, 2019 was a big year of sharing resources. That was 
a hard year for all of us. So there is a great relationship and 
a great history there, and I think there is every reason to 
expect that is going to continue to be the case.
    Senator Murkowski. Good.
    Mr. Rupert. Specifically, in Alaska, I was just in Alaska a 
couple weeks ago, spent time at Fairbanks at AFS, at Wainwright 
there, and preparations are very much ongoing. AFS is very 
squared away and they are preparing. We have seen a fairly 
dramatic shift in the outlook in Alaska, to your point. A month 
ago, all that red was not there. We did talk with predictive 
services while we were up there. The point they made is that 
with precipitation over the winter and early spring in Alaska, 
at that time, just a couple weeks ago, it was really sort of 
uncertain how that was going to go. Now, fast forward just a 
couple of weeks, and it's pretty clear that as things are 
starting to dry, now there is a real likelihood of above-normal 
activity in Alaska.
    Senator Murkowski. So above normal, a little bit later in 
the season, but is this going to extend us later? You don't 
necessarily know? Are we going to be above normal is what I am 
saying.
    Mr. Rupert. Yes, so the outlook looks four months forward, 
and over that time period, you know, we are, at this point, 
anticipating there is going to be the potential for above 
normal fire activity.
    Senator Murkowski. Well, we will get ready.
    I am probably going to have to take this for the record, 
Ms. Hall-Rivera, but I have asked this question a couple times 
in the last couple months within the Interior Appropriations 
Committee and here in the Forest Service budget hearing. I 
haven't received a response yet from Forest Service on this, 
and I talk about how the tribes in Alaska are leaders in self-
governance and really want to have more opportunities for 
tribal management, specifically with the 638 contracts and the 
compacts. So the Farm bill had authorized a 638 compacting for 
Tribal Forest Protection Act projects, but the authority is 
limited to projects on federal lands that border or are 
adjacent to the Indian Forest or rangeland. So we got some 
technical assistance from USDA that may help, but we also want 
to do what we can in expanding the 638 contracting and 
compacting to additional activities. So we are hoping that you 
will be willing to work with us and explore that further.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, absolutely, Senator.
    Senator Murkowski. Great, thank you.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator King [presiding]. On behalf of the Chairman, 
Senator Kelly has agreed to defer to Senator Daines.
    Senator Daines. Senator Kelly, thank you, by the way.
    Senator King, thank you as well.
    When you woke up this morning in Washington, you might have 
opened your windows up and heard the birds coughing outside. 
It's no secret that wildfire season is upon us. My guess is 
that folks on the East Coast are already sick of the smoke. We 
are already hearing about ground stops at Philadelphia Airport, 
slowdowns at LaGuardia because of visibility issues with the 
smoke. Look, this is what we deal with out west virtually every 
summer. I keep beautiful pictures of the landscapes of Montana, 
my hometown there in the Gallatin Valley, so that when we have 
our friends during tourist season and family that come out to 
Montana, I can show them the picture of what the mountains look 
like, if you could see them, but they are covered up in smoke 
oftentimes when we turn the corner in July and August and into 
September.
    We are sick of that smoke. I know the folks on the East 
Coast are, and we need to do something to try to reduce the 
risk of these fires. What happens in Montana is that we have 
environmental groups who litigate and stop forest treatment 
projects with a sympathetic judge or two within the Ninth 
Circuit Court, and we end up tying some 130 million board-feet 
of timber in Montana--tied up in litigation. Look, this is not 
about trying to make ideological points at the moment. I am 
focused on solving this problem. There is no doubt we have 
longer fire seasons. We have warmer summers. So what is the 
mitigation strategy going to be as we try to address this core 
problem? And forest treatment projects should be one of our 
deployed strategies. We have got to cut the red tape. We have 
got to combat the fringe litigation. We have got to solve this 
problem.
    If we don't act, these catastrophic wildfires will continue 
to threaten lives. They will burn millions of acres a year, 
spending untold millions of dollars in fighting these fires, 
putting firefighters at risk. Tragically, lives are lost with 
our firefighters every fire season. Billions of dollars of 
infrastructure are destroyed and our forest communities are put 
at risk. They are getting harder to fight. They are getting 
more dangerous to fight because we haven't addressed reducing 
fuel loads. These fires get hotter, and frankly, they are even 
more catastrophic.
    The Forest Service and DOI together now have over 100 
million acres at high risk of wildfire. These are a tinder box. 
They are waiting to burn if we do not make some changes on how 
we manage our public lands. On May 17th, my bipartisan Ninth 
Circuit Cottonwood fix legislation passed out of this Committee 
by a voice vote. I am thankful, grateful for my colleagues on 
both sides of this dais who unanimously supported the voice 
vote to move that forward out of Committee. Getting this fix 
signed into law by the President is vital, because needed 
forest management needs to continue versus being delayed by 
litigation. You talk to anybody who is close to this problem, 
they'll tell you, get that Ninth Circuit Cottonwood fix signed 
into law and we suddenly have reduced one of the major barriers 
to treatment and forest management.
    And by the way, forest management yields some very 
important benefits--wildlife habitat improvements by getting 
more sunlight on the forest floors to provide for better feed; 
watersheds, because we have massive wildfires, of course, you 
have big erosion in the spring that gets into the streams that 
harms trout habitat in Montana; and of course, reducing the 
risk of wildfires. But let's not forget the importance of 
getting workers back in the forest. These public lands don't--
there is no revenue coming off of them because the radical 
environmentalists have shut down the industry. We get workers 
back in there, getting revenues back to some of my impoverished 
counties, getting our loggers back in the forests versus right 
now, it's a bunch of lawyers.
    Forest Service Chief Moore and Deputy Chief French have 
both testified that the reconsultation requirement on the 87 
forest plans will negatively impact the Forest Service work to 
prevent wildfires. It ties right back to that Ninth Circuit 
Cottonwood problem. Deputy Chief Hall-Rivera, do you agree with 
them that the Ninth Circuit Cottonwood reconsultation 
requirement will delay landscape-scale management that is 
needed to help combat catastrophic wildfires?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, Senator, I would concur with what the 
Chief and Deputy Chief French have already put on the record.
    Senator Daines. Thank you for that response. Over the past 
two decades, wildfires have become hotter, longer burning, more 
damaging, and let's not forget that a catastrophic wildfire is 
a carbon emitter. A healthy, vibrant forest is a carbon sink. 
We now talk about having a fire year versus a fire season. This 
puts strain on wildland firefighters year after year as they 
battle more complex, dangerous fires for longer. In 2021, I 
worked in a bipartisan manner with Senator Feinstein to secure 
recognition of the work the wildland firefighters do by passing 
our bill to create a title that reflects their actual job of 
fighting fires and getting them a badly needed pay raise. 
Director Rupert and Deputy Chief Hall-Rivera, could you talk 
briefly, because I am out of time, about how the title change 
and the pay increase has impacted recruitment and retention of 
wildland firefighters at the agencies?
    Start with Mr. Rupert.
    Mr. Rupert. Yes, thank you. Really briefly, it certainly 
helped. We are--I am aware that we have seen firefighters that 
have made a decision or delayed retirement as a result of the 
increased support as well as on then the recruitment side. We 
have had success recruiting additional firefighters and have 
continued to focus on expanding our capacity and recognize that 
an important part of that effort is not only the pay support, 
but also the support for a full career that goes along with all 
of the work, for example, that has been done to establish the 
new series.
    Senator Daines. Director Rupert, thank you.
    Any additional comments there?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, Senator. I would just say that we 
know that the temporary bill pay increase has helped us retain 
some of our workforce who might have left otherwise. It 
certainly has brought some new workers into our firefighting 
workforce, and that is why it's absolutely critical that we 
avert the pay cliff and put something permanent into place.
    Senator Daines. Thank you. And that pay cliff is September, 
by the way, where this pay raise expires.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes.
    Senator Daines. Unless we take action here in Congress. 
Thank you.
    Senator King. Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Kelly.
    Senator Kelly. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    So we are currently experiencing the worst drought in 1,200 
years in the West. The forest is dry. Every fire season it 
seems these fires get worse and worse. And now we are seeing 
this in other parts of the continent with the fires going on in 
Canada today. Here is the satellite image, and I will show this 
for the record.
    [The satellite image follows:]
    [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator Kelly. And you can clearly see, you know, the smoke 
over the Eastern Seaboard. New York City yesterday had reported 
the worst air quality in the world. Though, when I check the 
air quality index for New York today, it is currently 199, and 
in DC it's 273. So I would argue maybe here in Washington it's 
possibly the worst or at least close to the worst on the 
planet.
    Well, this is something we see in Arizona year after year, 
especially in the northern parts of the state. Wildfires are 
just burning hotter, and it's a challenge to fight them. So 
last Congress, Senator Romney and I added legislation to the 
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that created a Wildfire 
Mitigation and Management Commission that is meeting today--18 
members who are going to report out in September with their 
recommendations. You know, how do we do a better job fighting 
wildfires? I have been in the U.S. Senate just a short period 
of time, and through a few fire seasons, and what I have seen 
is, we basically do the same thing each year and hope for a 
better result. Well, we are not going get a better result 
unless we make some changes.
    Senator Daines said if we do not act this will continue to 
be a problem, and I do agree with that. And he spoke about 
healthy forests. We have a project in Arizona, the Four Forest 
Restoration Initiative. The biggest ponderosa pine forest in 
the world just burns every year because it is just not a 
healthy forest. So we have got to move that forward. We have 
got to act. We have got to be more proactive and come up with 
some new ideas. So I am looking forward to these 
recommendations that we should see in September and possibly 
get these implemented. But also in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law, there was a requirement of a new 
classification, a distinct classification of a wildland 
firefighter job classification. And it is my understanding that 
the Forest Service and the Interior Department are in different 
places regarding the implementation of this. Well, that was 
required under the law.
    So Director Rupert, I am interested. Where is Interior on 
the implementation of this occupational series of wildland 
firefighter?
    Mr. Rupert. Thank you for the question, Senator.
    So the development of the series has very much been a joint 
collaborative effort between USDA, Interior, as well as OPM. 
The new series was established almost a year ago--0456. In 
Interior, we have been hard at work--this has also been 
collaborative work--taking the new series and developing actual 
position descriptions. The current status of that at Interior 
is, we have our standard wildland firefighting positions--
grades GS3 through GS10--with PDs that are ready to go that we 
are beginning to use. We still have additional work to do, 
especially as you get into some of the more specialized 
firefighting positions and the position descriptions that will 
go along with it. But we have made real progress with 
developing position descriptions and have begun to implement 
the use of that.
    Senator Kelly. And Deputy Chief Hall-Rivera, has the Forest 
Service implemented this occupational series as well?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. So we are in a similar place to the 
Department of the Interior, and we have worked collaboratively 
together up until now. But we are going on a little bit of a 
slower timeline and we have worked with OPM to secure an 
extension to the end of the calendar year. The reasons that we 
are doing that are a couple. There is significant complexity in 
the Forest Service. We have hundreds of position descriptions 
that could be going into this new series. And so what we want 
to do is make sure that we build in time to get it right. And 
what that means is, making sure that we can engage with our 
firefighting employees, our union, and our fire supervisors to 
make sure we get those details right before we put them into 
the new series. So that is why we are in a bit of a timing 
difference than the Department of the Interior. We have over 
12,000 firefighters, and like I said, hundreds of position 
descriptions. So from my perspective, it's a go slow to go fast 
and to go right.
    Senator Kelly. So worst case, when would you expect that 
you would hire somebody new--not somebody that is already an 
employee--but your next wildland firefighter, under this 
classification?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. I would expect that would happen next 
calendar year, Senator.
    Senator Kelly. All right, thank you.
    And thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman [presiding]. I am going to just--one quick 
round. Senator Cortez Masto, I think it's your turn.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Sorry.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Not a problem.
    So similar to my colleagues from the West, I don't want to 
just beat this to death, but just to put it in perspective--in 
2020, the August Complex Fire in Northern California burned 
1,032,000 acres. That is an area larger than the State of Rhode 
Island.
    In 2021, the Dixie Fire burned 963,000 acres, and the 
Caldor Fire, at the same time, burned 221,000 acres. Some of 
that was man-made, some of that was caused by lightning. And 
the reason I bring this up is because, true to what you just 
saw in Utah, the smoke there was caused by these fires. We see 
that in Nevada. We see that all across the West. It looked just 
like that.
    And my goal here has been, as I talk with my firefighters 
in my state--state, local, and federal. We have had summits--
and thank you very much--Forest Service has been at the table, 
so has Department of the Interior. How do we ensure that we are 
providing all of the resources we need to combat these fires 
that are hotter and longer and to keep our firefighters safe 
and our communities safe? One of the things I want to bring up 
is--a key part of the firefighting is our Air National Guard in 
Nevada. The 152nd Airlift Wing has eight Legacy C-130H aircraft 
with the modular airborne firefighting systems. Are you 
familiar with this system, Ms. Hall-Rivera?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, I am, Senator.
    Senator Cortez Masto. So the Air National Guard is 
utilizing these aircraft to fight fires along the West. They 
are looking for the C-130Js that have the new system associated 
with it. Why is it important to have this new system and the C-
130Js?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Well, it's always important to have the 
most modern aircraft that you can get in the firefighting 
environment. The C-130J is an excellent aircraft to be used as 
an air tanker, either one that is converted, or in this case, 
the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems (MAFFS), where it 
rolls on, and we have a few of those in our contracted fleet as 
well.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And the goal here is to give them the 
most up-to-date equipment to fight these fires, and my 
understanding is it can contain up to 3,000 gallons of flame 
retardant to help suppress fires by dropping more of this flame 
retardant. And these fires are fought by the Air National Guard 
in the western states. It's not just because they are in 
Nevada. It's not unique to Nevada. They are out fighting fires. 
Is that correct?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes. So the MAFFS program, as we call it, 
is a long-time partnership that we have had with the Department 
of Defense, and essentially, they are modular systems that roll 
on to the aircraft and then are able to drop retardant, and we 
work with lots of different units, including Nevada, and we 
have units in California and other places that partner with us 
and provide those aircraft, the personnel, and the retardant 
systems.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    And I bring that up because I want my colleagues to 
understand why the request is coming from Nevada for our Air 
National Guard for the newest model, these C-130Js. It's 
important for our firefighting in the western states.
    Let me jump back to the compensation issue because this 
is--again, thank you, Mr. Johnson, for your report--this is 
exactly what I am hearing from our firefighters in the State of 
Nevada. And clearly, more has to be done to provide permanent 
and better compensation. We also have to provide the affordable 
housing opportunities that are so necessary, for the reasons 
that we have just talked about. The Bipartisan Infrastructure 
package provided over $600 million--about $480 million to the 
Forest Service and then $120 million to the Department of the 
Interior, to temporarily increase that base firefighter salary 
for the reasons we were hearing. But let me ask you this, it's 
falling off. The money is no longer going to be there after a 
certain period of time. So for purposes of, I guess, DOI and 
the U.S. Forest Service, if Congress does not pass a bill to 
extend the pay increase by the time these funds run out, what 
happens?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Well, I think it would be absolutely 
catastrophic, Senator. I stated earlier, and I will restate it, 
our union is telling us they would expect that 30 to 50 percent 
of our firefighting workforce would leave our service and go 
elsewhere, as they should, to make a living wage and the right 
kind of compensation that they deserve to be paid. We are 
starting to see some resignations now. People are not going to 
wait until September 30.
    Senator Cortez Masto. And does that include--let's talk 
about specifics. The hotshot crews, the smoke jumpers, right? 
Losing qualified, skilled professionals in this area fighting 
fires and wildfires.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes. You make a really important point, 
Senator, that we would lose those folks who are leaders in the 
fire service, who have the most institutional knowledge, and 
that would be incredibly difficult for us to replace because it 
takes years and years of experience to get that kind of 
knowledge and expertise.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    And I know my time is up. I am going to submit this for the 
record, Mr. Rupert, because I do absolutely want to hear from 
you as well.
    But I also have concerns hearing from my firefighters, 
particularly Todd Ingalesbee--he is a fellow Nevadan and 
President of the Professional Firefighters of Nevada--about the 
concerns about the physical and mental health that multiple 
deployments have on our firefighters. What does that mean, and 
is that having an impact on what we are seeing in the loss of 
so many firefighters?
    Mr. Rupert. So you are hearing that feedback from 
firefighters in Nevada. There is good, solid evidence now from 
studies that that is, in fact, the case. Firefighters are at an 
elevated and greater risk of PTSD and anxiety as a result of 
those repeated deployments and long hours, and it is an 
opportunity to highlight. So we have talked about pay. Another 
aspect of the proposal we have moving forward is about 
capacity. So as we reduce the number of hours that we are 
essentially requiring firefighters to work that address that 
mental health issue, we also have to have additional capacity 
to make up for those hours. And so these things are all 
interconnected in terms of how we deal with the wildland 
firefighter workforce reforms. Pay, capacity, mental health 
support, housing, all of it, all of it together is important.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Senator Hawley.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks to the 
witnesses for being here.
    I want to start with a shout-out to firefighters in my 
state, the State of Missouri. Earlier this year, in March of 
this year, the Forest Service began a prescribed burn in the 
Mark Twain National Forest, down at the southeastern part of my 
state, and it was led--this prescribed burn was led--by a new 
all-veteran firefighting crew, which is just tremendous. There 
have been great reports on it throughout the state. And I think 
that this is a great model for what we could do. I see you 
nodding along, Ms. Hall-Rivera. So I am very proud of those 
firefighters. Very proud of these vets and proud of the model 
that they are, I think, showing for the rest, or setting up for 
the rest of the country.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera, let me ask you about the Forest Service 
role in a different regard when it comes to mining approvals 
for essential critical minerals. Would you agree with me that 
critical minerals are vital to our energy security?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, I would agree with that, Senator.
    Senator Hawley. The International Energy Agency estimated 
earlier this year that lithium demand is expected to grow by 
400 percent by 2040. Cobalt and nickel, between 200 and 250 
percent by 2040. Copper demand is supposed to go up more than 
double by 2040. Now, here is the thing that worries me. One 
nation in the world is currently refining 68 percent of the 
world's nickel. Would you care to take a guess who that might 
be?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. I would presume China.
    Senator Hawley. It is China.
    One nation is refining 40 percent of the world's copper. 
Want to guess who that is?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. I would presume the same.
    Senator Hawley. It's China.
    One nation has 59 percent of the lithium and 73 percent of 
the cobalt. Want to guess?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. I am going to say China.
    Senator Hawley. It's China. You got it. It's China. So 
given that, would you agree with me that it's important that we 
do everything we can to develop our domestic critical mineral 
mining here in this country?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, I would agree with that, Senator.
    Senator Hawley. Great. Okay. Then let me ask you about the 
Superior National Forest in Minnesota. Earlier this year, 
partly at the behest of the Forest Service, the Biden 
Administration withdrew 225,000 acres of critical mineral 
mining in northeastern Minnesota. This is the largest reserve 
of cobalt and nickel in the United States, perhaps, and I am 
told maybe even in the world. And yet, your Administration shut 
it down. Your agency recommended that it be shut down, 
depriving us of these minerals, making us dependent on other 
nations that mine them in a completely unsafe and unsustainable 
way, and also making us more dependent on these foreign 
nations. Why?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Well, Senator, I do want to say, I am not 
an expert on that process. That is not a part of the Forest 
Service that I oversee. I know we have a lot of values to 
balance there, especially with the Boundary Waters Wilderness 
Area, but I am sure that we could get back to you with more 
details on the specifics of that decision.
    Senator Hawley. Would you? That would be helpful, if you 
would. I would really appreciate it.
    Because here is my view. My view is, we shouldn't be making 
China richer and America poorer. My view is, we have the best 
technology in the world to mine and develop these minerals. We 
know how to do it in a safe and responsible manner. We should 
be doing it. And listen, I have heard from people all over the 
country, but particularly people in this part of the country, 
who have said that this decision is devastating to their region 
economically, but I just submit, it's devastating to our energy 
security and our national security. And at a time when I hear 
from this Administration, ``climate change, climate change, 
climate change,'' we need to have reliable, sustainable sources 
of energy. Why would we want to tie our own hands and make us 
and the world more dependent on China, who've got to have the 
worst environmental record of any nation in the world? If they 
are not the worst, they've got to be close.
    So I just don't get it. And I would appreciate you getting 
back to me on that.
    With my few remaining seconds here, Mr. Johnson, let me 
just ask you, in your testimony, your written testimony, you 
talked about barriers that federal agencies face when they are 
trying to recruit and retain firefighters. I agree with you 
that this is critically important. I want to highlight a bill 
that Senator Ossoff and I introduced last year called the Fire 
Station Improvement Act, which would cut red tape, expand the 
Assistance to Firefighters Grant, allow new funds to improve 
facilities, and protect the health and safety of our 
firefighters.
    Do you think an effort like that is necessary, number one, 
and number two what else do we need to do?
    Mr. Johnson. Yes, thank you, Senator.
    All efforts to help build capacity to address the wildfires 
would be very helpful. And also, as we have heard today, any 
efforts that we--because a lot of these barriers are 
interrelated--so dealing with some of the poor work/life 
balance, some of the mental health challenges, all of these 
will go a very long way to addressing the barriers.
    Senator Hawley. Thank you very much.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Senator Hickenlooper.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
    You know, the smoke that we are seeing right now in 
Washington that is blanketing large portions of America right 
now is mostly coming from Canada. It's my understanding that--
and Mr. Rupert, why don't I start with you?
    My understanding is there is an argument that for years the 
Forest Service had what we called the Smokey the Bear 
approach--put out every forest fire, and then the argument goes 
that that somehow made the forests overgrown and unhealthy and 
more vulnerable to hotter, larger fires. But Canada never 
really had a Smokey the Bear policy, right? That's my 
understanding.
    Mr. Rupert. Thank you, Senator. To be honest with you, I am 
not sure what the history in Canada is around the public 
outreach that they have in place around firefighters, whether 
they have an equivalent or not, but I think to your point, yes, 
I mean, fundamentally, what is driving these large, 
catastrophic wildfires and megafires, in addition to the 
weather that is associated with this changing climate, longer 
drought, and more extreme weather, is also fuel for the 
wildfires that is related to very aggressive suppression of 
wildfires, certainly, across America and even across the 
continent over the last century.
    Now, as you get farther north, closer to the Arctic, there 
are more fundamental shifts having to do with climate with 
areas that really have never burned that now are at risk. So as 
you get farther north in Canada, some of that, certainly, is in 
play.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Well, I guess the point is that the 
climate change is something you have got to put in your 
calculation and that the expenses of air quality at this level 
are, you know, when you actually begin trying to itemize them, 
it becomes enormous.
    I actually had a more specific, pedestrian question--
although air quality is pretty pedestrian, I guess. It affects 
each one of us. Affordable housing is obviously an issue, and 
certainly many Coloradans are grappling with it, but in terms 
of firefighters, it is good to hear that you guys are all 
working and recognize that this is something important. What 
are--and any of you can answer this. We will start with you, 
Mr. Rupert. What are some of the challenges you face in making 
housing more accessible for our firefighters and the ways that 
you are addressing that issue?
    Mr. Rupert. Yes, the real challenge and the real impact, I 
think, as you hit on, is the availability of affordable 
housing, and really, in many, many places across the nation, 
you know, we are asking for additional support, and that 
support that we are asking for is focused on renovating 
existing housing that we have, modernizing existing housing, 
and building additional housing.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, I would echo that, Senator. It's a 
multifaceted problem. It's an availability problem. It's an 
affordability problem, predominantly, especially in the western 
United States. Obviously, you see that in your state in some of 
our resort communities, in particular--second home communities. 
That is exactly where our firefighters need to live and work. 
And not only do we need to increase their wages so that could 
help with the affordability issue, as Mr. Rupert said, we have, 
as part of the Administration's proposal, a $50 million 
investment in employee housing, but I believe we need an all-
of-the-above approach. We need private-sector partnerships. We 
need public-private partnerships. We need to look at how we can 
work with our communities to keep our firefighters in those 
communities.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Absolutely.
    Ms. Norris. Yes, Senator. We do provide housing for our 
seasonal helitack staff so that we can compete with our federal 
partners so we can offer a way for them to stay and live in the 
area and be able to help us. We also have additional housing we 
are looking at trying to build to support that fire community.
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you. Multi-dimensional issue here. What 
we have heard from the stakeholders that we have talked to is 
largely about raising the pay because of the affordability 
issue. But one of the other options that came up with many of 
the stakeholders that we discussed was considering housing 
stipends. That would be a policy decision should the land 
management agencies and Congress want to do that, and that 
would require authority. The land management agencies would 
need authority to be able to issue those.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right. Some of the things we have 
seen that are really encouraging are Forest Service and BLM 
looking at long-term leases of land that is appropriately 
located and not compromising our--I am one of the biggest 
supporters you will ever find of public lands, and we do not 
want to ever compromise that, but sometimes that real estate 
can be in the right place and it can be a public-private 
partnership so that we can build housing for the firefighters 
that I think you all depend on.
    Let me ask you also, you know, you see all this smoke 
coming down from Canada, and we--two weeks ago, we saw in 
Colorado, you literally could not see from the state capital, 
you could not see the mountains because of the smoke that was 
coming down from Alberta.
    The Chairman. Senator, could I interrupt you just one 
second?
    Senator Hickenlooper. Sure.
    The Chairman. Can you hold that question?
    Senator Hickenlooper. Yes.
    The Chairman. Senator King has to go----
    Senator Hickenlooper. Of course.
    The Chairman [continuing]. To preside.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I am always--you don't even have to 
say another moment. I would be honored to yield.
    The Chairman. I will come right back to you.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Of course.
    The Chairman. Senator King.
    Senator King. I just want to submit for the record a chart 
of historical harvest levels in the Forest Service from 1905 to 
the present.
    [The chart referred to follows:]
    [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator King. And the other piece that I wanted to share 
was this chart, which is from yesterday. And what is very 
unusual is, we talk about climate. Living in the Northeast, 
climate always moves west to east. That is where the prevailing 
winds are. What is happening right now is something very 
unusual where the forest fire is up here, and the smoke is 
coming back down. And because of our superior virtue, you will 
notice that Maine is not in the shadow at all, but it is an 
interesting phenomenon. And it shows that purple is the worst 
air, which is in Washington, Philadelphia, New York. I just 
thought it was interesting, talking about climate. This is a 
very unusual weather pattern that has created the situation 
that we are in right now. It is very unusual for the air to be 
moving north to south rather than west to east.
    [The AirNow Fire and Smoke Map from June 7, 2023 follows:]
    [GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
    
    Senator King. So those were my two----
    The Chairman. But Senator King, I also wanted to mention 
real quick that you made a valuable point. He is saying that 
basically the $10 billion we have invested in things you were 
supposed to do--basically reducing the fuels for fires, he made 
a point that just--let's harvest. Let's harvest it.
    Senator King. They'll pay us, Mr. Chairman.
    The Chairman. Yes, I am saying, it doesn't cost anything. 
We make money. And we solve both problems. I don't know what 
the problem is there.
    Senator King. Thanks.
    The Chairman. A lot of people don't want to cut trees. 
Okay.
    Senator King. Thank you.
    The Chairman. Thank you, sir.
    Senator Hickenlooper, I'm sorry to have interrupted you, 
but thank you.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I am always glad to yield to Angus 
King because you always learn something.
    The Chairman. Always.
    Senator Hickenlooper. He is always looking at things from a 
different perspective, and you know, bringing to the surface 
things that might otherwise not be shared.
    I will finish that statement on the granular effect of 
these devastating fires. In Colorado, certainly, at all levels 
of management, we are seeing the planning at the fireshed 
level, trying to make us more resilient from future wildfires. 
The Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests are a good example 
of this work where partners work strategically across the 
landscape on figuring out where you can get the best bang for 
the dollar in terms of protecting forests and the communities 
and people in the wildland urban interface.
    So Mr. Rupert, how does Interior think strategically about 
where to deploy its wildfire management resources locally in 
order to achieve the desired outcomes at landscape scale?
    Mr. Rupert. Focusing initially on our response, the very 
mature and robust framework that we have in place is focused on 
nearest available resource, local response. We have the nation 
organized into geographic areas and those geographic areas 
coordinate to prioritize operational wildfire response based on 
the nearest available resource. I think then transitioning that 
to thinking about, okay, what are we doing before the fire, 
pre-fire, to reduce risk? Similarly, we have to continue--and 
we are making progress here, I am certain--but we have to 
continue to have increasingly coordinated, multi-
jurisdictional, cross-programmatic coordination and shared 
strategies to do the similar thing at that appropriate scale, 
that landscape scale, so that we are essentially developing 
these shared strategies to reduce risk before the fire comes, 
similar to how, you know, in many ways we respond to wildfires 
when they do occur.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right.
    Ms. Norris, do you agree with that in Wyoming?
    Ms. Norris. Yes, and we completely agree. One of our best 
tools is the Good Neighbor Authority agreement, and through 
that agreement, State Forestry has really worked hard with our 
federal partners to get more work done on the ground. And it is 
all different kinds of work. It is timber sales as well as 
additional project work. And now, looking at even trying to get 
the NEPA done, contracting out assessments, and trying to do 
things like that to help our federal partners.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I think that is the--even some of the 
discussions about copper and mining and a lot of these things, 
we are having to look at them in a new light, and our forests, 
NEPA, each of these historical, important sets of rules, we 
have to examine in the light of climate change and recognize 
there is an urgency there that we haven't had before.
    Anyway, Ms. Hall-Rivera, do you want to answer that 
question too, in terms of that resiliency, the planning for 
resiliency within the forests?
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Yes, I would absolutely echo what my 
colleague said. We need to focus and prioritize at a larger 
scale. That is fundamentally what our 10-year Wildfire Crisis 
Strategy is about, and it needs to be cross-boundary. It needs 
to be with partners. It absolutely needs to be co-prioritized 
with states, with tribes, with local areas, counties, and with 
Interior as well. And so that is the paradigm shift we talk 
about in our wildfire crisis strategy. And that is what we are 
trying to make a reality with the investments that we have been 
given from Congress.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right.
    Mr. Johnson, anything to add?
    Mr. Johnson. Thank you.
    So no, I think that it is very important as we are 
addressing this issue for the partnerships to continue that are 
being formed, you know, with the Federal Government and the 
state and local level because I think through those 
partnerships is how things will end up progressing and moving 
forward and leveraging all authorities that they have. Thank 
you.
    Senator Hickenlooper. Right.
    I am almost out of time. And I think I got extra time by 
being interrupted.
    The Chairman. No, you are definitely out of time.
    Senator Hickenlooper. I'm not now--I'm still--I've got a 
clock running, and I have watched enough basketball games to 
know that the clock----
    The Chairman. I have to go vote.
    Senator Hickenlooper. The buzzer hasn't gone off.
    I do want to--you each to talk about collaboration, and 
that takes more time, more money, more people, and yet it is 
crucial, and yet, we are going to likely enter a phase where we 
are not going to have more money. And I hope--I will leave you 
with this thought, or maybe I will leave the question in the 
record, which is how do we get to that more effective 
collaborative response in these issues where you have to have 
BLM and the Forest Service, everyone has to be working together 
at a level we have talked about but never done. How do we do 
that efficiently so that we can afford it?
    And I will leave you with that.
     I yield back to the Chair.
    The Chairman. Oh, thank you so much.
    [Laughter.]
    The Chairman. Real quick. We want this in the record and 
then we have to adjourn.
    The National Fire Protection Association recently released 
a standard, Standard 1851, regarding best practices to prevent 
development of cancers commonly caused by firefighting 
activities. They note that for every five degrees of increase 
in skin temperature, there is a 400 percent increase in the 
absorption capability of our skin, and that firefighters should 
prioritize getting soot, which is a carcinogen, off their skin 
as soon as possible.
    Mr. Rupert and Ms. Rivera, what are agencies doing to 
comply with the standard, and are they informing their 
firefighters of this information?
    Mr. Rupert. Yes, so thank you very much. Hugely important 
to the health and safety of wildland firefighters. Those 
standard operational procedures are very much a focus and 
priority across the entire interagency community. A specific 
example I would offer to illustrate that focus--the interagency 
community established a medical and public health advisory team 
during COVID. It was really impactful in terms of how we 
coordinate.
    The Chairman. Do the firefighters know about this? Have 
they been notified?
    Mr. Rupert. Yes, and that group is picking up on these 
things.
    The Chairman. Good.
    Mr. Rupert. And very much focusing on how do we more 
effectively----
    The Chairman. Let us know how we can help. Okay?
    Mr. Rupert. Thank you.
    Ms. Hall-Rivera. Thank you, Senator.
    The Chairman. Thank you.
    Members are going to have until close of business tomorrow 
to submit additional questions for the record.
    And I want to thank each and every one of you. It was very 
enlightening. It was very good. We have got a lot of work to 
do. There are a lot of common-sense solutions up here. Let's 
start basically using best practices to cut and sell the timber 
and solve two problems. Okay, thank you.
    Meeting adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
