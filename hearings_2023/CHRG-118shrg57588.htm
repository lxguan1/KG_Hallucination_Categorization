                              ----------                              


                       WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29, 2023

                               U.S. Senate,
                       Subcommittee on Health Care,
                                      Committee on Finance,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The hearing was convened, pursuant to notice, at 2:30 p.m., 
in Room SD-215, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Benjamin 
L. Cardin (chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
    Present: Senators Wyden, Stabenow, Warren, and Daines.
    Also present: Democratic staff: Martha P. Cramer, Staff 
Director and Health Policy Advisor for Senator Cardin; and 
Carolyn A. Perlmutter, Legislative Correspondent for Senator 
Cardin. Republican staff: Grace Bruno, Health Policy Advisor 
for Senator Daines; and Matthew May, Legislative Correspondent 
for Senator Daines.

 OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BENJAMIN L. CARDIN, A U.S. SENATOR 
FROM MARYLAND, CHAIRMAN, SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH CARE, COMMITTEE 
                           ON FINANCE

    Senator Cardin. The subcommittee will come to order.
    Let me welcome everyone to the first meeting of the 
Subcommittee on Health Care of the Senate Finance Committee of 
this Congress. I want to thank Senator Wyden and Senator Crapo 
for their cooperation in the establishment of the subcommittee 
and our ability to hold hearings. And, Senator Daines, I want 
to thank you for your help and cooperation. I look forward to 
working with you.
    We have, obviously, a very important agenda, and I hope 
that the subcommittee will be able to do some oversight as to 
some of the issues that are pretty pressing in our health-care 
system, during this Congress. I look forward to working with 
you, and I am very pleased that Senator Stabenow is here.
    Senator Stabenow has been one of the great leaders on 
health care in the U.S. Senate, and she served with great 
distinction as chair of this subcommittee. So I thank her for 
her help, and I know of no subject that she has been more 
active in than on oral health care. She has been one of our 
great leaders in the area of oral health care.
    So, today's subject is the oral health crisis, the need to 
address disparities. Disparities in our health-care system are 
well documented, and the impact they have in regard to 
vulnerable communities. With the passage of the Affordable Care 
Act, we elevated the Institute for Minority Health and Health 
Disparities as a full institute under the National Institutes 
of Health, NIH.
    They have documented the disparities based upon income. 
Lower-income communities do not have the same health-care 
providers in their community as we see in other communities. 
They have documented it in rural America, where again there are 
not as many health-care providers. They have documented 
disparities based upon race and ethnicity, because again, there 
are not as many providers in regards to the workforce.
    So, we have documented a lot of the reasons for disparities 
in our health-care system, and they are very prevalent, the 
disparities as they relate to oral health care.
    It really came home to me when I was first elected to the 
United States Senate in 2007. Many have heard me talk about 
Deamonte Driver, but I am going to mention him one more time. 
Deamonte Driver was a 12-year-old who lived in Prince George's 
County, MD, about 7 miles from here. He had a tooth problem. 
His mom tried to get him help but could not find a dentist to 
take care of his needs.
    She tried several times and was unable to get any help. She 
fell through the cracks. She was not in the Medicaid system at 
the time, and there were some eligibility issues, but she did 
not have any reimbursement.
    Deamonte ultimately became very sick, was rushed to the 
hospital. He had an impacted tooth, went through two 
operations, and what would initially have cost $80 for a tooth 
extraction ended up costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, 
and tragically Deamonte Driver lost his life.
    So that really struck home, that a person in my community 
that I represented, that we could have that type of an outcome. 
Now it has led to some changes in health-care policy. Working 
with Senator Stabenow, working with my dear friend Elijah 
Cummings in the House, we were able to extend pediatric dental 
under both the CHIP program and the Affordable Care Act.
    So we were able to make some progress, but there are still 
many gaps today. Oral health is integral to overall health and 
well-being. It can make worse an underlying health condition, 
an impact affecting overall health-care costs. It can impact a 
person's ability to get a job and be well enough to work. It 
impacts a person's ability to go to school, affecting the local 
and national economy. It can impact a person's confidence and 
ability to enjoy life or communicate effectively, affecting 
communities and overall society.
    Despite the importance of oral health, millions of people 
in the United States are not getting the care that they need. 
Former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher said more than 20 
years ago that you cannot be healthy without oral health.
    Certainly, we have made progress in improving oral health 
for children since then, especially for vulnerable children. 
But for working-age adults and seniors, disparities in oral 
health outcomes and access to dental care have widened by 
income and race. Treating dental care as an essential in U.S. 
health policy for all ages, not just children, is the only way 
that we can address these disparities.
    The oral health crisis is costly, and taxpayers are paying 
for it through worse outcomes for people with diabetes or heart 
disease, worse pregnancy outcomes, and through emergency room 
visits. We are paying more in our health-care system as a 
result of these disparities. One study found that the U.S. 
could save over $22 billion annually by improving oral health 
care.
    This is not a partisan issue. During the Trump 
administration, the U.S. Surgeon General and NIH began working 
on a report that became ``Oral Health in America: Advances and 
Challenges,'' which was released by the Biden administration in 
2021. This was a 
follow-up to the landmark report of 2000, ``Oral Health in 
America: Report of the Surgeon General,'' which provided a 
comprehensive look at the importance of oral health and the 
disparities in the United States.
    I have been pleased to work with the Biden administration 
to advance a number of oral health priorities, including the 
historic appointment of Dr. Natalia Chalmers to be the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Chief Dental Officer. That 
position lay vacant for many years. We finally got it filled, 
and we are very pleased that we have that position, in order to 
put a focus within HHS on oral health care.
    And at the beginning of this year, Maryland Medicaid began 
covering adults. However, 16 percent of Maryland residents are 
over 65 years of age, and approximately 626,000 people in my 
State and more than 70 percent of the seniors in Maryland do 
not have dental health insurance. We have gaps that we need to 
deal with.
    To echo the former U.S. Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, 
``there is no health without oral health.'' Adequate access to 
oral health care is essential to preventing tragedies like the 
passing of Deamonte Driver. I hope we can work together to try 
to narrow the disparity gaps that we have and find ways that we 
can deal with the health-care crisis.
    With that, let me turn it over to my distinguished ranking 
member, Senator Daines.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE DAINES, 
                  A U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA

    Senator Daines. Chairman Cardin, thank you. Thanks too for 
sharing that very personal story as well. It kind of paints the 
reality of what is happening today in our country. I am really 
glad to be with you, hosting our very first subcommittee 
hearing of this Congress.
    It is also nice we have a Montanan here, Mr. Jon Forte from 
RiverStone Health in Billings, where my dad graduated from high 
school as well. We will have a more formal introduction 
shortly, but thanks for being here, Jon. Glad you could join 
us.
    Oral health care is really important. It is crucial, both 
for its own sake and in relation to our overall health and 
well-being. As I told my staff, when you have a toothache, 
nothing else really matters at that point.
    A number of conditions can be associated with oral health 
implications, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, 
arthritis, and Alzheimer's. There are also studies indicating 
links between mental health and oral health, and some of the 
first signs of mental health stressors can actually manifest in 
the mouth. As we continue to look for holistic approaches to 
caring for the mind as well as the body, oral health has a 
distinctive role to play.
    Over the years, there has been much bipartisan success in 
providing access to dental health care, such as through the 
Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicare Advantage. I 
am proud of these accomplishments and what these programs have 
achieved, but as we all will hear today and know, there are 
challenges to be addressed. When we consider disparities in 
access to oral health care, perhaps the greatest barrier for 
Montanans and Americans in rural States is geography.
    In Montana, oftentimes we have to travel great distances to 
receive any kind of health care, especially to see a dentist or 
a dental specialist. In part, this is because of how large 
Montana and the West are, but also because of significant 
shortages we are experiencing in the health-care workforce, 
shortages which are disproportionately felt in more rural areas 
of our country.
    Just earlier this month, I sat down with members of the 
Montana Dental Association, and their number one concern was 
workforce, subsequently followed by housing and housing costs. 
Housing is a top issue for their staff members and dental care 
teams. One provider shared that he had never heard his team 
talk so much about affording a place to live. This is in 
Montana.
    Another concern is the mental health of our dental 
community. We are all aware of the mental health crisis in our 
country, and of course our health-care professionals are not 
immune from experiencing this crisis themselves, especially in 
Montana where suicide is sadly taking far too many lives.
    Like physicians, the dental profession is linked to high 
levels of stress, depression, anxiety, and burnout. Dentists 
can have, additionally, distinct challenges as both providers 
and then also having to run a small business.
    The COVID pandemic exacerbated these struggles, 
contributing to the workforce shortages we are experiencing 
today. As we move beyond the pandemic, it is my priority to 
ensure that our dental providers and all who serve in our 
health-care workforce have the resources they need to care for 
their mental wellness.
    The number of community health centers that offer dental 
services, by the way, has grown by 60 percent in the last 10 
years, and in Montana we are forced to have 93 percent of our 
health-care centers offering dental services on site. Our 
community health centers are a critical part of the solution 
that we need going forward.
    I am grateful for all the work our health centers do to 
provide access to dental care and address disparities 
throughout Montana and the country. I want to acknowledge here 
Chairman Cardin's longtime leadership on this particular area 
of health care, and also thank the witnesses for being here 
today and bringing your expertise to this very important 
subject. I look forward to the discussion.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Senator Daines appears in the 
appendix.]
    Senator Cardin. Well, Senator Daines, thank you for your 
comments. I just really want to underscore the importance of 
our community health centers in providing dental care, and I 
appreciate you mentioning that in Montana. I am sure it is true 
also in Michigan, and it is clearly true in Maryland.
    I have visited many of our community health centers that a 
decade ago were not providing dental services that are doing it 
today, and it really is providing a great deal more coverage. 
In our community health centers, we are seeing not just 
children; we are also seeing the adult population. So it has 
really been a major step forward. So, thank you for mentioning 
that. I appreciate it very much.
    We have four distinguished witnesses that we are going to 
hear from. Let me first introduce Dr. Warren Brill from 
Maryland, a dentist and owner of the Eastpoint Pediatric Dental 
Associates--and I must acknowledge, a friend and advisor.
    Dr. Brill has been practicing pediatric dentistry for over 
45 years and operates a full-time practice in Baltimore, 
primarily serving Baltimore City and Baltimore County. However, 
a sizeable number of his patients travel over an hour to 
receive care from his office or through surgical services he 
provides at the University of Maryland Rehabilitation and 
Orthopaedic Institute. Approximately 80 percent of his patient 
base is Medicaid-eligible.
    He is also a clinical associate professor of pediatric 
dentistry at the University of Maryland. Dr. Brill serves as 
chairman of the Oral Health Advisory Committee to the Secretary 
of Health and Mental Hygiene for the State of Maryland. He is a 
consultant for pediatric oral medical devices for the FDA. He 
is past president of the American Academy of Pediatric 
Dentistry.
    What do you do in your spare time? [Laughter.]
    For our next introduction, I will yield to the ranking 
member for Mr. Forte.
    Senator Daines. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I am happy to 
introduce Jonathan Forte--what a great last name, Forte--this 
afternoon. Jon joined RiverStone Health in Billings, MT as 
president and CEO on January 3, 2023. We are glad you are in 
Montana and leading this critically important facility and 
operation.
    RiverStone Health provides public health services to 
Yellowstone County, offers primary care, dental, and behavioral 
health at eight locations in Billings, Worden, Bridger, and 
Joliet. He also owns the Eastern Montana Area Health Education 
Center and the Montana Family Medicine Residency. We all know 
that is a really important part of the equation on health care: 
training the next generation of health-care professionals for 
Montana.
    Jon spent the first decade of his leadership career serving 
veterans in various management roles throughout the VHA 
administration, and is board-certified in health-care 
management and as an American College of Healthcare Executives 
fellow.
    Jon is an avid skier, a backpacker, paddle boarder, and a 
beekeeper. His true passion is teaching adaptive skiing and 
coaching individuals with disabilities to live an active life. 
Jon and his wife Liz, a certified nurse midwife--when do you 
have time to get out and ski and paddle board?--have three 
daughters and currently reside in Billings, MT.
    Jon, welcome.
    Senator Cardin. You left out the most important part of his 
background. He served on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
    Senator Daines. We stole him from you, Senator Cardin. I 
did not want to tell you that.
    Senator Cardin. Our third witness is Cherae Farmer-Dixon, 
dean and professor of Meharry Medical College School of 
Dentistry, an HBCU located in Nashville, TN. Dr. Farmer-Dixon 
has overcome barriers in race and gender in becoming the third 
woman to head the School of Dentistry at Meharry Medical 
College. She remains one of the few select women to lead in the 
role as a dean of a dental program that produces 27 percent of 
our Nation's currently practicing African American dentists. 
Dr. Farmer-Dixon has served in the dental school for 32 years.
    Prior to assuming the role of dean, she was the associate 
dean of academic and student affairs in the School of 
Dentistry. Dr. Farmer-Dixon has also dedicated 20 years of 
service to her country as a lieutenant colonel in the United 
States Army Reserves. Thank you for your service to our 
country. We really appreciate that. She is a native of 
Mississippi, and we are pleased to have you with us today. 
Welcome.
    Our final witness will be Dr. Marko Vujicic, who currently 
serves as chief economist and vice president of the Health 
Policy Institute at the American Dental Association. In this 
role, he oversees a comprehensive research program focusing on 
the U.S. dental care system.
    Dr. Vujicic has published extensively in peer review 
journals such as Health Affairs and The New England Journal of 
Medicine. He is also the lead author of the book ``Working Is 
Health,'' which examines health workforce challenges globally, 
and has written several book chapters on health-care policy 
issues.
    He received his Ph.D. in economics from the University of 
British Columbia. Welcome. It is wonderful to have you here.
    We will start with Dr. Brill. Your full statements will be 
made part of our record. You may proceed as you wish.

STATEMENT OF WARREN BRILL, DMD, OWNER, EASTPOINT DENTISTRY; AND 
CONGRESSIONAL LIAISON, AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY, 
                         BALTIMORE, MD

    Dr. Brill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Daines, and 
members of the subcommittee. My name is Warren Brill, and I 
operate a pediatric dental practice in Baltimore, MD. I also 
represent the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and serve 
as their congressional liaison to engage policymakers.
    I have practiced for 45 years, providing care to children 
in Baltimore City and surrounding counties. I fully understand 
the oral health disparities too many children and their parents 
face, whether they be racial, cultural, due to disability, 
economic, or geographic.
    I wish to share with you the story of Dawn, one of my 
patients covered by Medicaid. I first started treating Dawn 
when she was 13. Dawn is a person with disabilities, and when I 
met her, she was extremely shy. Dawn came to me with badly 
decayed front teeth that needed extraction, and in extreme pain 
with her back teeth. After receiving dental treatment, Dawn 
communicated more openly, improved her relationships, and was 
able to better function at school and work. When Dawn turned 
21, she aged out of Medicaid dental coverage, but I kept her in 
my practice as a pro bono patient.
    Our collective experience with access to oral health care 
likely looks very different than Dawn's. This means we have a 
responsibility to do more and to do better. I recommend this 
subcommittee explore three key actions to better support our 
Nation's children, particularly those served by Medicaid and 
CHIP.
    First, take steps to ensure every child has a dental home 
no later than age one. Second, make sure no child who has 
significant oral disease and needs dental surgery suffers in 
pain or risks spread of infection due to lack of operating room 
access or extensive surgical backlogs. Third, consider options, 
including tax incentives, to expand the dental workforce.
    First, let me address the necessity of early childhood oral 
health care. While we have seen the prevalence of tooth decay 
decrease nationally in the U.S., nearly 20 percent of children 
under the age of five have experienced dental decay.
    Dental decay is not an equal-opportunity disease. Children 
living in poverty are twice as likely to suffer tooth decay, 
and two times as likely to go untreated as compared to more 
affluent peers. This disparity is also prominent among persons 
with disabilities. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry 
and other dental and medical professional groups endorse the 
importance of having the child's first dental visit on or 
before age one, to establish a dental home.
    The Academy also supports your efforts, Mr. Chairman, to 
ensure dental care is covered by State Medicaid programs for 
adults. We firmly believe that if parents receive needed dental 
care, it will be easier to find a dental home for their 
children. Dentists also believe that we can further improve 
Medicaid by addressing audit reform for dentists.
    Second, we must further take action to support operating 
room access for dental surgeries. Given the complex health-care 
needs of patients I have described and the need for surgery 
under general anesthesia, the most optimal care setting for 
these surgeries is in an operating room.
    Over the last decade, our challenge as pediatric dentists 
has been in securing operating room time for dental care, as 
many hospitals face OR backlogs for as long as 6 to 12 months, 
with dental surgeons competing for time against medical peers.
    I am pleased to inform you that the Academy worked with the 
broader dental community and those advocating for patients with 
disabilities to begin addressing this problem with CMS. This 
year, CMS set up an improved Medicaid billing and payment 
system to support hospital expenses for dental surgeries. This 
should allow for more equitable consideration of dental cases. 
Dentists are asking State Medicaid programs to also adopt the 
billing and payment changes CMS established for hospitals.
    We must also address disparities for people living in rural 
communities, who must travel long distances to receive 
hospital-based care. The most viable option is for CMS to 
permit ambulatory surgical centers, known as ASCs, to provide 
dental surgeries. We have asked CMS to move forward this year 
to allow dental surgeries to be covered and fairly reimbursed 
in ASCs.
    I want to thank Chairman Cardin and Senator Blackburn for 
engaging CMS in support of this effort. I encourage all 
subcommittee members to help.
    Third, we should consider how tax incentives can support 
dental workforce development through dental school educators. 
To address the need for more dental educators in order to build 
the dental workforce, the Academy has long advocated for 
student loan repayment and forgiveness options. The average 
student loan debt for pediatric dentists is as much as $300,000 
or more.
    As faculty's salaries are significantly less than private 
practice opportunities, there is a disincentive to enter 
academia. We encourage the subcommittee to consider additional 
options to strengthen loan repayment support, such as tax 
policies. For example, to support a dental faculty loan 
repayment program, we could exclude the amount of loan 
forgiveness received from Federal income taxes.
    The Academy thanks the chairman for working with us on 
creative tax policies like this, and we encourage additional 
efforts to explore tax benefits to grow the dental workforce.
    Thank you, Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member Daines, for 
this opportunity to testify. I will be pleased to answer any 
questions.

STATEMENT OF JONATHAN P. FORTE, MHA, FACHE, PRESIDENT AND CEO, 
                RIVERSTONE HEALTH, BILLINGS, MT

    Mr. Forte. Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, members 
of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify. My 
name is Jonathan Forte, and I am president and CEO of 
RiverStone Health in Billings, MT.
    For over 40 years, health, education, leadership, and 
protection have been at the foundation of our work. As the 
health department for Montana's largest city, we lead public 
health efforts to protect safety and well-being. Our federally 
qualified teaching health center serves more than 14,000 
patients a year across eight locations.
    Equitable access to oral health care is not a rural problem 
or an urban problem; it is an American problem, one that 
community health centers are essential to solving. Across 
Montana, health centers are often the only access point for 
oral health care. Montana's 14 community health centers serve 
over 120,000 patients annually. That is one in every 10 
Montanans.
    At RiverStone, we see patients from across the State, 
central Wyoming, the Dakotas, and other areas across our 
region, some patients driving over 500 miles to visit a 
dentist. Recruitment of oral dental providers in rural and 
frontier areas can take up to 2 years or more. Recently, a 
health center in Bozeman was unable to retain a qualified 
dentist because affordable housing, even for someone with a 
strong professional salary, was unobtainable.
    Working with the only two dental-accredited DA programs in 
the State of Montana, RiverStone and other health centers 
provide scholarships to those students who commit to serving or 
working as a DA or hygienist. Our Eastern Montana Area Health 
Education Center also provides educational opportunities to 
students in high school, community college, and technical 
schools, to build a pipeline of future health-care 
professionals.
    Community health centers provide fully integrated, 
equitable health-care delivery, and RiverStone Health continues 
to strengthen collaboration between primary care, dental, and 
behavioral health. Recently, a patient was in for a tooth 
extraction, and as our dental assistant was prepping the 
patient, they expressed a desire to die by suicide. Thanks to 
our integrated model of care and the compassion of our team, 
the DA immediately requested a consultation with our behavioral 
health team, and a therapist was able to visit the patient 
while in our dental clinic. After the extraction, they ensured 
that she received the appropriate level of care.
    Since the first dental school was founded in the United 
States, dentistry and medicine have been taught and viewed as 
two separate professions. The lack of a dental school in 
Montana creates an additional challenge. In Montana, in our 
family medicine residency, all residents complete a 1-week oral 
health rotation with dental providers in our integrated health 
center. Family medicine physicians actually learn to perform 
oral health risk assessments and evaluations, and over 65 
percent of our resident physicians remain in Montana to work in 
communities where dental care might not exist.
    By increasing the collective knowledge of medical providers 
about oral health, RiverStone Health can deliver more complete 
and more equitable care. To truly meet patients where they are 
though, we must expand utilization of mobile health and deliver 
oral health care beyond the four walls of the traditional 
dental office.
    Mobile and portable oral health programs have proven 
incredibly successful, particularly in our schools, providing 
sealants and screenings to children. In Montana, mobile health 
units also provide care to farm workers harvesting sugar beets 
and cherries, as well as nursing home residents. When the 
Mobile Health Care Act becomes effective in 2024, health 
centers will be able to expand utilization of mobile units.
    However, our success depends on continued funding for new 
access point grants. Without new access point grants, health 
centers cannot take advantage of this helpful legislation. 
Federal investments in health centers reduce overall health 
spending by expanding access to efficient and effective primary 
care. If resources are allocated, RiverStone Health and many 
like us are well-positioned to address unmet oral health needs.
    Meeting the needs of our patients and the team that cares 
for them is what matters to me most as a community health 
executive. This requires long-term, sustainable, predictable 
funding to enable confidence in our mission and support the 
incredible team of dedicated professionals at RiverStone Health 
and community health centers across the Nation.
    Thank you for allowing me to share the current reality 
impacting our patients and oral health professionals. Your 
longstanding bipartisan support saves lives. On behalf of 
RiverStone Health and the Montana Primary Care Association, we 
appreciate this committee's commitment to addressing oral 
health disparities and welcome your questions.
    Thank you.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Forte appears in the

    Senator Cardin. Mr. Forte, thank you very much for your 
testimony.
    We will now hear from Dr. Farmer-Dixon.

  STATEMENT OF CHERAE FARMER-DIXON, D.D.S., MSPH, MBA, FACD, 
FICD, DEAN AND PROFESSOR, SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY, MEHARRY MEDICAL 
                     COLLEGE, NASHVILLE, TN

    Dr. Farmer-Dixon. Thank you, Chairman Cardin, Ranking 
Member Daines, and members of the subcommittee, for inviting me 
to discuss the urgent need to address disparities in health 
care. Reports of our Nation's health-care workforce shortage 
are widespread, and the need continues to grow.
    Equally concerning, diversity in our workforce is stagnant, 
especially within dentistry, which exacerbates existing oral 
health disparities and supports barriers to care across the 
Nation. Oral health must be treated as a foundational element 
of health through incorporation into Medicare and Medicaid 
coverage.
    Today, I will discuss the continuous implications of this 
shortcoming, and request that Congress join Meharry in solving 
this critical problem. I am proud to serve as dean of the 
School of Dentistry at Meharry Medical College, only one of 
four historically Black medical colleges, and one of only two 
historically Black dental schools in the United States.
    As a current lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve 
with 20 years of service, I appreciate your attention to 
veterans' health as well. Our college was founded in 1876 with 
a model of worship of God through service to mankind, and for 
147 years we have provided service to the underserved.
    Nearly every American will need an urgent trip to the 
dentist one day. Sadly, not everyone has access to the care 
they require due to shortcomings in coverage and the absence of 
diversity. The unfortunate death of Deamonte Driver was a call 
to action. Thank you, Senator Cardin, for your attention to 
this event and the policies that followed.
    As dentists, we often see patients with dental decay beyond 
repair and discover life-threatening diseases like diabetes and 
cancer, first in the mouth. These diseases can be prevented 
through routine oral health care while reducing an unnecessary 
strain on health-care resources.
    Most Americans without access to dental care come from low-
income and minority backgrounds, rural areas, and 
unfortunately, many of them are veterans. Many studies show 
vast disparities based on reliable access to care. So, allow me 
to elaborate.
    Over 40 percent of low-income and non-Hispanic Black adults 
have untreated tooth decay. Forty percent of adults with low 
income or no health insurance have untreated cavities. The 
children of low-income parents are three times as likely to 
have untreated cavities at ages 2 to 5. For these children, 
poor oral health causes them to miss school and receive low 
grades.
    If left untreated, childhood oral health issues morph into 
lifelong ailments and lead to the serious diseases that I 
mentioned previously. At Meharry Medical College, our mission 
is to serve, which we uphold by routinely caring for our low-
income and uninsured community.
    Every spring and fall, Meharry holds the largest oral 
health days in the Nation, where our dental students, our 
alumni, and our teachers donate free dental care services. For 
many, these oral health days are the only opportunity to 
receive dental care. This does not adequately address oral 
health disparities plaguing our communities.
    We cannot reach the many dental care deserts across the 
Nation where care is neither affordable nor approachable for 
minority groups. A key solution is increasing the diversity of 
our dental workforce. It is well-established that a person's 
health care and trust in the medical community improves when 
they are seen by a provider of their own race.
    When given a choice, people are far less likely to visit a 
dentist of a different race, and that means that many visit 
only when they are in the worse circumstances. Currently, only 
4 percent of our Nation's dental workforce is Black. That is 
barely one Black dentist in every major city in the U.S., and 
27 percent of those dentists have been educated at Meharry.
    The job of educating a diverse dental workforce cannot rest 
solely on Meharry and our sister HBCU, Howard. Dental education 
and affordable care must extend on a national level. We need 
Congress to focus on finding a solution and improving oral 
health nationally. Failure to act aggressively will lead to 
sicker Americans and an additional strain on our health-care 
system. We urge Congress to join us in creating a more diverse 
health-care workforce, and a health-care system with 
comprehensive care and coverage for dental.
    Meharry Medical College promises to be a steadfast partner 
and leader in this work. We have the legacy, expertise, and 
knowledge to lead this effort, so that all children of tomorrow 
can visit their local dentist with confidence, trust, and free 
of fear.
    Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you, and I am 
happy to answer any questions.

    Senator Cardin. Thank you very much for your testimony.
    Dr. Vujicic?

  STATEMENT OF MARKO VUJICIC, Ph.D., CHIEF ECONOMIST AND VICE 
      PRESIDENT, HEALTH POLICY INSTITUTE, AMERICAN DENTAL 
                    ASSOCIATION, CHICAGO, IL

    Dr. Vujicic. Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, 
members of the committee, I really want to thank you for 
inviting me to share some data-driven insights on oral health 
in America. More importantly, I want to thank you for holding 
this hearing. It is a recognition of the important role of oral 
health in overall health and well-being, but also a testament 
to the need for action.
    I think all of us would agree here today that when it comes 
to our Nation's oral health, we can and we should do better.
    My name is Marko Vujicic. I am the chief economist and vice 
president of the Health Policy Institute at the American Dental 
Association. I lead a research team that studies the U.S. 
dental care system. In this role and throughout my career, I 
have worked on bringing evidence and data to policymakers to 
help inform decision-making.
    My written testimony covers several important aspects of 
our dental care system and the topic of today's hearing, 
including trends in oral health, what is happening to 
disparities over time, what are some unique challenges in rural 
areas that we have heard a little bit about already. I have 
also laid out some considerations for policymakers as you think 
about solutions and the path forward.
    Now, my written testimony is heavy on data, statistics, and 
research, and I am happy to discuss it later on in detail. But 
in my opening remarks, I want to make one point and one point 
only, and that is, when it comes to our Nation's oral health, 
what we see today is a result of the policy choices we have 
made along the way.
    And namely, when it comes to children, we treat dental care 
as core health care, as an essential service. And when it comes 
to adults and seniors, we do not. So, in America's health-care 
policy, essentially we disconnect mouth from body when people 
become adults.
    It is precisely because of these policy choices along the 
way that, in fact, oral health in America is a two-part story. 
As you will see in my written testimony--or if you have seen--
when it comes to children, the data show some appreciable gains 
that we have made over time. We are certainly not out of the 
woods, but oral health is improving, and more importantly, 
disparities in many aspects of children's oral health are 
narrowing by race, by income. As Chairman Cardin said in his 
opening remarks, for adults and seniors, we are not seeing 
that.
    Our policy choices also have repercussions that extend well 
beyond the mouth. Every year, there are more than 2 million 
hospital emergency room visits in America for oral health 
conditions. If we do the math, that is about one every 15 
seconds.
    This is heartbreaking, but as an economist I also want to 
highlight that this costs our health-care system upwards of 
over $2 billion per year. Research also shows that improved 
oral health can lead to cost savings on the medical care side. 
We have heard this already for conditions like diabetes, heart 
disease, pregnancy.
    And maybe most shockingly, 3 out of 10 low-income adults in 
this country--3 out of 10--say that oral health conditions 
limit their job prospects. So these data suggest quite strongly 
that we are paying an economic penalty for our policy choices 
along the way. Put another way, aside from improving people's 
lives, there is an economic and fiscal dividend associated with 
improving our Nation's oral health.
    So, on behalf of the American Dental Association and my 
team back home in Chicago, I want to thank you for the chance 
again to share some data-driven insights, and I again thank you 
for holding this hearing. I am happy to elaborate further on 
any points in my testimony or answer any questions.
    Thank you once again.
    [The prepared statement of Dr. Vujicic appears in the 
appendix.]
    Senator Cardin. Let me thank all four of you for your 
contribution to this hearing. I particularly appreciate some of 
the specific recommendations that you have made, and we will 
certainly be looking at those specific recommendations.
    Dr. Vujicic, I could not agree with you more about the 
division between our young people and our adults and seniors. 
We had a choice to try to make some progress during the CHIP 
program, which obviously deals with our children, and we were 
able to get some progress done there for pediatric dental.
    And then in the Affordable Care Act, we had a chance to 
include the pediatric dental. We tried to do more; we were 
unsuccessful in getting more included. But I think your point 
is very well taken. There are some efforts now to deal with 
this through Medicare and through Medicaid, to expand coverage 
for adults, and that is an issue that is currently being 
debated here in Congress.
    And, Dr. Brill, your three recommendations. Your first was 
that we need to have young infants to 1-year-olds connected 
with a dentist by that time. And one way you said to get that 
is for their parents to have coverage and a dentist, but many 
of the low-income families do not have a family dentist. So 
therefore, their 1-year-old is less likely to have a dentist.
    So I think there is a direct connection between providing 
adequate coverage for our adult population and being able to 
get our children adequately covered. So I thought those points 
were just very well taken.
    There is also another aspect here, and I wonder if you all 
wanted to comment on it. We found that health literacy is not 
where it needs to be. Sometimes we find our children know more 
than their parents know by the mobile dental lab buses that go 
around to our schools. Has that been effective?
    I know in Maryland, we use the mobile dental facilities to 
go to our schools, and it helped the children, but it also 
helped the children's parents understand oral health care. Do 
you all have any experience on the advantages of mobile dental?
    Dr. Brill. The mobile dental programs do help, but they do 
not establish a dental home. So the best way to get the 
children to be healthy, especially via the parents, is to bring 
them to the dental office at age 1 or eruption of the first 
tooth.
    If they see the mobile dentist, they do not necessarily 
receive care, but are told that they might need care. So, it is 
a good first step, but it is not the solution. The solution is 
to find a dental home at age 1 or at the eruption of the first 
tooth.
    Senator Cardin. Dr. Farmer-Dixon?
    Dr. Farmer-Dixon. Yes. We have a mobile dental unit, and 
the premise is that we want to meet people where they are, and 
going into those rural communities, remote areas where they do 
not have access, but going on a regular basis so that they know 
that, while it is a mobile unit, it can serve as their mobile 
home.
    So it is for the family--to your point, the literacy for 
the adults and educating them so that they will understand the 
importance of oral health, not only for themselves, but for 
their children as well, so that we are making it a family 
approach to addressing their dental needs.
    Senator Cardin. So, I was at a behavioral health center 
this past week, and their number one concern was workforce, 
getting health-care professionals. I have been to our 
hospitals. Their number one concern is the workforce, getting 
workers. Everywhere we go, we have a shortage in the health-
care fields.
    So is there something unique about dentistry that we should 
be aware of in our effort? You mentioned those who are teaching 
dentistry. We had the same concern about those teaching 
nursing, that it is just economically not as rewarding. A nurse 
can make more practicing than they can teaching.
    Is there something special about dentistry that we should 
be trying to help in regard to the workforce?
    Dr. Brill. Well, one of the main obstacles in the workforce 
right now is the result of COVID. Many, many people either are 
not coming back into the field or not entering the field. So we 
have to be able to educate the population and the workforce 
that this is, if not under control, getting under control.
    In terms of the dentists themselves, as I mentioned 
earlier, the student debt is a big problem. There are programs 
that are in place now to help, but they need to be expanded and 
enhanced. Those are some of the things that will help 
ameliorate the situation of a decreased workforce.
    Senator Cardin. Let me ask Mr. Forte: you do not have a 
dental school, if I understand correctly, in Montana?
    Mr. Forte. That is correct.
    Senator Cardin. So, we generally learn that where people 
train, they are more likely to stay. What do you do to attract 
dentists in Montana?
    Mr. Forte. So, with the family medicine residency--that is 
right--we train family practice physicians, and we keep over 60 
percent of them in Montana. With our dental program, we go 
outside the State, and actually outside the Mountain West 
region, and partner with schools like the University of 
Washington School of Dentistry and the NYU Langone Advanced 
Education in General Dentistry Program.
    NYU Langone actually specializes in providing resident 
student dentists to community health centers like RiverStone 
Health across the country and focuses on rural and underserved 
locations as well. So, through partnerships and collaboration, 
we are able to bring students into Montana, expose them to the 
wonders of our State and our community, and hopefully they 
choose to stay there and raise their families.
    Senator Cardin. And also, their outstanding representatives 
in the United States Senate.
    Senator Daines?
    Senator Daines. Chairman Cardin, I was going to say a fly 
rod and a set of skis is also a way we recruit dentists to 
Montana at times. But thanks for your kind words, Mr. Chairman.
    So, I spoke a bit in my opening comments about how crucial 
health centers are to addressing health-care disparities across 
the country, especially in more rural States. As you said, we 
do not have a dental school in Montana, where receiving care 
often means driving several hours to see the nearest health-
care provider. RiverStone Health in Billings is a leading 
example on many fronts, including the access to dental 
services. But as has already been discussed, providing that 
care has its difficulties and challenges.
    Mr. Forte, from your perspective, what are some of the 
greatest challenges for health centers when it comes to 
providing access to dental services in States like Montana that 
do not have a dental school? What are your thoughts?
    Mr. Forte. Senator, it is obviously access to care. Like 
you stated earlier, due to our geographic nature and the 
distribution of dental providers, it is, ``Do I live close 
enough to a dentist or am I in a town that has a dental 
provider within it, or do I have to drive to a larger city like 
Billings or Helena?''
    Due to our vast geography, another challenge is that only 
30 percent of Montanans are actually exposed to fluorinated 
water. Community water systems are common in our larger cities 
and towns, but the majority of Montanans are on cisterns or 
wells, making fluoride toothpastes and school-based dental 
sealants and sealants for children a priority. That is one of 
the ways that we combat that issue.
    I think patient perception of a need to see a dentist is 
also an issue across the country, as well as how much it is 
going to cost. We have conversations with our patients almost 
every day. ``I am worried about how much this is going to cost 
me. I do not want to come back next week. Could I come back a 
month later? I will be able to afford it then.''
    Less than half of Montana's low-income adults reported 
seeing a dentist last year, and across the U.S., emergency 
dental visits for preventable conditions cost our health system 
nearly $2 billion. Montanans aged 18 to 39 rely on emergency 
dental care more than any other group.
    So, at RiverStone Health, it is important to us to get into 
schools, to provide access points, early childhood care 
programs, and comprehensive oral health education, to not only 
our students but also adults. With this mobile program, the 
problem I see in school-based dental programs is that adults 
are not consenting for their children to be treated, because 
they lack that health literacy about why dental care is 
important.
    Senator Daines. So you spoke a bit about mobile services. I 
know you have experience utilizing mobile clinics. I have seen 
that in Montana with some of the seasonal workers who work the 
Flathead cherry crop. If we did not have those seasonal 
workers, we would not have the joy of the cherries every August 
in northwest Montana.
    I have seen those mobile clinics take care of some of those 
seasonal workers. Could you talk a bit more--you alluded to it 
a bit--about the approach to providing care, and the success or 
limits you have seen with mobile clinics?
    Mr. Forte. Yes, absolutely. And in previous roles in 
community health, we have built mobile vehicles, specifically 
in Maryland. We built those vehicles during ARPA funding for 
community vaccinations through COVID, and then quickly realized 
the need to roll those out with a dental package on board, to 
go to area schools and serve over 36 schools on the Eastern 
Shore. It is a great program.
    Half of all school-based dental programs in the U.S. do not 
use a mobile unit. They use a small, portable suitcase-like 
device to go in and provide cleanings, screenings, and sealants 
in the janitor's closet, an empty classroom, the school 
auditorium, or the gymnasium--anywhere that that school has the 
ability to provide them with an access point.
    The mobile units truly provide a safe space, a controlled 
environment. And really, kids get excited when they see them 
pull up out front and know that the dental team is there to 
take care of them that day.
    Our mobile programs, once they are developed, I think the 
biggest challenge, like I said, is consent. If we are going out 
and we are providing access in the schools, we need parents to 
be educated about the program and know what benefit it will 
provide.
    Senator Daines. All right.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you. I might note that this is probably 
the first witness you have seen who mentions Montana and 
Maryland as the only two States in his testimony. [Laughter.]
    Senator Cardin. I knew we had a lot in common. That is 
good.
    Senator Stabenow?
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Another great M 
State, Michigan, so we will just keep going here. Welcome to 
all of you. I first thank you, Mr. Chairman, for all the work 
you have done on oral health over the years. I am proud to be 
your partner in this.
    I enjoyed working with you very much, and also, it is great 
to have Senator Daines again as the ranking member of the 
subcommittee. I appreciate very much the work on the behavioral 
health workforce that we were able to get done at the end of 
the year. So, a lot more to do on all of this.
    So, we are here because we know that oral health is health 
care, period, and we need it to be for children and adults and 
seniors. We need to make sure that we are treating it as such. 
But we also know that, obviously, people are lacking care and 
the affordable services that they need.
    So I am very pleased to lead efforts with Senator Cardin to 
improve oral health for moms, and we know that there is a 
positive impact on children in the connection with their moms.
    So, our Oral Health for Moms Act seeks to improve maternal 
oral health and, consequently, children's oral health. It would 
require Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program to 
cover dental health care for pregnant and postpartum women and 
require that health insurance provide coverage of oral health 
to pregnant women as an essential health benefit.
    And so, I am really pleased that right now all State 
Medicaid programs cover dental care during pregnancy and 60 
days postpartum, which is great, but there is more to do. So, 
Dr. Farmer-Dixon, I wonder if you could elaborate on the 
connections we have been hearing about today between an adult 
caregiver's oral health and what happens to their children?
    Dr. Farmer-Dixon. I think a lot of times, with expectant 
mothers especially, because they are going through hormonal 
changes, there are things that can happen in their mouth, like 
periodontal disease. And they need to go to the dentist on a 
regular basis, just like they are going for their regular 
evaluations during and throughout their pregnancy.
    So I think that it is twofold. There needs to be an 
education and a professional training among the physicians and 
the dentists, so that it is a holistic approach to providing 
care, so that when those expectant mothers are going, it is a 
natural progression that if they do not have a dental home, 
they also are connected with a dentist so that they are getting 
routine evaluations throughout their pregnancy.
    The other thing is that if they have a lot of cavities in 
their mouth, that means that they have a lot of what we would 
call bad bacteria, and there is the potential for that to be 
transferred to their unborn child. So unfortunately, then that 
child is coming in with some potentially bad bacteria and 
having a higher risk of getting dental decay.
    Even after the pregnancy, just the education--we talked 
about literacy, when it is a team approach to health care, not 
just the pregnancy but the child, and educating so that they 
know that there is a potential for baby bottle caries. They may 
think that they are providing healthy milk and juices, but 
because they are high in sugar content, they are potentially 
exposing their children--not intentionally, but due to a lack 
of knowledge.
    So it really needs to be a holistic approach to how we are 
looking at the health care of the expectant mother, and them 
understanding--and not just the mother, but the health-care 
team--working collectively to make certain that throughout the 
pregnancy and beyond, that it is a healthy child, and a healthy 
child means that they have a healthy mouth, that the mother has 
a healthy mouth, that the child becomes a healthy adolescent 
that includes oral health and a healthy adult.
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you so much.
    Dr. Vujicic, you mentioned in your testimony that dental 
coverage for adults is not currently an essential health 
benefit under the ACA or universally covered in Medicaid. Could 
you talk a little bit more about the effects of expanding that 
coverage to adults?
    Dr. Vujicic. Well, Senator, as you mentioned, the landscape 
currently is 29 States provide dental coverage to adults that 
we consider extensive in our analysis, in their State Medicaid 
program. You mentioned it is voluntary. We know that when 
States expand coverage and add dental benefits for adults in 
their Medicaid programs, it improves job prospects, most among 
Black beneficiaries.
    So there is definitely a reduction in disparities there. We 
know it reduces emergency room costs. Senator Cardin, in your 
State, we had the pleasure of teaming up to do some research. 
We estimated a $4-million savings per year to the Medicaid 
budget by expanding adult dental. Those are a couple of 
examples of what I call the fiscal dividend.
    Senator Stabenow. Thank you.
    And as I conclude, let me just say community health centers 
are so very important, Mr. Forte, and our Oral Health for Moms 
Act would also add new grants for Federally Qualified Health 
Centers as part of what they do. So, thank you for what you do 
in integrated care. We are hoping that Montana is going to be 
part of a broader community behavioral health clinic effort now 
that is happening, and with my Agriculture hat on, I have to 
say ``thank you'' for being a beekeeper.
    Senator Cardin. Well, we are joined by the chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee. We have been talking about a lot of 
the progress that we have made, whether it was through the 
Affordable Care Act--which, by the way, provided substantial 
increase of funds for the qualified health centers--or whether 
it was the CHIP program, or whether it was some of the bills 
that were passed in the last Congress.
    It was Senator Wyden's leadership that marshaled those 
successes to the finish line. So we are very proud of our 
chairman.
    Senator Wyden?
    Senator Wyden. I do not want to make this a bouquet-tossing 
contest, but the fact is Senator Cardin has been after these 
issues for years and years, before they became popular, before 
they were debated on the floor of the Senate and the House. I 
just want him to know how much I appreciate him being in these 
critical health precincts for so long, and we are so lucky that 
he is going to be the chair of this important subcommittee.
    I was listening to the Ms getting rolled out. I heard 
Maryland, Montana, and then Michigan. I said, ``Well, I do not 
really get to participate in that, because Oregon is not in the 
M department.'' But I want to talk about Medicare, so we will 
kind of stay with the Ms, and I want to put this in this 
context.
    Before he retired, the late Orrin Hatch was willing to talk 
to me about chronic illness. And I laid out a plan that 
essentially involved the proposition that when Medicare began 
in 1965, it was largely acute illness: you break your ankle, 
you go to the hospital; it is Part A.
    But most of Medicare today is now chronic illness: cancer, 
diabetes, heart disease, strokes, dental challenges. So I went 
to Chairman Hatch and I asked him about passing a major 
Medicare reform bill called the CHRONIC Care Act.
    He looked at me--he always treated me like his son, and I 
think Senator Cardin remembers it--and he smiled, and he said, 
``That's even more ridiculous than anything Kennedy used to ask 
me to do.'' I said, ``Mr. Chairman, I think we can do this. I 
think we can do it in a fiscally responsible way.'' And in 
fact, we did get it passed. It was one of his last major pieces 
of legislation.
    The fact though is that it did not really put us in a 
position under this legislation--for example, it had major 
provisions on telemedicine. And when Seema Verma, Donald 
Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services, called me up 
and said, ``Can we use it as the telemedicine standard for 
COVID?'', I said, ``Thrilled, terrific. But what about this 
other stuff?'' She said, ``Well, it is COVID. We cannot do 
it.'' Now we are in a position where we can.
    Doctor, if you were to amend the CHRONIC Care Act going 
forward today to incorporate the kinds of good work that 
Senator Cardin has been talking about in terms of say, dealing 
with chronic dental disease, what would you put in?
    Dr. Farmer-Dixon. I think there has to be coverage for 
adults. Just as with telemedicine, teledentistry would be a 
component of being able to reach those communities and create 
greater access and connect them with dentists. I think also in 
doing that, by creating greater access for adults, you have to 
have the workforce to be able to treat those individuals, and 
that goes back to increasing the diversity of the workforce.
    When we talk about our chronic diseases and the most 
vulnerable populations, those are poor individuals. Those are 
the low-
income. Those are Black and Brown communities. So, giving them 
access and expanding Medicare is a step in the right direction. 
But the other component of that is that giving them that 
access, they have to also have a provider that they can go to, 
and we have to look at how we increase the workforce--how we 
increase the diversity of the workforce as well.
    Senator Wyden. I think your answer is spot-on, and I would 
be interested in any information you have or could supply. I do 
not want to force you to write a book report or something, but 
the teledentistry model, particularly, is something that would 
be a next stop for the CHRONIC Care Act, and the next stop for 
telemedicine.
    It makes a lot of sense, and I would love to be one of the 
cosponsors of a Cardin bill on that, because I think it is very 
good. My time is almost up.
    The only other point I want to make, Mr. Chairman--why I 
think it is so important that you are doing this work--is, I 
have been struck now by the number of people who apparently are 
going to hospital emergency rooms suffering from dental 
disease. You talk to the physicians there, and they say--I went 
to school on a basketball scholarship. They would tell you it 
is like playing out of position.
    The emergency physicians are going to give people good 
care. They are committed to the health of the people they see, 
but they are not really trained to do it. And then they would 
say, ``Ron, you know, I can help people deal with the immediate 
challenge when they are dealing with tremendous disease, and I 
can make sure that they get a cleaning, and particularly get 
medicines so that they can deal with an infection.'' And then 
they tell you the real clincher: they are going to be back here 
in 6 weeks, because we do not deal with the problem 
comprehensively.
    So my time is up. I just wanted to come by for a few 
minutes on a busy day, because I am all-in for Senator Cardin's 
program.
    And on teledentistry, Dr. Farmer-Dixon--and I apologize for 
not getting into more detail with all of you--I think we have a 
chance now to take what is the future of Medicare, which is 
chronic disease, figure out the next steps beyond where 
Chairman Hatch was willing to be really gutsy and do something 
with the fellow on the other side of the aisle, and it would be 
good for telemedicine.
    So, I really appreciate all of you, and I am looking 
forward to being one of the cosponsors of a Cardin bill on 
something like this.
    Thanks, Ben. Thank you.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you, Senator Wyden. I appreciate very 
much your support and your leadership on this issue. 
Teledentistry is an interesting subject. We are moving forward. 
Under Senator Wyden's leadership, we have moved forward to 
expand the COVID-related telehealth services beyond COVID.
    I expect there are going to be further activities done at 
the Federal level to try to remove obstacles in the system, 
whether they are certification issues going across 
jurisdictions or reimbursement issues on telehealth.
    So for teledentistry, I look at the model today on payment, 
which is very mixed. You have, obviously, some coverages under 
the CHIP program and under the Affordable Care Act. You have 
some Medicaid coverage, and you have some private insurance 
coverage, and you have private pay. What are the obstacles to 
teledentistry? I take it it is used for a lot of the follow-up 
care for dental maintenance, et cetera.
    So, what are the obstacles today to expanding the use of 
telehealth, which could be pretty important for communities 
where transportation is difficult for people to get to a 
dentist?
    Dr. Brill. Teledentistry is very, very helpful when it 
comes to diagnosis. I learned from the very beginning you 
cannot diagnose over the telephone, but you can make a very 
good stab looking at a photograph on your cellphone. When it 
comes to the actual treatment, that is where the rubber does 
not meet the road, because you have to have the patient in the 
chair.
    But it certainly can alleviate a lot of the chair time that 
might not be productive in terms of the health outcome. So it 
has a place, but unlike other avenues or other specialties, it 
is an adjunct but it is not the end of what can be done.
    Senator Cardin. Anyone else with--yes, Doctor?
    Dr. Vujicic. Senator, just looking forward, I think the 
opportunity comes with perhaps reforming the payment model. You 
hit a very important point there. If the system navigates to a 
payment model that is somehow rewarding health or connectivity 
with providers, rather than simply paying for procedures and 
surgeries, all of a sudden now the incentives change for 
teledentistry.
    I agree totally. We saw it primarily with COVID and post-
pandemic. It is like a triage tool, right, to stay connected to 
patients. But you are totally right. The payment model is 
limiting its take-up, and I see a bright future if we can tweak 
the payment model.
    Senator Cardin. So, I will put a promo in for Maryland. 
Maryland has a total cost of care model that came out of its 
hospital reimbursement structure which is now well beyond 
hospital care, and it is based upon that. You can find less 
expensive--quality must be maintained--but less expensive and 
more efficient ways to do business; you can do it.
    Of course, that is also true on some of our efficiency 
models in the Affordable Care area. So we do have some models 
out there that reward that type of reimbursement, but not 
enough. Good point.
    I want to go back to the point that Dr. Brill mentioned on 
the lack of surgical space for dentistry, because that is 
absolutely true in Maryland. I have heard that over and over 
again. So, Dr. Vujicic, let me ask you whether this is a 
national issue or just one that is unique to a couple of 
States.
    Do we have a serious problem of dentistry not getting its 
fair allocations of surgical space within our hospitals?
    Dr. Vujicic. Yes. This is one of those that is not on my 
fingertips, but the team can get back to you on that. We 
certainly saw it as a national issue. We do not know how much 
it varies across States, and we have been supportive of 
legislation. Our DC team is here, so we can follow up on that.
    Senator Cardin. Dr. Farmer-Dixon, have you run into that 
issue in your work?
    Dr. Farmer-Dixon. When we are talking about dentistry and 
establishing it in a hospital setting--you know, unlike a 
medical room or an examination room--you have your examination 
chair. So there are other factors that come into play that are 
associated with cost.
    So when you are talking about setting up a dental chair or 
dental clinic, you are talking about adequate plumbing for 
suction, vacuum units, compressors, water lines--at additional 
cost in comparison to maybe setting up a medical clinic.
    And so, while in some instances the idea or the concept is 
great, when you start looking at how you are going to 
logistically develop that and execute that plan, you get into 
additional costs that a lot of times people--unless they are in 
the dental profession or understand dentistry and what it takes 
to actually set up a dental clinic--do not expect those costs, 
those additional costs.
    Senator Cardin. Mr. Forte, in a rural area like Montana, do 
you have challenges in getting surgical space?
    Mr. Forte. Absolutely, and you know, a lot of our private 
dentists across Montana do not actually do extractions, and so 
patients are forced to go to an oral surgery center somewhere. 
The great vast geography of the State of Montana precludes that 
easy access most times.
    We do have a part-time oral surgeon on staff at RiverStone 
Health, and that provides some of the only access to oral 
surgery and greater, higher-level procedures that some of our 
patients require. So, anything we can do to improve access to 
OR space or improve oral surgeons coming into rural and 
frontier regions would be greatly appreciated.
    Senator Cardin. And, Dr. Brill, I have found that medical 
politics can be more brutal than politics in the Senate. So is 
this a medical turf problem, or is this a situation where we 
can help you?
    Dr. Brill. I think it is probably both. We compete for 
operating room time with surgeons. Fortunately, at my 
hospital--which is part of the University of Maryland system--
there is a dedicated operating room just for dental cases. But 
that is not the case throughout the State or the Nation. Shady 
Grove Hospital, which is in our State, discontinued all dental 
cases in the recent past.
    So there are children who need care. We do not know where 
to go. I have a national reach within my organization, and this 
is a national problem in terms of operating room access, which 
is one of the reasons that we are hoping that the new code and 
procedures that CMS put in for Medicare for hospital 
reimbursement for operating rooms will also be applied to ASCs, 
which I believe is something that you and Senator Blackburn are 
working on.
    Senator Cardin. Thank you.
    Senator Warren, it is nice to have you here. Thank you.
    Senator Warren. Thank you very much; thank you. I 
appreciate it, Chairman Cardin.
    So, since Medicare was established in 1965, it has not 
covered routine dental benefits. That means no fillings, no 
extractions, or even preventive care like cleanings. As a 
result, seniors are more likely than any other age group to 
lack dental insurance, and nearly half of all Medicare 
beneficiaries, about 24 million people, report that they did 
not have dental coverage in 2019.
    Now, while Medicare is prevented from covering almost all 
dental benefits, the government has created an exception for 
the private health insurance plans that offer Medicare 
Advantage or MA. Under this system, MA plans can offer 
supplemental benefits that cover services that are not 
available under traditional Medicare, and not unsurprisingly, 
dental benefits are a very popular offering. In fact, 96 
percent of MA enrollees were in plans offering some dental 
coverage in 2022. But even seniors who are able to access 
dental services may face hurdles in getting the care that they 
need.
    Dr. Vujicic, almost all MA beneficiaries are in plans that 
offer dental care. We have almost all of them. But what do we 
know about the quality of the coverage they are getting?
    Dr. Vujicic. In a nutshell, the research suggests strongly 
that Medicare Advantage dental has very little impact on 
utilization of dental care, as well as oral health outcomes 
themselves. I could elaborate more.
    Senator Warren. But tell me the principal reasons why that 
is so.
    Dr. Vujicic. Well, for example, a third of those plans have 
cost sharing for prevention. When they do offer more than 
prevention--fillings, extractions, like you said--the most 
common co-insurance rate is 50 percent. So I mean, I challenge 
us to think--if a heart valve replacement was 50 percent co-
insurance, we certainly would complain about affordability of 
cardiac care. Those are some of the key parameters in the----
    Senator Warren. Okay, okay; dollar cap, service frequency 
limits, required copays----
    Dr. Vujicic. Correct.
    Senator Warren. All right; very helpful. In fact, a new 
study found that seniors in MA used even fewer services than 
beneficiaries in traditional Medicare. So, while millions of 
Medicare beneficiaries do not have access to dental care, the 
ones who do may have such high out-of-pocket costs that 
effectively they do not.
    According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicare 
beneficiaries who use dental services paid about $875 in 
average out-of-pocket costs in 2018. One in five spent more 
than $1,000.
    Dr. Farmer-Dixon, in your experience as a dentist, if a 
patient faces high out-of-pocket costs, are they more likely or 
less likely to get the care that they need?
    Dr. Farmer-Dixon. They are less likely to get the care that 
they need, because they cannot afford those out-of-pocket 
costs.
    Senator Warren. Okay. So seniors are more likely to avoid 
getting dental care if they know it is going to mean spending a 
lot of money out of pocket. It seems to me the solution is 
clear. It is time to expand Medicare to cover dental care, 
something I have long supported.
    But critics say it is going to be too expensive. But the 
truth is that MA plans have been overcharging Medicare for 
years, and the most recent reports suggest they are going to 
wrack up nearly a trillion dollars in overpayments by 2031.
    And it will not be just taxpayers who foot the bills for 
these overpayments. Medicare beneficiaries will also pay nearly 
$150 billion in higher Part B premiums. So, Dr. Vujicic, how 
much would it cost to add a dental benefit to Medicare?
    Dr. Vujicic. The estimates range from $23 billion per year 
up to $32 billion per year, depending on how the benefit is 
designed and the parameters, et cetera. But that is the range 
from the research.
    Senator Warren. Okay. So $23 billion to $32 billion a year, 
or we can spend nearly a trillion dollars in overpayments to 
insurance companies for crummy coverage that beneficiaries do 
not use. Or we can crack down on the abuses and use this money 
to pay for the dental care that people actually need.
    Now, CMS has recently proposed a rule that takes steps to 
ensure that payments to MA plans more accurately reflect the 
cost of providing care. CMS should absolutely finalize this 
rule. But I want to argue here that CMS needs to go further and 
end these insurance industry scams and ensure that 
beneficiaries get the care they need. We could use this money 
to provide the dental care that people across this Nation need.
    I appreciate all of you being here. I appreciate you for 
holding this hearing, Mr. Chairman. There is such an obvious 
way for us to provide a solution here if we just have the 
political will to get it done.
    Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Cardin. Senator Warren, thanks for the points that 
you made. I totally agree with you. Your numbers are extremely 
conservative, using 2018 numbers, which would be likely higher 
today. The number that you got on the cost of extending 
Medicare to cover dental is the direct cost to Medicare without 
all the savings.
    This hearing has pointed out that we are going to get 
savings in so many other areas of health care, including 
diabetes, heart disease, pregnancy complications, things like 
that, which will save dollars, not to mention the fact we have 
talked about the emergency room use for dental care, which I 
can tell you in my State of Maryland, it is major problem in 
our emergency rooms with dental care being provided.
    So that is terribly inefficient, very costly. So the 
numbers that have been given to you do not take that into 
consideration. In one of the bills that we are working on--
Senator Whitehouse is trying to help as chairman of the Budget 
Committee--the way that we score some of these programs is to 
look at it from a more holistic point of view, as to the type 
of savings it brings in.
    I use the example of the CBO today. If you did not have an 
annual physical coverage under Medicare, and we put a bill in 
to do that, it would be scored for hundreds and hundreds of 
billions of dollars, and we know it saves money.
    So we need to change the way that we score these programs, 
because it is just common sense that to get people in to see a 
dentist is going to save money. They are going to be able to 
work, we eliminate the loss of time from work--all the 
different losses that we have because people are not getting 
just the routine care.
    So I thank you for making that point. I hope we will see 
the day that we can expand Medicare to include dental, and we 
were close, I thought, in the last Congress, so we are going to 
have to keep working at it. Thank you for the point.
    Senator Warren. Thank you for your leadership on this.
    Senator Cardin. And let me thank all of our witnesses. Let 
me just check to see if I have to do anything else formally.
    [Pause.]
    Senator Cardin. We will keep the record of the committee 
open for 1 week in case members have questions for the record. 
We would ask the witnesses, if they get questions for the 
record, to please respond to them quickly. You may be saved 
because we are going into a recess, so we scatter pretty 
quickly after tomorrow, so I think we will be safe.
    But the record of the committee will remain open for 1 week 
for questions for the record. And again, I thank our panelists 
for being here today. It was, I think, extremely helpful. I 
wrote down your suggestions, and working with Senator Daines, I 
hope that we will be able to advance some of these issues 
during this Congress.
    And with that, the subcommittee will stand adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:03 p.m., the hearing was concluded.]

 Prepared Statement of Warren Brill, DMD, Owner, Eastpoint Dentistry; 
   and Congressional Liaison, American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry
    Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, and members of the 
subcommittee, my name is Warren A. Brill, DMD, and I am a private 
practice dentist in the State of Maryland and also represent the 
American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, serving as their congressional 
liaison to engage Federal policymakers on policies affecting pediatric 
dentistry. I have practiced pediatric dentistry for 45-years, providing 
care to children in Baltimore city and surrounding counties. I fully 
understand the oral health disparities too many children and parents 
face--whether they be racial, cultural, due to disability, economic, 
geographic or a combination of several of these disparities. I thank 
you for holding this important hearing today.

    I would like to share with you the story of one of my Medicaid 
patients who is a constant inspiration for me, named Dawn. I first 
started treating Dawn when she was 13. Dawn has challenging physical 
and intellectual disabilities. She did not communicate and was 
extremely shy. Dawn came to me with badly decayed front teeth that 
needed extraction and extreme pain with her back teeth. After receiving 
dental treatment, Dawn communicated more openly, improved and grew her 
relationships, and was able to better function at school and work. When 
Dawn turned 21, she aged out of Medicaid dental coverage, as the State 
of Maryland like many other States went many years without covering 
adult dental benefits.\1\ She struggled to find care in the absence of 
having health insurance at the time, and I decided to keep her in my 
practice as a pro bono patient.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ Effective January 1, 2023, dental services are available to all 
adults over the age of 21 who receive full Medicaid benefits in the 
State of Maryland.

    Our collective experience--yours and mine--with our oral health 
care likely looks very different than Dawn's. This means we have a 
responsibility to do more and to do better. While there are many 
actions we can and should take to improve the dental Medicaid benefit, 
I recommend this Subcommittee start with three key actions to better 
support our Nation's children, particularly those served by Medicaid 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and CHIP:

      First, take steps to ensure every child has a dental home no 
later than age 1.
      Second, make sure no child who has significant oral disease and 
needs dental surgery suffers in pain or risks the spread of infection 
due to lack of hospital access or extensive surgical backlogs; and
      Third, consider options for utilizing tax incentives to expand 
the dental workforce to support rural and other underserved 
communities.
                       establishing a dental home
    While we have seen the prevalence of tooth decay nationally 
decrease in the U.S., nearly one in five children under the age of five 
has experienced dental decay. Dental decay IS NOT an equal opportunity 
disease. Children living in poverty are twice as likely to suffer tooth 
decay and two times as likely to go untreated as compared to more 
affluent peers. This disparity is also prominent in the disability 
community. We know that tooth decay compromises the health, 
development, and quality of life of children, affecting such factors as 
eating, sleeping, self-esteem, speech development, and school 
performance.

    The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) and other dental 
and medical professional groups endorse the importance of having the 
child's first visit dental visit on or before age one to establish a 
dental home. The Academy defines a dental home as an ongoing 
relationship between the dentist and a patient, inclusive of all 
aspects of oral health care delivered in a comprehensive, continuously 
accessible, coordinated, and family-centered way.\2\ A dental home 
should be established no later than 12 months of age to help children 
and their families institute a lifetime of good oral health. A dental 
home addresses anticipatory guidance and preventive, acute and 
comprehensive oral health care and includes referrals to dental 
specialists when appropriate. Early dental visits can prevent suffering 
from dental pain and/or disease, reduce dollars spent on future 
surgical and emergency dental services, and maximize the chances for 
children to grow up with healthy, happy smiles. Medicaid's Early and 
Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) benefits for 
children help to increase access to important dental services for 
children.

home, The Reference Manual of Pediatric Dentistry, Chicago, IL:

    Young children are more vulnerable to oral disease and its 
consequences given that they depend on others to receive care. We also 
know that children living in poverty have a higher risk of dental 
decay.\3\ Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic children are almost three 
times more likely to live in poverty than white children. Dental caries 
(decay) prevalence varies with family income. In 2014-2015, 52 percent 
of children and youth aged 2-19 from families living below the Federal 
poverty level had any dental caries experience, compared to 34 percent 
of children from families with income levels greater than 300 percent 
of the Federal poverty level.\4\

    We have an epidemic of dental caries in many of our youngest 
children. Poor diet and low overall health literacy affect these 
disparities. Dentists observe children with diets high in sugar and 
without the benefit of early preventive care, contributing to early

childhood caries.

    Disparities in dental disease exist based on race and ethnicity as 
well. Among children and youth aged 2-19 years, the prevalence of total 
dental caries was highest for Hispanic youth (52 percent) compared with 
Black (44 percent), Asian (43 percent), and White youth (39 percent). 
The prevalence of untreated dental caries was highest among Black 
children (17 percent) compared with Hispanic (14 percent), White (12 
percent), and Asian children (11 percent).\5\ Often times, children 
seen in the emergency room for dental pain attributed to decay are 
predominantly minority children from low-income families.\6\

    To address these disparities and support a dental home for all 
children, Congress must ensure that Medicaid EPSDT advances efforts to 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
promote the dental home concept.

    The Academy also strongly supports efforts that have been led by 
Chairman Cardin through S. 570, the Medicaid Dental Benefits Act of 
2023, to ensure dental care is covered across State Medicaid programs 
for adults. When parents have access to dental benefits and receive 
needed dental care, their children are more likely to also be 
established with a dental provider.\7\

    The Academy also is concerned about the many challenges patients 
with disabilities who are covered by Medicaid experience as they 
transition out of Medicaid as children, and they seek care, 
particularly if the State does not provide an adult dental Medicaid 
benefit. Far too often, pediatric dentists struggle to find a dentist 
to provide ongoing care when a patient ages out, as addressed in the 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
example I provided today.

    The Academy also wishes to highlight additional provisions within 
S. 570 that would support continued dentist participation in the 
Medicaid program to support young children and adult parents alike, 
including Medicaid audit reform for dentists. Audits are necessary to 
identify improper payment and instances of fraud within Medicaid 
programs. Unfortunately, the quality and consistency of auditing 
practices vary greatly between contractors and by State. Although 
audits are a critical part of maintaining program integrity, they are 
most effective when they can make a clear distinction between truly 
fraudulent practices and honest mistakes and can be conducted by 
professional peers familiar with dentistry. Auditing practices failing 
to make this distinction threaten to have a substantial impact on 
children's access to oral health care through a reduction in the number 
of pediatric dentists willing to participate in Medicaid. Nearly 70 
percent of pediatric dentists participate in the Medicaid program 
today, and support for audit reform is sorely needed to ensure dentists 
continue to participate.
            support operating room access for dental surgery
    Given the complex health-care needs of some of patients I have 
described and the need for dental rehabilitation surgery under general 
anesthesia, the most optimal care setting for these surgeries is in an 
operating room.

    The Academy has witnessed a major decrease in operating room access 
for dental procedures over the last decade. The Academy conducted 
surveys of the pediatric dental community,\8\ finding that in a 
majority of States, operating room access for pediatric dentists is a 
persistent problem, and in most States--particularly rural States--it 
can be a severe problem, given fewer access sites and longer scheduling 
delays. Pediatric dentists report that COVID-19 made things far worse 
as hospitals have had to halt elective procedures and then face immense 
backlogs of medical and dental cases. Too often, pediatric and other 
dentists have seen dental cases fall to the very back of the line in 
terms of hospital prioritization as medical procedures are first 
addressed. In most States this access problem, which predominantly 
impacts people with disabilities, has worsened even as the worst of the 
COVID-19 pandemic subsided. Dental patient wait times for operating 
room access can be 6 months to a year or even longer.\9\ For dental 
patients who await treatment, pain management, antibiotics, and 
temporary band-aid-like approaches to management are the only option, 
but not a fair or equitable one. Change is needed to ensure that 
children and adults with disabilities and chronic health conditions are 
not forced to unnecessarily wait to receive treatment in a safe setting 
that can fully meet their needs.

Pediatric Dental Care, AAPD, May 2021, available at https://

    \9\ Ibid.

    The dental community attributed this operating room access 
challenge to the lack of a sustainable billing mechanism for dental 
surgical services in both Medicare and Medicaid. While the dental 
services that are needed are already covered services, the facility 
services to provide care in the operating room are not separately 
recognized or valued for what they include: expertise on staff to 
address emergencies, anesthesia, equipment, medication, recovery 
observation and support, and infection control. The bottom line is that 
dental rehabilitation surgical services for children and adults with 
complex dental needs, until recently, did not have a specific Medicare 
billing code or fair associated reimbursement when these services are 
provided in a hospital. There is also no billing mechanism today to 
allow for additional operating room sites, such as ambulatory surgical 
centers (ASCs), to support and expand access capacity particularly in 
rural and other underserved community. The lack of a viable billing 
mechanism in Medicare also directly impacts the Medicaid program as the 
majority of State Medicaid programs look to Medicare billing codes and 
payment policy as a benchmark for determining Medicaid billing codes 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and payment rates for surgical services.

    I am pleased to inform the subcommittee that the Academy worked 
with the broader dental and disability communities to begin addressing 
this problem with CMS. Following a final Medicare hospital outpatient 
rule issued last year,\10\ beginning in January 2023, CMS established 
an improved Medicare billing and payment system to support hospital 
expenses for dental surgeries, issuing a new billing (CPT) code and 
associating that code with an ambulatory payment classification (APC) 
focused on the cost of dental surgical services.\11\ These important 
reforms should allow for more equitable consideration of dental cases 
in hospitals going forward. Dentists are recommending that State 
Medicaid programs also adopt the billing and payment changes CMS 
established for hospitals, which is a decision up to each individual 
State Medicaid program.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ 87 FR 71748 (November 23, 2022).
    \11\ CMS established CPT G0330 (dental rehabilitative surgery) and 
associates the code with APC 5871 for dental procedures.

    We must now address disparities for people in rural and other 
underserved communities who travel long distances to receive hospital-
based care or where their hospitals are still over capacity and unable 
to accept additional operating room cases. The most viable option is 
for CMS to permit ASCs to provide dental surgeries. We have asked CMS 
to move forward this year to allow dental surgeries to be covered and 
fairly reimbursed in ASCs. In last year's final OPPS rule, CMS stated 
that it would consider this issue for future rulemaking.\12\ I want to 
thank Chairman Cardin and Senator Blackburn for working together this 
year to engage CMS in support of this effort. I encourage all 
subcommittee members to help and encourage CMS to include the new 
dental rehabilitation surgery Medicare code on the ASC Medicare Covered 
Procedures List this year for implementation in January 2024.

    consider how tax incentives can support and expand the dentist 
                               workforce
    To address geographic disparities, we must talk about enhancing the 
dental workforce. Dentistry has long advocated for loan repayment and 
forgiveness options, but these are simply not enough. The average 
student loan debt for a dentist is roughly $300,000.\13\ As faculty 
salaries are significantly less than private practice opportunities, 
there is a disincentive to enter academia.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ Dentists of Tomorrow 2022, American Dental Education 
Association, September 2022, available at https://www.adea.org/
Seniors2022/.

    Congress established and the Health Resources and Services 
Administration (HRSA) administers the Dental Faculty Loan Repayment 
Program (DFLRP). The program may support loan repayment contracts over 
5 years to recruit and retain faculty. Full-time faculty members are 
eligible for repayment of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 percent of their 
student loan balance (principal and interest) for each year of service 
while providing dentistry in an underserved community. The program is 
making an impact in the recruitment of promising new pediatric 
dentistry faculty, but more help is needed to retain additional 
pediatric dental faculty to support expansion of the pediatric dentist 
workforce. Unless the tax code is amended, individual recipients of 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DFLRP must pay income tax on their awards.

    The Academy encourages the subcommittee to consider options to 
strengthen loan repayment support through tax reform policies. As a 
start, to support the DFLRP, Congress could exclude the amount of loan 
forgiveness received from Federal income taxes.

    The Academy recognizes Chairman Cardin for working with the dental 
community on creative tax policies like this and introducing bipartisan 
legislation in prior Congresses to address tax concerns with the DFLRP 
specifically, and we encourage additional efforts to explore tax 
benefits to grow the dental workforce.
                               conclusion
    I thank you again for the opportunity to testify as a private 
practice pediatric dentist and on behalf of the American Academy of 
Pediatric Dentistry. I hope that today is the beginning of an active 
dialogue this congressional session to develop policies, advance needed 
legislation, and implement regulatory reforms that can address the oral 
health disparities faced by too many people in our country.

        Questions Submitted for the Record to Warren Brill, DMD
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
    Question. COVID-19 upended daily life and continues to impact our 
communities and our health-care system today. What are some lessons 
learned from the pandemic about oral health care and access to oral 
health care that the committee should be aware of?

    Answer. Over the course of the pandemic, dental service use among 
children covered by Medicaid and CHIP was down about 20 percent on 
average. Dental services took a greater hit than other primary care 
services, such as vaccinations for children (down about 11 percent). 
Dental service use has not fully recovered since the pandemic.\1\ As of 
2023, children are not yet back to regularly seeing dentists, receiving 
preventive or restorative care they need at the rate they were pre-
pandemic. The mandated closure of my Baltimore-based dental office had 
a negative effect on my patients' oral health in that care could not be 
accessed in a timely fashion. Additionally, many parents did not bring 
their children into the office immediately when we first reopened our 
practice as families were initially unsure of possible exposure to the 
virus, even though we utilized and publicized all ADA and CDC 
recommendations for infection control. It is important to note that the 
dental community has long been a leader in infection prevention and 
control, looking back to the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. While most 
dental offices were mandated by their State authorities to close for at 
least some time during the COVID pandemic in order to preserve personal 
protective equipment (PPE) and control the spread of the virus, 
dentists and their teams were well prepared to maintain a safe 
environment for patients and families. Studies of dental teams early in 
the pandemic indicated low COVID-19 prevalence.\2\ In any future 
pandemic, the AAPD strongly recommends that oral health be deemed an 
essential health service rather than an elective service. Children's 
access to needed oral health care was halted as a result of dentist 
office closures, and children's health suffered greatly as a result, 
and the effects are long-lasting.

    COVID-19 accelerated the adoption and usage of teledentistry. One 
year into the pandemic, three out of four pediatric dentists had 
incorporated teledentistry into their practices to reach more patients 
while minimizing risk of infection.\3\ Dentists put technology to use 
to triage emergencies, efficiently do post-op and follow-up care, 
perform consults, and educate patients. Since the end of the public 
health emergency (PHE), many practices have reduced their reliance on 
teledentistry, especially as coverage and payment has shifted following 
the end of the PHE.

    AAPD views teledentistry as a valuable tool to improve access to 
care for pediatric patients, especially infants, young children, 
adolescents, and individuals with special health-care needs when 
circumstances create barriers to care.\4\ Additionally, the AAPD 
believes teledentistry is useful in addressing time-sensitive injuries 
such as trauma or when unexpected circumstances result in difficulties 
accessing care. However, the AAPD views teledentistry as an excellent 
adjunct to in-office dental care, and believes it does not and cannot 
replace a patient needing or having a true ``dental home'' for 
complete, comprehensive, and ongoing oral health care.

    Question. As States resume redetermining who is eligible for 
Medicaid this Spring, we know that many people will lose their Medicaid 
coverage. Some will lose their coverage even if they are still eligible 
for it just for procedural reasons.

    How will these changes impact access to oral health care?

    Answer. Medicaid ``unwinding'' and the end of continuous 
eligibility has been and will continue to be a concerning period for 
all invested in the health, well-being, and social supports of our most 
vulnerable populations. While complete data on coverage loss is not yet 
available from CMS, the Georgetown University Center for Children and 
Families estimates that 5-7 million children could lose Medicaid or 
CHIP coverage, with the majority of them being improper removals from 
coverage where the family continues to meet eligibility criteria.\5\ 
Without Medicaid (including pediatric dental) and its mandatory 
coverage requirements for children's oral health care through EPSDT, 
families are much less likely to be able to get dental care due to cost 
concerns.

on how to be prepared to support patients and families through this

    Question. Oral health is integral to overall health. Older adults 
and people with disabilities have some of the worst access to oral 
health coverage and oral health care, with particular inequities in 
access for people of color. For example, prior to the pandemic, 7 out 
of 10 Black Medicare beneficiaries and 6 out of 10 Hispanic 
beneficiaries reported they haven't seen a dentist within the past 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
year.

    Can you speak more about how older adults and people with 
disabilities are affected by a lack of affordable or accessible oral 
health coverage, particularly since oral health can impact other 
underlying conditions?

    Answer. The former Surgeon General Koop said it many years ago: 
``You're not healthy without good oral health.''

    Lack of access to oral health care disproportionately harms people 
with disabilities and people of color: 62 percent of Medicare enrollees 
under age 65, 68 percent of Black Medicare enrollees, and 61 percent of 
Hispanic Medicare enrollees did not see a dentist in the last year.\7\ 
People of color and those with disabilities are particularly vulnerable 
to serious health conditions exacerbated by poor oral health, such as 
diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Pediatric dentists often face 
challenges in transitioning patients with disabilities to an adult 
dentist after the age of 18. Unfortunately, many general dentists are 
not comfortable in treating patients with physical or developmental 
disabilities. As a result, many individuals with disabilities are 
forced to seek costly dental services in emergency departments. The 
profession is working to address these serious issues via improved 
education and training in dental schools and in residency programs.

    Most people with disabilities have health coverage through Medicare 
(without a robust dental benefit) or Medicaid (regardless of income 
level).\8\<SUP>,</SUP>\9\ For those who live in States without a 
comprehensive dental benefit, their options for dental care are 
limited. This is one significant reason why the AAPD has endorsed S. 
570, the Dental Medicaid Benefit Act of 2023, and strongly supports 
Senator Cardin's leadership to establish a required adult dental 
Medicaid benefit.\10\ The AAPD encourages Senator Cardin to press on

    \10\ S. 570--Medicaid Dental Benefit Act of 2023, https://
www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/570?.

    Some patients with disabilities are especially vulnerable to dental 
disease because their condition makes in-home preventive care more 
challenging in addition to other medications and medical interventions 
that might have a negative impact on oral health. In cases of severe 
dental disease when a patient may not tolerate care in a routine dental 
setting, comprehensive restorative dental care in a surgical 
environment (i.e., a dental case in a hospital operating room or an 
ambulatory surgical center [ASC]) may be indicated. Unfortunately, 
access to care in these settings has been a significant challenge for 
many years, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals and ASCs 
forgo dental cases due to historically low Medicare and Medicaid 
payment rates for dental surgical services compared to other surgical 
procedures. Fortunately, CMS recently adopted a new Medicare HCPCS code 
for dental rehabilitation; it was applied to hospital settings under 
Medicare in 2023 and is currently being proposed to apply to ASCs 
starting in 2024. However, Congress needs to ensure implementation 
adequately recognizes the services and costs involved in providing such 
care in these settings. Further, CMS should encourage State Medicaid 
programs to adopt this new code and appropriate funding for these 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
services in Medicaid.

    Another area of pressing concern is oral health access and oral 
health disparities in rural communities. Children living in rural 
communities tend to have poorer oral health outcomes than their peers 
living in urban or suburban areas.\11\ Some of the contributing factors 
include dentist and dentist staff (hygienists and assistants) workforce 
shortages and lack of oral health literacy.

    The AAPD supports the Oral Health Literacy and Awareness Act (S. 
403/H.R. 994), which would prioritize oral health promotion and disease 
prevention programs targeting populations with specific oral health 
needs, including low-income individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, 
and individuals with disabilities. The AADP also supports the 
Healthcare Extension and Accessibility for Developmentally Disabled and 
Underserved Population (HEADs Up) Act which aims to expand and enhance 
health-care services, including dental care, for individuals with 
developmental disabilities. The legislation seeks to include 
individuals with developmental disabilities within special medically 
underserved populations, ensuring their specific health-care needs are 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
recognized.

    Additionally, contributing to the lack of access for dental 
services for certain populations is the problem of health plans 
systematically and routinely denying claims and appeals for medically 
necessary procedures related to congenital abnormalities or birth 
defects. These conditions affect how individuals develop, function, or 
look, often for the rest of their lives. Intensive dental and oral care 
for individuals with congenital abnormalities is a standard of care in 
dentistry, and without insurance coverage families bear the burden of 
how to pay for their child's treatment or procedures that are required 
to repair function--and to help kids enjoy happier, healthier 
childhoods.

    Of those 120,000 children born annually in the U.S. with birth 
defects, approximately 40,000 require reconstructive surgery. While 
this legislative effort falls outside the jurisdiction of the Finance 
Committee, the AAPD encourages Congress to reintroduce the Everlasting 
Smiles Act [of 2023] and work to advance and address this issue in this 
Congress.

    Question. At the beginning of this year, Maryland's Medicaid 
program launched a comprehensive adult dental benefit.

    What, if any, lessons have been learned from States that have 
offered or are starting to offer comprehensive dental services to 
adults on Medicaid regarding the effect on health disparities for 
minority or other underserved populations at greatest risk of lack of 
access to oral health care?

    Answer. The financial lesson learned is that for a small cost to 
the State for dental care, a large financial savings will result when 
the proper dental therapeutic treatment is provided. Access to covered 
oral health care relieves a person of pain and suffering.

    Medicaid adult coverage for comprehensive dental care is an 
absolute necessity in the U.S. As pediatric providers, we are supremely 
aware of the impact coverage has on parent/caregiver employability, 
family-wide access to services, and a person's lifetime development. 
Adults who have coverage have better job prospects and are better able 
to retain their jobs.\12\ Children whose parents have dental coverage 
are more likely to be established with a dental home themselves.\13\ 
When children have dental coverage, they tend to perform better in 
school, attain higher-paying jobs, and have better overall health as 
adults.\14\

                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
    Question. The oral health-care workforce is one of the first stops 
in reducing barriers to oral health care. As we heard during the 
hearing, there are many existing gaps in the dental workforce that 
contribute to some of the racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities 
that we see in access to care. While the oral health workforce has 
become increasingly diverse, there are still opportunities to achieve 
greater recruitment of minority oral health professionals. Regardless 
of insurance status, in 2019 non-Hispanic Black (26.4 percent) and 
Hispanic (25.3 percent) individuals were less likely to have had a 
medical and dental visit within the year than non-Hispanic White 
individuals (43.3 percent). In addition, individuals in rural 
communities have lower rates of dental care utilization, higher rates 
of dental caries, and fewer dentists per capita when compared to 
individuals in urban communities. Rural seniors are also less likely to 
have visited a dentist in the past year and rural children are less 
likely to receive preventive dental care than their urban counterparts.

    What are the existing barriers to achieving a diverse oral health 
care workforce?

    Answer. The HRSA title VII pediatric dentistry residency program 
recruits dentists from a pool of candidates limited to college 
graduates who have also completed dental school (usually an additional 
4 years); the demographics of this group do not match that of the 
general population.

    Question. How can Congress work towards better incentivizing a more 
diverse oral health-care workforce?

    Answer. In response to the challenges noted above, Congress has 
invested in HRSA title VII primary care oral health programs, which 
have supported expansion, improvement, and diversification of pediatric 
dental residency training. This program allows for residents to treat 
patients in community-based settings outside of a dental school clinic 
or hospital and gain an appreciation for the access challenges due to 
social determinants of health. While outside of the Finance Committee's 
jurisdiction, we ask that Senators maintain their support for the title 
VII pediatric dental residency training program.

    The HRSA title VII program also supports dental faculty loan 
repayment, which is important to recruiting and retaining pediatric 
dental faculty (as dental graduates faces tremendously high student 
loan debt). This helps ensure diverse faculty mentors are in place to 
support diverse trainees. To make this program even more effective, 
Congress should act on legislation introduced in the last Congress by 
Senators Cardin and Wicker to make such repayments non-taxable to 
faculty recipients.\15\

            Prepared Statement of Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin, 
                      a U.S. Senator From Maryland
    Let me welcome everyone to the first meeting of the Subcommittee on 
Health Care of the Senate Finance Committee of this Congress. I want to 
thank Senator Wyden and Senator Crapo for their cooperation in the 
establishment of the subcommittee, and our ability to hold hearings.

    Senator Daines, I want to thank you for your help and cooperation. 
I look forward to working with you. We have, obviously, a very 
important agenda, and I hope that the subcommittee will be able to do 
some oversight as to some of the issues that are pretty pressing in our 
health-care system, during this Congress. I look forward to working 
with you, and I am very pleased that Senator Stabenow is here. Senator 
Stabenow has been one of the great leaders on health care in the United 
States Senate, and she served with great distinction as chair of this 
subcommittee. So, I thank her for her help. I know of no subject that 
she has been more active in than on oral health care. She's been one of 
our great leaders in this area of oral health care.

    So, today's subject is the oral health-care crisis: the need to 
address disparities. Disparities in our health-care system are well 
documented--and the impact they have in regards to vulnerable 
communities. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we elevated 
the Institute for Minority Health and Health Disparities as a full 
institute under the NIH, and they have documented the disparities based 
upon income: lower-income communities do not have the same health-care 
providers in their communities as we see in other communities. They've 
documented it in rural America, where again there are not as many 
health-care providers. We've documented disparities based on race and 
ethnicity, because again, there are not as many providers in regards to 
the workforce. So we have documented a lot of the reasons for 
disparities in our health-care system, and they are very prevalent, the 
disparities, as it relates to oral health care.

    It really came home to me when I was first elected to the United 
States Senate in 2007. Many have heard me talk about Deamonte Driver, 
but I will mention him one more time. Deamonte Driver was a 12-year-old 
who lived in Prince George's County, MD, about 7 miles from here. He 
had a tooth problem. His mom tried to get him help but could not find a 
dentist to take care of his needs. She tried several times but was 
unable to get any help. She fell through the cracks; she wasn't in the 
Medicaid system at the time; there were some eligibility issues; she 
didn't have any reimbursement. Deamonte ultimately became very sick and 
was rushed to the hospital; he had an impacted tooth. He went through 
two operations, and what would have initially cost $80 for a tooth 
extraction ended up costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, and 
tragically Deamonte Driver lost his life. So that really struck home: a 
person in the community that I represented, that we could have that 
kind of outcome. It led to some changes in health-care policy. Working 
with Senator Stabenow, working with my dear friend Elijah Cummings in 
the House, we were able to extend pediatric dental, under both the CHIP 
program and the Affordable Care Act program, so we were able to make 
some progress, but there are still many gaps today.

    Oral health is integral to overall health and well-being. It can 
make worse an underlying health condition, impacting overall health-
care costs. It can impact a person's ability to get a job and be well 
enough to work. It can impact a person's ability to go to school, 
impacting the local and national economy. It can impact a person's 
confidence and ability to enjoy life, or communicate effectively, 
affecting communities and society overall. Despite the importance of 
oral health, millions of people in the United States are not getting 
the care they need.

    Former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher said more than 20 years 
ago that ``you cannot be healthy without oral health.'' Certainly, we 
have made progress in improving oral health for children since then, 
especially for vulnerable children. But for working-age adults and 
seniors, disparities in oral health outcomes and in access to dental 
care have widened by income and race. Treating dental care as essential 
in U.S. health policy--for all ages, not just children--is the only way 
to address these disparities.

    The oral health crisis is costly, and taxpayers are paying for it: 
through worse outcomes for people with diabetes or heart disease, worse 
pregnancy outcomes, and through emergency room visits. We are paying 
more in our health-care system as a result of these disparities. One 
study found that the U.S. could save $22.8 billion annually by 
improving oral health care.

    This is not a partisan issue. During the Trump administration, the 
U.S. Surgeon General and NIH began working on the report that became 
``Oral Health in America: Advances and Challenges,'' which was released 
by the Biden administration in 2021. This was a follow-up to the 
landmark report from 2000, ``Oral Health in America: A Report of the 
Surgeon General,'' which provided a comprehensive look at the 
importance of oral health and the disparities in the United States.

    I have been pleased to work with the Biden administration to 
advance a number of oral health priorities, including the historic 
appointment of Dr. Natalia Chalmers to be the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services' Chief Dental Officer. That position lay vacant for 
many years. We finally got it filled, and we are very pleased that we 
have that position, in order to put a focus within HHS on oral health 
care.

    And at the beginning of this year, Maryland Medicaid began covering 
adults. However, 16 percent of Maryland residents over 65 years of age 
and older--approximately 626,000 people in my State--and more than 70 
percent of seniors in Maryland do not have dental insurance. We have 
gaps that we need to deal with.

    To echo former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, ``there is no 
health without oral health.'' Adequate access to oral health is 
essential to preventing tragedies like the passing of Deamonte Driver 
from ever happening again. I hope we can work together to try to narrow 
the disparity gaps that we have and find ways we can deal with the 
health-care crisis.

                                 ______
                                 
               Prepared Statement of Hon. Steve Daines, 
                      a U.S. Senator From Montana
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm glad to be with you hosting our first 
subcommittee hearing of this Congress.

    It is also a real pleasure to be joined today by Mr. Jon Forte from 
RiverStone Health in Billings, MT. We'll have a more formal 
introduction shortly, but thank you for being here, Jon. Glad you're 
with us.

    Oral health care is critically important--both for its own sake, 
and in relation to our overall health and well-being. A number of 
conditions can be associated with oral health implications, including 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. 
There are also studies indicating links between mental health and oral 
health, as some of the first signs of mental health stressors can 
manifest in the mouth.

    As we continue to look for holistic approaches to caring for the 
mind and the body, oral health has a distinctive role to play. Over the 
years, there has been much bipartisan success in providing access to 
dental health care, such as through the Children's Health Insurance 
Program and Medicare Advantage. I am proud of these accomplishments and 
what these programs have achieved, but there are still some challenges 
to be addressed.

    When we consider disparities in access to oral health care, perhaps 
the greatest barrier for Montanans and Americans in rural States is 
geography. In Montana, people often have to drive great distances to 
receive any kind of health care, especially to see a dentist or dental 
specialist. In part, this is because of how large Montana and the West 
are, but also because of the significant shortages we are experiencing 
in the health-care workforce--shortages which are disproportionately 
felt in more rural areas of the country.

    Just earlier this month, I sat down with members of the Montana 
Dental Association, and their number one concern was workforce, 
subsequently followed by housing. Housing is a top issue for their 
staff members and dental care teams--one provider shared that he had 
never heard his team talk so much about affording a place to live.

    Another concern is the mental health of our dental community. We 
are all aware of the mental health crisis in our country today and, of 
course, our health-care professionals are not immune from experiencing 
this crisis themselves--especially in Montana, where suicide is sadly 
taking too many lives.

    Like physicians, the dental profession is linked to high levels of 
stress, depression, anxiety, and burnout--and dentists can have 
additionally distinct challenges as both providers and small business 
owners. The COVID pandemic exacerbated these struggles, contributing to 
the workforce shortages we are experiencing today as we move beyond the 
pandemic.

    It is my priority to ensure that our dental providers, and all who 
serve in our health-care workforce, have the resources they need to 
care for their mental wellness. These hardships are realities for 
Montanans and health-care professionals across the country, and it 
serves as a reminder that we must also think about holistic solutions 
to these problems.

    I also want to highlight one of the most important approaches to 
facilitating comprehensive, integrated health care, and that is through 
the work of our community health centers. Our health centers serve as 
points of care for millions of patients across the country, many of 
whom are uninsured, living in poverty, and located in rural 
communities. The number of community health centers that offer dental 
services has grown by 60 percent in the last 10 years, and in Montana, 
we are fortunate to have 93 percent of our health centers offering 
dental services onsite.

    I'm grateful for all the work our health centers do to provide 
access to dental care and address disparities throughout Montana and 
the country.

    I want to acknowledge Chairman Cardin's long-time leadership on 
this particular area of health care, and also thank the witnesses for 
being here today and offering their expertise on the subject.

    I'm looking forward to our discussion today.

    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                                 ______
                                 
  Prepared Statement of Cherae Farmer-Dixon, D.D.S., MSPH, MBA, FACD, 
 FICD, Dean and Professor, School of Dentistry, Meharry Medical College
    There has been significant progress in the improvement of general 
health and well-being of the United States population over the past 
century.\1\<SUP>-</SUP>\9\ Due to this, most Americans are living 
longer and healthier lives. Mortality rates have been reduced as health 
care continues to improve.

    In this time, there have been significant breakthroughs in 
diagnosis and treatment of oral diseases.\10\ These oral health 
innovations help most Americans live better lives; however, not all 
have benefited. While we have made great progress, it has not been 
equitable.

    Many Americans still experience chronic and treatable pain and 
illness with complications that devastate overall health, well-being, 
and have considerable financial and social ramifications. The silent 
epidemic of oral diseases affects our most vulnerable populations: poor 
children, the elderly, and members of racial and ethnic minority 
groups.\11\

    Oral health and disease are associated with cardiovascular disease, 
immune disorders, microbial infections and cancers. New research points 
to the associations between chronic oral infections and heart and lung 
diseases, stroke, low-birth weight and premature births. Associations 
between periodontal (gum) disease and diabetes have also long been 
noted.\12\<SUP>,</SUP> \13\
                        oral health disparities
    Dental maladies exist across the lifespan and disproportionately 
effect vulnerable populations. There are common dental anomalies found 
in infants, children, adolescents, pregnant women and the elderly. 
Caries (cavities) continue to be one of the most common chronic 
diseases in U.S. children. When left untreated, pain and infection can 
develop and lead to more oral health issues. Gum disease and tooth loss 
disproportionately impact the overall health of minority populations.

    Pregnant women with poor oral health are more likely to deliver 
infants with low birth weights. Infants experience poor oral health and 
preventable diseases, like baby bottle cavities, due to lack of 
knowledge, limited access to care, and inadequate resources. Children 
with poor oral health miss more school and receive lower grades.\14\ 
Research shows that 17 percent of children, aged 2 to 5 years old, 
living in low-income households have untreated cavities--three times 
the amount found in children from higher-income households.\15\ 
Childhood oral health issues persist throughout adolescence and into 
adulthood when left untreated.

    Hormonal changes during puberty and adolescence may in some cases 
attribute to an increased incidence of cavities and gum disease. In 
children ages 12 to 19, 23 percent of children from low-income families 
have untreated cavities twice that of children from higher-income 
households.\15\

    The adult population is living longer and many experience oral 
health problems such as tooth decay, tooth loss, gum disease, 
xerostomia (dry mouth), chronic disease, oral cancer and pre-cancer 
conditions. These problems may cause pain, issues with chewing and 
eating and difficulty with smiling and communication, as well as have 
an impact on the lifespan.\13\ Among working-age U.S. adults, over 40 
percent of low-income and non-Hispanic Black adults have untreated 
tooth decay.\16\ Adults with less than a high school education are 
almost three times as likely to have untreated cavities as adults with 
at least some college education.\15\ About 40 percent of adults with 
low-income or no private health insurance have untreated cavities. Low-
income or uninsured adults are twice as likely to have one to three 
untreated cavities and three times as likely to have four or more 
untreated cavities as adults with higher incomes or private 
insurance.\16\

    Most of us will experience dental disease, especially as we age. 
Nearly all adults (96 percent) aged 65 years or older have had a 
cavity; and one in five have untreated tooth decay.\13\<SUP>,</SUP> 
\17\ Total tooth loss is experienced in nearly one in five adults aged 
65 or older. Complete tooth loss is twice as prevalent among adults 
aged 75 and older (26 percent) compared with adults aged 65-74 (13 
percent).\13\<SUP>,</SUP> \17\ A high percentage of older adults have 
gum disease. About two in three, or 68 percent, of adults aged 65 years 
or older have gum disease.\13\<SUP>,</SUP> \18\ The prevalence of 
disease, however, varies vastly among race and ethnic groups. For 
example, 46 percent of African American adults have decay as compared 
to 27 percent of adults nationwide.\13\<SUP>,</SUP> \19\
                             access to care
    Low-income populations, across all ages, experience the lowest 
access to oral health care.\20\ The 2020 National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) report, ``Oral Health in America: Advances and Challenges,'' 
generated a call to action by the National Institute of Dental and 
Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) director, the National Institutes of 
Health director, and the U.S. Surgeon General to ensure oral health for 
all.\2\<SUP>,</SUP> \21\

    The newly issued report provides a comprehensive snapshot of oral 
health in America, including an examination of oral health across the 
lifespan and a look at the impact the issue has on communities and the 
economy. Major take-aways from the report include:

          Group disparities pertaining to oral health, identified 20 
        years ago, have not been adequately addressed. Greater efforts 
        are needed to tackle the social determinants that create these 
        inequities and the systemic biases that perpetuate them.
          Healthy behaviors can improve and maintain oral health, but 
        these behaviors are influenced by social and economic 
        conditions.
          Oral and medical conditions often share common risk factors. 
        Oral health treatment can improve other health conditions and 
        individual health overall.
          Substance misuse and mental health conditions negatively 
        affect the oral health of many.\22\

    The Healthy People 2020 Report demonstrated that oral health is 
essential to our overall health. The report also highlighted that those 
who need dental care are the least likely to have access. These 
individuals disproportionately are low-income, live in poverty, and are 
most likely representative of minority populations. Many reside in 
geographically isolated areas with reduced access to dentists and 
Medicaid providers.\23\ Rural areas often have inadequate public 
transportation systems, barring many from access to 
dentists.\23\<SUP>,</SUP> \24\ Rural populations also have a higher 
prevalence of cavities and tooth loss and a lower degree of private 
dental insurance combined with limited access to public dental 
services.\25\<SUP>,</SUP> \26\ As a result, those who need dental care 
the most are the least likely to receive it.\20\
                            dental workforce
    The U.S. population continues to diversify with increases in the 
Hispanic and Asian populations, while Black population remains stable. 
This trend is predicted to continue along with other population 
demographics over the next 20 years. The current dental workforce does 
not reflect the diversity that is demonstrated throughout the United 
States. Blacks make up an estimated 12.4 percent of the U.S. 
population, and approximately only 4 percent of the dental workforce. 
Hispanics make up an estimated 18 percent of the U.S. population and 
approximately 6 percent of the dental workforce. The dentist workforce 
consistently skews more Asian and White and is underrepresented 
significantly by Hispanic and Black dentists \27\ (Figure 1).

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2923.001


    .epsGreater diversity in the dental workforce is necessary to 
effectively address the needs of the population. The Health Resources 
and Services Administration (HRSA) estimates that there is a current 
shortage of 10,877 dentists in the United States.\28\ Several dental 
schools that have opened in recent years cite insufficient supply of 
dentists as a key reason as to why the U.S. needs more dental school 
graduates.\29\<SUP>,</SUP> \30\<SUP>,</SUP> \31\ These dental school 
expansions, however, have yet to demonstrate a significant increase in 
producing minority dentists.

    Twenty-seven percent of the practicing African American dentists in 
the U.S. are graduates of Meharry Medical College. The burden of 
increasing diversity cannot rest solely on the two HBCU dental schools 
(Meharry and Howard). There must be continued intentional efforts 
within the dental education that includes collaboration with schools at 
all levels, beginning in Pre-K and Kindergarten as well as working with 
community organizations, churches, health care and other professional 
organizations and corporations. There must be a concerted group effort 
to make a significant impact.

    A recent report by the Oral Health Workforce Research Center found 
that ``improving the racial and ethnic diversity of the nation's 
dentists is critical in efforts to reduce disparities in access to care 
and health outcomes and to better address the oral health needs of an 
increasingly diverse U.S. population.'' Research shows that patients 
are more comfortable receiving care from a provider of their own race.

    Studies have also determined that non-white dentists care for a 
disproportionate number of at-risk patients in minority and underserved 
communities. Researchers have found that 53 percent of clinically 
active Black dentists reported primarily treating underserved patients 
at their primary practice, and another study concluded that ``the 
Hispanic/Latino (H/L) dentist workforce is a critical component of our 
dental delivery system and is shown to contribute to improved access 
for H/L populations and underserved populations.''\32\

    Increasing racial diversity within the oral health care workforce 
is therefore imperative for eliminating access barriers, increasing 
utilization, and improving outcomes.

    Strategies to improve and help eliminate oral health disparities 
collectively include:

        1.  Improving access to care through incentives for rural and 
        inner-city workspaces;
        2.  Increasing the diversity of the workforce;
        3.  Greater interprofessional training and collaboration; and
        4.  Support of federal programs that increase maintain and/or 
        enhance programs that impact health care delivery such as loan 
        repayment programs and federal renumeration.

    If we want to adequately combat and eliminate oral health 
disparities, we must meet communities where they are.

      Questions Submitted for the Record to Cherae Farmer-Dixon, 
                     D.D.S., MSPH, MBA, FACD, FICD
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
    Question. COVID-19 upended daily life and continues to impact our 
communities and our health-care system today. What are some lessons 
learned from the pandemic about oral health care and access to oral 
health care that the committee should be aware of?

    Answer. The pandemic highlighted disparities in oral health care 
and the lack but need for striving to achieve health equity. Lessons 
learned include the following:

          Dental office limitations.--Limitations of the dental office 
        to accommodate infections created by air-borne pathogens 
        resulted in many being closed and providing only emergency 
        services. Persons with limited or no access to care suffered 
        the greatest burden. Furthermore, there was a greater negative 
        impact on the oral status of individuals who are already the 
        most vulnerable: poor and underserved communities as well as 
        uninsured individuals. This created the opportunity to expand 
        safety measures for dental offices as a result of the increased 
        risks with air-borne pathogens. Air filtration devices and 
        filtration mechanisms were incorporated to increase safety and 
        decrease risks.

           The pandemic also created the opportunity to examine the 
        control and regulatory limitations placed on oral health 
        practitioners and dental offices so that they could reopen.

          Immunizations with dentists/oral health care 
        professionals.--There was a greater need for immunizations/
        vaccines. Licensed dentists can and should be authorized 
        universally to give certain immunizations, thus creating more 
        opportunities for them to have a greater role in vaccines and 
        infection control as well as serve as an additional resource to 
        offer health guidance to the population.

          An increased need for diversity in the oral health-care 
        workforce.--There is a need to increase diversity in the 
        workforce and therefore to focus on initiatives that will 
        support and have the potential to achieve these outcomes. 
        Studies have demonstrated that there are better health outcomes 
        in communities where populations have individuals who look like 
        them. Pipeline programs such as the Health Career Opportunity 
        Program (HCOP) that is offered through the Health Resources and 
        Services Administration have been a great vehicle for 
        introducing, recruiting, and increasing the number of minority 
        oral health care professionals. In addition, financial 
        resources through the National Health Service Corp as well as 
        title VII funding initiatives such as the Faculty Loan 
        Repayment Program have also served as vehicles to recruit and 
        retain individuals in underserved areas. These programs help to 
        offset some of the loan indebtedness associated with dental 
        education which averages around $350,000. This does not include 
        debt that individuals also have accumulated from their 
        undergraduate training.

          Increased Medicaid renumeration to attract more providers.--
        Many dentists do not choose to participate in Medicaid or 
        Medicare programs because the renumeration rate is 
        significantly lower than traditional insurances. With the high 
        costs of dental overhead as well as loan indebtedness, it 
        creates a financial burden and makes it less attractive to 
        become a provider. This creates an opportunity to increase the 
        renumeration for Medicaid and Medicare, making it more 
        attractive and amenable for dentists to participate.

          A need for adult dental coverage in all States along with 
        the understanding of how critical oral health is to overall 
        health.--Many populations can not afford private dental 
        insurance. In addition, they may be eligible and have Medicaid 
        and/or Medicare. However, if their State does not offer adult 
        dental coverage, this negatively impacts their ability to 
        afford dental treatment, resulting in no care or limited care 
        for emergencies only. These emergencies typically result in 
        loss of teeth. Furthermore, conditions can be exacerbated in 
        patients with other underlying health issues such as diabetes 
        and/or heart disease. Well documented data has shown 
        correlations between oral conditions such as periodontal 
        disease and heart disease, diabetes and Alzheimer's. Therefore, 
        there is a greater need for oral health care to be engrained 
        more in discussion and treatment of overall health care through 
        interprofessional collaboration (medical, dental, social work, 
        allied health, etc.) for improved overall health outcomes.

    Question. As States resume redetermining who is eligible for 
Medicaid this Spring, we know that many people will lose their Medicaid 
coverage. Some will lose their coverage even if they are still eligible 
for procedural reasons.

    How will these changes impact access to oral health care?

    Answer. Individuals who will lose coverage will no longer have 
access to receive routine oral health care. Individuals who are 
traditionally Medicaid recipients cannot afford the out-of-pocket costs 
of routine dental care, even when it is at a reduced cost such as 
through services provided at some Federally Qualified Health Centers 
and State health departments. In addition, if these individuals have 
underlying conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, their oral 
health condition can be compromised. When services are sought, it is 
typically for emergency care, usually resulting in extractions to 
eliminate pain.

    Routine care is essential to maintain a healthy oral cavity and aid 
in eliminating potential dental disease. Data has demonstrated that 
there is an association between oral and systemic health. Furthermore, 
disease that is present in the mouth has been correlated with 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. The lack of Medicaid 
coverage for routine care can essentially result in sicker patients 
causing increased costs in medical care that will potentially be 
needed.

    Question. Oral health is integral to overall health. Older adults 
and people with disabilities have some of the worst access to oral 
health coverage and oral health care, with particular inequities in 
access for people of color. For example, prior to the pandemic, 7 out 
of 10 Black Medicare beneficiaries and 6 out of 10 Hispanic 
beneficiaries reported they haven't seen a dentist within the past 
year.

    Can you speak more about how older adults and people with 
disabilities are affected by a lack of affordable or accessible oral 
health coverage, particularly since oral health can impact other 
underlying conditions?

    Answer. Medicare does not cover routine dental care and covers only 
limited care for people with disabilities. A large percentage of these 
individuals do not have separate and/or private dental insurance that 
would cover some of the dental expenses. As a result, they are unable 
to afford dental coverage and go without and only seek care on an 
emergency basis.

    In cases where there is limited coverage such as in people with 
disabilities, the challenge of accessibility exists as a result of the 
unavailability or limited availability of providers who will accept 
their Medicare coverage. There have been instances, particularly in 
rural and remote areas, where individuals have to travel as far as 60-
100 miles to seek treatment from a provider who will accept the low 
Medicare reimbursement rate.

    Medicare renumeration is less than traditional insurance 
reimbursement for the same dental service. For various reasons, some 
practitioners choose not to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs, resulting in limited access to care for those patients who 
may have benefits through these government agencies.

    Question. At the beginning of this year, Maryland's Medicaid 
program launched a comprehensive adult dental benefit.

    What, if any, lessons have been learned from States that have 
offered or are starting to offer comprehensive dental services to 
adults on Medicaid regarding the effect on health disparities for 
minority or other underserved populations at greatest risk of lack of 
access to oral health care?

    Answer. Medicaid expansion to include comprehensive dental care for 
adults provides increased affordability of dental care for populations 
who are some of the most vulnerable. Low income populations and people 
of color have higher incidences of caries as underlying conditions such 
as heart disease, diabetes, etc. More importantly, they are routinely 
the individuals who are most in need of care and have the least access 
to care.

    Comprehensive dental services for adults will serve to decrease the 
health disparities gap for minority and other underserved populations 
by providing them access to care and affordability of care.

                                 ______
                                 
                 Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
    Question. The oral health-care workforce is one of the first stops 
in reducing barriers to oral health care. As we heard during the 
hearing, there are many existing gaps in the dental workforce that 
contribute to some of the racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities 
that we see in access to care. While the oral health workforce has 
become increasingly diverse, there are still opportunities to achieve 
greater recruitment of minority oral health professionals. Regardless 
of insurance status, in 2019 non-Hispanic Black (26.4 percent) and 
Hispanic (25.3 percent) individuals were less likely to have had a 
medical and dental visit within the year than non-Hispanic White 
individuals (43.3 percent). In addition, individuals in rural 
communities have lower rates of dental care utilization, higher rates 
of dental caries, and fewer dentists per capita when compared to 
individuals in urban communities. Rural seniors are also less likely to 
have visited a dentist in the past year and rural children are less 
likely to receive preventive dental care than their urban counterparts.

    What are the existing barriers to achieving a diverse oral health-
care workforce?

    Answer. Several underlying issues barricade the diversification of 
the dental workforce; however, limited awareness, lack of minority 
recruitment, and high costs of dental education stand at the forefront 
of this uphill battle. Inadequate acknowledgment of oral health care 
career opportunities and insufficient support for ``pipeline programs'' 
deprive racial minorities of vital preparatory information. The 
implementation of pipeline programs directly influences access to 
mentorships, scholarships, externships, and several other 
opportunities. Placing increased funding in these foundational 
initiatives with a continued focus on underrepresented communities will 
help attract the next generation of students to oral health care 
education and dental careers. Pipeline programs, such as the HCOP has a 
longstanding track record of serving as an effective minority 
recruitment tool and assisting in increasing diversity. On a personal 
note, I was introduced to dentistry when I participated in a summer 
HCOP program for high school students. As a result of that program, I 
knew that I wanted to be a dentist and continued on that quest which 
led to me not only becoming a dentist, but serving as a dental educator 
and dean of a dental school. Furthermore, the strategic revitalization 
of dental school recruitment, would proactively reach more diverse 
pools of applicants and create dental classes that represent the 
populations that they will serve. This revitalization should include 
the execution of small changes like intentionally diversifying staff 
and faculty, integrating intercultural competency into the dental 
curriculum, and increasing financial assistance and scholarship 
opportunities. Thus, making dental schools appear more accessible and 
achievable for potential applicants.

    Question. How can Congress work towards better incentivizing a more 
diverse oral health-care workforce?

    Answer. Congress would make the biggest impact by not only 
continuing to invest in targeted pipeline programs and retention 
programs but by also increasing funding. Increased funding of the 
National Health Service Corp to support students while in dental school 
and post-graduation would help to offset the costs while guaranteeing a 
commitment to practice in some of the most vulnerable communities where 
there is the greatest need--rural and inner-city communities.

    Increased funding of the Health Careers Opportunity Program that is 
authorized through the Public Health Service Act will serve to expand 
programs that serve to introduce minorities and others from 
disadvantaged backgrounds to health careers. HCOPs provide mentoring, 
support, and internships in an effort to not only spark their interest 
but lead them into dental careers, thus diversifying the oral health-
care workforce. According to workforce data, an additional 11,000 
dentists are needed to serve the population. By providing affordable 
training, academic enrichment programs, and virtual mentorship and 
internship programs, student engagement would be consistent throughout 
their academic careers. Also, creating financial investments, like paid 
internships and accelerated programs to try to ease the monetary 
burden. Moreover, investing in the surrounding communities of 
institutions to encourage local recruitment and increase opportunity 
accessibility.

         Prepared Statement of Jonathan P. Forte, MHA, FACHE, 
                  President and CEO, RiverStone Health
                      introduction and background
    Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, and members of the 
committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on such a critical 
issue. My name is Jonathan Forte, and I am the president and CEO at 
RiverStone Health in Billings, MT. For over 40 years, health, 
education, leadership, and protection (HELP) have been the foundation 
of our work.

    In our role as the Yellowstone City-County Health Department, we 
lead public health efforts to protect safety and well-being, as the 
largest health department in Montana's largest city. We were also one 
of the first 50 health departments in the Nation to receive Public 
Health Accreditation. Our Federally Qualified Health Center serves more 
than 14,000 patients a year, in eight locations across Yellowstone and 
Carbon Counties. As one of the first Teaching Health Center's in the 
Nation, we provide high-quality, affordable care to all, regardless of 
anyone's ability to pay.

    Today, I will share my perspective, acquired in various health-care 
management roles within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), as a 
Community Health Center executive and as a public health professional. 
My career began in Scranton, PA and has always focused on serving 
underresourced and marginalized populations across Maryland, West 
Virginia, Washington, DC, North Carolina, and now Montana. Equitable 
access to oral health care is not simply a rural problem, or an urban 
problem, it's an American problem impacting families no matter where 
they live.

    My testimony will reflect the experiences of our patients and oral 
health-care professionals, who serve them, as well as three key 
elements I believe are essential to providing equitable access to care 
and alleviating our Nation's oral health crisis:

        1.  Developing collaborative partnerships and centers of 
        innovation for workforce development, focused on supplying the 
        next generation of oral health professionals.
        2.  Using lessons learned from America's Community Health 
        Centers to support and incentivize fully integrated and 
        equitable models for oral health delivery.
        3.  Expanding utilization of mobile health to meet patients 
        where they are, delivering care beyond the four walls of 
        traditional dental offices and infrastructure.

    RiverStone Health is one of 1,400 Community Health Center 
organizations across 14,000 rural and urban communities, serving over 
30 million Americans. Health centers are medical and dental homes for 
people of all ages and walks of life--newborns, seniors, the unhoused, 
veterans, and agricultural workers. Health centers are problem-solvers, 
and protectors of public health. We provide equitable access to quality 
health-care services that individuals would otherwise find unaffordable 
and unattainable. We look beyond the patient's chart for answers that 
not only prevent illness but address the environmental and social 
factors that can make people sick--lack of nutrition, exercise, 
homelessness, mental health, and addiction.

    Montana's 14 Community Health Centers (CHCs) serve 120,000 patients 
annually, 1 of every 10 Montanans. We operate in one of the largest 
States with a vast geography and just over a million people.

    At RiverStone Health, dental visits account for one quarter of all 
patient encounters. Unfortunately, 34 percent of those dental visits 
are for emergency care only, meaning a patient is in pain and needs 
immediate attention to address infection and/or extract a tooth. The 
majority of our CHC dental patients have incomes less than $60,000/year 
for a family of four.

    Limited services in rural areas require patients to travel to 
larger communities for oral health care, but the issue is compounded by 
a lack of resources everywhere, including the larger communities. In 
Montana, many private dentists don't perform extractions and many of 
our patients can't readily access oral surgery centers scattered 
throughout the State. While Montana's Medicaid expansion in 2016 led to 
a 28-percent increase in access to dental care, almost 80 percent of 
Montana counties are designated as oral health professional shortage 
areas.

    Veterans comprise 10 percent of Montana's population, and many 
veterans suffer due to a lack of oral health access. Only 7 percent of 
veterans are currently eligible for VA dental care. When the VA MISSION 
Act of 2018 authorized the VET-Smile program, five of the initial eight 
dental programs chosen to participate in this pilot program were 
Federally Qualified Health Centers.

    RiverStone Health's dental program treats almost 1,000 veterans 
annually, many of whom are still not eligible for care through VA 
programs. If the VET-smile program and veteran eligibility requirements 
were expanded, Community Health Centers would continue answering the 
call and partnering with VA to enhance access for veteran dental care 
across the U.S.

    Montana is home to seven federally recognized Tribal communities. 
The prevalence of tooth decay among Native children is significantly 
higher than White children--84.0 percent compared to 57.4 percent--and 
the life span of Native individuals is almost 20 years shorter. 
Montana's Community Health Centers continually work to build trusted 
relationships with Tribal partners to recognize and remove barriers to 
care, while providing culturally competent and equitable health 
services to their communities.

    In providing access to affordable care for people least likely to 
have it, Community Health Centers significantly reduce unnecessary 
hospitalizations and ER visits and costs to the American taxpayer. With 
all the challenges already discussed, Montana's average dental cost per 
patient is very close to the national average of $655.
                               discussion
    Community Health Centers are essential to solving our Nation's oral 
health crisis, and here's why: America's Community Health Centers 
develop collaborative partnerships and serve as centers of innovation 
for workforce development, supplying the next generation of oral health 
professionals.

    In many small Montana towns across our northern border with Canada, 
Community Health Centers are often the only access point for oral 
health care. Due to a lack of access throughout our region, RiverStone 
Health sees patients from all around Montana, Central Wyoming, and the 
Dakotas, with patients frequently driving over 500 miles round-trip to 
visit a dentist.

    RiverStone Health's Dental Director, Joey Verlanic, honestly 
believes she could see patients 24-7-365 and still have patients to see 
years later, due to the overwhelming need for oral health care across 
our region.

    Community Health Centers and private dental offices in rural and 
frontier areas are frequently challenged to recruit oral health 
professionals including dentists, dental hygienists, and dental 
assistants. Recruitment for dentists in many frontier communities can 
take 2 years or more. Recently, a health center in Bozeman was unable 
to retain a qualified dentist, not because of a lack of candidates, but 
because housing, even for someone with a strong, professional salary, 
was unattainable. A lack of staff creates bottlenecks to access and 
simply compounds the crisis.

    We continue innovating and finding new ways to develop our oral 
health workforce. RiverStone works with Montana's only two accredited 
Dental Assisting (DA) programs at Great Falls College--MSU and Salish 
Kootenai College. We also created a new, on the job training program 
within the dental clinic. The Montana Primary Care Association (MTPCA) 
and member health centers provide scholarships for dental assistants 
and other students interested in completing a DA program after 
committing to employment. Great Falls--MSU also operates the only 
accredited dental hygienist program in Montana, presenting supply 
challenges and decreasing our ability to develop qualified oral health 
support staff. RiverStone Health provides the same scholarship program 
to hygiene students to encourage entry into this rewarding dental 
career.

    The lack of dental schools in Montana, North and South Dakota, 
Idaho, and Wyoming adds to workforce development challenges and leads 
to competition for out-of-State dental students. Continuing to 
innovate, RiverStone Health hosts 2nd- and 4th-year dental students 
from the University of Washington Dental School's Regional Initiatives 
in Dental Education (RIDE) program. More than 70 percent of RIDE 
graduates go onto practice in rural and underserved areas of the 
Pacific Northwest.

    RiverStone Health and health centers across Montana collaborate 
with the National Network for Oral Health Access (NNOHA) to continually 
develop innovative workforce solutions such as a new, entry level 
Sterilization Tech position. Now focused on attracting individuals with 
no prior medical or dental experience into the field of oral health 
care, many of these technicians pursue lasting careers in dental 
assisting or dental hygiene.

    RiverStone Health was the first NYU Langone Dental training site in 
Montana for Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD), enabling us 
to attract and retain advanced dental clinicians dedicated to providing 
oral health care to vulnerable communities. NYU Langone Dental Medicine 
trains over 400 residents across the United States and serves an 
estimated 1 million patients across 75 community health centers.

    Through our Eastern Montana Area Health Education Center (AHEC), 
RiverStone Health provides exposure opportunities to students from high 
schools, community colleges, technical schools, and universities, 
increasing interest in health professions and recruiting them into 
clinical support roles.

    Using lessons learned from America's Community Health Centers, 
Congress can support and incentivize fully integrated and equitable 
models for oral health delivery.

    Research demonstrates that interdisciplinary teams (professionals 
from various disciplines working together in one place) increase 
efficiency, improve cost-effectiveness, and improve health outcomes. 
RiverStone Health continues to further integrate primary care, 
dentistry, and behavioral health across our organization.

    RiverStone Health is regularly recognized as a Patient-Centered 
Medical Home (PCMH) by the National Committee for Quality Assurance 
(NCQA). PCMH standards emphasize the use of systematic, patient-
centered, coordinated care which support access, communication, and 
patient involvement. RiverStone Health also earned NCQA's Distinction 
in Behavioral Health Integration.

    Recently, a RiverStone Health dental patient was at an appointment 
for a tooth extraction. While our dental assistant was preparing the 
patient for their procedure, the patient expressed a desire to die by 
suicide. Due to our integrated model of care, and the compassion of our 
team, the DA immediately requested a warm hand-off consultation with 
our behavioral health team. A behavioral health therapist was able to 
visit the patient immediately after the extraction, while in the dental 
operatory, to ensure they received appropriate care.

    Integrated medical, behavioral, and oral health care saves lives. 
From a fiscal or quality of life perspective, America can no longer 
afford a health system that maintains outdated, entrenched silos which 
frequently separate physical and oral health. Ever since the first 
dental school was founded in the United States in 1840, dentistry and 
medicine have been taught as and viewed as two separate professions, 
but RiverStone Health and other CHCs are working to break these 
precedents.

    As home to the Montana Family Medicine Residency (MFMR) the first 
graduate medical education program in Montana, we attract and train the 
next generation of physicians to help meet Montana's shortage of family 
practice physicians. All MFMR Family Medicine Residents complete a 1-
week oral health rotation with dental providers in our integrated 
health center model.

    This competency-based oral health education prepares Family 
Medicine residents to perform oral health risk assessments and 
evaluations, preventive interventions, patient education, and 
interprofessional collaborative practice, including how to make proper 
referrals for specialty care. Over 65 percent of our MFMR physicians 
remain in Montana and provide medical care in communities where dental 
care may not be present. The MFMR oral health program begins building 
lasting relationships between medical and dental providers, fostering a 
level of collaboration and respect between physicians and dentists that 
has not always existed.

    RiverStone Health also participates in nationally recognized 
scientific research with the Rocky Mountain Network of Oral Health 
(RoMoNOH) focusing on providing primary prevention of dental caries in 
pregnant women, infants, and children from birth to age 40 months. The 
program is active in community health centers (CHCs) across Arizona, 
Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming, studying the integration of oral health 
care into medical clinics. Further teaching family medicine and primary 
care providers to apply fluoride treatments and conduct dental 
screenings during well-child visits or annual physicals. By increasing 
the collective knowledge of medical providers about oral health, 
RiverStone Health and others can deliver more complete and equitable 
oral health care, even outside the dental clinic.

    Two years ago, a homeless patient walked into the RiverStone Health 
Dental Clinic suffering from substance use disorder and painful 
cavities on almost every tooth. Due to our integrated model of care, 
this patient has a renewed smile, housing, and is actively making 
lifestyle changes to improve his overall health and well-being.

    Expanding utilization of mobile health to meet patients where they 
are, Community Health Centers deliver oral health care beyond the four 
walls of traditional dental offices and infrastructure.

    Mobile and portable oral health programs have become incredibly 
successful across the United States, particularly for school-based 
locations. According to a 2017 report by the Oral Health Workforce 
Research Center (OHWRC), more than 750 (44.5 percent) school-based 
health centers (SBHCs) were sponsored by a Community Health Center.

    From Maryland to Montana, mobile units increase access to care 
outside the four walls of our health centers, schools, and nursing 
homes. Building and supporting real estate is expensive, but studies 
have shown mobile clinics return $36 for every $1 invested.

    In Montana, Community Health Centers utilize mobile health units to 
treat farmworkers harvesting sugar beets and cherries and provide 
school-based oral health screenings and sealants to kids in school. Ag 
Worker Health and Services and Alluvion Health, currently provide 
preventive and basic restorative oral health services via mobile units.

    When the law becomes effective in 2024, the MOBILE Health Care Act 
of 2022 will make it easier for health centers to expand utilization of 
mobile medical, dental, and behavioral health clinics. The MOBILE Act 
is a significant victory for expanding section 330 grantees' ability to 
treat more patients and meet them where they are. However, our success 
is completely dependent on the allocation of continued funding for New 
Access Point grants. Without New Access Point funding, section 330 
grantees cannot take advantage of this positive legislation.
                               conclusion
    I recognize the difficult decisions Congress must make to balance 
funding levels with the need to maintain our Nation's fiscal health, 
but medical inflation has outpaced health centers' funding increases 
since 2015, leading to an actual 9.3-percent decrease in actual funding 
levels. Decades of research show that Federal investments in health 
centers reduce overall health spending by expanding access to efficient 
and effective primary care. Patients who access primary care at health 
centers show positive health outcomes and reduced use of emergency 
department and hospital stays.

    I appreciate that this budget environment makes additional 
investments challenging, but health centers are well-positioned to 
address unmet oral health needs if those resources are allocated. The 
Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) estimates that 
millions of patients would benefit from access to oral health care at 
the health centers where they already receive primary care. For 
example, the National Association of Community Health Centers estimates 
that an additional investment of $500 million over 5 years would allow 
health centers to hire more than 3,500 oral health providers and serve 
more than 5 million additional patients. This level of commitment by 
Congress would leverage the existing network of care and build on a 
proven model that saves the health system billions of dollars.

    Meeting the needs of the patients we serve and the team that cares 
for them is what matters most to me as a Community Health Center 
leader. Doing so requires long-term, sustainable, and predictable 
funding that enables confidence in our mission and supports the 
incredible team of dedicated professionals at RiverStone Health.

    Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, and members of the 
committee, thank you for allowing me to share the current reality 
impacting our patients and oral health professionals. Your 
longstanding, bipartisan support changes our patients' and your 
constituents' lives every day. With sustained and expanded funding, 
health centers across the United States will continue to innovate and 
find new ways to provide improved access, equity, and quality of care 
to all those we serve.

    On behalf of RiverStone Health and the Montana Primary Care 
Association, we appreciate this committee's commitment to addressing 
oral health disparities and welcome your questions once witness 
testimony has concluded.

  Questions Submitted for the Record to Jonathan P. Forte, MHA, FACHE
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
    Question. COVID-19 upended daily life and continues to impact our 
communities and our health-care system today. What are some lessons 
learned from the pandemic about oral health care and access to oral 
health care that the committee should be aware of?

    Answer. On March 16, 2020, the American Dental Association (ADA) 
recommended suspension of elective dental procedures. As a result, 76 
percent of dental offices in the U.S. closed, only seeing emergency 
patients, while 20 percent of dental offices in the U.S. closed 
completely. In Montana, most dental clinics shut down completely due to 
a lack of widespread testing, point of care availability, and high-risk 
nature of aerosolized dental procedures. Many individuals went without 
regular dental care, just as they did medical care, and providers are 
seeing more complex health issues across patient populations due to 
delays in care.

    The CDC notes, ``The COVID-19 pandemic has alarming implications 
for individual and collective health and emotional and social 
functioning'' and that ``health-care providers have an important role 
in monitoring psychosocial needs and delivering psychosocial support to 
their patients.'' Research suggests a strong association between oral 
health conditions like erosion, caries, and periodontal disease and 
mood conditions like stress, anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Among 
those hospitalized with COVID-19, diabetes and cardiovascular disease 
are two of the most prevalent underlying comorbidities, according to 
the CDC. We know that periodontal disease is associated with diabetes 
and cardiovascular disease, so delays in dental care could have also 
exacerbated the mortality and morbidity rate of the COVID-19 pandemic.

    What we now know is that when people have a way to pay for health 
needs (i.e., insurance coverage) they will come and seek care. At 
RiverStone Health, our integrated care model and training programs 
allow family practice physicians and primary care providers to provide 
basic hygiene and screening services during medical visits. This level 
of preventative care must be replicated and available for reimbursement 
by payers.

    As a result of COVID-19, patients are now receiving more invasive 
dental procedures due to delayed treatment and as such, experience a 
higher risk of psychological stress--related dental conditions. 
Continued support for statewide policies to expand access to oral 
health care and oral health promotion strategies for the vulnerable 
populations should be encouraged.

    Question. As States resume redetermining who is eligible for 
Medicaid this Spring, we know that many people will lose their Medicaid 
coverage. Some will lose their coverage even if they are still eligible 
for it just for procedural reasons. How will these changes impact 
access to oral health care?

    Answer. As of July 2023 in Montana, 75 percent of individuals (over 
25,000) removed from Medicaid were due to administrative or procedural 
reasons. Only 25 percent or 8,433 individuals were appropriately deemed 
ineligible. Many Medicaid offices across the country have not been 
monitoring or updating patient addresses and contact information 
throughout the pandemic. Many Federally Qualified Health Center 
patients move frequently, causing changes to their addresses or phone 
numbers, while many more remain unhoused in our post pandemic housing 
crisis.

    RiverStone Health took a proactive approach to contacting patients 
and correcting contact information, while also working one-on-one with 
Medicaid beneficiaries who present to appointments, verifying patient 
information in the Montana Medicaid portal. With over 6000 Medicaid 
enrollees, we have currently matched over 2,000 patients to ensure 
their benefits continue or connect them to resources for enrolling in 
other coverage.

    Other than the obvious issue of removing health-care coverage from 
patients who rely on Medicaid for chronic medical conditions. Our 
primary oral health concern is removing individuals who are in the 
middle of active dental treatment plans, such as complex periodontal 
procedures, crowns, bridges, implants, or other medically necessary 
treatments which are proven to improve both quality of health and 
quality of life.

    Once an individual is removed from Medicaid rolls, treatment is 
interrupted and might not continue. Patients who had Medicaid coverage 
may become eligible for sliding fee programs or forced to pay out of 
pocket for any remaining procedures. States should suspend the 
redetermination of patients with currently active treatment plans until 
their oral health treatment plan is completed. RiverStone Health works 
with each patient on a case-by-case basis to ensure we can complete 
treatment plans and meet our patients' needs.

    Question. Oral health is integral to overall health. Older adults 
and people with disabilities have some of the worst access to oral 
health coverage and oral health care, with particular inequities in 
access for people of color. For example, prior to the pandemic, 7 out 
of 10 Black Medicare beneficiaries and 6 out of 10 Hispanic 
beneficiaries reported they have not seen a dentist within the past 
year. Can you speak more about how older adults and people with 
disabilities are affected by a lack of affordable or accessible oral 
health coverage, particularly since oral health can impact other 
underlying conditions?

    Answer. I spoke briefly about how oral health, behavioral health, 
cardiac health, and other conditions are all interconnected in a 
previous response. There are also downstream connections between COVID-
19, Medicaid redetermination, and oral health. With the pandemic's 
impact on mental health, pandemic-related increases in oral health risk 
factors, and anticipated declines in per capita dental visits, 
increasing integrated practice and referrals between dental providers 
and behavioral health providers will be prudent. Oral care is health 
care. By increasing the availability of basic screening services in the 
primary care office, we can create more equitable access to oral health 
care. Similarly, increased efforts to more effectively integrate dental 
programs focused on prevention, screening, and risk assessment within 
primary care, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatric offices should 
be pursued to expand access to oral health services for vulnerable 
populations.

    With regards to older Americans, many of these patients simply do 
not get care. Many elderly patients also lack saliva which leads to 
additional oral health issues. Disparities in care across nursing homes 
further exacerbate oral health issues as many long-term care and 
independent living staff lack training to screen for or treat oral 
health concerns.

    Medicare dental coverage outside of Medicare Advantage is necessary 
to improve access. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), 
almost half of all Medicare beneficiaries did not have a dental visit 
within the past year (47 percent), with higher rates among those who 
are Black (68 percent) or Hispanic (61 percent), have low incomes (73 
percent), or who are in fair or poor health (63 percent), as of 2018.

    Eighty-eight percent of those who did seek care paid out of pocket. 
Average out-of-pocket spending on dental services among Medicare 
beneficiaries who had any dental service was $874 in 2018. One in five 
Medicare beneficiaries (20 percent) who used dental services spent more 
than $1,000 out of pocket on dental care.

    In summary, since 1965, Medicare has not covered routine dental 
care and half of Medicare beneficiaries (47 percent) do not have any 
dental coverage, as of 2019. Our colleagues at KFF discovered that, 
without coverage, many people on Medicare forego needed and routine 
dental care--an issue that disproportionately impacts communities of 
color--with significantly fewer visits to the dentist in the past year 
among Black and Hispanic beneficiaries (68 percent and 61 percent, 
respectively) compared to White beneficiaries (42 percent). Untreated 
oral health can exacerbate certain chronic diseases, delay diagnosis of 
serious health conditions, and result in costly emergency visits.

    Question. At the beginning of this year, Maryland's Medicaid 
program launched a comprehensive adult dental benefit. What, if any, 
lessons have been learned from States that have offered or are starting 
to offer comprehensive dental services to adults on Medicaid regarding 
the effect on health disparities for minority or other underserved 
populations at greatest risk of lack of access to oral health care?

    Answer. Unfortunately, my experience with this expansion was 
limited due to my transition to Montana. I would encourage outreach to 
Dr. Sandra Garbely, DMD at Choptank Community Health System to garner 
additional specifics about access to care in Maryland and outcomes of 
this expansion of coverage.

    One answer to our oral health access problem is that Medicare and 
Medicaid must provide expanded adult dental coverage. Medicaid adult 
dental coverage has been proven to reduce racial and ethnic disparities 
and improved outcomes for young adults, age 19-44.

    Immediately following the launch of comprehensive dental services 
to adults in Maryland, we witnessed an increase in the number of 
appointments being requested, however access to care was hindered due 
to a lack of staffing, infrastructure, and availability of appointments 
coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. While eligibility for care was 
increased, access to that care was difficult to come by due to a need 
for additional, qualified staff and the creation of professional career 
pipelines. Incentives for the recruitment and retention of dental 
providers are necessary to ensure continued access to care for all. 
Teaching Health Center appropriations and continued health center 
funding can go a long way to ensuring the sustainability of our 
workforce.

    Research has shown, in expansion States providing dental benefits, 
compared with non-expansion States, access to dental coverage was 
associated with an 11-
percent increase in the number of patients who reported seeing a 
dentist in the previous year and a 17-percent decrease in the 
prevalence of untreated decayed teeth. In States without Medicaid 
dental benefits, there was an increase in the average number of missing 
teeth and an almost 10-percent decrease in the prevalence of functional 
dentition (having 20 or more teeth).

                                 ______
                                 
    Prepared Statement of Marko Vujicic, Ph.D., Chief Economist and 
  Vice President, Health Policy Institute, American Dental Association
    On behalf of the American Dental Association's Health Policy 
Institute, thank you, Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member Daines, for 
the opportunity to testify and share data-driven insights at today's 
hearing: ``An Oral Health Crisis: Identifying and Addressing Health 
Disparities.''

    My name is Marko Vujicic. I am the chief economist and vice 
president of the Health Policy Institute at the American Dental 
Association. Over the past 12 years, I have led a team of researchers 
who study the U.S. dental care system, covering topics such as access 
to dental care, the dental workforce, dental care utilization, dental 
education, oral health outcomes, and more.

    The American Dental Association is pleased to see that the Senate 
Finance Health Care Subcommittee has selected the topic of oral health 
as their first hearing of the 118th Congress. This is a testament of 
not only the important link between oral health and overall health and 
well-being, but a recognition that there is a need for action. We can 
and should do better when it comes to our Nation's oral health.

    My testimony is focused around three main themes: the state of oral 
health in America; the policy choices we have made along the way; and 
considerations as we move forward.
 the state of oral health in america--key trends to highlight from the 
                                  data
    Among U.S. children, oral health is improving. Over the past 2 
decades, rates of untreated dental disease have been declining; dental 
care utilization has been increasing, particularly for key preventive 
services (e.g., dental sealants); and more and more children are 
covered by some form of dental benefits.\1\ These improvements have 
been most dramatic for low-income children and non-White children. In 
fact, in several States, including Texas, Hawaii, and Wyoming, dental 
care utilization rates for Medicaid-insured children are comparable to 
those of privately insured children.\2\ New analysis shows that the mix 
of dental care services being provided to Medicaid-insured children is 
similar to those being provided to privately insured children.\3\ When 
it comes to children's oral health in America, disparities by income 
and by race have been narrowing over time.

    For working-age adults (age 19-64) and seniors (age 65 and older), 
the trends are different. For example, rates of untreated disease among 
working-age adults have not changed significantly over the past 2 
decades, and disparities by income and race are persistent and much 
wider than for children. The percent of working-age adults who visit a 
dentist in the course of a year is actually slightly lower today than 2 
decades ago. For seniors, dental care utilization rates have increased 
over time, but the disparities by income and by race have been stable. 
In fact, gains in some oral health measures, such as reductions in 
tooth loss, are concentrated among high-income seniors.\4\ Overall, 
disparities in oral health are stable for working-age adults and 
seniors.\5\

    In any given year, less than half of the U.S. population visits a 
dentist.\6\ But oral health in America is a two-part story. We have 
seen 2 decades of steady improvements among children, particularly the 
most vulnerable, in tandem with much less progress among working-age 
adults and seniors.

publications/st537/stat537.pdf, accessed March 24, 2023.

             the policy choices we have made along the way
    The trends in oral health we observe are a result of how dental 
care is handled in Federal and State health policy, particularly the 
different policy approach for children compared to working-age adults 
and seniors. Comprehensive dental coverage is a requirement in Medicaid 
and CHIP programs and is part of the essential health benefit under the 
Affordable Care Act. As a result, over 90 percent of U.S. children are 
covered by dental insurance and this percentage has been increasing 
steadily the past 2 decades. Because dental care is an essential 
service, there are checks and balances in place to ensure a 
comprehensive basket of dental care services is covered for children 
with minimal cost sharing among beneficiaries.

    For working-age adults and seniors, the policy approach has been 
very different. Dental care is not considered an essential health 
benefit. Medicaid programs are not required to cover dental care 
services for adults, and traditional Medicare does not cover dental 
services except in certain circumstances that are linked to medical 
procedures. The Affordable Care Act did not include adult dental care 
as an essential health benefit.

    As a result, there is considerable variation, for example, in adult 
dental coverage within State Medicaid programs. As of October 2022, 
only half of States provide comprehensive dental coverage to adults in 
their Medicaid programs.\7\ However, more and more States have added 
dental coverage for adults over the past several years, including all 
State Medicaid programs now providing dental coverage during pregnancy 
and for at least 60 days post-partum.\8\

    For seniors, dental coverage is an optional benefit within Medicare 
Advantage, with 94 percent of enrollees having some form of dental 
coverage as part of their plan. However, the range of dental care 
services covered within these plans varies considerably, with some 
covering only preventive services. Most plans have considerable 
coinsurance rates (e.g., 50 percent) for dental care services beyond 
routine check-ups and cleanings.\9\ There is very little data available 
on utilization rates for supplemental benefits, including dental care, 
among Medicare Advantage enrollees.\10\ However, a recent study found 
that dental care utilization rates and certain measures of oral health 
decline when people reach Medicare eligibility and, more significantly, 
there were no differences between enrollees in traditional Medicare 
compared to Medicare Advantage.\11\ Of all the supplemental benefits, 
Medicare Advantage enrollees report the most confusion and 
dissatisfaction about dental coverage.\10\

    Due to the very different policy approaches taken toward dental 
care for children compared to working-age adults and seniors, we see 
vastly different degrees of financial barriers to dental care. A much 
larger share of working-age adults and seniors report they cannot 
access needed dental care services due to affordability issues compared 
to children.\12\ Moreover, ``cost'' is the top reason working-age 
adults and seniors are not able to access dental care, and financial 
barriers are more severe for dental care than any other health-care 
service (e.g., prescription drugs, mental health, physician services). 
This is a direct consequence of policy choices.

    Essentially, our health policy approach disconnects the mouth from 
the body when you become an adult.
          key considerations for policy makers moving forward
    As policymakers consider ways to address the oral health issues 
facing the Nation, there are some important findings from the data and 
evidence that I wish to highlight.
The Economic and Fiscal Dividend of Improved Oral Health
    Beyond the fact that you cannot be healthy without a healthy 
mouth,\13\ there is compelling empirical evidence of the economic 
benefits associated with improved oral health. Oral health issues limit 
job prospects, hinder workplace productivity, and limit employee 
earnings. An estimated 29 percent of low-income adults in the U.S. 
report that the appearance of their mouth and teeth affects their 
ability to interview for a job.\14\ For low-income adults living in 
States that do not provide adult dental coverage in their Medicaid 
program, this figure jumps to 60 percent. When States provide 
comprehensive adult dental coverage in their Medicaid program, the job 
prospects of Medicaid beneficiaries improve and the effect is most 
significant for Black Medicaid beneficiaries.\15\ Investing in oral 
health improves job prospects and helps narrow economic disparities.

    There is new research linking improved oral health with reduced 
overall health-care spending. These links are strongest for certain 
medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and pregnancy. One 
study shows that newly diagnosed diabetics see reductions in health-
care spending if they receive certain dental care treatments while 
those that go without dental care do not.\16\ Among pregnant women, 
when dental care is included as part of routine prenatal care, overall 
medical care costs associated with the pregnancy are lower.\17\

    Every 15 seconds in America, someone shows up at a hospital 
emergency department because of a dental issue. The estimated 2.1 
million emergency department visits for dental conditions cost the U.S. 
health-care system $2.7 billion each year, with Medicaid accounting for 
the largest share of this spending.\18\ This is an example of 
inefficient spending that could be avoided if more Americans had access 
to a dental home for routine care and prevention.

    The American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute has 
developed a quantitative model to estimate the fiscal impact of 
alternative adult dental coverage policies in Medicaid on State 
budgets. In addition to estimating additional dental care spending, the 
model incorporates the fiscal offsets associated with reduced emergency 
room costs as well as reduced medical care costs. The net cost of 
adding comprehensive adult dental benefits into all State Medicaid 
programs that currently do not provide such benefits is estimated at 
$836 million per year.\19\ Detailed analysis has been provided to State

    Investing in oral health also impacts the local economy beyond 
reduced health-care costs, improved job prospects, and overall 
wellbeing. Each dental practice is estimated to contribute $2.3 million 
annually to the local economy when the various direct and indirect 
effects are taken into consideration.\24\ Overall productivity losses 
associated with untreated oral disease were estimated to be $45.9 
billion per year in the U.S., much higher than any other country.\25\

dental care within health policy.
 A Dental Workforce That Is Sufficient, Diverse, Healthy, and Located 
        Where it is Needed Most
    As in much of health care, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly 
disrupted the labor market for dental team members. Dental practices 
are having a tough time finding qualified staff, particularly dental 
hygienists and dental assistants. As of March 2023, 96 percent of 
dentists report it is extremely or very difficult to fill vacant dental 
hygienist positions and 86 percent of dentists report the same for 
dental assistant positions.\26\ Enrollment in dental hygiene programs 
has only recently recovered to pre-pandemic levels while enrollment in 
dental assisting programs has been on a steady decline since before the 
pandemic.\27\ As a result, the current staffing shortage for dental 
hygienists and dental assistants is likely to persist for several 
years. In the interim, there are strategies for employers to 
effectively recruit and retain staff \28\ and for State and Federal 
policymakers to boost training capacity.\29\

    Like many other health-care professions, the pandemic took a toll 
on the mental health and well-being of dental team members. Levels of 
anxiety and depression spiked mid-2020 and then steadily decreased 
through 2021.\30\

    Beyond the disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
supply of dentists per capita is predicted to be steady through 2025 
and then to increase significantly after that.\31\ However, between 
2011 and 2021, the number of dentists per 100,000 population increased 
from 60.8 to 62.8 in urban areas while decreasing from 37.3 to 36.5 in 
rural areas. This is an important issue to highlight, as geographic 
access to dental care providers in rural areas is much lower than in 
urban areas.\32\ There are several policy options to consider to 
attract and retain more dental care providers in rural areas, including 
loan forgiveness programs tied to geographic areas, education pathway 
programs, enhanced mobile clinics, alternative workforce models and 
scope of practice, and targeted visa programs, to name a few.\33\

    Related to geographic access to dentists, it is important to note 
that conventional methods of designating ``shortage areas'' for dental 
care providers--including the methodology used by HRSA--are 
significantly flawed. Much has been written about the drawbacks, 
including a concise two-page summary,\34\ and the American Dental 
Association's Health Policy Institute has developed an alternative, 
peer-reviewed methodology that addresses these shortcomings. The 
American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute has offered, and 
continue to offer, to assist government agencies in any way to improve 
the data and methods for assessing provider adequacy. In the meantime, 
the analysis for every State, including a separate analysis for 
Medicaid beneficiaries, can be accessed on the American Dental 
Association's Health Policy Institute website.\35\

    Among Medicaid beneficiaries, particularly adults, finding a 
dentist who participates in the Medicaid program is an important 
barrier to care in many States. One out of three dentists in the U.S. 
sees at least one Medicaid patient in the course of a year. A mere 18 
percent of dentists see at least 100 Medicaid patients per year. There 
is significant variation in these kinds of statistics by State and 
dentist characteristics. At the State level, Vermont, Missouri, and 
Montana have the highest shares of dentists seeing a high volume of 
Medicaid patients.\36\

    Policymakers have a considerable body of evidence at their disposal 
to design effective policies that can boost provider participation in 
Medicaid. These ``good practices'' are well documented and include 
streamlined credentialing and broader administrative practices, 
sufficient fees, patient navigation assistance to reduce missed 
appointments, and expanded scope of practice for dental team members. 
What has been studied less is the role of individual dentist 
characteristics and practice modalities in the Medicaid participation 
decision. New research \37\ indicates that, all else equal, racially 
and ethnically diverse dentists are far more likely to see a high 
volume of Medicaid patients. Dentists in large group practices are also 
more likely than solo practitioners to see a high volume of Medicaid 
patients. As dental school enrolment diversifies \38\ and more dentists 
practice in larger groups,\39\ this could lead to more dentists, in 
aggregate, participating in Medicaid.

    The dentist workforce does not reflect the U.S. population when it 
comes to racial and ethnic diversity. The latest data indicate that 
Black and Hispanic dentists are significantly underrepresented in 
relation to the U.S. population overall.\40\ For example, 3.8 percent 
of dentists are Black compared to 12.4 percent of the U.S. population. 
Similarly, 5.9 percent of dentists are Hispanic compared to 18.4 
percent of the U.S. population. Dental school enrollment data indicate 
a slight increase in diversity. For the 2021-22 school year, 7.3 
percent of first-year dental students were Black and 10.7 percent were 
Hispanic, meaning we can expect a more diverse workforce in the future.

The Importance of Addressing Cost Barriers to Dental Care
    The evidence is compelling that the most important barriers to 
dental care for working-age adults and seniors relate to affordability, 
particularly for those of low income. Lack of dental coverage as well 
as shortcomings in the status quo model of dental insurance for 
working-age adults and seniors are key factors driving up financial 
barriers to dental care. There are a host of policy approaches that 
could be explored to address affordability. These include improving 
transparency and accountability within the private dental insurance 
market through, for example, applying minimal loss ratios to dental 
insurance plans, setting out-of-pocket payment limits for patients or, 
even more simply, requiring better data reporting.\41\ The private 
dental insurance model as it currently operates is not true insurance, 
as it almost universally has an annual maximum benefit and significant 
coinsurance rates for services beyond prevention. Policymakers could 
explore broader reforms such as classifying dental care as an essential 
benefit for all age groups, using the key policy parameters around 
children's dental care as a framework.

                                 ______
                                 
       Questions Submitted for the Record to Marko Vujicic, Ph.D.
             Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
    Question. COVID-19 upended daily life and continues to impact our 
communities and our health-care system today. What are some lessons 
learned from the pandemic about oral health care and access to oral 
health care that the committee should be aware of?

    Answer. The pandemic highlighted that dental care is an essential 
service. Through the pandemic, and through the early stages of 
recovery, dentists were seeing the consequences of delayed or missed 
dental care appointments, with increased treatment needs. As with the 
rest of the health-care system, the most vulnerable groups were hardest 
hit, seeing the biggest increase in unmet needs. Fast forwarding to 
today, the latest data show that among the Medicaid-insured population, 
dental care utilization still remains well below pre-pandemic levels. 
Part of this is likely due to capacity constraints driven by staffing 
shortages. But part of also likely reflects how the pandemic has had a 
long term impact on health equity.

    Question. As States resume redetermining who is eligible for 
Medicaid this Spring, we know that many people will lose their Medicaid 
coverage. Some will lose their coverage even if they are still eligible 
for it just for procedural reasons.

    How will these changes impact access to oral health care?

    Answer. Unequivocally, this will have a negative effect on access 
to oral health. For U.S. children, Medicaid coverage for dental care is 
an essential driver of the progress we have seen in oral health. 
Comprehensive dental coverage for children in Medicaid and CHIP 
programs has helped expand access to dental care for millions of 
children, and this had led to narrowing disparities in oral disease by 
income and race. For adults, the past few years have seen many state 
Medicaid programs expand (optional) dental coverage, recognizing the 
importance of oral health for low-income adults. These gains are 
threatened in states that reform their eligibility policies to reduce 
enrolment.

    Question. Oral health is integral to overall health. Older adults 
and people with disabilities have some of the worst access to oral 
health coverage and oral health care, with particular inequities in 
access for people of color. For example, prior to the pandemic, 7 out 
of 10 Black Medicare beneficiaries and 6 out of 10 Hispanic 
beneficiaries reported they haven't seen a dentist within the past 
year.

    Can you speak more about how older adults and people with 
disabilities are affected by a lack of affordable or accessible oral 
health coverage, particularly since oral health can impact other 
underlying conditions?

    Answer. This is not a topic the ADA Health Policy Institute has 
studied. Yet.

    Question. At the beginning of this year, Maryland's Medicaid 
program launched a comprehensive adult dental benefit.

    What, if any, lessons have been learned from states that have 
offered or are starting to offer comprehensive dental services to 
adults on Medicaid regarding the effect on health disparities for 
minority or other underserved populations at greatest risk of lack of 
access to oral health care?

    Answer. Maryland has been a leader in highlighting the essentialism 
of oral health and in adopting policies to expand access to dental care 
for vulnerable populations. Adding comprehensive adult dental benefits 
to the Medicaid program is the latest step. There is strong evidence 
linking Medicaid policy on dental coverage for adults and cost barriers 
to dental care, dental care utilization, oral health status, and 
employability. Studies show that when adults gain dental coverage 
through Medicaid, they report improved oral health and employability. 
These outcomes are most pronounced among Black Medicaid enrollees and 
those who had gone without dental coverage for more than a year, 
suggesting that dental coverage has the potential to reduce inequities 
in the oral health care delivery system. Providing dental coverage to 
adults in Medicaid programs increases access to and utilization of 
dental care. There are economic benefits to adult dental coverage in 
Medicaid as well. Among Medicaid-enrolled adults in States with no 
dental coverage for adults in their Medicaid program, 60 percent report 
that the appearance of their mouth and teeth affects their ability to 
interview for a job. For those in states with comprehensive Medicaid 
dental coverage for adults, it was much lower, at 35 percent. The 
Medicaid Dental Benefit Act of 2023 (S. 570) would make comprehensive 
dental care a mandatory component of Medicaid coverage for adults in 
every state. This bill, supported by the American Dental Association, 
would help reduce disparities in oral health among adults in the U.S.

    Question. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have 
a framework for health equity that includes a priority related to 
expanding the collection, reporting, and analysis of data, including 
demographic data, to better understand disparities.

    What, if any, challenges have you observed in using data to 
understand the state of oral health and oral health disparities in the 
United States?

    What actions would you like to see the Federal Government take to 
address these challenges?

    Answer. There are three broad areas for consideration I feel are 
important for improving the data infrastructure for better insights on 
health equity. First, it is important to expand/replace the type of 
data collected from large population-based surveys (i.e., NHIS, MEPS) 
to include patient-reported outcomes related to oral health (e.g., 
OHIP-5 measures). Second, it is important for federal agencies to adopt 
a consistent methodology for collecting race and ethnicity data across 
numerous surveys. Third, the methodology for identifying health 
professional shortage areas needs to be modernized and updated. I am 
happy to follow up and expand on these points as needed.

Dear Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member Daines:

AARP, on behalf of our nearly 38 million members and all older 
Americans nationwide, appreciates the opportunity to submit a written 
statement for the record to the Subcommittee on Health Care of the 
Committee on Finance for the March 29, 2023, hearing entitled ``An Oral 
Health Crisis: Identifying and Addressing Health Disparities''. Lack of 
access to affordable dental care can have profound health consequences 
across populations. Older Americans, in particular, know that oral 
health affects all aspects of their health and well-being. Poor oral 
hygiene can cause complications for people with chronic conditions, 
hasten cognitive decline, lead to social isolation, and increase 
overall health care expenses.

Medicare is crucial to Americans' ability to lead full and active lives 
as we age. However, traditional Medicare, which serves about half the 
people enrolled in the program, does not cover routine dental care.\1\ 
By law, Medicare does not pay for preventive or diagnostic services 
such as teeth cleanings or x-rays. It also does not cover basic 
restorative procedures like fillings, nor more complex restorative care 
like dentures or implants.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coverage/MedicareDentalCoverage.

Unfortunately, nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries do not have any 
dental coverage \2\ and are therefore responsible for the entire cost 
of all routine dental services. Without oral health coverage, many 
people with traditional Medicare pay out-of-pocket or simply forego 
dental visits. Those who want coverage must buy separate dental 
insurance or enroll in Medicare Advantage, which typically offers very 
limited dental coverage, if any. Some people with limited resources can 
get dental coverage through Medicaid. In any scenario, the level of 
coverage, access, and affordability for older Americans varies 
considerably.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/medicare-and-dental-
coverage-a-closer-look/.

The impact is clear: many people with Medicare face significant 
barriers to accessing the dental care they need. About 17 million 
individuals with traditional Medicare (or roughly 44% of the 
traditional Medicare population) did not see a dentist in the past 
year.\3\ Going without dental care is an issue that disproportionately 
impacts certain demographic groups within traditional Medicare--
including people from Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino 
communities, beneficiaries with low incomes,\4\ and people who live in 
rural areas.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ Estimates for the number of people who did not see a dentist 
and for out-of-pocket spending on dental care are based on AARP Public 
Policy Institute's analysis of the 2019 Medicare Current Beneficiary 
Survey (MCBS). Data on dental service utilization across Medicare 
Advantage plans is not available.

Recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services revised their 
policy to allow Medicare coverage for ``medically necessary'' dental 
care that is integral and inextricably linked to the success of a 
covered health service. This policy change will allow Medicare 
beneficiaries to receive the prerequisite oral care needed for organ 
transplants, cancer treatment, or many other health services. Before 
this change, the lack of coverage for oral care created a barrier, 
preventing access to the life-saving treatments that are covered. We 
applaud CMS for this significant step of covering ``medically 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
necessary'' oral health care, but more should be done.

We urge the Committee to consider greater coverage of dental services--
including routine care--under traditional Medicare, which would benefit 
millions of people and address both oral and medical health needs. 
Including comprehensive dental coverage in traditional Medicare as a 
Part B benefit is a responsible way to ensure all older Americans have 
access to the care they need. Increased Medicare dental coverage would 
be a very good investment in peoples' health and well-being, and a good 
investment in the Medicare program. Proper dental care can prevent 
infection, reduce hospitalizations, and help manage expensive chronic 
conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Furthermore, a healthy 
mouth and teeth are necessary for good nutrition and communication, 
which help prevent dementia and social isolation and their associated 
costs.

It is long past time for Medicare to cover the full person--from head 
to toe. AARP thanks the Committee for examining oral health coverage 
and looks forward to working with you to ensure more Americans have 
access to the care they need. If you have any questions, feel free to 
contact me or have your staff contact Andrew Scholnick on our 
Government Affairs team at ascholnick@aarp.org.

The Academy of General Dentistry, on behalf of our membership and our 
patients, submits this statement for the record concerning the hearing 
entitled, ``An Oral Health Crisis: Identifying and Addressing Health 
Disparities,'' before the Senate Committee on Finance Subcommittee on 
Health on March 29, 2023.

As the only dental association solely dedicated to the interests of 
general dentists, the largest segment of the dental profession, and as 
the second largest professional dental organization, the AGD recognizes 
the important role it can play in advancing oral health care for every 
individual. Founded in 1952, the AGD's mission is to ``advance general 
dentistry and oral health through quality continuing education and 
advocacy'' through its nearly 40,000 members.
                       introduction and landscape
Oral Health Is Critical to Overall Well-being
Studies have long documented the importance of an individual's oral 
health to their overall well-being. One journal from 2017 stated ``the 
oral cavity is the intersection of medicine and dentistry and the 
window into the general health of a patient.''\1\ This holds true for 
patients across their lifespan, from birth, to adolescence, to early 
adulthood, to women who are pregnant or postpartum, and to those at the 
end of life. Research estimates that over 100 systemic diseases have 
oral manifestations.\2\ For example, the Mayo Clinic states that poor 
oral health may contribute to various diseases and conditions, 
including: (1) endocarditis when bacteria from the mouth spreads 
through the bloodstream, (2) cardiovascular disease which may be linked 
to infections caused by oral bacteria, (3) birth complications, and (4) 
pneumonia. Additionally, poor oral health can also be an indicator of 
diseases such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's 
disease. Research also notes other conditions that might be linked to 
poor oral health, including eating disorders and poor nutritional 
intake, rheumatoid arthritis, certain cancers and immune system 
disorders.\3\ Additionally, dentists often catch many illnesses and 
conditions before they are diagnosed by a physician, because patients 
may visit their dentists more regularly for routine care. Further, 
because many medical issues are asymptomatic patients may therefore not 
see a need to visit their physicians as frequently. Dentists often 
refer patients to physicians who are hypertensive, have suspicious 
lesions in their mouth or on their face, or have uncontrollable 
gingivitis (which may be an indicator of diabetes or early signs of 
leukemia). All of these conditions, either ones that are caused by or 
may result in poor oral health, affect significant portions of the 
population. Optimization of a patient's health through both primary and 
dental health care can alleviate many of these disease burdens on 
individuals and on the health care system as a whole.

Although dentistry accounts for just 4 percent of total national health 
expenditures,\4\ dental health care can help prevent the worsening of 
certain illnesses and ultimately reduce costs to both the individual 
patient and the overall health care system. For example, one study 
estimates that illnesses related to oral health result in 6.1 million 
days of bed disability, 12.7 million days of restricted activity, and 
20.5 million days of lost workdays each year.\5\ Additionally, data 
indicates that costs associated with nontraumatic emergency room visits 
for dental procedures may exceed $1.7 billion per year.\6\ Therefore, 
it is important to note that, unlike medical treatments, the vast 
majority of oral health conditions are preventable through oral health 
literacy, sound hygiene, and preventive care.

Providing patients with routine dental health care will help them avoid 
worsening health conditions and prevent them, and the health care 
system, from incurring unnecessary costs. For example, general dentists 
can help identify early signs of tooth decay, which can help patients 
avoid developing cavities or infections. If patients develop oral 
infections, particularly those with preexisting conditions such as 
diabetes or certain cardiovascular conditions, they can experience 
severe health complications that result in being admitted to an 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
emergency room.

Additionally, the AGD focuses on prevention, screening, early 
detection, and treatment of oral/oropharyngeal cancer. The 
philanthropic arm of the AGD offers grants to programs that perform 
oral cancer screenings and educates general dentists on improving 
screening techniques and sending patients for referrals and care if 
necessary. By improving and expanding oral cancer screenings, dentists 
can help diagnose patients at an early stage, when outcomes are much 
more favorable.
Regulatory Environment for General Dentists
Dentists are heavily impacted by the changing regulatory environment 
and increased administrative burdens. In addition, debates around 
expanding access to dental care too often fail to take into 
consideration significant differences between the oral health payment 
and delivery system and the medical system. The Academy of General 
Dentistry (AGD) advocates for the interests of general dentists, both 
as an organization and in partnership with other dental associations. 
As clinicians, we advocate for the best interests of our patients and 
oppose third party interference with the doctor-patient relationship. 
Specifically, the AGD believes that health care reform should:

    1.  Be market-based and foster competition;
    2.  Be based on a dental prevention/dental home model for oral 
health care;
    3.  Reduce administrative burdens;
    4.  Address state level reforms; and
    5.  Encourage healthy lifestyles, good oral health habits, and 
personal responsibility.

Priority Issues of Concern

The AGD would like to bring focus on four priorities we urge this 
Committee, and Congress, to act on: (1) improving access to dental 
health care for all Americans; (2) providing a supportive regulatory 
and tax environment necessary for a robust dental care industry; (3) 
ensuring supportive Medicaid policies and coverage of dental services; 
and (4) addressing Medicare policies and noncoverage of dental 
services.

  I. Ensuring Access to Dental Health Care

The AGD cares deeply about ensuring that every American has access to 
oral health care. As discussed previously, oral health care is a 
critical predictor and indicator of overall well-being. Unfortunately, 
not everyone has access to dental health care, and these rates are 
significantly worse for underserved populations. For example, people 
who are located in rural areas, have lower incomes, and are Hispanic 
and non-Hispanic Black, are less likely to have had a dental visit 
within the last year, according to 2019 data from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\7\ Additionally, those without 
insurance are less likely to seek or receive dental health care.\8\ 
Even for those with insurance, a 2021 survey found that nearly half of 
all Americans with insurance skipped a dental visit because of cost.\9\

High costs and other barriers to care, such as a lack of 
transportation, are the most commonly cited reasons why patients forgo 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
dental health care.

Dentists desire to serve each and every individual with the best 
possible care, but simply are unable to because of a lack of adequate 
policy. For example, dentists support programs such as dental loan 
repayment programs, which place new graduates in underserved areas. 
Dental organizations host large annual campaigns to fund care for 
children from underserved communities. Further, although dentistry is 
seen as a predominantly hands-on profession, dentists utilized 
telehealth to provide care for patients during the pandemic. Therefore, 
we urge the Committee and Congress to consider policies that will help 
expand and protect access to dental health care for all.

  II. Tax Policies

Dentistry is unique in health care in that it is essentially a small 
business. The model of a dentist's office is quite different than a 
model of a physician's office, a hospital-physician group, etc. Thus, 
it is particularly important to prioritize policies that help protect 
and empower small businesses to ensure dental practices can provide 
sustained and high-quality care for their patients.

First, many studies document disparities in access to oral health care 
by geography--individuals living in rural or less economically 
advantages areas are less likely to have access to dental 
care.\10\<SUP>,</SUP> \11\<SUP>,</SUP> \12\ Unfortunately, high 
educational debt and practice costs can disincentivize dentists from 
practicing in these areas because they can expect higher compensation 
rates when practicing in urban areas. As such, we urge Congress to 
provide tax credits for establishing and operating a dental practice in 
an underserved area.

(accessed March 20, 2023).

Second, a significant amount of dentists operate as small business 
owners and employers. One study found that dental practices, 
experienced a 6 percent revenue decline in 2020 compared with 2019, 
with dental hygiene appointments alone dropping 47 percent.\13\ This 
was largely a result of workforce shortages and layoffs, health and 
safety fears, foregone care, and other consequences experienced and 
exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the pandemic, the 
general cost of operating a dental practice also exponentially grew. 
For example, practices often spent a lot more to procure necessary 
personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks and gloves, as those 
manufacturers experienced their own financial strains. It is critical 
to continue supporting private dental practices by avoiding any new 
specific tax on dental services \14\ and by providing thorough tax 
incentives so dentists can provide the critical preventative and 
routine oral health care people need to protect their overall well-
being.

    \14\ The AGD supports the permanent repeal of the 2.3% medical 
device excise tax imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act (ACA), Public Law 111-148.

Third, a health savings account (HSA) paired with an HSA-qualified 
health plan allows for tax-free contributions to a savings account. 
Funds from these accounts can be used to pay for qualified expenses, 
including most dental expenses. The AGD supports increasing the maximum 
allowable contributions to flexible spending accounts (FSA), health 
savings accounts (HSA), health reimbursement accounts (HRA) and also 
supports changes that would allow families to carry over FSA 
contributions from year to year.\15\ Currently, carry-over is limited 
to HSAs and HRAs, which may further inhibit an individual's ability to 
seek and receive oral health care. Consumers participating in these 
tax-advantaged accounts can evaluate the spending of their health care 
dollars and make more informed decisions. Because dental benefit plans 
are so limited in their coverage, this is especially important to help 
finance oral health care needs.

limits-for-hsas-and-high-deductibel-health-plans.aspx (accessed March 
20, 2023).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  III. Medicaid Policies

The AGD would also like to express its strong support of ensuring 
dental health benefits and access under Medicaid. Currently, between 
Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and private 
insurance, dental coverage for children has increased significantly 
since prior to the expansion of dental benefits in these programs. 
However, coverage does not necessarily translate to access to or 
utilization of care. Additionally, access to dental care for adults 
under Medicaid is significantly limited. For example, one study found 
that only 32 percent of those with public dental coverage reported 
dental care use in a given year.\16\ Again, this reiterates the fact 
that coverage does not necessarily translate to utilization. We need to 
do more to increase access to dental services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Increase While Treatment Will Decline, Health Affairs, https://
www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.0833 (accessed March 20, 
2023).

Further compounding this challenge is that dentists, and specifically 
general dentists, are not adequately reimbursed for providing services 
to Medicaid patients. Less than half of all dentists in the U.S. 
participate in Medicaid; this is not because they do not want to care 
for Medicaid patients, but rather, because they are unable to. Lagging 
reimbursement and administrative burdens are major factors. While 
reimbursement levels vary by state, they largely remain significantly 
lower than private payer reimbursements.\17\ As previously mentioned, 
many dental practices are small businesses, and are forced to make 
business decisions to meet their overhead costs. Bringing the Medicaid 
reimbursement schedule closer to what traditional insurance pays will 
encourage more dentists to participate in the program. Additionally, 
alleviating some of the regulatory and administrative burdens, such as 
prior authorization, associated with participating in the Medicaid 
program will also help more dentists participate.

Reimbursement, Milliman, May 2019, http://assets.milliman.com/ektron/
medicaid-adult-dental-reimbursement.pdf https://catalyst.nejm.org/
cause-crises-whole-health-whole-person/.

Any expansion of present programs must address these barriers directly 
and be structured to enhance dentist participation. Efforts to address 
these barriers should include ensuring reasonable reimbursement for 
dentists and relief from administrative burdens. In particular, the AGD 
implores Congress to take steps to incentivize participation in 
government-funded dental care programs to achieve optimum oral health 
outcomes for indigent populations, including by raising Medicaid fees 
to at least the 75th percentile of dentists' actual costs. 
Additionally, the AGD encourages Congress to take steps to reduce the 
administrative burdens for dentists participating in Medicaid. This 
will help make certain that dentists are able to care for their 
Medicaid patients and advance the goal of providing comprehensive oral 
health care and preventative general dental care to all Americans.

  IV. Medicare Policies

The elderly can be particularly at risk for oral health problems. The 
over 65 years-of-age population is diverse; their interests, resources 
and needs vary widely across the aging spectrum. Recognizing this 
diversity is key in terms of considering approaches to dental care. 
Considerations include treatment planning and increasing oral health 
literacy later in life.

However, the AGD opposes efforts to expand access by adding a dental 
benefit to Medicare.\18\ The Medicare Part B program unfortunately 
cannot sustain the inclusion of dental benefits. The program itself is 
financially unstable and is approaching insolvency and beneficiaries 
should not have to rely on it for routine care, which is most dental 
care. Additionally, dental benefits are not insurance, because while 
insurance provides beneficiaries with policies that protect the insured 
for coverage of catastrophic events, dental benefits reduce the out-of-
pocket costs for non-
catastrophic costs. General dentistry care is primarily preventative. 
Dental benefit plans should thus be differentiated from insurance 
plans, as they are prepayment plans to be used by the beneficiary to 
the maximum extent each year to pay for routine dental care. However, 
Medicare enrollees may find that there is a need for industry to create 
new dental benefits products that would provide coverage for some of 
the more expensive and catastrophic dental services at a reasonable 
cost.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \18\ The AGD believes Medicare cannot sustain the inclusion of 
dental benefits. Market innovations should include the ability for 
seniors to obtain dental benefits in a competitive market, AGD Policy 
on Dental Benefits for the Medicare Population, https://www.agd.org/
dental-practice-advocacy-resources/advocacy-resources/key-federal-
issues/medicare (accessed March 20, 2023).

The AGD believes that any extra funds in federal insurance programs 
should instead be directed toward Medicaid. Currently, less than 50 
percent of dentists participate in Medicaid due to low reimbursement 
rates. Increasing Medicaid reimbursement to industry standards will 
increase the number of dentists who participate in that program.

Additional Areas of Concern

The AGD would also like to highlight two additional priorities for this 
Congress: (1) improving oral health literacy and (2) addressing 
workforce challenges and concerns, including student debt.

  I. Oral Health Literacy

Although outside the scope of this Committee's jurisdiction, the AGD 
appreciates Senator Cardin's efforts on the Oral Health Literacy and 
Awareness Act of 2023.

We strongly believe that by improving oral health literacy, we further 
everyone's access to dental health care, particularly among 
underrepresented populations and certainly including rural populations. 
Unfortunately, studies show that dental care visits declined 
drastically during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 
although they have rebounded since, rates of dental care visits remain 
below pre-pandemic levels.\19\ Studies also reflect large disparities 
among people who visit the dentist annually, disparities which were 
also exacerbated by the pandemic.\20\ Further, some populations require 
more regular or intense visits to their dentists but are unaware of the 
need to do so or the consequences of foregoing this care. For example, 
pregnant individuals may experience worse oral health due to hormonal 
fluctuations, and it is critical they see their dentist regularly to 
ensure any infection does not pass into the fetus. Other barriers to 
access and utilization that patients report include transportation 
issues, lack of oral health literacy,\21\ fear, and/or anxiety. In 
summary, educating the public about the importance of maintaining good 
oral health should be a top concern--as oral disease left untreated can 
result in pain, disfigurement, loss of school and workdays, nutrition 
problems, expensive emergency room use for preventable dental 
conditions and even death.

    \20\ As discussed above, people who are located in rural areas, 
have lower incomes, and are Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black, are less 
likely to have had a dental visit within the last year. Further, 
individuals living in rural or less economically advantages areas are 
less likely to have access to dental care.

process, and understand basic health information and services needed to

Health and Human Services; 2000.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  II. Workforce

Additionally, the AGD deeply cares about issues related to workforce 
strains such as the student loan debt burden on its members. Without 
policies that support the dental workforce, dentists are unable to 
provide care for their patients. Thus, the AGD strongly supports 
policies that will help the current workforce as well as the pipeline 
of future workers, such as student loan forgiveness and workforce 
policies that will support staffing and operational needs of dental 
practices.

First, the AGD deeply cares about issues related to workforce strains 
and student loan debt burden on behalf of its members. For example, as 
seen in many of sectors in the health care industry and beyond, 
workforce strains among dentists were greatly exacerbated during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Some practices had many of their employees quit 
during the pandemic due to the additional stress and fear resulting 
from the virus. Stressors and strains such as this on the workforce 
ultimately decreases people's access to oral health care and 
exacerbates the burden on dental practices.

Additionally, workforce strains were also accelerated due to the 
significant rates of mental health decline among all health care 
professionals, including dentists, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
stresses of dentistry in today's market results in an enormous mental 
load on dentists. Issues such as increasing student debt and private 
practice closures exacerbated the mental health challenges. Dentists 
also witnessed an increase in mental stress and illness in patients 
during the pandemic. For example, the incidence of cracked tooth 
syndrome among patients increased exponentially during the pandemic.

Further, the average dental school student graduates with over $286,000 
in debt.\22\ Most dental students rely on federal student loans to 
finance their education. With dental school tuition nearly doubling 
since 2000, new dentists are faced with staggering amounts of debt 
after graduation, which can limit their ability to choose a preferred 
career path. In addition, with the passage of the Budget Control Act of 
2011, graduate students lost access to federally subsidized loans. 
Under this program, the federal government pays the interest while 
students are in school, during a grace period and during periods of 
deferment. The loss of this benefit has increased the debt burden on 
graduate and professional students, including dental students. As 
mentioned above, people living in rural and other underserved areas 
have significantly less access to dental care, but education costs can 
disincentive students from practicing in these areas after graduation. 
Thus, the AGD urges Congress to ensure education debt is not hindering 
diversity, restricting practice in underserved areas and/or serving as 
an outright deterrent for those wanting to enter the profession.

Conclusion

The AGD continues to advance its mission to promote and advance oral 
health for all by advocating for improved oral health literacy and a 
regulatory environment that supports general dentists' practice of 
primary oral health care. In conclusion, successfully advancing access 
to and delivery of oral health care to all Americans will require swift 
and intentional action. This action will need to support both the 
workforce, so they are able to care for patients across the U.S. no 
matter where they are located nor their ability to pay, and the 
patients, by educating them on the importance of healthy oral habits 
and expanding their access to care. Progress will require partnership 
across all stakeholders, including government and industry, and we urge 
your support to ensure policies that prioritize oral health and well-
being are elevated. The AGD strongly believes every person deserves a 
dental home and access to routine, safe, reliable, and quality oral 
health care.

Thank you for the opportunity to submit this statement for the 
Committee. We proudly offer to be a resource to this Committee and look 
forward to serving as a partner on oral health priorities.

Dear Senator Cardin,

It was exciting to listen in on the hearing regarding the oral health 
crisis.

I have been a Registered Dental Hygienist (RDH) for over 45 years! For 
many years, I practiced in Maryland, the District of Columbia and now 
Virginia. I had the privilege to work in Montgomery County, MD under 
Health and Human Services (HHS) for the Head Start program and low 
income 2nd grade--but lost my funding after 2 years, so I returned to 
the clinical setting. During my HHS period, I created a program for the 
2nd grade, discussing the science of teeth that I am now turning into a 
book for 8-12 years old. ( I could use funding--FYI) I was frustrated 
when Deamonte Driver died and will never forget his name.

I am now 67 years old, clinical hygiene is a struggle, so I was 
fortunate to receive the Volunteer position as the Dental Hygiene 
Liaison for Head Start for the state of Virginia! I am excited and have 
lots to do to improve the program, schools and educate the parents.

Here are my suggestions/thoughts regarding the oral health crisis that 
I hope you will be able to share with Mr. Wyden of Oregon and Ms. 
Warren of Massachusetts and others involved.

 1.  The RDH is a licensed oral health care provider. The RDH takes 
many continuing education courses (as many as a DDS/DMD) to maintain 
the license. The dental hygiene programs enable the graduate to be a 
specialist in the PREVENTIVE wing of dentistry. The Dental programs are 
more focused on RESTORATIVE. Both areas of dentistry are important--
BUT--everyone needs Prevention! And sometime more then twice a year.

 2.  Currently, the dental hygienist is regulated by the Dental Boards 
in each state except California. Over 10 years ago, California created 
the first Dental Hygiene Boards. The RDH in California can graduate as 
a licensed RDH or get further certification to become an Advanced 
Practitioner-RDHAP. My suggestion is for Congress to support the 
American Dental Hygiene Associations in each state wishing to create a 
Dental Hygiene Board for their state to allow the profession to grow 
and be guided by like-minded professionals. Most allied health 
professions regulate their own industry--so this is not an unusual 
request. With the knowledge of statistics and the poor reports on oral 
health, access to care and care discrepancies, allowing the RDH to 
self-regulate would be a huge jump in access to care, direct payment to 
the RDH provider, creating a RDH career--not just a job (which most 
RDH's feel), eliminate the glass ceiling for the RDH, let the RDH who 
achieves Master's and PhD's in public health and dental hygiene know 
they will make a difference!

 3.  It's not just a cleaning! When you see a RDH, they are listening 
to all the questions and symptoms the patient may have, reviewing their 
health history, taking blood pressure, taking all necessary dental x-
rays and reviewing them with the patient, perform an oral cancer head 
and neck screening, checking patient's occlusion--does the patient 
grind or clench their teeth? Would a night guard be beneficial, discuss 
resting position, do they have good airway? How is their sleep? Can 
they breathe through the nose? Explain bacteria that causes cavities 
and the bacteria that causes gum/periodontal disease which can lead to 
bacteria that causes heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, hormonal 
changes with pregnancy, how to take care of an infant's mouth and teeth 
and the need for a one year examination, educate on how fluoride and 
hydroxyapatite work to remineralize enamel and ph of saliva, dry mouth 
situations and remedies, perform a dental cleaning using ultrasonic and 
hand scalers, discuss necessary treatments. What's biofilm, how do I 
use an electric toothbrush, waterpik and interdental cleaners? What is 
the best for the patient? And set up a recare appointment so they will 
return. This is PREVENTION--THAT EVERYONE NEEDS--before it becomes 
chronic or a crisis--we need a Preventive Care Act! What other job has 
one person doing all this? We need it to be a career with self-
regulating boards and direct pay to the RDH--that is how more people 
will want to choose this career.

 4.  Teledentistry--so many RDHs would love to create a business to 
care for individuals in rural areas. It would be a dream to many to 
open their own mobile units and give preventive treatment. It's 
frustrating to see that nail salons are just licensed but regulate 
themselves! It's time for a change.

 5.  How did this happen? The DC health journalist, Mary Otto, wrote a 
book called ``Teeth,'' after Deamonte died. Sadly, the dental and 
medical profession where once together, but became separated in the 
1860s. The hygiene profession is 110 years old this year and was 
created by the dental industry. At that time, most dentists were white 
males and the hygienist where white females and housewives. It's 
certainly not that now! Many dentists are concerned that if the RDH is 
empowered that they will lose dollars. That is not true! More people 
will take the position as it will be a career with many avenues. And 
the RDH will be referring to the local DDS/DMD--a partnership between 
colleagues.

 6.  Education costs--it's many times more expensive to become a DDS/
DMD then it is to become a RDH. And prevention is the key--that 
everyone needs. The RDH would gladly take a lower government payment 
for preventive care--American Dental Association fights the Medicare 
bill as they have higher costs and desires.

 7.  Research shows other organizations such as the PEW Group and 
Children's Hospitals and the general public would agree that access to 
care would improve if there were Dental Hygiene clinics, owned by RDH's 
and easily accessible to the public. There are so many people without 
basic preventive services that the RDH would be able to handle.

 8.  Nursing homes, schools and hospitals all need a dental hygienist 
on the staff. Why is this so foreign? The need is great and obvious. 
Every hospital needed a RDH during the pandemic and still does. Every 
school needs a RDH that they can contact (I oversaw 30 elementary 
schools in Montgomery County), and you know nursing homes or senior 
homes need preventive care.

 9.  Preventive care before restorative care is needed--is the key.

10.  I can gladly get a team of RDH's from all over the USA to speak if 
that would help the cause. We are ready and able!

Thank you for reading this and I hope it influences your decisions. 
Please contact me with any questions or suggestions.

Sincerely,

Antoinette Alaimo

Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, and Members of the 
Subcommittee:

The American Association for Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research 
(AADOCR) respectfully submits this statement as it pertains to the 
hearing ``An Oral Health Crisis: Identifying and Addressing Health 
Disparities,'' which your committee held on March 29, 2023. We 
appreciate your consideration of our requests.

Oral health--too often considered in isolation--is integral to overall 
health. Poor oral health can affect activities that may be taken for 
granted--the ability to eat, drink, swallow, smile, speak, and maintain 
proper nutrition--and create economic burden that disproportionately 
harms older adults, low-income, and underserved communities.

The oral cavity serves as a window into many health issues, including 
but not limited to systemic diseases, such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and 
Sjogren's, an autoimmune disease that causes one's immune system to 
attack parts of its own body. Additionally, researchers are exploring 
the debilitating loss of salivary gland functioning and saliva 
production stemming from radiation treatment for head and neck cancers 
and even from common medications and aging itself. Lack or loss of 
saliva, which causes xerostomia, or uncomfortable dry mouth, has also 
been shown to be a risk factor for dental caries.

In December 2021, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial 
Research (NIDCR) released ``Oral Health in America: Advances and 
Challenges'', a data-
driven report documenting 20 years of progress in oral health since the 
2020 Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health. The report provides 
insight into issues currently affecting oral health and serves as a 
call to action to transform how the U.S. addresses oral health, 
including future NIDCR research, oral health promotion, disease 
treatments, and strategies to overcome health disparities for all 
Americans.

One of the key findings from the report was that oral and medical 
conditions share common risk factors. Oral health treatment can improve 
other health conditions and a person's health overall. However, vast 
inequities remain in access to oral health care and health outcomes 
related to race, ethnicity, residence, education, and socioeconomic 
level. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly 24 million 
Medicare beneficiaries lack critical oral health coverage, and 76.5 
million adult Americans lack dental coverage overall.

The lack of dental coverage and access to services disproportionately 
impacts populations of color. For example, Black and Hispanic seniors 
in the U.S. have two to three times the rate of untreated cavities as 
older non-Hispanic white adults. The same disparities exist for low-
income seniors and those without a high school degree. Both groups are 
about three times as likely to have untreated cavities as adults with 
higher incomes or at least some college education.

To help address these inequities, AADOCR supports the coverage of 
dental and oral health services under the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs. Chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, chronic 
lung disease, dementia, and stroke have been shown to increase the 
pathogenicity of the oral microbiome, as shown by increased 
inflammation, periodontal bone loss, and increased risk or severity of 
periodontitis. Studies have discerned a relationship between oral 
bacteria, dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC).

The increased prevalence of several types of oral bacteria have also 
been shown to be positively correlated with the metastasis of malignant 
tumors. Early detection and treatment are appropriate strategies to 
prevent and control oral cancer and for an improvement in patient 
outcomes. Therefore, payment for the delivery of preventive dental 
care, and conservative periodontal treatment are key interventions to 
decrease the prevalence of malignant oral cancers.

Furthermore, periodontal disease has been shown to increase 
susceptibility to several systemic diseases due to shared risk factors, 
subgingival biofilms acting as reservoirs to gram negative bacteria, 
and through the periodontium acting as a reservoir of inflammatory 
mediators. The treatment of oral diseases can also impact systemic 
diseases including cardiovascular disease, infective endocarditis, 
bacteria pneumonia, diabetes mellitus and others. Treatment of 
periodontal disease has been shown to reduce by 65% the level of C-
reactive protein--an inflammatory marker seen in myocardial infarction 
and stroke. Coverage of even routine dental services will reduce 
susceptibility to systemic diseases and improve outcomes of other 
covered medical services.

Oral diseases have been shown to preclude, delay, and even jeopardize 
medical treatments such as organ and stem cell transplantation, heart 
valve repair or replacement, cancer chemotherapies, placement of 
orthopedic prostheses, and management of autoimmune diseases. Despite 
these factors, most Medicare beneficiaries do not currently receive 
oral or dental care. In fact, Medicare coverage extends to the 
treatment of all microbial infections except for those relating to the 
teeth and periodontium. This exclusion has no medical justification, 
especially in light of the broad agreement among health care providers 
that such care is integral to the medical management of numerous 
diseases and medical conditions. Moreover, the lack of medically 
necessary oral/dental care heightens the risk of costly medical 
complications, increasing the financial burden on Medicare, 
beneficiaries, and taxpayers.

Researchers have discovered that oral diseases share many of the same 
behavioral and social determinants as other noncommunicable diseases 
such as diabetes and hypertension, including tobacco use, environmental 
setting, unhealthy diets high in free sugars, and lack of access to 
health care, and these vulnerabilities accumulate along the life course 
and contribute to disparities in oral health outcomes.

The payment of preventative routine dental care by Medicare and 
Medicaid will help reduce barriers to oral health care and may bolster 
efforts to integrate oral health and primary health care, incorporate 
interventions at multiple levels to improve access to and quality of 
services, and create health care teams that provide patient-centered 
care in both safety net clinics and community settings across the life 
course. In addition, the payment of services for the treatment of oral 
diseases by Medicare and Medicaid will also improve oral-health-related 
quality of life (OHRQoL) across the life spectrum for persons within 
this socioeconomic demographic.

For these reasons, the Association strongly supports the Medicaid 
Dental Benefits Act (S. 570), legislation introduced and championed by 
Chairman Cardin. This measure is necessary to ensure comprehensive 
dental care is covered under Medicaid regardless of what state a 
patient lives in. The current patchwork of dental coverage offered by 
state Medicaid programs leaves millions of adults who rely on Medicaid 
for their health care without the access to dental care that they need. 
More than half of the states only offer limited dental benefits, 
emergency-only coverage, or no coverage at all for adults.

Adults who rely on Medicaid are also the least likely to access dental 
care given their financial constraints. Not only do they face the 
greatest cost barriers to dental care, they are more likely to 
experience dental pain and report poor oral health. Oral diseases not 
only cause pain, discomfort, social isolation, interruption of school 
and work, but also place undue strain on our health system and reduce 
economic productivity, leading to direct and indirect costs that are 
estimated to be as high as $2.7 billion annually.

AADOCR also supports the Medicare and Medicaid Dental, Vision, and 
Hearing Benefit Act (S. 842), legislation that would strengthen 
coverage for dental services under Medicare by repealing the statutory 
exclusion that restricts coverage of such services. The measure would 
expand Medicare coverage to ensure beneficiaries are covered for dental 
and oral care, including coverage of routine cleanings and exams, 
fillings and crowns, major services such as root canals and 
extractions, emergency dental care and other necessary services, and 
payment for dentures.

About half of Medicare enrollees report that they have not had a dental 
visit in the past year often related to the cost of care. Adding oral 
health coverage to Medicare Part B would allow an estimated 60 million 
older adults and people with disabilities to receive dental care, which 
would improve their overall health, lower health care costs, and 
increase their ability to keep their jobs.

We appreciate the opportunity to submit this statement and thank the 
Subcommittee for its support of enhanced access to dental and oral 
care. We stand ready to assist the members of this Subcommittee in any 
way we can and are happy to answer any questions you may have.

RE: An Oral Health Crisis: Identifying and Addressing Health 
Disparities

Dear Chair Cardin and Ranking Member Daines:

The American Network of Community Options and Resources (ANCOR) 
appreciates the opportunity to provide a statement for the record for 
the hearing, ``An Oral Health Crisis: Identifying and Addressing Health 
Disparities.''

Founded more than 50 years ago, ANCOR is a national, nonprofit 
association representing 2,000 private community providers of long-term 
supports and services to people with intellectual and developmental 
disabilities (I/DD), as well as 56 state provider associations. 
Combined, our members support more than one million individuals with I/
DD across their life span and are funded almost exclusively by 
Medicaid. Our mission is to advance the ability of our members to 
support people with I/DD to fully participate in their communities.

ANCOR is grateful for the work of the subcommittee in highlighting the 
need for better accessibility of oral health care for people with 
disabilities. Disparities in access to and coverage of dental care for 
people with disabilities is a problem that jeopardizes individuals' 
overall health and undermines Medicaid's goal of ensuring equity for 
all.

Across the country, Medicaid is the largest payor of supports and 
services for people with disabilities, covering various essential 
services such as medical care, long-term supports in home and 
community-based settings, and employment programs. However, one of the 
largest gaps in coverage for adults with disabilities is the coverage 
of comprehensive dental services under state Medicaid programs. As Dr. 
Brill rightly noted in his testimony, ``dental decay is not an equal 
opportunity disease,'' but it impacts people with disabilities in 
higher rates, ``compromis[ing] the health, development, and quality of 
life'' of those individuals. Given the importance of comprehensive 
dental care to treat and prevent dental decay and other forms of oral 
disease, the lack of coverage among states is highly problematic.

According to a 2021 survey of state Medicaid adult dental services 
coverage conducted by the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access 
Commission, while most states provide some form of dental coverage, 
three states provide no adult dental benefit at all, and nine states 
cover only emergency services.\1\ This lack of full coverage is 
particularly troubling given that states may further reduce or 
eliminate dental benefits during a budget shortfall, which could have a 
severe impact on the health and well-being of people living in states 
with already limited coverage.

    \1\ Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, Medicaid 
Coverage of Adult Dental Services (January 2021), https://
www.macpac.gov/publication/medicaid-coverage-of-adult-dental-services/.

ANCOR supports the Medicaid Dental Benefit Act of 2023, introduced by 
Chair Cardin, which would improve the coverage of dental and oral 
health services for adults covered by Medicaid. We also appreciate the 
creation of a core set of adult oral health quality and equity 
measures, which will provide necessary data to ensure individuals are 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
receiving the care they need and identify gaps in accessibility.

In addition to the lack of adequate coverage for dental care under 
state Medicaid programs, another hurdle to accessing comprehensive 
dental care for people with I/DD is the lack of providers. Even for 
those living in states with Medicaid coverage of services, there are 
low levels of dentist participation in Medicaid. According to a 2021 
survey by the American Dental Association, only one out of three 
dentists sees at least one Medicaid patient in the course of a year, 
with just 18% of dentists seeing at least 100 Medicaid patients per 
year.\2\

ada/ada-org/files/resources/research/hpi/hpibrief_1021_1.pdf.

There are many factors affecting provider participation in Medicaid, 
including low reimbursement rates.\3\ For many dental providers, a 
barrier to participation is the lack of education and adequate training 
on how to best assist individuals with I/DD. ANCOR supports measures to 
improve education and training for dental providers, including support 
for partnerships among providers of dental care, health care, and long-
term supports and services.

Thank you for highlighting the importance of better accessibility to 
dental care and for the opportunity to submit a statement for the 
record. ANCOR supports the work of this subcommittee to improve access 
to and coverage of dental care and looks forward to the opportunity to

                 Statement of Helen Hawkey, Board Chair

On behalf of the American Network of Oral Health Coalitions (ANOHC), I 
want to thank Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member Daines for holding 
this important and timely hearing, and offer my sincere appreciation to 
all of the witnesses and committee members who spoke about the impact 
of oral health inequities on socio-economic advancement, self-esteem, 
and overall health and diseases prevention of Americans. ANOHC is a 
national voice for state oral health coalitions and their members, 
dedicated to improving oral health care access and overall health.

Since the founding of dental schools as institutions distinct from 
medical schools, dentistry--its practice, service delivery, and 
insurance coverage, for example--has remained separate from medical 
care in the United States. This separation is particularly detrimental 
to persons living in poverty, the elderly and persons living with 
disabilities--the groups at highest risk for poor oral health because 
they are least able to afford costly services without financial 
assistance and the least able to travel to areas where providers are 
available.

It is time to solve the problem and truly address the inequities for 
America's families. ANOHC believes Congress should take immediate 
action to insure that every American has an equal opportunity to a 
healthy mouth.

As advocates for the oral health community, ANOHC recognizes the need 
for improved dental coverage in Medicaid and Medicare. Without this 
coverage, millions of older adults, people with disabilities, and low-
income families in our nation cannot afford the care they need to get 
and stay healthy. ANOHC also supports increased funding for oral health 
education and training programs to ease the strain on current providers 
and expand access in underserved areas. To truly impact oral health 
disparities at the state and local level, ANOHC calls on the federal 
government to allocate funding to support state oral health programs.

The Impact of Oral Health

Oral health is essential to general health and well-being at every 
stage of life. A healthy mouth enables not only nutrition of the 
physical body, but also enhances social interaction and promotes self-
esteem and feelings of well-being. The mouth serves as a ``window'' to 
the rest of the body, providing signals of general health disorders. 
Oral conditions have an impact on overall health and disease. Bacteria 
from the mouth can cause infection in other parts of the body when the 
immune system has been compromised by disease or medical treatments 
(e.g., infective endocarditis). Systemic conditions and their treatment 
are also known to impact oral health (e.g., reduced saliva flow, 
altered balance of oral microorganisms). Today, oral health access 
continues to discriminate against immigrants, low-income families, 
rural communities, people with disabilities, and unemployed or 
underemployed.

Oral health affects a person's overall health, income, and quality of 
life. Yet, the dental care delivery system remains divorced from the 
rest of the healthcare system. The notion of dentistry as a field 
separate from medicine is a historical phenomenon that has been 
reinforced through legislation, education, and service delivery. This 
division places an undue burden of dental disease on the most 
vulnerable Americans who face barriers to accessing dental care.

State Remedies are Limited without Action by Congress

Access to dental care is not equitable for all; certain populations 
face barriers when trying to access dental services. These barriers can 
include geographic location, lack of insurance or inadequate insurance 
coverage, disability status, income, and more. States are doing 
everything in their power to address oral health inequities. From 
creative workforce solutions such as dental therapists and direct 
access hygienists, to nonprofit dental clinics, to one-day free dental 
clinics such as Mission of Mercy, states are doing their very best to 
care for those who are left behind.

All states are facing a twin challenge with the dental workforce--the 
aging of dental professionals and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 
pandemic. As older dentists retire, there is a shortage of qualified 
providers to fill their positions, particularly in rural or underserved 
areas. The pandemic also created financial and operational challenges 
for many dental practices, reducing their capacity to see patients or 
forcing them to close altogether. These factors further contribute to 
disparities in access to dental care.

Solutions

Addressing health disparities must be the goal of all stakeholders 
involved in oral health but it is impossible to create equitable 
systems without a solid foundation. This foundation must include an 
adequate supply of providers in the state and resources to develop 
actionable, state-level data along with staff to create effective 
strategies. ANOHC propose several solutions that can establish 
environments in states to that allow for the development of policies to 
address oral health disparities:

    1.  Require comprehensive dental coverage in Medicare and Medicaid 
at the federal level.

Improving dental coverage through Medicare and Medicaid means people 
can better afford dental services. When people can afford services, 
providers can keep their doors open, increasing the number of providers 
that can participate in networks. When people can afford preventive 
care and early treatment of disease, they are less likely to experience 
severe oral health problems that require costly emergency treatment. 
Additionally, improved oral health can have positive impacts on overall 
health and reduce costs for medical care.

    2.  Increase federal investment in dental education and workforce 
development programs.

Expanding the supply of oral health professionals is necessary in an 
environment where access is constrained in many areas. Networks are 
already strained with reduced staff after COVID, retiring professionals 
and increased demand for services. States can't do this alone. They 
will require funding and assistance to achieve an adequate number of 
trained providers to serve all populations.

    3.  Provide all states with oral health program funding.

Challenges faced by states in oral health are similar but also unique. 
Similar in that all states are experiencing workforce shortages 
exacerbated by COVID that is increasing oral health disparities that 
were often profound before the pandemic. However, the strategies each 
state will need to develop and deploy to address the challenge is 
unique and dependent on how oral health is financed, demographics, 
availability of higher education and training, geography, data 
collection capabilities and many other factors. Providing each state 
with funding directly to their state-level oral health program will 
provide a foundation for the development of programs and strategies to 
meet the challenge each state faces.

Thank you for your time and consideration of this worthwhile topic. As 
the most common chronic disease of children and adults across the 
nation, an investment in this subject benefits us all.

RE:  Wednesday March 29, 2023 Subcommittee Hearing on Oral Health 
Crisis

Dear Senate Committee on Finance:

The California Pan-Ethnic Health Network is writing to applaud 
lawmakers' recent push to expand oral health coverage for Americans in 
the recent subcommittee hearing on the oral health crisis. For far too 
long, Americans have suffered the consequences of poor oral health 
care, including chronic disease, chronic pain, difficulties obtaining 
employment, and school absences, across the country.\1\ These 
consequences have been disproportionately shouldered by marginalized 
communities. Congress should act to prevent the disproportionate impact 
of poor oral health care on marginalized communities by passing and 
implementing the Medicaid Dental Benefit Act (S. 570/H.R. 1342).

CPEHN is a statewide multicultural health advocacy organization

Since 1992, CPEHN has served California's Black, Indigenous, 
Communities of Color (BIPOC) by bringing together and mobilizing 
historically excluded populations to advocate for public policies that

earlier efforts to make the Medicaid dental benefit a permanent one.

Establishing permanent, comprehensive oral health coverage for all 
adults who rely on Medicaid will advance health, economic, and racial 
justice on a national scale. Among adults with low incomes in 
California, almost 50% of Latino adults did not have dental insurance 
in 2020, compared to 28% of White adults with low incomes.\2\ Adults 
who did not have dental insurance were also about 3 times more likely 
to have no natural teeth compared to adults who did have dental 
insurance.\3\ To address these oral health disparities and advance oral 
health equity, S. 570/H.R. 1342 will:

Medicaid program.
    2.  Require adult oral health quality and equity measures.
    3.  Require an adult oral health care report.
    4.  Require oral health outreach and education.

CPEHN's research in California has found that the lack of stable 
preventive and restorative dental coverage is one of the most 
significant barriers to accessing oral health care for low-income 
communities.\4\ While California currently has comprehensive adult 
dental benefits for adults enrolled in Medicaid, this has not always 
been the case. In the last 15 years, California has eliminated and 
restored dental benefits for millions of adult recipients of Medicaid 
multiple times. In 2017, CPEHN and its grassroots partners successfully 
mobilized our communities to advocate for the full restoration of adult 
dental benefits. In 2019, we again successfully mobilized over 100 
organizations, including dental providers, advocates, universities, and 
community groups to prevent cuts to the fully restored adult dental 
benefits as a result of the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on our 
economy. Oral health coverage, however, should be a permanent adult 
Medicaid benefit that is no longer subject to the volatility of the 
state budget.

As a result of these previous budget cuts, California's oral health 
system remains fragile. The year-to-year changes in coverage have 
caused many providers enrolled in Medicaid to leave the program,\5\ 
reducing the already low number of providers who accept Medicaid, 
leaving Medicaid members with less options to receive oral health 
treatment. Additionally, the year-to-year changes have caused great 
confusion among Medicaid members who are affected by these sudden 
policy changes and left wondering whether or not they will have access 
to a dental check-up in a given year. Changes to dental benefits for 
adults enrolled in Medicaid also lead to the inability to continue 
ongoing treatment, interruptions in access to preventive services, and 
expanded use of the emergency room for preventable dental conditions. 
Overall utilization rates remain low, with statewide utilization rates 
growing by only one to two percent across all service categories 
(annual dental visits, preventative services, dental exams, diagnostic

Medicaid members' oral health needs will only grow exponentially in the 
post-COVID-19 period. Over 25% of dental practices in California closed 
after statewide safer-at-home orders.\6\ Although California issued 
guidelines \7\ to help health care providers return to practice--an 
effort to begin the process of resuming non-
emergency, non-COVID-19 health care services--the state should not 
overlook the oral health care long-term consequences resulting from 
pandemic fears around accessing dental care by both providers and 
members. Millions of Medicaid members, many of whom postponed both 
routine and necessary care, will need to pursue or continue treatment. 
Permanent adult oral health coverage will be essential to ensuring 
Medicaid members receive the oral health care they will unquestionably 
need.

Americans should not have to worry about their access to dental care 
changing from year to year simply because they are enrolled in 
Medicaid. S. 570/H.R. 1342 will help address the challenges highlighted 
in this letter, and improve the overall health of all Americans. For 
these reasons, we urge Congress to act on the Subcommittee Hearing on 
Oral Health Crisis' findings by passing the Medicaid Dental Benefit Act

The Honorable Benjamin L. Cardin    The Honorable Steve Daines
Chairman                            Ranking Member

Subcommittee on Health Care         Subcommittee on Health Care

Dear Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member Daines:

Community Catalyst is pleased to submit a statement in regards to the 
Subcommittee's recent hearing on oral health disparities.

Community Catalyst is a leading non-profit national health advocacy 
organization dedicated to advancing a movement for health equity and 
justice. We partner with local, state, and national advocates to 
leverage and build power so all people can influence decisions that 
affect their health. Health systems will not be accountable to people 
without a fully engaged and organized community voice. That's why we 
work every day to ensure people's interests are represented wherever 
important decisions about health and healthcare are made: in 
communities, state houses, and on Capitol Hill. We share your goals of 
making the healthcare system work for those not currently well-served, 
especially people of color, individuals with low incomes, rural 
communities, and older adults, and appreciate your attention to the 
important role of the dental care system.

We appreciate the subcommittee's recognition of the limits of the 
current optional nature of Medicaid dental benefits for adults and the 
impact on older adults and people with disabilities of the current lack 
of comprehensive dental benefits in Medicare. We also appreciate your 
attention to the need to strengthen and support the dental workforce, 
including increasing the number of providers, diversifying the 
workforce, and expanding the use of teledentistry to increase the reach 
of the system.

Improving Public and Private Dental Coverage

Dental care presents the greatest financial barriers \1\ of any 
healthcare service--nearly 40% of dental care costs are paid out of 
pocket \2\ and almost half of adults identify cost as a barrier to 
getting care.\3\ As noted during the hearing, many states have very 
limited coverage of dental care for adults in their Medicaid programs 
and Medicare does not include any dental benefits. Adult dental care is 
also absent in the Essential Health Benefits (EHB) package that many 
health plans must follow. As a result, access to dental care for people 
with Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance remains inconsistent and 
woeful. The availability and comprehensiveness of optional adult dental 
benefits in Medicaid varies widely from state to state and fewer than 
half of dentists accept Medicaid \4\ at all, leaving many families 
without access to care even if they do have coverage. Similarly, about 
half of people with Medicare have no dental coverage \5\ and the same 
amount do not get a yearly dental visit.

coverage-a-closer-look/.

Unsurprisingly, this patchwork of coverage and access often results in 
dental debt, which contributes to broader medical debt for about half 
of adults \6\ who incur it. Due to structural racism and resultant 
longstanding economic inequities, people of color are more likely to 
have debt as a result of dental or other medical bills and face greater 
barriers to accessing dental care in general. Additionally, as Dr. 
Marko Vujicic noted in his testimony, about one-third of low-income 
adults say that dental conditions limit their job prospects.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \6\ https://www.kff.org/report-section/kff-health-care-debt-survey-
main-findings/.
    \7\ https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-
org/files/resources/research/hpi/us-oral-health-well-being.pdf.

The benefits of standardizing dental benefits for adults are far-
reaching. As Dr. Vujicic also noted, lack of dental coverage can result 
in unnecessary emergency department (ED) use for dental problems. When 
people don't have access to the care they need, they often wait until 
dental problems become so painful that the ED is their only option. 
ED's are typically not set up to provide adequate treatment and most 
people leave with only antibiotic and painkiller prescriptions. In 
addition to not providing the dental care people need, these visits 
cost the health care system more than $2 billion a year.\8\ This 
costly, unnecessary, and ineffective problem can be solved by making 
comprehensive adult dental benefits a mandatory coverage category in 
state Medicaid programs and including them as part of the EHB package. 
Mandating adult dental benefits in Medicaid would save at least $273 
million per year \9\ on the medical side.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-
org/files/resources/research/hpi/whitepaper_0721.pdf.

Additionally, as the testimonies of Dr. Warren A. Brill and Dr. Farmer-
Dixon highlighted, adult dental coverage, including during pregnancy, 
can have cascading effects on children's oral health--research shows 
that Medicaid adult dental coverage is associated with decreased dental 
disease in children.\10\ Comprehensive adult dental care can have a 
positive impact on the oral health of whole families.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8609949/.

Finally, as Dr. Vujicic noted, while some Medicare Advantage plans 
optionally cover dental care, few Medicare beneficiaries actually use 
it due to high cost sharing. And, as Dr. Farmer-Dixon noted, people are 
less likely to get the care they need when out-of-pocket costs are 
high. Including a comprehensive dental benefit in traditional Medicare 
could ultimately result in cost savings as a result of fewer 
unnecessary ED visits, reduction in overpayments and other 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
administrative burdens, and medical-side savings.

Finally, we appreciate Dr. Brill's testimony on the need for education 
for parents and the public about the importance of oral health. We 
support efforts to equip communities with the information and resources 
they need to understand their oral health, the services available to 
them, and to advocate for themselves and their families. Data show that 
the vast majority of people understand the importance of oral health 
and its connection to overall health.\11\ To fully address our nation's 
oral health crisis, we need policy solutions to improve dental coverage 
and ensure providers are available to serve communities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ https://www.carequest.org/SOHEA2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expanding and Diversifying the Oral Health Workforce

We further appreciate the subcommittee's recognition of the need to 
continue to strengthen our nation's oral health workforce to ensure 
equitable access to high-quality and culturally respectful care for 
every person, especially in rural, low-
income, and communities of color. More than 70 million people live in 
areas without enough dental providers \12\ and rural and low-income 
communities are most likely to be impacted. The low number of dentists 
who are people of color--who are more likely to practice in underserved 
areas--also likely means that the dentist-to-
population ratio in communities of color is lower.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/shortage-areas.
    \13\ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jphd.12501.

Like many other measures of health, racial disparities in access to 
dental providers continue to exist. However, beyond simply increasing 
the number of providers in underserved communities, we must also strive 
to establish a health care workforce that is community based and more 
representative of individuals in these communities. Increasing the 
diversity of health care providers and fostering a community-centered 
workforce has long been a key recommendation for addressing racial and 
ethnic health disparities.\14\ As Dr. Farmer-Dixon underscored in her 
testimony, we agree that increasing dental provider diversity is 
critical to expanding access, improving oral health, and addressing 
disparities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220358/.

A more diverse healthcare workforce can help address disparities in 
access to care.\15\ When people of color have a provider of their same 
race, ethnicity, or culture, patient satisfaction and quality of care 
improve.\16\ Despite strong evidence that racial concordance between 
providers and patients improves quality of care and reduces costly 
adverse outcomes, currently, the dental workforce is not representative 
of the communities it serves. Nearly three-quarters of dentists are 
white, and Black and American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people 
are particularly underrepresented in dentistry. Additionally, white 
dentists are the least likely to serve people with Medicaid. Dentists 
who are people of color are more likely to do so and are also more 
likely to work in underserved communities.\17\

    \17\ https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/
10775587221108751.

We are supportive of the recommendations made to the subcommittee by 
experts like Dr. Farmer-Dixon to establish a more diverse pipeline of 
dental professionals. We encourage the subcommittee to consider how 
community-driven provider models like dental therapists can help 
address access barriers, reduce oral health disparities, and establish 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a more representative and culturally respectful oral health workforce.

In particular, evidence of the success of dental therapists has shown 
that these 
community-based providers improve access to dental care and oral health 
outcomes \18\ at the population level. Dental therapists \19\ are 
licensed providers who play a similar role in dentistry to that of 
physician assistants in medicine. They work under the supervision of a 
dentist to provide routine dental care like exams and fillings. Using 
teledentistry methods to collaborate with their supervising dentist, 
dental therapists can bring care to people where they are, including 
schools, nursing homes and rural communities. And because their 
employment cost is, on average, one-third to one-half the amount of a 
dentist, hiring dental therapists is a cost-
effective way for safety-net clinics to stretch their budget to treat 
more patients. Currently, dental therapists are authorized to work in 
at least some settings in 13 states.

    \19\ https://www.dentaltherapy.org/about/about-dental-therapy.

Recent recommendations from the HRSA Advisory Committee on Training in 
Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry \20\ offer several opportunities to 
support and expand the oral health workforce through dental therapy, 
including updating Title VII training programs to explicitly include 
dental therapy programs and trainees, dedicating funding in Title VII 
specifically for dental therapy education programs, ensuring that 
dental therapy faculty are eligible for faculty loan repayment, and 
including dental therapists in the National Health Service Corps.

    \20\ https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/advisory-
committees/primarycare-dentist/reports/actpcmd-19th-report-dental-
therapy.pdf.

In rural communities, communities of color, and Tribal communities, 
dental therapy creates an accessible pathway for people from areas with 
little access to oral health care to become the dental providers their 
communities need. For the first time, these communities are gaining 
regular access to dental care from someone who is part of their 
community--who speaks their language, understand their culture, and can 
provide culturally respectful care that is grounded in shared 
experience.

Oral Health Workforce and Innovative Technologies

In addition to expanding the dental workforce, we recognize the issues 
raised by Dr. Brill's testimony about the lack of operating room space 
for critical dental procedures. We support opportunities to improve 
access to dental care across a variety of settings to ensure a robust 
and comprehensive system that can serve the diverse needs of diverse 
patients. At the same time, with good access to preventive and basic 
restorative care, the need for dental surgery can be greatly reduced, 
avoiding unnecessary pain and invasive care and reducing the overall 
cost of care to both the patient and the healthcare system. Dental 
therapists are trained in the most commonly needed procedures in 
underserved communities and are well trained to provide preventive and 
basic restorative care needed to avoid more painful and costly care in 
the future. Often, they are trusted members of the communities they 
serve. They are shown to reduce extractions in both children and adults 
and can temper the need for pediatric dental care under anesthesia.\21\ 
Dental therapists work closely with dental hygienists, who are experts 
in prevention, and are a critical part of the dental team's work to 
improve access and reduce disparities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \21\ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jphd.12263.

A fully staffed dental team can also make use of the most current 
technology to improve both access and outcomes. The use of 
teledentistry technology spread rapidly during the COVID public health 
emergency (PHE). As the PHE unwinds, many states have begun extending 
teledentistry policies in recognition of their impact on access to care 
and the fact that many barriers that teledentistry can address--
including transportation, child care, and location of dental 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
facilities--will continue to exist beyond the COVID era.

Additionally, in recent years, less invasive alternatives to drilling 
and filling cavities have become more commonplace in dentistry. Often 
referred to as ``minimally-invasive dental care''\22\ (MIC) these 
alternatives are used to catch and treat oral health problems early on, 
rather than waiting for disease to get bad enough for someone to need 
surgical or other more invasive interventions. Scientific advancement 
and the body of evidence around the effectiveness of MIC have grown 
rapidly, offering options for preventive and basic restorative care 
that are less expensive and traumatic for patients and can reduce 
systems costs in the long run.\23\

care/.
    \23\ https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022034518800014.

One medicine in particular, silver diamine fluoride (SDF), has shown 
promise in reducing disease and improving oral health for children and 
adults. The American Dental Association (ADA) and the World Health 
Organization (WHO) have recommended the use of SDF to stop the spread 
of existing cavities, prevent new ones, and even reverse decay.\24\ It 
is simple and inexpensive to apply, and can easily be provided by 
dentists, dental therapists, dental hygienists, or non-clinical 
providers in community-based settings. These factors, and its low cost, 
provide opportunities to address financial barriers to oral health care 
and income-based inequities. In 2022, the American Medical Association 
(AMA) added a billing code to facilitate medical providers to 
administer SDF,\25\ offering opportunities to foster medical-dental 
integration, to further expand the reach of critical dental care, and 
to advance oral health equity.

We greatly appreciate the subcommittee's attention to disparities in 
access to dental care and for seeking to address our nation's oral 
health crisis. We are eager to work with you to identify additional 
opportunities to support improvements to public and private dental 
coverage and diversification and expansion of our nation's oral health 
workforce through community-driven provider models. For additional

            Statement of Vivian Vasallo, Executive Director

On behalf of the Delta Dental Institute, thank you, Chairman Cardin and 
Ranking Member Daines, for the opportunity to share insights following 
last week's hearing: ``An Oral Health Crisis: Identifying and 
Addressing Health Disparities.'' We applaud you for holding a hearing 
to discuss this important issue and appreciate your willingness to 
allow additional stakeholders to submit statements for the record.

My name is Vivian Vasallo, executive director of the Delta Dental 
Institute. In this role, I head Delta Dental's work to elevate oral 
health in the nation's broader health care conversation through 
research, community engagement, and advocacy. In partnership with Delta 
Dental companies, we strive to ensure that everyone understands the 
importance of oral health to overall health and has access to the high-
quality dental care they need.

Oral Health Is Integral to Overall Health

In 2000, the U.S. Surgeon General released a report \1\ on oral health 
characterizing oral disease as a ``silent epidemic'' affecting 
vulnerable populations, including historically underrepresented groups, 
people with disabilities, and the elderly. Even 20 years later, 
research \2\ shows that rates of tooth decay, periodontal disease, and 
oral cancers are far higher--and dental care utilization rates 
considerably lower--for historically underrepresented groups in the 
U.S. To adequately address disparities in oral health care, the Delta 
Dental Institute recommends the subcommittee focus on efforts to 
increase access to care, improve oral health literacy, and create a 
more diverse oral health workforce.

Oral health is critical to overall health, and poor oral health can 
have dangerous consequences. Oral disease is associated with 
cardiovascular disease,\3\ respiratory disease \4\ and adverse 
pregnancy outcomes.\5\ Periodontal, or gum, disease is strongly 
associated with increased risk of cancer \6\ and chronic diseases such 
as diabetes.\7\ Untreated, often preventable, oral diseases send 2.1 
million Americans \8\ to the emergency room each year.

A poll \9\ from the Delta Dental Institute shows Americans 
overwhelmingly agree that oral health is critical to overall health. In 
fact, more than two-thirds \10\ agree the benefits of a routine dentist 
appointment during COVID-19 outweighed the potential risks of delaying 
preventive care. Yet there is a lot of work left to do to ensure all 
Americans have affordable access to the oral health care they need. 
Millions \11\ of Americans lack dental insurance, and racial inequities 
have created stark gaps \12\ in oral health outcomes for communities of 
color.

Prioritizing Oral Health

Americans want the federal government to take action to expand oral 
health access and affordability. Another Delta Dental Institute poll 
\13\ found clear bipartisan support for improved access to oral health 
care, with 93% of Democrats and 80% of Republicans in support of dental 
coverage in Medicare, and 86% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans 
supporting state-based Medicaid coverage for oral health.

In addition to prioritizing oral health care access, to address oral 
health disparities and ensure the effectiveness of executive, 
legislative, or regulatory action related to oral health care, America 
needs more oral health experts in the federal government, including 
agencies like HRSA, \14\ the CDC, and the Department of Veterans 
Affairs,\15\ which have a substantial impact on Americans' oral health, 
but few have a chief dental officer or equivalent on staff. We commend 
\16\ the Biden Administration and Centers for Medicare ad Medicaid 
Services (CMS) Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure for prioritizing 
oral health with their appointment of Dr. Natalia Chalmers as Chief 
Dental Officer, but there is still much work to be done.

Oral Health Literacy

Oral health literacy plays a critical role in driving health outcomes 
by enabling patients to make informed decisions about their care. In a 
Delta Dental Institute white paper, ``Improving America's Oral Health 
Literacy,''\17\ the authors found that while the public recognized the 
connection between oral and overall health, discrepancies in oral 
health outcomes remain, due in part to low levels of oral health 
literacy. Though survey results from a Delta Dental Institute poll 
found that most Americans feel generally positive about their ability 
to understand health information, there are gaps for low-income, aging, 
and rural communities that are important for all stakeholders, 
including dental health professionals, insurers, health funders, 
employers, and others, to address.

We applaud \18\ the bipartisan introduction of the Oral Health Literacy 
Act (H.R. 994,\19\ S. 403 \20\), which would authorize a public 
education campaign across all relevant federal programs to increase 
oral health literacy and awareness. We believe this legislation will 
help create more equitable policies and initiatives for oral health and 
improve access to care. As such, we urge quick action in Congress to 
help close the oral health literacy gap.

Diversity in the Oral Health Workforce

While racial and ethnic diversity among health professionals is linked 
to improved outcomes and greater health equity, the current oral health 
workforce does not reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. 
population.

To help address this imbalance, on World Oral Health Day, March 20, 
2023, Delta Dental launched the Driving Greater Diversity in the Oral 
Health Workforce Campaign \21\ which will support workforce diversity 
initiatives through oral health education, literacy, research, and 
community investment, and by establishing the 
industry-leading Delta Dental Oral Health Diversity Fund.\22\ In its 
first year, the Delta Dental Oral Health Diversity Fund will make 
targeted investments of up to $1 million to support innovative 
solutions and address barriers that school-aged children from 
historically underrepresented communities face in pursuing careers in 
the oral health professions.

In addition, recent research \23\ from the Harvard School of Dental 
Medicine, sponsored by the Delta Dental Institute, found that expanding 
the dental workforce in Oral Health Professional Shortage Areas through 
the National Health Service Corps would reduce the risk of dental 
caries among children in underserved areas, improve care, and cut 
costs.

To further address oral health disparities, Delta Dental is committed 
to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion and addressing the needs 
of diverse communities through research, giving initiatives, and other 
activities in the communities we serve. In 2021,\24\ Delta Dental made 
key investments totaling $106 million, nearly a quarter of which were 
dedicated to oral health education and workforce development. As part 
of this giving, Delta Dental has made efforts to expand access to care 
by supporting dental treatment and prevention programs, such as free 
dental clinics; advancing health equity through scholarships and grants 
for underrepresented students pursuing careers in oral health; and 
funding research and supporting new care models and technologies, like 
medical-dental integration and teledentistry, to help develop new 
solutions to improve care.

Subcommittee Actions to Reduce Oral Health Disparities

Based on the state of oral health in America,\25\ there is a clear link 
between oral health and overall health and a need to address barriers 
that vulnerable patients face in accessing high-quality oral health 
care. We commend the Subcommittee's hearing on this topic, as it 
brought these very matters to light. Our Driving Greater Diversity in 
the Oral Health Workforce campaign was created in hopes of diversifying 
the oral health workforce and subsequently improving oral health 
outcomes for racially and ethnically diverse patients and communities. 
We believe the country would benefit from programs like our campaign, 
and the Subcommittee's recognition of disparities in oral health care 
and the lack of diversity in the oral health workforce would make way 
for these very programs to develop and grow.

%20Oral%20Health%20Report_2022-Release.pdf.

Our aim is to create an oral health workforce that is racially and 
ethnically diverse, culturally competent, and reflects the changing 
demographics of the U.S. population. To accomplish this, we recommend 
that members of the Subcommittee create legislation that authorizes a 
federal program to create a more diverse and culturally competent 
dental workforce, following the framing of what Delta Dental is trying 
to accomplish through our ongoing campaign.

Conclusion

Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member Daines, thank you again for holding 
a hearing on this critically important topic. I hope we are able to 
continue this conversation in the coming months, as significant work 
remains to address oral health disparities. We were pleased to see Dr. 
Cherae M. Farmer-Dixon, Dean of Meharry Medical College's School of 
Dentistry, one of only two historically black colleges and universities 
(HBCU) dental schools in the U.S., on the panel. There are additional 
experts with diverse backgrounds and robust experience addressing oral 
health disparities in their communities from whom the committee can 
continue to learn.

As the nation's oral health leader, serving more than 85 million 
Americans and offering the largest network of dentists in all 50 
states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, Delta Dental is eager to 
lend its expertise in oral health to inform future legislative 
initiatives. As issues in this important policy area arise, we welcome 
the opportunity to work with you to move those policies forward. Please 
consider the Delta Dental Institute as a key resource and do not 
hesitate to contact us should you have any questions.

Chairman Cardin and Ranking Member Daines, Families USA would like to 
thank you and the entire Finance Subcommittee on Health Care for this 
important and timely hearing, and to offer our sincere appreciation to 
all of today's witnesses for lifting up the critical need to improve 
our oral health care system. Oral health care is key to overall health 
and wellness, employment opportunities, economic stability, and social 
connectedness. Families USA supports addressing the disparities in 
access to oral health care and finding solutions to ensure all families 
have access to affordable and quality oral health, including through 
comprehensive oral health coverage in Medicare and Medicaid.

Oral Health Care is Health Care

The Centers for Disease Control \1\ and the World Health Organization 
\2\ have both declared that oral health is a key indicator of overall 
health, well-being, and quality of life. Additionally, longstanding 
evidence shows that poor oral health harms our physical, mental, and 
economic well-being.

When people cannot access the care they need, oral health problems can 
prevent them from eating, working, securing employment, and staying 
healthy. A recent survey of middle-aged adults revealed that nearly 
four in ten had dental problems within the past two years that caused 
pain, difficulty eating, and work absences.\3\

When oral disease goes untreated, people are at a higher risk for 
diabetes, heart disease, stroke, COVID-19, and even death.\4\ If people 
already have these health conditions, poor oral health can make them 
worse. This can be a particularly acute problem for our nation's older 
adults, over two thirds of whom have untreated gum disease and roughly 
a fifth of whom have untreated tooth decay.\5\

Additionally, lack of access to oral health care during pregnancy can 
lead to poor health outcomes for both the mother and baby.\6\ Poor oral 
health raises the risk of high blood pressure during, which can lead to 
major complications and even maternal deaths.\7\ It also increases the 
risk of poor birth outcomes, such as low birth weight or premature 
birth.\8\ Moreover, children are three times more likely to have dental 
disease if their mother was not able to receive dental care during 
pregnancy.\9\

Oral Health Remains Out of Reach

Oral health care is central to overall health, yet for far too many 
people, access to affordable and high-quality dental care is out of 
reach. Americans are roughly four times more likely to lack dental 
insurance than medical insurance, with the greatest rates of 
uninsurance among racial and ethnic minorities.\10\ Without insurance, 
oral health care is too expensive for many people to afford. For 
example, the average cost of a root canal can cost between $750 and 
$1,200.\11\ Due to this, dental care remains the number one medical 
service families skip due to cost.\12\ According to CareQuest Institute 
research, 93% of individuals living in poverty have unmet dental needs, 
compared with 58% in high-income families.\13\

These problems are even greater for communities of color, rural 
communities, and the disability community. Black and non-white Hispanic 
adults are more likely to face cost barriers to dental care than White 
adults, and this gap has been increasing over time.\14\ Among Black 
older adults, the percent of individuals who have lost of all their 
natural teeth is 31%--almost double the national average--with minimal 
change over the past decade.\15\ Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, seven 
out of ten Black individuals and six out of ten Hispanic individuals 
accessing health coverage through Medicare reported they did not see a 
dentist in the last year compared to four out of ten of their white 
counterparts--and we know the pandemic exacerbated these 
disparities.\16\

Residents in rural America face major difficulties in access, coverage, 
and geography that limit their ability to obtain good oral health care. 
An analysis of 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data 
found that 20% of rural older adults have not seen a dentist or visited 
a dental clinic for more than 5 years, compared to 14% of non-rural 
older adults.\17\ In rural areas, unmet oral health needs can 
exacerbate other health problems that are common in these communities--
studies show strong links between oral health and diabetes, a disease 
with much higher mortality rates in rural areas than in more urban 
locations.\18\

Many adults with disabilities experience extraordinary barriers to good 
oral health. About 8 million disabled adults under age 65 rely on 
Medicare for coverage, and 4 million of these adults are dually 
eligible for Medicaid. However, both Medicare and Medicaid leave 
significant gaps in comprehensive oral health coverage. The lack of 
proper access to oral health care has significant impacts for 
individuals with disabilities because they commonly have multiple 
chronic health conditions.\19\ Additionally, few dental offices provide 
accommodations to serve adults with physical or other disabilities. The 
need for accommodations varies among people with congenital, acquired, 
physical and intellectual disabilities and adds additional difficulties 
accessing quality oral health care.\20\

Ensuring Coverage in Medicare and Medicaid

While there are a variety of solutions to address the oral health care 
crisis, Families USA believes that adding a mandatory, comprehensive 
oral health benefit in Medicare and Medicaid would be the most 
impactful way to provide critical relief for millions of families.

Currently, two-thirds of older adults and people with disabilities who 
rely on the Medicare program for their insurance, often living on fixed 
incomes, do not have any source of oral health coverage. Adding an oral 
health benefit to Medicare would allow 60 million older adults and 
people with disabilities to access dental care.\21\ There is very 
strong support for adding such a benefit; in 2021, roughly nine in ten 
voters supported Medicare oral health coverage.\22\

Ensuring comprehensive coverage in Medicaid would be another way to 
safeguard oral health access for millions of families. Currently, 
states have a patchwork of oral health coverage in Medicaid including 
many that have no coverage or only provide it in emergency 
situations.\23\ Adding a comprehensive benefit in Medicaid would not 
only provide needed whole-person care for millions of people, but it 
could also save our health system $2 billion annually. With better 
access to oral health care, fewer people would be reliant on emergency 
departments to alleviate dental pain. And the data show that states 
that offer more comprehensive care spend less per person on dental care 
than those that don't provide any benefits or only offer emergency 
coverage.\24\

The current lack of coverage for oral health services in Medicare and 
Medicaid is a fundamental gap, and without action it will be extremely 
difficult to make progress on other important components of improving 
oral health. Coverage is a critical step toward making progress on 
integrating dental and medical care, ensuring oral health providers are 
affordable and available in underserved areas, improving access to 
telehealth, and many of the other important issues raised in today's 
hearing.

Conclusion

Millions of individuals and families lack access to affordable, quality 
oral health coverage. Congress has both the power and the 
responsibility to enact policy changes that acknowledge the reality 
that good oral health is central to overall health and financial 
stability. We appreciate the focus from Chair Cardin and Ranking Member 
Daines on this critical issue, and we look forward to continuing to 
work closely with the Finance Subcommittee on Health Care to bring to 
light the deep disparities in oral health care, and the solutions to 
ensure that our health doesn't depend on our wealth.

Statement of Elizabeth Brewer, MS, MPH, Head of U.S. Government Affairs

Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, and members of the 
Subcommittee, on behalf of Haleon and the millions of consumers who use 
our oral health products we thank you for convening this hearing to put 
a spotlight on the unequal access to oral health care that some racial/
ethnic and socioeconomic groups experience. We urge your subcommittee 
to take action on this important issue that impacts people's overall 
health, ability to work and ability to attend school.

Haleon is a world-leading consumer health company with a clear purpose 
to deliver better everyday health with humanity. Haleon advocates for 
improving oral health and hygiene as an integral part of health care. 
Poor oral health and hygiene can cause tooth decay, gum disease and 
tooth loss among a variety of other health complications. Populations 
with a greater oral health risk include individuals with chronic 
diseases and weakened immune systems. Insufficient or inadequate dental 
care can worsen chronic health problems like diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease, hinder timely diagnosis of severe medical 
conditions, and lead to avoidable complications that may require costly 
emergency room visits.\1\

While access to oral health has improved for many Americans there 
continues to be disparities in access. In the United States, people are 
more likely to have poor oral health if they are low-income, uninsured, 
and/or members of racial/ethnic minority, immigrant, or rural 
populations who have suboptimal access to quality oral health care. 
These inequities extend throughout the life course and include 
differences in access to affordable healthy foods, professional dental 
prevention and treatment services, and dental insurance.\2\ These same 
groups are less likely to afford to pay out-of-pocket for dental care, 
do not have private or public dental insurance, or can't get time off 
from work to get to dental care. Dental expenses constitute more than a 
quarter of overall health care out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures and are 
reported to present higher financial barriers than medical, 
prescription pharmaceuticals, and mental health care.\3\

As you know, the Medicare program covers a majority of all Americans 
age 65 and older and plays a vital role in the quality and longevity of 
their lives. However, the program has also long fallen short in 
providing those beneficiaries with sufficient coverage for essential 
oral and dental treatment. Two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries lack 
oral health coverage, and 49% of Medicare beneficiaries have not seen a 
dentist in the last 12 months (as of 2017).\4\ A recent study found 
that use of dental services fell at age 65 for both enrollees in 
tradition fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage.\5\ As a result, 
medical problems and treatment that can be proactively addressed with 
such care have instead gone unchecked, delayed, or canceled, resulting 
in serious clinical, human, and fiscal implications.

The committee's important hearing is being held at an equally important 
time. As you know, the Traditional Medicare program covers a majority 
of all Americans age 65 and older and plays a vital role in the quality 
and longevity of their lives. However, the program has also long fallen 
short in providing those beneficiaries with sufficient coverage for 
essential oral and dental treatment. As a result, medical problems and 
treatment that can be proactively addressed with such care have instead 
gone unchecked, delayed, or canceled, resulting in serious clinical, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
human, and fiscal implications.

Oral health is well established as being essential to a person's 
overall health and well-being. On the basis of their clinical 
experience and extensive peer-reviewed research, numerous medical, 
nursing, and specialty organizations view whole-body systemic health as 
a priority for the future of American health care. Additionally, they 
have identified specific diseases, conditions, and clinical procedures 
for which resolution of oral and dental infections is fundamentally 
necessary to the delivery and efficacy of medical procedures covered by 
the Medicare program.

Despite this documented linkage, access to needed oral and dental care 
has long suffered from inequities that limit many older adults' access 
to oral and dental care. As a consequence, millions of Medicare 
beneficiaries, particularly in marginalized and medically underserved 
communities, face daunting obstacles to the proactive and effective 
clinical care they need and deserve.

This coverage gap exposes Americans age 65 and older to tremendous 
risk. Absent access to oral and dental care, many Medicare 
beneficiaries are unable to receive covered medical treatment they need 
due to the clinical risks posed by their untreated oral and dental 
conditions. This places their health at risk and results in worsening 
medical conditions, avoidable institutionalization, and, tragically, 
higher mortality rates. Similarly, their quality of life is deeply 
compromised by the lack of oral treatment, limiting many beneficiaries' 
ability to be free of pain and enjoy productive and fulfilling lives.

At the same time, restricted access to oral and dental treatment 
compels beneficiaries, taxpayers, and the Medicare program to bear 
higher costs than would otherwise be necessary. By way of example, 
Avalere Health analyzed the savings leading commercial health insurers 
are realizing by providing dental coverage to their enrollees. Even the 
discrete instance examined by Avalere Health (coverage of periodontitis 
treatment for beneficiaries with specific chronic conditions) revealed 
its potential to achieve net Medicare savings of $63.5 billion due to 
the avoidance of costly medical complications.

Fortunately, progress is being made to close the Medicare program's 
coverage gap. Specifically, the Physician Fee Schedule final rule for 
2023 clarified medical coverage for dental services that are 
inextricably linked and substantially related and integral to organ 
transplant surgery, cardiac valve replacement, valvuloplasty 
procedures, and head and neck cancers. The final rule also created the 
opportunity for further coverage expansion by establishing ``a process 
to identify for [the Medicare program's] consideration and review 
submissions of additional dental services that are inextricably linked 
and substantially related and integral to the clinical success of other 
covered medical services.'' Finally, the rule confirmed Medicare 
coverage for the wiring of teeth related to covered medical services, 
the reduction of jaw fractures, the extraction of teeth in preparation 
for radiation treatment of neoplastic disease, dental splints for 
covered treatment of certain medical conditions, and oral or dental 
examinations relating to renal transplant surgery.

0By clarifying Medicare coverage of medically necessary dental services 
and opening an important opportunity for stakeholders to suggest 
clinical scenarios to which medically necessary oral and dental 
services should be extended in the future, the Medicare program has 
opened the door to meaningful progress to improve the clinical success 
of covered medical services. That said, the promise of equitable access 
to clinically- and cost-effective oral and dental care depends to a 
significant degree on this committee and body.

Oral health thought leaders have submitted evidence-based nominations 
for consideration by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS). If accepted as part of the annual process for continued 
expansion of medically necessary coverage, the nominated conditions 
will be included in the Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule for 2024. 
If subsequently advanced to the Fee Schedule's final rule, the coverage 
gap long faced by millions of Medicare beneficiaries will take another 
important step towards closure.

Specifically, the nominated conditions are as follows:

      Medical coverage of medically necessary coverage of diabetes, 
consistent with extensive evidence that medical management of diabetes 
mellitus by reducing blood sugar levels is substantially improved by 
non-surgical periodontal and preventive dental services, as well as the 
Final Rule's solicitation of clinical scenarios including ``management 
of chronic conditions such as diabetes.''
      Medical coverage of medically necessary coverage of blood and 
solid tumor cancers, due to the close association between cancer, 
cancer treatment, immunosuppression, and the heightened risk of oral 
health-related complications during chemotherapy and radiation adjuvant 
therapies.
      Medical coverage of medically necessary coverage of 
complications related to systemic autoimmune disease, consistent with 
extensive evidence that impacted persons are at much higher risk of 
advanced dental decay, tooth loss, and gum disease, as well as 
extensive evidence linking periodontitis to the development of 
rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.

Inclusion of the above medical coverage would have a direct and 
meaningful impact in the lives of many Medicare beneficiaries. As a 
result, we urge this committee to utilize its oversight of CMS and 
engage with Agency officials as they consider these nominations and 
formulate this year's Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule. With your 
continued leadership, we are confident further progress will be 
realized in building a more equitable, clinically successful, and cost-
effective Medicare program for all beneficiaries.

staff. Please do not hesitate to let me know if we can address any 
questions you may have or provide additional information. We thank you 
for the opportunity to submit written testimony for the record.

   Statement of Judith A. Jones, D.D.S., M.P.H., D.Sc.D., Professor, 
            University of Detroit Mercy School of Dentistry
Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for convening a hearing on ``An Oral Health 
Crisis: Identifying and Addressing Health Disparities'' and for this 
opportunity to submit written testimony.

Having reviewed the transcript of the oral testimony, I concur with all 
the speakers, and in particular Drs. Cherae Farmer Dixon, Marko Vujicic 
and Senator Elizabeth Warren. As a Geriatric Dentist and specialist in 
Dental Public Health, I have spent my career caring and advocating for 
oral health care for older adults, veterans, persons with cognitive 
decline, and the homeless.

Despite the documented linkage between oral and general health, 
millions of Medicare beneficiaries, particularly in marginalized and 
medically underserved communities, face daunting obstacles to the 
proactive and effective clinical care they need and deserve. For this 
reason, I have long advocated for the inclusion of dental care in 
Medicare Part B. However, in the absence of successful legislation in 
support of such inclusion, I write in full support of medically 
necessary dental care for Medicare beneficiaries as a stop-gap measure.

The Physician Fee Schedule final rule for 2023 clarified medical 
coverage for dental services that are inextricably linked and 
substantially related and integral to organ transplant surgery, cardiac 
valve replacement, valvuloplasty procedures, and head and neck cancers 
(in FY24). The final rule also created the opportunity for further 
coverage expansion by establishing ``a process to identify for [the 
Medicare program's] consideration and review submissions of additional 
dental services that are inextricably linked and substantially related 
and integral to the clinical success of other covered medical 
services.'' Finally, the rule confirmed Medicare coverage for the 
wiring of teeth related to covered medical services, the reduction of 
jaw fractures, the extraction of teeth in preparation for radiation 
treatment of neoplastic disease, dental splints for covered treatment 
of certain medical conditions, and oral or dental examinations relating 
to renal transplant surgery.

By clarifying Medicare coverage of medically necessary dental services 
and opening an important opportunity for stakeholders to suggest 
clinical scenarios to which medically necessary oral and dental 
services should be extended in the future, the Medicare program has 
opened the door to meaningful progress to improve the clinical success 
of covered medical services. That said, the promise of equitable access 
to clinically- and cost-effective oral and dental care depends to a 
significant degree on this committee and body.

Oral health thought leaders have submitted evidence-based nominations 
for consideration by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS). If accepted as part of the annual process for continued 
expansion of medically necessary coverage, the nominated conditions 
will be included in the Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule for 2024. 
If subsequently advanced to the Fee Schedule's final rule, the coverage 
gap long faced by millions of Medicare beneficiaries will take another 
important step towards closure.

Specifically, the nominated conditions are as follows:

      Medical coverage of medically necessary coverage of diabetes, 
consistent with extensive evidence that medical management of diabetes 
mellitus by reducing blood sugar levels is substantially improved by 
non-surgical periodontal and preventive dental services, as well as the 
Final Rule's solicitation of clinical scenarios including ``management 
of chronic conditions such as diabetes.''

      Medical coverage of medically necessary coverage of blood and 
solid tumor cancers, due to the close association between cancer, 
cancer treatment, immunosuppression, and the heightened risk of oral 
health-related complications during chemotherapy and radiation adjuvant 
therapies.

      Medical coverage of medically necessary coverage of 
complications related to systemic autoimmune disease, consistent with 
extensive evidence that impacted persons are at much higher risk of 
advanced dental decay, tooth loss, and gum disease, as well as 
extensive evidence linking periodontitis to the development of 
rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.

Inclusion of the above medical coverage would have a direct and 
meaningful impact in the lives of many Medicare beneficiaries. I urge 
this committee to use its oversight of CMS and engage with Agency 
officials as they consider these nominations and formulate this year's 
Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule. With your continued leadership, I 
am confident further progress will be realized in building a more 
equitable, clinically successful, and cost-effective Medicare program 
for all beneficiaries.

I would welcome the opportunity to serve as a resource to you and your 
staff. Please do not hesitate to let me know if I can address any 
questions you may have or provide additional information.

Thank you.

RE:  March 29, 2023 Subcommittee Hearing on ``An Oral Health Crisis: 
Identifying and Addressing Health Disparities''

This statement is submitted on behalf of Justice in Aging, an advocacy 
organization with the mission of improving the lives of low-income 
older adults. We use the power of law to fight senior poverty by 
securing access to affordable health care, economic security, and the 
courts for older adults with limited resources. We focus our efforts 
primarily on advocating for people who have been marginalized and 
excluded from justice, such as women, people of color, LGBTQ 
individuals, and people with limited English proficiency.

We appreciate you holding this historic hearing on the oral health 
crisis and disparities in access to necessary oral health care. Justice 
in Aging has worked extensively to improve the oral health of low-
income older adults particularly for communities of color (https://
www.justiceinaging.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Addressing-Oral-
Health-Equity-by-Adding-a-Dental-Benefit-to-Medicare.pdf) and older 
individuals with disabilities (https://justiceinaging.org/wp-content/
uploads/2020/10/Adding-a-Dental-Benefit-to-Medicare-Disability.pdf) who 
experience high rates of oral health disease impacting their overall 
health and quality of life. We urge Congress to address these 
inequities by (1) expanding Medicare coverage to include a 
comprehensive oral health benefit in Medicare Part B; (2) extending 
guaranteed, comprehensive dental coverage to all Medicaid enrollees; 
and (3) expanding eligibility for dental care for veterans provided by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs.

 Lack of Oral Health Coverage Drives Disparities in Access and Health 
                    for Older Adults

The lack of affordable oral health coverage for older adults is a 
significant barrier to accessing oral health care and exacerbates 
racial, geographic, and disability-
related health and wealth disparities. Yet, our nation's largest health 
programs serving older adults do not offer guaranteed coverage of oral 
health care. Medicare, the primary source of health coverage for older 
adults, explicitly excludes coverage (https://www.justiceinaging.org/
wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Creating-an-Oral-Health-Benefit-in-Medicare-
A-Statutory-Analysis.pdf?eType=EmailBlastContent&eId
=2071568b-2eb3-4b7b-a9ff-da101bff3bfa) for most dental services, 
leaving 47% of Medicare enrollees--or 24 million--without any oral 
health coverage.\1\ Medicaid, which serves 7.5 million people age 65 
and over \2\ and many more older adults ages 50 to 64, does not require 
states to cover adult dental benefits resulting in inequitable coverage 
across the country.\3\ Meanwhile, only 15% of the 9.2 million U.S. 
veterans receive comprehensive dental coverage through the office of 
Veterans Affairs.\4\

Oral health care is expensive, so it is not surprising that those 
without coverage or even those with limited coverage cite not being 
able to pay for treatment as the biggest barrier to accessing care.\5\ 
As of 2020, the median income for older adults is just $26,668.\6\ 
Moreover, 9% of older adults--or 5 million individuals--were living in 
poverty. Black (17%), Hispanic (17%), and Asian (12%) older adults 
experience poverty at much higher rates compared to white older adults 
(7%).\7\

Unable to afford care, many older adults must forgo treatment. For 
example, surveys show that nearly half of all Medicare enrollees--
approximately 30 million older adults and people with disabilities--did 
not have a dental visit in the last year.\8\ This is even more severe 
among populations of color who have lower incomes compared to white 
older adults due to ongoing and historic racial discrimination. Sixty-
eight percent of Black and 61% of Hispanic Medicare enrollees, for 
example, did not see a dentist in the last year compared to 42% of 
white Medicare enrollees.\9\

Without access to treatment, older adults experience high rates of poor 
oral health, with certain populations suffering more acutely. 
Nationwide, 17% of older adults have no remaining natural teeth--a rate 
that has been steadily decreasing each year. Yet, among Black older 
adults, the percent of individuals with complete tooth loss is 28%--
almost double the national average--with minimal change over the past 
decade.\10\ Black and Hispanic older adults are also two to three times 
more likely to have severe periodontitis--or gum disease--than white 
older adults and twice as likely to have untreated tooth decay.\11\

#page=411.
    \11\ Id.

The impact of poor oral health on overall health for older adults is 
substantial and exacerbates health disparities while driving increased 
health care spending for chronic conditions. For example, periodontitis 
is associated with chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease, 
conditions that disproportionately impact communities of color.\12\ 
Most recently, oral health has been linked to Alzheimer's and dementia, 
conditions that Black and Hispanic older adults are twice as likely as 
white older adults to experience.\13\ Research shows that individuals 
with dementia are more likely to have poor oral health and poor oral 
health increases the risk of developing dementia.\14\ Further, 
untreated gum disease can lead to infections like aspiration pneumonia 
resulting in costly hospitalizations and deaths,\15\ particularly among 
nursing facility residents, while ongoing pain associated with 
untreated oral health disease increases the likelihood that opioids 
will be prescribed and abused.\16\

Older Adults Need Comprehensive Dental Coverage to Remedy Inequities

Dental coverage is the largest determinant of whether an individual can 
access oral health care. Therefore, expanding coverage is an essential 
step in ensuring access and addressing disparities. In fact, research 
demonstrates that expanding dental coverage reduces racial and ethnic 
disparities in access to dental services.\17\ Adding a dental benefit 
to Medicare Part B would provide comprehensive coverage to all 61 
million older adults and people with disabilities enrolled in the 
program and reduce disparities based on race, disability, income, and 
geography. As the National Institutes of Health reported, ``because the 
removal of cost and insurance barriers promotes the use of dental 
services by older adults, the addition of an oral health benefit in 
Medicare would improve access to care nationwide, especially for low-
income older adults and those of some racial/ethnic groups.''\18\ 
Meanwhile, extending guaranteed comprehensive dental coverage to all 
adult Medicaid enrollees and expanding Veteran's coverage would ensure 
older adults and aging adults with disabilities not enrolled in 
Medicare have access to necessary dental treatment.

       Letter Submitted by Dushanka V. Kleinman, D.D.S., M.Sc.D.
U.S. Senate
Committee on Finance
Subcommittee on Health Care

Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, and esteemed members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for convening a hearing on ``An Oral Health 
Crisis: Identifying and Addressing Health Disparities'' and for this 
opportunity to submit this testimony.

By way of background, I am a recently retired Professor, Principal 
Associate Dean, and Associate Dean for Research at the University of 
Maryland School of Public Health, a Diplomat of the American Board of 
Dental Public Health, and a member of the Santa Fe Group. Prior to 
joining the University of Maryland in 2007, I had the privilege of 
providing public service for 28 years as the Deputy Director and Acting 
Director of the National Institute of Health's National Institute of 
Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) and in the U.S. Public Health 
Service Commissioned Corps, where I served as Rear Admiral, Assistant 
Surgeon General, and Chief Dental Officer. In these roles, I have 
witnessed the critical importance of integrating oral health literacy 
together with the application of new knowledge and health services. 
This was clearly demonstrated by the rapid actions taken after the 
tragic passing of Deamonte Driver. Having devoted my entire dental 
public health professional career services in the state of Maryland, I 
have long been deeply appreciative of your commitment to and leadership 
in advancing holistic health care including oral and dental care and 
health literacy.

The committee's important hearing is being held at a very important 
time. As you know, the Traditional Medicare program covers a majority 
of all Americans age 65 and older and plays a vital role in the quality 
and longevity of their lives. However, the program has also long fallen 
short in providing those beneficiaries with sufficient coverage for 
essential oral and dental treatment. As a result, medical problems and 
treatment that can be proactively addressed with such care have instead 
gone unchecked, been delayed or canceled, with serious clinical, human, 
and fiscal implications.

Oral health is well established as being essential to a person's 
overall health and well-being. On the basis of their clinical 
experience and extensive peer-reviewed research, numerous medical, 
nursing, and specialty organizations view whole-body systemic health as 
a priority for the future of American health care. Additionally, they 
have identified specific diseases, conditions, and clinical procedures 
for which resolution of oral and dental infections is fundamentally 
necessary to the delivery and efficacy of effective medical procedures 
covered by the Medicare program.

Despite this documented linkage, access to needed oral and dental care 
has long suffered from inequities that limit access to oral and dental 
care for many older adults. As a consequence, millions of Medicare 
beneficiaries, particularly in marginalized and medically underserved 
communities, face daunting obstacles to the proactive and effective 
clinical care they need and deserve.

This coverage gap exposes Americans age 65 and older to tremendous 
risk. Absent access to oral and dental care, many Medicare 
beneficiaries are unable to receive covered medical treatment they need 
due to the clinical risks posed by their untreated oral and dental 
conditions. This places their health at risk and results in worsening 
medical conditions, avoidable institutionalization, and, tragically, 
higher mortality rates. Similarly, their quality of life is deeply 
compromised by the lack of oral treatment, limiting many beneficiaries' 
ability to be free of pain and enjoy productive and fulfilling lives.

At the same time, restricted access to oral and dental treatment 
compels beneficiaries, taxpayers, and the Medicare program to bear 
higher costs than would otherwise be necessary. By way of example, 
Avalere Health analyzed the savings leading commercial health insurers 
are realizing by providing dental coverage to their enrollees. Even the 
discrete instance examined by Avalere Health (coverage of periodontitis 
treatment for beneficiaries with specific chronic conditions) revealed 
its potential to achieve net Medicare savings of $63.5 billion over a 
ten-year period due to the avoidance of costly medical complications.

Fortunately, progress is being made to close the Medicare program's 
coverage gap. Specifically, the Physician Fee Schedule final rule for 
2023 clarified medical coverage for dental services that are 
inextricably linked and substantially related and integral to organ 
transplant surgery, cardiac valve replacement, valvuloplasty 
procedures, and head and neck cancers. The final rule also created the 
opportunity for further coverage expansion by establishing ``a process 
to identify for [the Medicare program's] consideration and review 
submissions of additional dental services that are inextricably linked 
and substantially related and integral to the clinical success of other 
covered medical services.'' Finally, the rule confirmed Medicare 
coverage for the wiring of teeth related to covered medical services, 
the reduction of jaw fractures, the extraction of teeth in preparation 
for radiation treatment of neoplastic disease, dental splints for 
covered treatment of certain medical conditions, and oral or dental 
examinations relating to renal transplant surgery.

By clarifying Medicare coverage of medically necessary dental services 
and opening an important opportunity for stakeholders to suggest 
clinical scenarios to which medically necessary oral and dental 
services should be extended in the future, the Medicare program has 
opened the door to meaningful progress to improve the clinical success 
of covered medical services. That said, the promise of equitable access 
to clinically- and cost-effective oral and dental care depends to a 
significant degree on this committee and body.

Oral health thought leaders have submitted evidence-based nominations 
for consideration by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS). If accepted as part of the annual process for continued 
expansion of medically necessary coverage, the nominated conditions 
will be included in the Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule for 2024. 
If subsequently advanced to the Fee Schedule's final rule, the coverage 
gap long faced by millions of Medicare beneficiaries will take another 
important step towards closure.

Specifically, the nominated conditions are as follows:

      Medical coverage of medically necessary coverage of diabetes, 
consistent with extensive evidence that medical management of diabetes 
mellitus by reducing blood sugar levels is substantially improved by 
non-surgical periodontal and preventive dental services, as well as the 
Final Rule's solicitation of clinical scenarios including ``management 
of chronic conditions such as diabetes.''

      Medical coverage of medically necessary coverage of blood and 
solid tumor cancers, due to the close association between cancer, 
cancer treatment, immunosuppression, and the heightened risk of oral 
health-related complications during chemotherapy and radiation adjuvant 
therapies.

      Medical coverage of medically necessary coverage of 
complications related to systemic autoimmune disease, consistent with 
extensive evidence that impacted persons are at much higher risk of 
advanced dental decay, tooth loss, and gum disease, as well as 
extensive evidence linking periodontitis to the development of 
rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.

Inclusion of the above medical coverage would have a direct and 
meaningful impact in the lives of many Medicare beneficiaries. I can 
attest to this on a personal note: my own family benefitted from my 
husband's dental care prior to his aortic valve replacement procedure, 
which reduced the risk of infection that would have greatly compromised 
his treatment. As a result of all the factors described above, I would 
like to urge this committee to utilize its oversight of CMS and engage 
with Agency officials as they consider these nominations and formulate 
this year's Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule. With your continued 
leadership, I am confident further progress will be realized in 
building a more equitable, clinically successful, and cost-effective 
Medicare program for all beneficiaries.

I would welcome the opportunity to serve as a resource to you and your 
staff. Please do not hesitate to let me know if I can address any 
questions you may have or provide additional information.

Thank you.

Executive Summary

Adults with severe intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD) 
experience more severe dental disease while facing greater barriers to 
accessing dental care than any other population in America. This unique 
patient population often lacks the mental and/or physical capacity to 
care for their own mouth, are incapable of earning an income to pay for 
dental care on their own and are not guaranteed dental coverage with 
their medical Medicaid benefits. Therefore, this vulnerable population 
is left dependent on charitable care that is often incapable of 
providing the complex treatment they need. This paper intends to 
describe access to dental care problems facing America's special needs 
populations.

Key points:

      Dentistry is the most common unmet healthcare need for the 
severely disabled.
      Untreated dental decay and periodontal disease causes pain and 
infection in a population that lacks the ability to communicate their 
suffering.
      Each state must choose to offer dental coverage after age 21 for 
those whose severe disabilities qualify them for Medicaid medical 
coverage. Some states, like Alabama, choose not to.
      Severely affected patients often cannot safely receive dental 
care in a dental office and require treatment in a hospital operating 
room. However, Medicaid reimbursement for hospital facility fees and 
anesthesia services is below the cost of providing this care. A new CMS 
rules change could increase hospital reimbursement from $203 to $1,958. 
This should improve access to hospital based dental care, but each 
state will need to implement the rule.

Special Health Care Needs (SHCN) Defined and Scope of Need

The term ``disability'' has been used to describe individuals with a 
wide range of challenges that are beyond the scope of this discussion. 
This paper will address adults with SHCN who were born with a moderate 
to severe cognitive and/or physical impairment like autism, cerebral 
palsy, and other syndromes. This population fall into the category of 
``intellectual and developmental disabilities'' (IDD). The target 
population is comprised of individuals with impairments that qualify 
them for Medicaid medical benefits under Social Security.

According to Waldman, et al., in 2017, approximately 12.6% of Americans 
had a severe disability. The 2000 Surgeon General's report on Oral 
Health in American identified oral disease as a problem for those with 
SCHN and the 2021 follow-up report further documents the problem 
persists. Key barriers to oral health described are lack of third-party 
coverage, high costs associated with treating many oral conditions in 
the population, poor behavior during treatment, and too few dentists 
trained to provide care for this population.

Dental Needs and Challenges for This Population

Patients with severe IDD often lack the mental, behavioral, or physical 
ability to brush and floss themselves, cooperate for others to provide 
oral hygiene for them, or tolerate professional dental care in a 
traditional setting. This lack of daily preventive care increases 
incidences of both tooth decay and chronic inflammation and bone loss 
(periodontal disease) around the teeth. Tooth decay leads to pain, 
infection and swelling that can trigger aggressive behavior in many of 
the intellectually impaired. Periodontal disease results in chronically 
ulcerated pockets of tissue around the teeth that destroys the 
supporting bone leading to tooth mobility, difficulty eating, and tooth 
loss. This chronic inflammation places a constant and significant 
physiological stress on the patient's body and serves as a portal for 
bacteria to enter the blood stream. Difficulties eating also decrease 
nutritional intake and overall health.

Treatment for this population in a traditional dental office setting 
often requires the use of physical restraints to safely control the 
patient's behavior. Advanced pharmacologic sedation can help some cases 
but, due to the atypical anatomy and physiology of these patients, 
sedation carries significant risk of adverse reactions including death. 
Often, the safest method of providing dental care is to treat patients 
with severe IDD in a hospital operating room under general anesthesia. 
Simply stated, providing advanced dental care for many adults with 
severe IDDs outside an operating room has and will continue to result 
in harm to these patients. Unfortunately, it is often the only option 
available.

Insurance Coverage Gap

Medicaid provides medical coverage for many of the most severely 
affected individuals with IDD, regardless of socioeconomic status. 
However, CMS only stipulates Medicaid dental coverage through age 21. 
Some families carry their IDD loved one on their family dental policy 
until the child reaches 26y of age. After this age, only families that 
can afford a separate, stand-alone dental policy are able to carry 
dental insurance for their IDD loved ones. Most families simply pay 
out-of-pocket for the care they can afford.

Stand-alone dental policies rarely cover the hospitalization or general 
anesthesia required to safely treat this population, and private 
medical policies rarely cover dental treatment. Most of the IDD adult 
population falls into this gap where they lack either the medical 
coverage to gain access to medically necessary sedation/general 
anesthesia or the dental coverage to afford extractions and 
restorations.

Medicare plans have emerged that provided limited dental coverage for a 
small group of disabled citizens. Medicare Advantage (Part C) includes 
coverage called Medicare Dual-Eligible Special Needs Plan (D-SNP). 
Patients who qualify for these plans may receive dental coverage with a 
low annual spending limit. However, very few seem to qualify for these 
plans, as the plans require recipients be eligible for both Medicare 
and Medicaid, limiting eligibility to:

    1.  Medicaid eligible disabled who are over 65y of age.
    2.  Medicaid eligible disabled who have a Medicare eligible parent 
who is deceased or receiving Medicare benefits.
    3.  Patients who were able to work enough to become Social Security 
eligible prior to becoming disabled.

This coverage does not cover patients who were born with profound 
intellectual and developmental disabilities, are between 21 and 65y of 
age, and whose parents are young enough to not qualify for Medicare. 
These are often the most fragile and medically/behaviorally complex 
patients.

Access to Operating Room Dentistry: Nationally, the American Dental 
Association (ADA), American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) and 
American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) worked 
with the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a rule 
change that improves hospital reimbursement for dental services. This 
rule creates a new code specific to dental care (APC 5871) that went 
into effect on January 1, 2023, and increases facility fee 
reimbursement from $203.64 to $1,958.92. However, if CMS does not 
mandate use of the new code, then state Medicaid agencies may choose to 
implement and reimburse for it. Also, note that while this rule change 
covers the medical costs of operating room dentistry, it does not 
address the lack coverage for dental services. It also does not address 
care delivered in ambulatory care centers instead of hospitals.

Conclusion:

The need for dental care for adults with profound intellectual and 
developmental disabilities is not being met by current healthcare 
system. The current system relies on benevolence to meet the oral 
health needs of our most vulnerable Americans with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities, but this system is not capable of safely 
meeting the need. America must act at the national level to address 
these oral health needs. Extending basic oral health benefits to adults 
with IDD covered by Medicaid would take an investment but could 
dramatically change the oral health of this fragile population. Without 
action, this population of vulnerable adults will continue to suffer 
with untreated oral infection, inflammation, and pain.

     Statement of Chapman Bryant II, Policy and Advocacy Associate

The National Down Syndrome Congress (NDSC) is the country's oldest 
national organization for people with Down syndrome, their families, 
and the professionals who work with them. We provide information, 
advocacy and support concerning all aspects of life for individuals 
with Down syndrome, and work to create a national climate in which all 
people will recognize and embrace the value and dignity of people with 
Down syndrome.

NDSC thanks Senator Cardin (D-MD) and the entire United States Senate 
Finance Committee's Subcommittee on Health for holding a hearing to 
discuss the oral health crisis to identify and address health 
disparities. Individuals with Down syndrome face significant oral 
health challenges including issues with access and coverage of care 
with Medicaid, difficulties with self-care, medication side effects, 
and systemic health conditions.

The National Council on Disabilities (NCD) published a report entitled 
``Neglected for Too Long: Dental Care for People with Intellectual and 
Developmental Disabilities,''\1\ highlighting the significant lack of 
dental care and access to oral health services for individuals with 
intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The report 
highlights the critical need for increased awareness and action to 
address the oral health disparities faced by people with IDD. It notes 
that individuals with IDD are at a higher risk of developing oral 
health issues due to a combination of factors, including difficulties 
in self-care, medication side effects, and systemic health conditions. 
Found in the report, a series of studies concluded that 75% of dental 
students reported little to no preparation in providing care to people 
with IDD.

NCD_Dental%20Brief%202017_508.pdf.

NDSC supports the information provided within these reports, and we 
hope the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance's Subcommittee on Health will 
take into consideration the severe oral health disparities facing 
individuals with Down syndrome. On top of these challenges, one of the 
biggest obstacles deals with the lack of access or coverage by Medicaid 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
for people living with Down syndrome.

Furthermore, Medicaid may not cover all necessary oral health services 
for people with Down syndrome. For example, orthodontic treatment may 
not be covered, even though it may be essential for proper dental 
alignment and function. Additionally, Medicaid may not cover certain 
specialized services, such as sedation or general anesthesia, which may 
be necessary for individuals with Down syndrome who have difficulty 
tolerating dental procedures.\2\

Developmental Disabilities--A Fiscal Analysis, https://ncd.gov/
publications/2022/medicaid-oral-health-coverage-adults-IDD.

Overall, these issues can lead to significant barriers in accessing 
oral health services for people with Down syndrome who rely on Medicaid 
for healthcare coverage. It is essential to address these issues to 
ensure that individuals with Down syndrome have equal access to quality 
oral health services and can maintain good oral health and overall 
well-being. If you have any questions, please contact Chapman Bryant,

                                 ______
                                 
                  Statement Submitted by Richard North
My background is in non-profit health management, 21 years for the 
American Cancer Society, the last five as CEO of the Oregon chapter, 
and seven years as director of the Oregon Physicians for Social 
Responsibility's safe food program. I now volunteer with a large group 
of scientists, doctors and dentists all over North America to stop 
water fluoridation.

Everyone wants children and adults to have better dental health. The 
question is: What are the best ways to achieve that--and what ways 
actually do more harm than good?

I recommend taking the millions of dollars currently used for 
fluoridation to pay for improving access to low-income children to 
professional dental care--via mobile dental vans. They have a proven 
track record, especially when they can come to schools, thereby 
eliminating transportation problems for parents in getting their 
children to dentists and dental hygienists.

Mobile dental vans are a win-win-win situation. They can provide dental 
care for children whose parents currently don't have access to 
professionals, they reduce the health harms of fluoridation and they 
can be supported by everyone.

My opposition to fluoridation comes after 11 years of thoroughly 
researching the issue. It has two main foundations: health harms and 
ineffectiveness.

There is already a consensus (even including the CDC, one of 
fluoridation's main promoters) that fluoride's effectiveness in 
preventing cavities is mainly topical, not swallowed. Even if you 
accepted the CDC's questionable estimate that fluoridation reduces 
cavities by 25%, this only equates to 0.5 cavities per child, since 
children aged 6-17 average 2.1 cavities in their permanent teeth (Slade 
et al., Journal of Dental Research, 2018).

The Cochrane Collaboration is considered the gold standard of 
evaluating effectiveness. In its comprehensive 2015 review, it 
concluded ``We did not identify any evidence . . . to determine the 
effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries in adults. . 
. . There is insufficient evidence to determine whether water 
fluoridation results in a change in disparities in caries levels across 
socio-economic status.''

Finally, World Health Organization data show cavity rates in children 
(age 12) have dropped as much in nations that don't fluoridate as in 
nations that do.

Bottom line: It's questionable if fluoridation has any effectiveness in 
preventing cavities, but if it does, it's very minimal. Please compare 
this to just one of many serious health harms connected with it, 
including endocrine disruption, kidney damage, diabetes, 
hypothyroidism, fluorosis and many others. I'd like to emphasize just 
one in more depth: permanent brain damage, especially loss of IQ.

We all know that air and water pollution disproportionately harm low-
income and minority families, one of the worst examples the lead 
contamination in Flint, MI. And we all know there's no safe level of 
lead. Even the smallest amounts can cause permanent brain damage, 
especially lowered IQ.

But many do not know that recent studies, many funded by the National 
Institutes of Health, have found that fluoridated water can harm 
pregnant women and lower their children's IQs as much as lead.

Here are quotes from some of the world's top scientists:

Dr. Philippe Grandjean, Harvard professor and author of 500 peer-
reviewed papers: ``Fluoride seems to fit in with lead, mercury and 
other poisons that cause chemical brain drain.''

Dr. David Bellinger, researcher who has authored over 100 studies on 
lead: ``It's actually very similar to the effect size that's seen with 
childhood exposure to lead.''

Dr. Dimitri Christakis, pediatrician and co-editor of the Journal of 
the American Medical Association Pediatrics: Fluoridation is, quote, 
``an effect size which is sizeable--on par with lead.'' He also said if 
his wife were pregnant, ``I would not have my wife drink fluoridated 
water.''

Moreover, a recent National Toxicology Program review found that 52 out 
of 55 studies linked higher fluoride with substantially lowered IQ, 
including 18 out of 19 rated the highest quality. It said, ``Several of 
the highest quality studies showing lower IQs in children were done in 
optimally fluoridated (0.7 parts per million) areas.''

Contrast this massive scientific evidence to assertions of the two 
major promoters, the CDC and American Dental Association, that 
fluoridation is safe for everyone. That's just not true.

It's especially unfair for low-income families, who can't afford 
bottled water or expensive filters to avoid this brain damage. They 
have no choice. Fluoride is every bit as much an environmental 
injustice as Flint and far more widespread--it's contaminating three 
fourths of our public water supply.

Please, stop this unscientific, unjustified practice from further 
harming our pregnant women and children. Let's turn this negative 
situation into a positive one.

Thank you for your consideration.

U.S. Senate
Committee on Finance
Subcommittee on Health Care

Chairman Benjamin Cardin, Ranking Member Steve Daines, and 
distinguished members of the Senate Finance Committee, Subcommittee on 
Health Care thank you for holding this hearing on the important topic 
Oral Health Crisis: Identifying and Addressing Health Disparities. I am 
Nancy Chapman, MPH, RD, a public health nutritionist who has managed 
the Oral Health Alliance (OHA), a Healthy People 2030 Champion, over 
the past six years. I will present recommendations for oral health 
preventive practices to help forestall and reverse this country's oral 
health crisis. Our informal Alliance represents oral health providers, 
nutrition and public health professional organizations, nutrition and 
dental researchers at dental schools nationwide, groups representing 
children and older adults, industry, and school-aged and community 
groups interested in addressing disparities in the prevalence and 
prevention of dental caries throughout the United States. The OHA 
focuses on preventive oral health practices, especially for under-
resourced communities, that often get overlooked in policy discussions 
focused on oral health treatment services and reimbursement of those 
services.

The OHA agrees with comments made at your March 29th hearing that 
pointed to the need to increase family literacy about the essential 
role that poor oral health plays in overall health deficits across the 
life span. To prevent dentsnacks andarly, the OHA urges instruction of 
pregnant women, young children, new parents, and caregivers about 
preventive practices to follow throughout the lifespan--decreasing 
frequent intakes of foods high in fermentable carbohydrates, brushing 
teeth, cleaning between teeth, chewing sugar free gum for 20 minutes 
after meals or snacks, and drinking fluoridated water or using 
fluoridated toothpaste and fluoride tablets. For vast number of 
communities underserved by dental practices, education about preventive 
oral health practices can be delivered through telehealth channels, 
mobile health units, in schools, early childhood education centers, 
older American centers, workplaces, farm worker communities, and other 
sites that were identified by other hearing witnesses. Dental caries is 
completely preventable with access to proper knowledge about dental 
hygiene, access to adequate healthy foods, access to affordable oral 
health tools, such as toothbrushes, fluoridated toothpaste, dental 
floss, and sugar free gum, and access to fluoridated water or tablets. 
Compared to expenditures on emergency dental services, preventive 
services are affordable and inexpensive.

Why support preventive oral health practices? The answer is that poor 
oral health is a silent epidemic that impacts those who are food 
insecure, underinsured, under-resourced, and isolated. Poor oral health 
has a disproportionate health and economic impact on the healthcare 
system, society, and families. About 18 percent of children under 6 
have dental caries climbing to 45 percent of those children aged 6-11 
that have at least one decayed tooth. 1 in 6 adolescents have untreated 
tooth decay, and I in 6 adults aged 65 or older have lost all their 
teeth. If tooth decay remains untreated, it can affect nutritional 
intake and lead to tooth loss and severe health and mental 
complications. In the US alone, the 2021 cost of highly preventable 
dental care cost nearly $162 Billion. Medicare and Medicaid spent about 
$4 billion. Private spending was up $11 billion and out-of-pocket up 
$13 billion from 2020-2021, according to American Dental Association 
data. On average, 34 million school hours are lost annually due to 
unplanned/emergency dental care needs; and more than $45 billion (US 
dollars) are lost each year in productivity because of untreated oral 
disease.

Oral health and nutrition have a multifaceted-relationship--oral 
infectious diseases, including dental caries, impact the ability to eat 
healthy foods that meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) and 
nutrition status across the life span, and nutrition and diet can 
affect the development and integrity of the oral cavity and progression 
of oral diseases. Social and economic conditions are important 
determinants of oral health. Over the past five years, the OHA members 
have offered evidence on the benefits of preventive oral health 
practices and information on how professionals and communities are 
implementing oral health prevention programs to leaders and experts 
within ODPHP, CDC, CMS, HRSA, and NIDCR as well as USDA. The OHA 
website, https://oralhealthalliance.org/, contains copious links to 
research across life stages and for each preventive oral health 
practice.

We continuously share extensive scientific evidence and public health 
justification for including affordable and feasible advice on 
preventive oral health practices in the 2025-30 DGAs. Specifically, we 
recommend all health and nutrition policies highlight five key 
practices ? to decrease frequent intakes of foods high in fermentable 
carbohydrates, to brush teeth, to clean between teeth, to chew sugar 
free gum for 20 minutes after meals or snacks, and to drink fluoridated 
water or use with fluoridated toothpaste or fluoride tablets.

In past few years, several major reports have been published that 
confirm the increasing domestic and global concern about the health 
inequity of untreated dental caries and its impact on dietary intake, 
health, and prevalence of chronic disease.

January 2023--WHO Oral Health Action Plan recommended taking a public 
health approach that provides services that include oral health 
promotion and prevention as well as treatment and rehabilitation 
interventions related to oral diseases and conditions across the life 
course. The Plan stated that achieving the highest attainable standard 
of oral health is a fundamental right of every human being. The WHO 
stated that ``Oral health affects people physically and psychologically 
and influences how they grow, enjoy life, look, speak, chew, taste food 
and socialize, as well as their feelings of social well-being.''

November 2022--National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine 
(NASEM) workshop, Sharing and Exchanging Idea and Global Experiences on 
Community-engaged Approaches to Oral Health, focused on the new WHO and 
FDI World Dental Federation definition of oral health as vital to 
general health and well-being and on approaches to community-engaged 
oral health.

December 2021--NIDCR Oral Health in America: Advances and Challenges 
reiterated the link between oral health and overall health, identified 
safe and effective measures and dietary changes to improve oral health, 
and addressed four of the top chronic diseases related to oral health.

December 2020--the HP 2030 Oral Health Objectives, included 15 of the 
358 health objectives, recognized the growing problems of untreated 
dental caries and their impact on dietary intake, health, and 
prevalence of chronic diseases of individuals across the life span, 
especially from under-resourced communities, due to social and economic 
conditions.

December 2020--the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) 
recognized ``dental caries as one of the diet-related chronic diseases 
that pose a major public health problem for Americans.'' The DGAs 
stated: ``Good dental health is essential to overall health as well as 
the ability to chew food properly.''

With the opportunity to prevent the substantial problems of dental 
caries and related chronic diseases, federal agencies should widely 
disseminate messages, program, and policies promoting the benefits of 
adopting routine oral health practices in educational materials for 
millions of Americans suffering from, or at risk for, dental caries, 
especially those with social and economic challenges. The 2025-2030 
DGAs, under development by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee 
(DGAC), is a primary public health document, recognized worldwide, that 
should carry forward advice to decrease frequent intakes of foods high 
in fermentable carbohydrates, brush teeth, clean between teeth, chew 
sugar free gum for 20 minutes after meals or snacks, and drink 
fluoridated water. The OHA requests the Senate Finance Committee 
leaders send a letter to the Secretaries of HHS and USDA strongly 
encouraging the DGAC review the evidence supporting specific preventive 
oral health practices and request their inclusion in the 2025-2030 DGAs 
recommendations. Thank you for this opportunity to share the 
recommendations of thousands of individuals that work to correct the 
oral health crisis through multiple channels.

Majority Leader                     Minority Leader
U.S. Senate                         U.S. Senate
Washington, DC 20510                Washington, DC 20510

Dear Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell:

As you embark on the 118th Congress, we urge you to prioritize a policy 
change to improve oral health in America: extending guaranteed, 
comprehensive dental coverage to all adults who rely on Medicaid for 
their health care. Poor oral health hurts more than our mouths. It can 
impede an equitable and lasting economic recovery by harming our 
overall health, employability, and financial security. By securing 
Medicaid dental coverage for adults, Congress can drive health and 
economic gains for families, states, and our nation.

We urge you and your colleagues to cosponsor and work to advance the 
Medicaid Dental Benefit Act (S. 570/H.R. 1342), led by Senator Cardin 
and Congresswoman Barragan in their respective chambers, which would 
make comprehensive dental care a mandatory component of Medicaid 
coverage for adults in every state. As detailed below, ensuring 
Medicaid adult dental coverage is vital to advancing racial and 
economic equity; supporting employment and economic growth; improving 
people's overall health; and protecting our health care resources.

Oral health coverage is a glaring hole in Medicaid benefits that are 
otherwise a lifeline to millions of adults and families. Adult dental 
coverage is optional for state Medicaid programs. While children 
enrolled in Medicaid have guaranteed, comprehensive dental benefits, 
federal policy does not have similar standards for adults who rely on 
the program. As a result, oral health coverage for adults varies widely 
across states, and some states don't cover it at all. This puts care 
out of reach for millions of people, especially given that adults with 
low incomes confront the greatest cost barriers to oral health care out 
of any age or income group. In fact, cost barriers to dental care for 
adults have only increased \1\ in recent years, with Black and Hispanic 
communities reporting the highest financial hurdles to accessing the 
care they need.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ https://familiesusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HPI-CC-FUSA-
WhitePaper_0721.pdf.

Adding adult dental coverage to Medicaid is key to advancing racial, 
economic, and health justice. Lack of access to dental care is one of 
the most overlooked examples of health disparities today. America's 
entrenched racial and economic inequities risk individual and community 
well-being. The very people who are also most likely to get sick or 
lose their job from health and economic crises also face the steepest 
structural and historic barriers to dental services: people with low 
incomes; Black, Hispanic, and other people of color; tribal 
communities; people with disabilities; and those in rural America, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
among others.

Without access to affordable dental care, these communities are more 
likely to have poor oral health. For example, among adults facing cost 
barriers to dental care, racial disparities \2\ have widened in the 
last decade. Securing Medicaid oral health coverage for adults could 
alleviate needless suffering while also advancing equity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \2\ https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-
org/files/resources/research/hpi/hpigraphic_0421_3.pdf.

When policy and cost barriers keep dental care out of reach, it 
threatens national prosperity. For many adults, being able to afford 
dental care could be the key to getting a new job or supporting their 
economic security. Yet three in ten working-age adults with lower 
incomes say that the appearance of their mouth and teeth affects their 
ability to interview for a job.\3\ The U.S. loses more than $45 billion 
each year in productivity \4\ due to untreated dental disease.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \3\ https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-
org/files/resources/research/hpi/us-oral-health-well-being.pdf.
    \4\ https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/oral_health_disparities/
index.htm.

Research shows, however, that Medicaid adult dental coverage can 
improve employability,\5\ while reducing associated racial inequities 
in the job market. Good oral health can also increase wages \6\ for 
women in the workforce. These gains could be pivotal for people 
recovering from pandemic unemployment, which most hurt women and women 
of color.

    \6\ https://www.jstor.org/stable/25703463?seq=1.

Expanding oral health coverage is a cost-effective way to support 
better health at every age. Lacking access to dental care risks our 
overall health and wastes resources. Poor oral health can make chronic 
conditions, like diabetes, more difficult and expensive to manage. It 
may also cause dangerous and costly pregnancy complications, with risks 
to parents and children. But analysis \7\ by the ADA Health Policy 
Institute, Community Catalyst, and Families USA finds that extending 
Medicaid adult dental benefits could lead to significant savings: With 
improved oral health, the policy could save at least $273 million 
annually in medical costs related to diabetes, heart disease, and 
pregnancy. It could also lower overall state spending on dental care.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ https://familiesusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HPI-CC-FUSA-
WhitePaper_0721.pdf.

The research, however, does not account for other key savings this 
policy would yield over time, meaning that the estimated price tag of 
$535 million in federal spending is likely higher than what we would 
see in reality. For example, greater access to dental care would reduce 
other unnecessary health spending, such as averting hospital emergency 
department visits for dental pain. This could save the U.S. health 
system $2 billion \8\ per year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ https://familiesusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/HPI-CC-FUSA-
WhitePaper_0721.pdf.

A growing number of experts and community leaders support lifting 
barriers to dental coverage. Building upon decades of work on this 
issue at the state and national levels, community leaders, health 
equity advocates and oral health stakeholders have actively voiced our 
support \9\ for Medicaid oral health coverage to the Biden-Harris 
administration and Congress. For nearly a decade, the American Dental 
Association \10\ has also publicly supported making adult dental 
coverage a mandatory Medicaid benefit. We are encouraged by the 
President's FY 2022 budget, which recognizes the value of dental 
coverage in its proposal to add this benefit to Medicare. At the same 
time, policymakers must not neglect adults with low incomes who count 
on Medicaid.

    \10\ https://www.ada.org/about/governance/current-
policies#medicaidchip.

Congress can and must advance federal policy that makes comprehensive 
oral health coverage for adults a permanent part of the Medicaid 
program for all states. Continuing to make dental coverage inaccessible 
for some communities, including people of color, tribal communities, 
and adults with low incomes, harms us all. Oral health shapes our 
overall health and shared prosperity, and will influence the direction 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
of our recovery from the pandemic.

By advancing the Medicaid Dental Benefit Act, lawmakers can promote a 
sustainable economic recovery and reduce vast health inequities by 
guaranteeing dental coverage to all adults who count on Medicaid, no 
matter where they live.

Thank you for your consideration.

U.S. Senate
Committee on Finance
Subcommittee on Health Care

Dear Senator Benjamin Cardin, Steve Daines and the Senate Finance 
Health Care Subcommittee:

Thank you for having a hearing on Oral Health. Oral health is often 
considered elective because few die from it. However, oral pain and 
disease can be debilitating and life altering. Disparities, some caused 
by authorities, are a concern and can be attenuated.

I am a practicing dentist with 49 years of experience in disadvantaged 
rural communities, the wealthiest communities, managed care, Indian 
Health Service, private practice and as an educator to and with the 
finest cosmetic dentists in the world. My two professions, dentistry 
and public health are dear to my heart. With your help we can do 
better. Your witnesses were not practicing dentists and lacked 
expressing real world experience.

Summary: Educating more minority dentists, even financial incentives to 
those dentists to go to underserved communities, and then paying them 
below the cost to treat the disease will help some with limited 
success. Either quality goes down, unnecessary work is done, or the 
dentist moves to where they can survive financially.

Governments and ``authorities'' are contributing to hundreds of 
Billions of dollars in harm and poorly spent resources while lowering 
income, contributing to oral health damage, and minorities end up 
taking a disproportionate share of the harm.

Witnesses called by the committee are part of the choir and the 
Senators failed to gain significant alternatives to recommendations for 
``more of the same.'' Alternatives to some of our policies have been 
shown to be effective in other countries. The hardest part is objective 
evaluation of what we are doing, what we want, and the science to get 
there.

Examples:

    1.  Public health authorities based on political pressure must stop 
overruling the science experts. Government funding continues to promote 
the flawed policies and protect entrenched turf.

    2.  Protecting the public and minorities, the fetus and infants 
must become the priority. Governments are investing millions into 
harming the public which is causing billions of dollars of harm. Toxins 
such as mercury treatments and fluoride ingestion should not be 
supported.

    3.  Health education must become a priority, rather than 
pharmacology and surgery. Pumping patients through dental ``surgical 
factories'' to treat disease does little to educate the public on how 
to prevent the disease.

    4.  When hearings are set up, divergent voices should be heard, 
including clinical dentists.

Specifics: Health and Human Services (HHS) blocked the National 
Toxicology toxicologists' report on Fluoride's developmental 
neurotoxicity from being released, until the court forced HHS to 
release the report. The NTP experts have been silenced, their report 
white -washed, so the policies, rather than the public, can be 
protected.

Centers for Disease Control Oral Health Division (CDC) is little more 
than a rubber stamp for industry.

The American Dental Association (ADA) testified in court they have no 
duty to protect the public. The ADA protects dentists first and 
foremost, not the public. The Senate must be inclusive of organizations 
more protective of the public health such as the International Academy 
of Oral Medicine and Toxicology.

The EPA has and is over-ruling their scientists and the National 
Research Council to protect policy and tradition. For example, the EPA 
scientists have clearly spoken through their Union:

        In summary, we hold that fluoridation is an unreasonable risk. 
        That is, the toxicity of fluoride is so great and the purported 
        benefits associated with it are so small--if there are any at 
        all--that requiring every man, woman and child in America to 
        ingest it borders on criminal behavior on the part of 
        governments. Dr. J. William Hirzy, Senior Vice-President, 
        Headquarters Union, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, March 
        26, 2001

Although the EPA scientists are opposed to fluoridation, the EPA 
management over-rules the scientists.

We have taken the EPA to court under the Toxic Substances Control Act. 
The EPA did not provide their experts to testify in court in support of 
EPA's policies on fluoride. Instead, EPA hired an outside company known 
for protecting industry, such as tobacco. The public's health must come 
before twisting evidence. EPA scientists are good, the management is 
the problem.

The legal counsel of the FDA reports jurisdiction for water is with the 
EPA. The EPA legal counsel reports the FDA has jurisdiction over the 
drug fluoride. In effect, no Federal Agency assumes jurisdiction over 
determining the dosage, pharmacological efficacy, adverse effects, 
label, total exposure from all sources at all ages, safety, harm, 
ethics or benefit--if any.

Your witness, Dr. Cherae Farmer-Dixon was clear and correct in that 
diagnosis and treatment of oral health has improved, but ``it has not 
been equitable.'' Oh. . . and what about prevention? Ignored.

Consider the following graphs from published research.

World Health Organization data graphed and published by Neurath clearly 
shows a decline in dental caries in all developed countries regardless 
of chosen policies or fluoridation. We should celebrate improved 
success in oral health, in developed countries.

Caries rates are declining especially for the wealthy. I published the 
graph below ranking the USA states on the percentage of their whole 
population on fluoridated water and percentage reported good/excellent 
teeth (National Survey of Children's Health data).

The data is powerful. Fluoridation has no common cause with oral 
health, but income (socioeconomics) has a significant effect on oral 
health. If public health fluoridation actually reduced dental caries we 
should see and measure a benefit in the community at large. But we 
don't.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2923.002

.eps[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2923.003


.epsFluoride ingestion lowers IQ. Lower IQ results in lower income, 
increased incarceration, more special education and lower 
socioeconomics. The Food and Drug Administration historic position not 
to ingest fluoride is supported with hundreds of published research 
studies. Authorities pushing fluoridation are relying on outdated 
evidence.

Prevention is better than treatment and will improve health and reduce 
socioeconomic disparities; however, relying on chemistry to overcome 
bad habits is not wise. The first item to eliminate in the dental 
practice when reimbursement goes down, is prevention. No more diet 
instruction, oral hygiene instruction, handing out tooth brushes, 
tobacco harm or avoiding substance abuse.

Our oral health care system has set up great ``repair shops;'' however, 
prevention is not profitable and marginalized in part to the rich. 
Don't get me wrong, we need to treat those in pain and stop the 
pathology from getting worse, but we are not maximizing prevention 
because CDC and HHS and ADA are focused on flawed data of fluoride 
ingestion, diagnosis and treatment.

We have alternative opportunities.

    1.  Stop sugar subsidies. Tax the sources causing harm. With 
tobacco we educate the harm on the label. Require soda pop cans to have 
pictures of damaged teeth, such as Dr. Limeback's suggestion on health 
education.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2923.004


    .eps2.  Tobacco sales are taxed. Soda and sugar products should 
also and the money spent on health education and treatment of the 
damage it causes. Government sugar subsidies must stop.

WHO recommends soda taxes to reduce sugar consumption and has some 
effect on socioeconomic inequalities.

    3.  More dentists are not the answer for disparities. Dentists move 
to where they can have economic stability and success.

Do not marginalize lower socioeconomic individuals to mass factory 
assembly line dental factories which provide incomplete low-quality 
diagnosis and treatment.

    4.  Like Europe, the precautionary principle should be accepted.

Taking a project out to bid is the normal process for procurement, but 
is lacking in oral health. Governments expect dentists to provide 
treatment below costs. Moving to distressed communities to provide 
quality oral health prevention, diagnosis and treatment at ``below 
costs'' is not appealing to most dentists.

I would be willing to provide more evidence, but my experience with 
authorities is they have their minds made up before hearings and trust 
those whom they have trusted in the past. If anyone is reading this, 
please confirm with an email to bill@teachingsmiles.com.

Sincerely,

Bill Osmunson, D.D.S., MPH

   Statement of Kevin L. Hagan, President and Chief Executive Officer

Chairman Cardin, Ranking Member Daines, and members of the 
subcommittee, thank you for convening this hearing to put a spotlight 
on the unequal access to oral health care that some racial/ethnic and 
socioeconomic groups experience. We urge your subcommittee to take 
action on this important issue that impacts people's overall health, 
ability to work and ability to attend school.

PAN is an independent, national 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to 
helping federally and commercially insured people living with life-
threatening, chronic, and rare diseases with the out-of-pocket costs 
for their prescribed medications. PAN provides patients with direct 
assistance through nearly 70 disease-specific programs and collaborates 
with national patient advocacy organizations to provide patients with 
education and additional support. Since 2004, we have helped more than 
1 million underinsured patients gain access to their lifesaving 
prescriptions.

PAN supports improving oral health and hygiene as an integral part of 
health care. As you know, poor oral health and hygiene can cause tooth 
decay, gum disease and tooth loss among a variety of other health 
complications. Populations with a greater oral health risk include 
individuals with chronic diseases and weakened immune systems. 
Insufficient or inadequate dental care can worsen chronic health 
problems like diabetes and cardiovascular disease, hinder timely 
diagnosis of severe medical conditions, and lead to avoidable 
complications that may require costly emergency room visits.\1\

Department of Health and Human Services, https://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jcpe.12060.

While access to oral health has improved for many Americans there 
continues to be disparities in access. In the United States, people are 
more likely to have poor oral health if they are low-income, uninsured, 
and/or members of racial/ethnic minority, immigrant, or rural 
populations who have suboptimal access to quality oral health care. 
These inequities extend throughout the life course and include 
differences in access to affordable healthy foods, professional dental 
prevention and treatment services, and dental insurance.\1\ These same 
groups are less likely to afford to pay out-of-pocket for dental care, 
do not have private or public dental insurance, or can't get time off 
from work to get to dental care. Dental expenses constitute more than a 
quarter of overall health care out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures and are 
reported to present higher financial barriers than medical, 
prescription pharmaceuticals, and mental health care.\2\

As you know, the Medicare program covers a majority of all Americans 
age 65 and older and plays a vital role in the quality and longevity of 
their lives. However, the program has also long fallen short in 
providing those beneficiaries with sufficient coverage for essential 
oral and dental treatment. Two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries lack 
oral health coverage, and 49% of Medicare beneficiaries have not seen a 
dentist in the last 12 months (as of 2017).\3\ A recent study found 
that use of dental services fell at age 65 for both enrollees in 
tradition fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage.\4\ As a result, 
medical problems and treatment that can be proactively addressed with 
such care have instead gone unchecked, delayed, or canceled, resulting 
in serious clinical, human, and fiscal implications.

All too often, limited or no dental insurance coverage can result in 
high OOP or foregone oral health care. High OOP costs are a barrier to 
dental care as more than 15 million older adults live on incomes below 
200% of the federal poverty level, and 4.7 million live below poverty. 
Forgoing dental care, however, can worsen underlying conditions. 
Untreated cavities and gum disease can exacerbate certain diseases, 
such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and lead to chronic pain, 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
infections, and loss of teeth.

PAN urges the Committee to authorize a dental benefit in Medicare so 
that millions of beneficiaries on fixed incomes will be able to 
maintain their oral health that is critical to their overall health. 
Importantly, Congress must structure the benefit to included routine 
preventive procedures and limit out-of-pocket spending for more 
invasive dental care, including restorative procedures such as 
fillings, crowns and root canals. High levels of coinsurance have 
proven to be cost prohibitive and results in a drop in utilization of 
dental services.\3\

In the absence of a dental benefit, PAN is pleased that the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) included in the 2023 Physician Fee 
Schedule final rule clarification of medical coverage for dental 
services that are inextricably linked and substantially related and 
integral to organ transplant surgery, cardiac valve replacement, 
valvuloplasty procedures, and head and neck cancers. The final rule 
also created the opportunity for further coverage of procedures by 
establishing ``a process to identify for consideration and review 
submissions of additional dental services that are inextricably linked 
and substantially related and integral to the clinical success of other 
covered medical services.'' PAN urges the committee to utilize its 
oversight of CMS and engage with CMS officials as they formulate the 
2024 Physician Fee Schedule proposed rule.

PAN lauds you for your continued leadership to increase access and 
affordability of oral health care. We welcome the opportunity to work 
with the Committee as they develop legislation to address this 
important issue. For further information, please reach out to Amy 
Niles, Chief Advocacy and Engagement Office at aniles@

To Whom It May Concern,

I write to inform that there is a little known school of Dentistry, one 
that actually lessens the burden of tooth decay and gum disease in 
their patients. Known as Preventive Dentist's, this school, for over 70 
years, has seen the oral health of their patients improve, and stay 
healthy.

Today, the business of Dentistry charges the America public over $125 
billion per year to treat these two diseases. This is a perverse 
incentive that precludes the prevention of tooth decay and gum disease.

This does not speak to the myriad commercial determinants of ill 
health, billions of dollars of mouthwash, toothpaste, and other useless 
sundry items being sold to hopeful people that do not work as 
advertised.

There is an unhealthy relationship between organized Dentistry and the 
companies that sell these goods.

Tooth decay is the number one disease of childhood, all of Dentistry 
will tell you that tooth decay is preventable, and this is the 
disconnect.

If any of the nostrums sold to prevent tooth decay and gum disease, 
including those offered by organized Dentistry today, actually 
prevented anything, we would see a decrease in the number of Dental 
schools, but we see the opposite.

Since at least 1971, organized Dentistry has promoted only two things 
for the prevention of tooth decay and gum disease. This abject 
dependency has led to the dire conditions we see today.

Over 500 million tax dollars were given to the National Institute of 
Dental and Craniofacial Research in 2022. Never take advice from a bald 
headed barber on how to grow hair.

To the oral health of the Nation,

                     Statement of Marjorie Shapiro
It's time that all our government health agencies stop promoting 
chemical water fluoridation.

Fluoridation chemicals that are added to drinking water are unpurified 
toxic waste from industry. Hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFS) is transported 
around the country in hazmat certified trucks and by rail. Recently a 
train derailment of hazardous material caused a disaster in East 
Palestine PA which would have been an even bigger disaster had the 
train been carrying HFS. HFS is highly toxic, highly flammable, and 
extremely dangerous to transport. The disaster in East Palestine should 
be a wake-up call.

Not only are fluoridation chemicals toxic, corrosive and dangerous to 
transport, but, by definition, fluoride is a drug. It is added to 
supposedly treat the disease of dental decay. Millions of Americans are 
forced to consume fluoride daily, a drug that isn't even pharmaceutical 
grade; that is given without informed consent and without regard to 
dosage. No one is monitoring how much fluoride a person is ingesting. 
If someone drinks a lot of black tea which contains fluoride, takes 
drugs such as Prozac that contain fluoride or if they sweat a lot and 
drink copious amounts of water, they are consuming an unknown dose.

Every tube of toothpaste has a poison warning to not swallow it. 
Toddlers and young children who are too young to spit it out swallow 
toothpaste. No one is monitoring how much toothpaste is on the brush 
and how much a child swallows. Numerous high-quality, peer reviewed 
studies now show neurologic harm to fetuses, infants, and children from 
exposure to fluoride. We need to protect our most vulnerable from 
harmful chemicals.

Fluoride is the only chemical added to water that is not added to treat 
the water to make it potable. Only fluoridation chemicals are added to 
treat people. In defiance of the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA allows 
fluoridation chemicals which contain both lead and arsenic into 
drinking water. EPA's maximum contaminant level goal for lead and 
arsenic is zero.

Any benefit to teeth from fluoride is topical. Brush your teeth with 
it, opt in or out of a fluoride treatment at the dentist but toxic, 
corrosive fluoridation chemicals should not be transported across the 
country and dumped into drinking water. US Citizens have a right to 
pure unadulterated drinking water without any amount of added lead, 
arsenic, heavy metals, radio-nuclides and drugs such as fluoride.

Subcommittee on Health Care

        By focusing on fluoridation instead of diet and dentist-access, 
        organized dentistry allowed a national dental health crisis to 
        occur on its watch and created a new one--dental fluorosis.

        --Dr. David Kennedy, D.D.S., MPH, 3rd generation dentist and 
        past president of the International Academy of Oral Medicine 
        (2016)

To Whom It May Concern:

I suggest that the comment by Dr. David Kennedy quoted above is about 
as pithy as it gets. But allow me to provide you with a picture with 
additional quotes and scientific references to demonstrate.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T2923.005


.epsBut if the crass profiteering of various fluoridation stakeholders 
that is facilitated by willfully blind decision makers isn't enough, 
let's consider the March 2023 revelations that biased actors in Health 
and Human Services (HHS), egged on by the Oral Health Division of the 
CDC whose paychecks are connected to fluoridation promotion and 
programs, managed to use political means to suppress a National 
Toxicology Report (NTP) that validated that any exposure to fluoride in 
utero or during infancy is indeed associated with lower IQ as well as 
increased rates of other cognitive-behavioral deficits and dental 
damage.

Here is the link to the NTP webpage that was only released because of a 
whistleblower and court order: https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/
assessments/noncancer/ongoing/fluoride/index.html.

        Several of the highest quality studies showing lower IQs in 
        children were done in optimally fluoridated (0.7 mg/L) areas in 
        Canada, but the individual exposure information in those 
        studies, as documented by repeated urinary measurements, 
        suggests widely varying total fluoride exposure from drinking 
        water combined with exposures from other sources. For example, 
        many urinary fluoride measurements exceed those that would be 
        expected from consuming water that contains fluoride at 1.5 mg/
        L.

        --NTP reply to HHS comment re NTP Report (March 15, 2023)

But again, let me draw you a picture drawn from one of the many studies 
used by the NTP.

My suggestions for addressing the ``Oral Health Crisis'' are as follows 
:

    1.  Take the $100 million HHS uses to promote fluoridation and 
untold millions communities spend on fluoridation schemes and spend it 
on dental clinics for preschoolers, low-income populations and the 
elderly.
    2.  Improve water infrastructure and the availability and 
affordability of nutrition food.
    3.  Make dental care part of health care, and make dentists accept 
it.

Sincerely,

Karen Favazza Spencer

.epsAddendum Submission

``I would advise them (pregnant women) to drink bottled water or 
filtered water. . . .''

--Dimitri Christakis, M.D., MPH, editor in chief of JAMA Pediatrics on 
``Association Between Maternal Fluoride Exposure During Pregnancy and 
IQ Scores in Offspring in Canada'' (August 19, 2019)

To Whom It May Concern:

Regarding Mr. Forte's testimony implying that the lack of fluoridation 
results in more cavities in children and others living in rural areas 
and Ms. Stabenow's and Dr. Farmer-Dixon emphasis on oral health for 
pregnant women and holistic care and ``bad bacteria,'' allow me to 
offer the following:

The scientific of evidence is that fluoridation policy damages the 
biome and does not improve dental oral health in children or anyone 
else. Moreover, fluoridation policy contributes to ``chronic illness'' 
as fluoride is a drug that interferes with glucose metabolism, inhibits 
thyroid hormones, and promotes inflammatory diseases from allergies & 
arthritis to kidney disease & ulcerative colitis.

      Children living in communities with water sources containing 
less than 1 ppm fluoride concentration are still vulnerable to 
inflammatory, immunological, and other non-skeletal bodily harm. Dental 
fluorosis (DF) is present even at these low exposures and seems to be 
sex- mediated. DF a visible sign of fluoride poisoning while young 
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/
S0269749122022102).

      Although there is no argument that fluoride exposure can result 
in dental and skeletal fluorosis, a structural defect, the impact on 
brains and bodies at current exposure levels is a source of 
controversy. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) reviewed the 
evidence of developmental neurotoxicity at concentrations considered 
optimal or safe by U.S. authorities. The NTP found that most studies 
suggested an adverse effect of fluoride exposure on children's IQ, 
starting at low levels of exposure (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
36639015/).

      Identifies fluoride as an environmental chemical that has 
adverse effects on articular cartilage and osteoarthritis (OA) risk. 
``In full sample analysis, a 1 mg/L increase in UF (urinary fluoride) 
level was associated with a 27% higher risk of OA'' (https://
link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12011-021-02937-2).

      18% of people drinking ``optimally'' fluoridated water in 
Canadian communities have a heightened risk of low thyroid function 
because fluoride interferes with iodine metabolism. Many of them will 
be sub-clinical and not know they are mildly hypothyroid, which 
nevertheless increases their risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, and 
other problems. Study excluded those already diagnosed with thyroid 
disease (CHMS) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/
S016041201830833X).

      This study found fluoride-induced insulin resistance and vitamin 
D deficiency lead to diabetes, and confirms fluoride exposure through 
drinking tap water with F-concentrations considered ``safe'' by US 
authorities is a risk factor for developing diabetes. The study 
demonstrate that vitamin D deficiency and fasting blood glucose levels 
(BGLs) are significantly associated with water fluoride levels. The 
authors recommend using safe water (bottled or purified) and vitamin D 
supplementation (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36705502/).

Moreover, fluoridation doesn't prevent cavities or emergency dental 
care.

      On May 3, 2019, pediatric dentist Dr. Darren Riopelle of Grand 
Rapids, MI was featured in the local paper. He reported that many of 
his first time patients between 3 and 9 years old comes into his office 
with 3 to 20 cavities requiring full mouth restoration. Grand Rapids 
has been fluoridated since 1945.

      In 2014, Keys News in Florida reported that their district 
received an award for fifty years of fluoridation, and also that the 
local rotary club funded $10,000 worth of dental care for one little 
girl and extensive cosmetic dentistry for one little boy with 
``discolored teeth.'' Fluoridation results in discolored and brittle 
teeth disproportionately by race which is why many Civil Right leaders 
like Ambassador Andrew Young and Henry Rodriguez, director of the TX 
chapter of LULAC oppose fluoridation policy.

The dentists and doctors with the International Academy of Oral 
Medicine and Toxicology, International Academy of Biological Dentistry 
and Medicine, American Academy of Environmental Medicine and 
International College of Integrative Medicine are just a few of the 
professional scientific organizations with a patient focus who oppose 
fluoridation policy as harmful.

Finally, consider that only about 1% of the chemicals added to water 
supplies are consumed by man, the rest going to waste water. Moreover, 
fluoridation chemicals are contaminated with arsenic, aluminum, barium, 
cadium, etc. which are also consumed and go to wastewater. 
Environmental impact on salmon fisheries was one reason British 
Columbia ended fluoridation. I doubt Montana really wants to see the 
same ill effect in their back yards. Cessation did not increase 
cavities:

      A 2001 cessation study of six thousand children in British 
Columbia published in the Journal of Community Dentistry and Oral 
Epidemiology found that decay ``decreased over time in the 
fluoridation-ended community while remaining unchanged in the 
fluoridated community,'' http://www.NCBI.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11153562.
      ``Barium and aluminum levels approached those that the EPA found 
in samples of electroplating sludge, river sediment, and hazardous 
soils . . . contaminant content creates a regulatory blind spot that 
jeopardizes any safe use of fluoride additives.'' PJ Mullenix in ``A 
new perspective on metals and other contaminants in fluoridation 
chemicals'' (2014).

I do not disagree that oral health and affordable dental care aren't 
issues, they are. But I suggest you pay attention to science rather 
than magic potion mythology.

Sincerely,

Karen Favazza Spencer

More power to you if fluoridation doesn't bother you, but not the power 
to assume it's safe for your neighbor with kidney disease, his pregnant 
wife or their diabetic daughter!

General Comments
There is an oral health crisis in the United States:

      Dental disease is the most common chronic disease in children; 
it contributes to poor nutrition, failure to thrive, and other health 
problems.\1\

    \1\ ``Improving Systems to Ensure Oral Health for All,'' Oral 
Health for All 2020.

      Poor oral health is associated with cancer, cardiovascular 
disease, diabetes, and other physical and behavioral health 
diseases.\2\<SUP>,</SUP> \3\<SUP>,</SUP> \4\

      Only 63 percent of adults aged 18-64 had a dental visit in 
2020.\5\ Cost is the number one barrier to accessing care.\6\

Aged 18-64: United States, 2019 and 2020,'' Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, April 2022.
    \6\ ``Consumer Survey of Barriers to and Facilitators of Access to 
Oral Health Services,'' Oral Health Workforce Research Center, 2019.

      76.5 million Americans do not have dental insurance, including 
26.1 million Medicare enrollees, 8.5 million Medicaid enrollees, 16.1 
million privately insured enrollees, and 19.6 million medically 
uninsured Americans.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \7\ ``A Snapshot of the 76.5 Million Americans Without Dental 
Insurance,'' CareQuest Institute for Oral Health, 2021.

We urge Congress to take the following actions to alleviate this 
suffering:
            1. Add a Comprehensive Dental Benefit to Medicare
Half of Medicare beneficiaries, and nearly three-fourths of Black 
Medicare beneficiaries, do not visit the dentist.\8\ This lack of 
access directly affects beneficiaries' health, as roughly 15 percent of 
adults aged 65 and older have no natural teeth.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \8\ Freed, M., and Neuman, T., ``Drilling Down on Dental Coverage 
and Costs for Medicare Beneficiaries,'' Kaiser Family Foundation, 2019.
    \9\ Ibid.

Adding a comprehensive dental benefit to Medicare would dramatically 
expand seniors' access to oral health care. This proposal is also 
exceedingly popular. Roughly 90 percent of the public say that Congress 
should add dental, hearing, and vision benefits to Medicare.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \10\ ``Two-Thirds of the Public Say the U.S. Should Play a Major 
Role in Distributing COVID-19 Vaccines Globally, but not Most 
Republicans,'' Kaiser Family Foundation, 2021.

            2. Designate Adult Dental Services as a Mandatory Medicaid 
                    Benefit
Under current law, states have the option to include adult dental 
coverage in their Medicaid programs. Only half of these programs offer 
comprehensive dental benefits.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \11\ ``State Medicaid Coverage of Dental Services for General Adult 
and Pregnant Populations,'' National Academy for State Health Policy, 
2022.

Making adult dental services a mandatory Medicaid benefit would expand 
access to millions of Medicaid beneficiaries. Congresswoman Barragan 
(D-CA) has introduced legislation, the Medicaid Dental Benefit Act, 
that would require state Medicaid programs to provide comprehensive 
dental benefits to all beneficiaries. The benefit would cover routine 
diagnostic and preventive care, basic and major dental services, 
temporomandibular and orofacial pain disorder treatment, and other 
necessary services as defined by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human 
Services.\12\ We urge the Senate Finance Committee to consider this or 
similar legislation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \12\ Press Release, ``Barragan Introduces Medicaid Dental Benefit 
Act,'' July 19, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            3. Recognize Adult Dental Services as an Essential Health 
                    Benefit
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) significantly 
strengthened health care access and equity. However, one gap in the ACA 
is that it does not include adult dental care as an essential health 
benefit that qualified health plans are required to cover. This means 
that financial assistance for individuals and families cannot be used 
to cover adult dental benefits.

The ACA authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review 
and update the essential health benefits.\13\ However, we urge Congress 
to amend the ACA to include adult oral health care as an essential 
health benefit. Doing so will send a clear message that oral health 
care is essential to overall health.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \13\ Reusch, C., ``The ACA Has Boosted Oral Health Access, Now 
Let's Keep the Progress Going,'' Community Catalyst, March 25, 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            4. Fund CDC and HRSA Oral Health Grants for All States
The CDC State Actions to Improve Oral Health Outcomes grant funds 20 
state programs to reduce dental caries, oral health disparities, and 
chronic diseases associated with poor oral health.\14\ The current 
iteration of the grant funds 20 states an average of $370,000 per year 
for up to five years to support school sealant programs, support and 
increase access to community water fluoridation, and conduct oral 
health surveillance.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \14\ ``CDC-Funded Programs,'' Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2019.
    \15\ CDC, 2019.

We urge Congress to expand funding to provide grants to all 50 states. 
The CDC Division of Oral Health estimates it would need an additional 
$15 million yearly to do this. This small investment would have 
profound oral health benefits across the country.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \16\ ``Congress has a Social and Fiscal Responsibility to Improve 
Oral Health for Everyone,'' Oral Health Progress and Equity Network, 
2021.

Similarly, the HRSA Grants to Support Oral Health Workforce Activities 
initiative helps states develop and maintain programs that address 
dental workforce needs in designated Dental Health Professional 
Shortage Areas (HPSA)s.\17\ This important program funds 32 states for 
$3,200,000 per year. Expanding the program to all 50 states would cost 
little money but have a tremendous impact.

Activities,'' Rural Health Information Hub, 2021.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
Oral health is essential to overall health. Congress should act now to 
recognize this fact and support better health for all Americans. Thank 
you again for the opportunity to provide this statement. Please do not
