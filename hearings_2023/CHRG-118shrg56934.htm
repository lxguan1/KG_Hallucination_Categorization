 NOMINATIONS OF PHILIP NATHAN JEFFERSON, LISA DENELL COOK, AND ADRIANA 
                             DEBORA KUGLER

                              ----------                              


                        WEDNESDAY, JUNE 21, 2023

                                       U.S. Senate,
          Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs,
                                                    Washington, DC.
    The Committee met at 10:27 a.m., in room 216, Hart Senate 
Office Building, Hon. Sherrod Brown, Chair of the Committee, 
presiding.

            OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIR SHERROD BROWN

    Chair Brown. The Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee is back in session.
    The Committee meets today to consider three nominations to 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System: The 
Honorable Philip Jefferson to be Vice Chairman; The Honorable 
Lisa Cook to be a member; and The Honorable Adriana Kugler to 
be a member. We thank the nominees for appearing here today and 
for their willingness to serve. And we also thank them for 
waiting through what seemed like an interminable markup 
session, so thank you for your patients.
    The economy is in a different place from where it was at 
this time last year. Back then, Russia's brutal invasion of 
Ukraine devastated global energy markets, driving up the cost 
of gas. The national average price of gas topped $5 a gallon. 
Global supply chain disruptions resulted in shortages of key 
goods, increasing costs on American families. And inflation, we 
know, hit a peak rate of 9.1 percent.
    Today, inflation is at 4 percent, short of the Fed's 
target, of course, of 2 percent, but a steady improvement from 
the 9 percent last year. Global supply chains have begun to 
stabilize. Product shortages have eased. Ports are less 
congested. The price of gas has fallen, and domestic energy 
production has increased. The unemployment rate is under 4 
percent.
    This is the strongest labor market for American workers in 
decades, thanks to the work that two of you have done on the 
Fed to help that happen, and the Administration's work, 
especially. The country added 339,000 jobs in May--think of 
that--bringing the total number of jobs created since the 
Democrats were in the majority, since I have been Chair of this 
Committee, to 13 million new jobs. In April, the Black 
unemployment rate hit 4.7 percent, the lowest in 50 years. In 
May, the unemployment rate for Latinos dropped.
    The economy is trending in the right direction. We must 
build on that success and work to solve the persistent problems 
that have held back American workers for decades, regardless of 
the economic trends.
    At this important time in our economic recovery, we need 
all seven Federal Reserve Governors working to grow an economy 
with low prices and plentiful job opportunities, to uphold--as 
I have talked to all three of you individually about, some 
longer than others--to uphold the Fed's dual mandate of 
promoting stable prices and maximum employment.
    We are fortunate to have three exceptionally qualified 
nominees before the Committee today. I will speak about them in 
a moment. I will go to you, and then I want Senator Menendez to 
introduce one of the people on the panel.

             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT

    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your 
willingness to serve our Nation in your very important roles 
that we have the responsibility, constitutional responsibility 
to vet and talk about.
    Mr. Jefferson, thank you for your willingness to continue 
to support the philosophy that I think is really embedded in 
the American culture that the free market system is the marvel 
of the world and one that requires us to continue to focus our 
attention on how do we improve it based on the current 
philosophy and the mandate of the Fed. And I thank you for your 
willingness to do so.
    Before us today, however, are three noms, not just one, who 
are asking us to confirm them to serve the American people 
through their Government-appointed positions. But two of these 
noms seem more interested in having Government serve their 
personal ideologies and their political priorities. Unlike the 
famous words that I paraphrase of JFK, ``Ask not what you can 
do for your country but rather what the country can do for 
you,'' I think Governor Cook and Ms. Kugler both want to use 
their positions and their influence to influence and immerse 
their philosophies into the mainstream of American life, 
through these incredibly powerful posts. Examples would include 
everything from reparations to climate agenda, systemic racism, 
ESG, and other issues that distract from the actual job of the 
Fed. Using something like the Black unemployment as a way we 
determine Fed decisions is just as discriminatory as using only 
the Asian unemployment would be. Very different outcomes but 
both very distorting.
    I think it is important for us to have noms who want to 
serve the country and not have their positions be leverage for 
their ability to weave into our overall philosophy their 
ideologies.
    With that I return to you.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Scott.
    Before yielding my time to Senator Menendez, I want to 
recognize Senator Menendez for his many years of championing 
Hispanic representation in our financial system and at the 
highest levels of Government. Bob?
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you and to 
Ranking Member Scott for an opportunity to say a few words 
about what I consider a historic hearing.
    Today we have before us three exceptionally qualified 
nominees to serve on the Federal Reserve: Dr. Jefferson, Dr. 
Cook, and Dr. Kugler. For a moment, though, I would like to 
touch on Dr. Kugler's nomination and the personal significance 
that it holds for me.
    In her appearance today I see the story of my mother, 
Evangelina Menendez. Seventy years ago, my mother convinced my 
father to leave behind the only life they had ever known in 
Cuba. They arrived, like so many before them, as immigrants on 
unfamiliar shores, reaching for the American dream. Every day 
my mother worked long hours as a seamstress in a factory, 
always striving to provide for her three children. She is the 
reason I sit in this chair as a United States Senator.
    Because of the sacrifices she made as a fierce Latino who 
loved our country and its promise, in the way that only an 
immigrant can, today Dr. Kugler sits in her chair as a first-
generation American as well. What a shining testament to the 
power of the American dream.
    Only in America are our stories even possible, which is 
why, for 30 years in Congress, I have pushed for greater 
representation in every industry, at every level. To me, 
creating more stories like ours is part and parcel of creating 
a more perfect union.
    Earlier this year I made the case to the Biden 
administration that this nomination is a golden opportunity to 
send a clear and powerful message that the hopes and dreams of 
Latinos are central to the promise of America. Today, Dr. 
Kugler makes history as the first person of Latino descent ever 
nominated to serve on the Federal Reserve. It is a remarkable 
accomplishment, and I want to recognize all she has done to 
earn it.
    And I say what she has done to earn it, I see no ideology 
in her views. I see a pragmatism that comes from being an 
economist. I hear no ``woke-ism.'' I hear no purpose of 
promoting a plan or a program or an idea. What I see is a 
former Chief Economist at the Department of Labor, who now 
serves as the U.S. Executive Director at the World Bank. She 
brings both a domestic and international perspective at a time 
when the global economy has never been more connected. She has 
conducted invaluable research on labor markets, unemployment, 
and productivity, all which are central to the Federal 
Reserve's dual mandate. And because of her work and her 
reputation, she has earned the endorsement of 33 of her peer 
economists from across the political spectrum, who call her, 
quote, ``a brilliant, objective economist who takes an 
evidence-based approach to decision making and is an expert in 
policy evaluation,'' close quote.
    In short, she is eminently qualified for the position she 
has been nominated for. And because of her unwavering work 
ethic, her commitment to public service, and her sterling 
credentials, we are able to hold today's hearing, which is more 
than a century in the making. That is right. In the 110-year 
history of the Federal Reserve there has never been a member of 
the Board of Governors who has lived the experience of being 
Latino in America, not once.
    And so today we have an opportunity to take momentous steps 
and right history in real time. I want to thank Dr. Kugler for 
her willingness to serve, and I want to thank my colleagues for 
giving me this opportunity to speak from the heart about what 
her nomination means for the 62 million Latinos who call 
America home. Simply put, we see ourselves reflected in this 
historic nomination. And while she may be the first one of us 
nominated, and hopefully confirmed, we certainly do not expect 
her to be the last.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Menendez. And Senator Van 
Hollen, from Maryland, has a few comments.
    Senator Van Hollen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking 
Member. Congratulations to all three of you on your 
nominations. Governor Jefferson, thank you for your earlier 
work at my alma mater, Swarthmore College, as Chair of the 
Department of Economics. And I just wanted to second the 
remarks made by Senator Menendez and also add, Dr. Kugler, that 
we are pleased in Maryland that you are a great resident of our 
State. You bring us great Maryland pride. So congratulations to 
all three of you, and welcome.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen. I will do 
introductions, what is left of those introductions.
    We are fortunate to have three exceptionally qualified 
nominees. Dr. Philip Jefferson is the President's nominee to be 
Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve. If confirmed, he would be 
only the second Black man to serve in this role. In 2022, the 
Senate confirmed Dr. Jefferson in a 91-7 vote to a 14-year term 
as a member of the Federal Reserve.
    He is a recognized expert on the economics of poverty and 
opportunity. Before joining the Fed, he served as Vice 
President for Academic Affairs, Dean of Faculty, and Paul B. 
Freeland Professor of Economics at Davidson College. And as 
Senator Van Hollen said, also Chair of the Economics Department 
at Swarthmore, my daughter's alma mater. Welcome to the 
Committee.
    The President has renominated Dr. Lisa Cook to a 14-year 
term on the Board of Governors. Despite a toxic campaign by the 
far right to discredit her nomination, the Senate still 
confirmed Dr. Cook's nomination to the Board of Governors in 
May of last year. I was proud to help lead that fight. Like Dr. 
Jefferson, she is a respected economist with decades of 
monetary policy experience.
    Prior to joining the Fed, Dr. Cook served as Professor of 
Economics and International Relations at Michigan State 
University, becoming one of the country's leading researchers 
on international economic growth and innovation economics. She 
had served as a Senior Economist at the White House, Senior 
Advisor at the Department of Treasury, and Adjunct Professor at 
the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.
    Welcome, Dr. Cook. Really glad you are back, and it took 
over a century to have a Black woman Governor on the Federal 
Reserve. Dr. Cook shattered that glass ceiling last year. We 
are thrilled she wants to serve a full term.
    We will also consider the historic nomination of Dr. 
Adriana Kugler. Thank you. I can only endorse the words of 
Senator Menendez.
    Dr. Jefferson, proceed.
    Oh, I am sorry. We need to swear them in. Would you please 
all stand. I apologize.
    Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to 
give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, 
so help you God?
    Mr. Jefferson. I do.
    Ms. Cook. I do.
    Ms. Kugler. I do.
    Chair Brown. Do you agree to appear and testify before any 
duly constituted committee of the Senate?
    Mr. Jefferson. I do.
    Ms. Cook. I do.
    Ms. Kugler. I do.
    Chair Brown. Thank you. Take your seats.
    Dr. Jefferson, please begin.

STATEMENT OF PHILIP NATHAN JEFFERSON, OF NORTH CAROLINA, TO BE 
VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
                             SYSTEM

    Mr. Jefferson. Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and 
Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
appear before you today. I am honored by President Biden's 
nomination to serve as Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System. If confirmed, I will continue to 
use my experience and expertise in pursuit of the goals that 
Congress assigned to the Federal Reserve on behalf of all 
Americans: maximum employment and price stability.
    When I spoke to this Committee over 16 months ago, I was a 
Ph.D. economist with an eclectic research background: 
macroeconomics and monetary economics, poverty and economic 
inequality, and applied econometrics. I posited then that these 
varied specializations would provide unique perspectives on the 
complex issues facing the Fed. One year of service as a Fed 
Governor has tested this hypothesis, and I can confirm its 
accuracy. I have equally learned from and enjoyed the broad 
range of views around the Federal Open Market Committee table.
    As a Governor, I have focused on the design, 
implementation, and transmission of monetary policy; served on 
key committees on monetary affairs, supervision and regulation, 
and community banks; and chair the committee on Board affairs.
    The Fed's decisions affect all Americans. We consult data, 
empirical evidence, and research. But fully understanding the 
U.S. economy means understanding the experiences of those who 
live and work in it. Since arriving at the Federal Reserve, I 
have made two-way communication with the public a priority, 
from meeting with business and community leaders, workers, 
students, and retirees to public speeches.
    Experience shows that achieving our dual mandate fosters an 
environment characterized by a dynamic labor market, thriving 
entrepreneurship, sustainable growth, and secure and stable 
savings and investment. It also provides a critical foundation 
for monetary policy in challenging times. Our commitment to 
these goals will ground inflation expectations appropriately so 
that policy does not encumber private economic decision making. 
Long-run inclusive prosperity also requires paying careful 
attention to the financial system's safety and soundness.
    The economy faces multiple challenges, including inflation, 
banking sector stress, and geopolitical instability. The 
Federal Reserve must remain attentive to them all. Inflation 
has started to abate, and I remain focused on returning it to 
our 2 percent target. Despite recent stress, the U.S. banking 
system is sound and resilient, and I remain attuned to any 
threats to its stability.
    Before closing, I wish to acknowledge the love and support 
of friends and family, especially my sons Nathan and Miles. 
Again, thank you for the opportunity and for your consideration 
of my nomination.
    If confirmed as Vice Chair, I look forward to working with 
each of you and with this Committee. I welcome your questions.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Dr. Jefferson.
    It was an honor to attend your swearing in as it was, Dr. 
Cook's swearing in back a while ago. So Dr. Cook, good to see 
you here.

 STATEMENT OF LISA DENELL COOK, OF MICHIGAN, TO BE A MEMBER OF 
      THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

    Ms. Cook. Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other 
Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to 
appear before you today. I am humbled and honored to have been 
renominated by President Biden to serve a full 14-year term on 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
    In my work as a Federal Reserve Governor, my background and 
professional experience have proven to be invaluable. I spent 
my childhood in Milledgeville, Georgia, in the midst of the 
rural, desegregating South. My dedication to public service was 
invigorated by observing the courage and resolve of my late 
parents and other members of my family. We stood alongside 
friends and neighbors whose names were never recorded, and 
others, like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose 
memories are engraved in our Nation's history.
    After being a Marshall Scholar at Oxford University and 
earning my Ph.D. in economics at the University of California, 
Berkeley, I engaged in pathbreaking analytical and empirical 
research on economic growth, innovation, and financial 
institutions while on the faculty of Harvard University and of 
Michigan State University and as a National Fellow at the 
Hoover Institution. My professional colleagues elected me to 
help lead the field as a member of the Executive Committee of 
the American Economic Association, and I was selected as a 
Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. 
In addition, I have gained valuable experience from my work at 
the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the President's Council 
of Economic Advisers.
    I have significant experience in banking and finance, as is 
evidenced by my service on the board of directors of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and of a Community Development 
Financial Institution in Michigan, in addition to my employment 
at an investment bank and a large commercial bank. Indeed, 
community banks and other local financial institutions elected 
me as a director of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis.
    When I appeared before you last spring, I pledged to 
protect the independence of the Federal Reserve. Over the past 
13 months, I have been unwavering in my dedication to ensuring 
that our decisions serve the American people rather than any 
political or special interests.
    As a policymaker, I am committed to following a data-driven 
approach. My analysis draws extensively on high-frequency data 
and cutting-edge methodologies. This approach is especially 
important in a context where the pitfalls of relying on 
traditional analytical methods have been quite evident.
    I am acutely aware that the Federal Reserve's policy 
actions affect the daily lives of all Americans. The economy 
can only thrive when everyone can take part and contribute. 
Therefore, I consistently strive to engage directly with 
business and community leaders, workers, entrepreneurs, 
students and retirees, and other Americans. Listening to their 
experiences and perspectives where they are--from Grand Rapids 
to Oakland to Spartanburg to Detroit to New Orleans--has been 
critical for informing my own policy decisions.
    I am committed to promoting sustained economic growth in a 
context of low and stable inflation. A strong economy 
contributes to broad-based prosperity by bringing people off 
the sidelines and providing opportunities to develop key job-
market skills.
    As I stated to this Committee last year, elevated inflation 
is a grave threat to sustaining the expansion of the American 
economy. Therefore, in my role as a voting member on the 
Federal Open Market Committee I have been consistently 
supportive of our rapid and forceful actions to tighten 
monetary policy and bring inflation down. If confirmed, I will 
stay focused on inflation until our job is done. The American 
economy is at a critical juncture, and it will be essential for 
the FOMC to act as needed to bring inflation back to our 2 
percent inflation target.
    Senators, it has been a great honor to serve the American 
people. As public servants, we vow to work on behalf of all 
Americans. I am grateful for your time and attention today, and 
for your consideration of my nomination. If confirmed, I look 
forward to continuing to work with you in this important role.
    Before concluding, I would like to express my gratitude to 
all of my family members, especially those here today--my aunt, 
Wivona Murray Ward, and my sisters, Melanie and Pamela Cook--
for their steadfast love, encouragement, prayers, and support 
over many years.
    Thank you. I look forward to your questions.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Dr. Cook.
    Dr. Kugler, you are recognized for 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF ADRIANA DEBORA KUGLER, OF MARYLAND, TO BE A MEMBER 
    OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

    Ms. Kugler. Good morning, Chairman Brown and Ranking Member 
Scott. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator 
Menendez and Senator Van Hollen for their generous 
introductions. It is truly a privilege to have been nominated 
by President Biden to be a member of the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System. I am honored for the opportunity to 
appear before you today.
    With me today are my husband of 29 years, Ignacio Donoso, 
and my daughter, Miri. My son, Danny, is watching from New 
York. I am also tremendously grateful to introduce my parents, 
Bernardo and Nelly, who have sacrificed so much to support me 
over the years.
    As a first-generation American and daughter of Colombian 
immigrants, I am fortunate to have lived the American Dream 
after having seen poverty and adversity. I have had educational 
and economic opportunities that my parents and grandparents 
would have never had, and I have benefited from social mobility 
that is only possible in our dynamic U.S. economy.
    My maternal grandfather had to leave high school to help 
his widowed mother raise his five siblings and my maternal 
grandmother was orphaned at the age of 3 in Colombia. My 
paternal grandparents fled religious persecution and had to 
restart their lives on a new continent. My parents worked hard 
every day to ensure I had every available opportunity to 
succeed. My family has instilled in me the importance of 
resilience and an unwavering work ethic and the value of giving 
back to those less fortunate than you.
    I attended public high school in Maryland, earned a 
bachelor's degree at McGill University and completed a Ph.D. in 
economics at U.C. Berkeley. My areas of specialization are 
applied econometrics and labor economics. Over the course of my 
25-year career, I have produced original research and evidence-
based policy analysis on labor markets, unemployment, worker 
mobility, and firm productivity, all topics that inform the 
Federal Reserve's important work. If confirmed, my extensive 
experience analyzing U.S. economic data will be critical in 
fulfilling my duties at the Federal Reserve and in making well-
informed monetary policy decisions.
    The Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote stable prices 
and maximum employment remains fundamental. And as we have seen 
in recent months, the role of the Federal Reserve in fostering 
the safety and soundness of banks and resilience of the 
financial system remains as critical as ever. If confirmed, I 
am deeply committed to setting monetary policy to reduce 
inflation and promote maximum employment, and to foster the 
resilience of the financial sector to support job creation and 
economic growth. My personal and professional experience guides 
my understanding that high inflation hurts workers and 
businesses alike, and I believe that it is important to bring 
inflation down to the Fed's 2 percent target. This will give us 
a strong foundation to build an economy that supports all 
Americans.
    If confirmed, I look forward to upholding the Federal 
Reserve's independence, making decisions in collaboration with 
my colleagues, and based on the best data and analysis. As 
Chief Economist at the U.S. Department of Labor, I worked on 
issues related to job growth, unemployment, and workforce 
development following the Great Recession. In my current role 
as U.S. Executive Director at the World Bank, I have worked to 
provide strategic direction as the world grapples with multiple 
crises, including the recovery from the pandemic, high 
inflation around the globe, and the economic spillovers of 
Russia's war on Ukraine.
    I have also served in a number of leadership roles during 
the course of my career, including as Vice-Provost at 
Georgetown University. In those roles, I have always placed the 
highest priority on being a reasoned voice, grounded in 
evidence and working to advance organizational goals. If 
confirmed, I intend to bring the same balanced and cooperative 
leadership approach to the Board of Governors.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to come before you 
today. I would be happy to answer your questions.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Dr. Kugler.
    So as not to show favoritism to any of these three 
outstanding nominees I have one question for each of you, and 
please be as brief as you can so we can keep within 5 minutes.
    Governor Jefferson, and left to right, we have seen three 
major bank failures in the last 4 months. As Vice Chair Barr 
noted, these three banks failed, quote, ``following substantial 
deposit overflows, over poor management of interest rate risk 
and liquidity risk.'' The rapid collapse of these banks brings 
into focus issues of financial stability and lurking risks to 
our financial system.
    My question, Dr. Jefferson, what risks are you closely 
monitoring? How should we think about those risks in the 
economy more broadly?
    Mr. Jefferson. Thank you, Senator, for your question. You 
are correct. Recently we did experience a period of banking 
stress. As I look ahead to the economic outlook for the third 
and fourth quarter I am monitoring very carefully the 
possibility of additional tightening from the banking sector 
with respect to credit. It represents a downside risk for the 
economy, and I am watching that very carefully.
    With respect to financial stability concerns, as you 
mentioned liquidity risk is something that certainly we would 
want to monitor along with banks' provision of interest rate 
risk.
    So these are factors that we must continue to monitor, 
along with the rapid potential flight of deposits in banks that 
have a structure where they depend on a large share of 
uninsured deposits.
    In addition to that, I am also looking at, quite carefully, 
weakness in the commercial real estate sector, as the pandemic 
has had an adverse impact on that sector. It is certainly the 
case that loans that are based in commercial real estate are 
subject to additional risk.
    And finally, Senator, there is cybersecurity, always 
something that must be monitored so that our financial system 
is robust to potential bad actors who could compromise our 
financial system.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Governor Jefferson.
    Governor Cook, your thoughts on the state of the economy. 
Eleven straight month inflation fell, now registering at 4 
percent. The Fed paused rate hikes this month, as you know. 
Prior to pursuing rate hikes they had raised benchmark interest 
rates 10 times since March of 2022. How do you view the state 
of the economy? Are there key economic indicators that give you 
hope that the Fed is taking the right steps necessary to get 
inflation down to its target 2 percent number?
    Ms. Cook. Thank you for your question, Senator. We are 
committed to getting inflation back down to the Fed's 2 percent 
inflation target. The inflation rate peaked in 2022, and it is 
coming down, but we are not there yet. It is not back to its 2 
percent target.
    With respect to risks associated with inflation, there are 
several, including global commodity prices, the resurgence of 
global commodity prices, and supply disruptions--those were 
huge--and intensification of Russia's aggression in Ukraine. 
These were factors that were prevalent during this pandemic-
related economy.
    On the front of economic growth, certainly there is a risk 
that economic growth could slow. Interest rate hikes worked to 
tighten financial conditions, and therefore to limit aggregate 
demand, to bring supply and demand into better balance. That is 
where the inflation is coming from. So there is a risk there. 
But certainly we hope that if there an economic activity 
slowdown that there is not one that leads to a recession.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Dr. Cook.
    Dr. Kugler, you are an expert in labor economics. You have 
conducted extensive research and analysis into labor markets, 
examining how training programs help young workers maximize 
their God-given potential. Working in the Obama administration, 
Chief Economist at the Department of Labor, serving as 
Executive Director of the World Bank, all those things make you 
immensely qualified for this.
    Share with us how your experiences have shaped--and when we 
talked in my office I know we did not get to some of your 
background, and I wanted to explore a bit--tell us how your 
experiences have shaped your view of monetary policy, 
particularly in light of the Fed's dual mandate.
    Ms. Kugler. Thank you very much for that question, Chairman 
Brown. I would say both my personal and professional 
experiences have shaped my view of the dual mandate, of the 
need to bring down inflation and the need to keep maximum 
employment.
    I spent my childhood in Colombia, where in the late 1970s 
and the early '80s inflation was very high, hovering about 25 
percent. This is something that you saw and felt in everyday 
life, when you went to the grocery story, when you went to buy 
anything, and you had to make decisions as to what to buy or 
what not to buy.
    In that context too, unemployment was very evident, and it 
showed how that could get you into poverty. The lack of 
employment and the precarious employment left many homeless. 
That was a reality back in Colombia, my parents' home country.
    So this drove me to study economics, and this certainly 
drove my interest in economics, and I ended up, in my Ph.D. 
program, at a top program in the country, to study 
macroeconomics, to specialize in macroeconomics and labor 
economics. Those were my specialties. During that time I was 
lucky enough that the Federal Reserve gave me a fellowship as a 
graduate student. I was a visiting scholar at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco where I spent time, and I had an 
office in the Research and Statistics Department.
    Now I have had a 25-year career, as you mentioned, Senator, 
where I have produced regional research, but I have also done a 
tremendous amount of policy analysis, looking at labor markets 
and also firm productivity. Both of these areas of research 
clearly inform the employment side of the dual mandate as well 
as the price side and the stability of prices that the Congress 
has asked the Fed to fulfill.
    I truly believe that both sides of the mandate are very 
important, and one side of the mandate may become more 
important at some points and the other side of the mandate may 
become more important at other times. Right now the inflation 
side is critical. It is very important to continue to bring 
down inflation to its 2 percent target. I am committed to that. 
I believe firmly that those that are hurt the most by high 
inflation but also by high unemployment are always the most 
vulnerable. I have seen it with my own eyes, both when I was 
growing up in Colombia, but also here in our great U.S. 
economy. So thank you very much.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Dr. Kugler. Senator Scott.
    Senator Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    This question is for both Governors Jefferson and Cook on 
the diversity of our financial institutions. Competition is a 
bedrock of the American experiment, and the diversity of our 
banking system has been a core tenet of the prosperity that our 
Nation has experienced. Today we have about 4,000 banks, a 
figure that has been on the decline for the last couple of 
decades.
    While it is important to recognize that large financial 
institutions serve a valuable purpose, we must also ensure that 
small financial institutions are allowed to prosper and 
persevere to serve their communities. I am a big believer that 
community banks are where you find that community 
relationships. It allows for folks to have a relationship that 
helps them get a loan to start a small business or a mortgage. 
That relationship becomes really important.
    And too often, new regulations increasingly result in 
compliance burdens which prevent many of these institutions 
from being profitable, and they often cannot complete on even 
footing with the larger institutions who employ thousands of 
employees, it seems, just to meet the financial and Federal 
regulations.
    Given your roles will involve the oversight of all of our 
Nation's banks, how will you commit to ensuring the continued 
diversity of our financial system, and maybe more pointedly and 
specifically, the one-size-fits-all, is that your view of how 
we should regulate our banks, or is a more tailored approach 
being necessary?
    Mr. Jefferson. Thank you, Senator Scott, for your question. 
And let me affirm the perspective that the diversity of the 
banking system is really one of the strengths of the American 
economy. It is very much the case that the role of community 
banks often is vital for the communities in which they exist 
because of that personal, what we call, relationship banking, 
which is the key to access for many small businesses who are 
just starting out.
    My view with respect to regulation is that regulations 
should be set at a level that is consistent with the level of 
risk of the institution. Necessarily, community banks are less 
complex than the large banking organizations in our economy, 
and therefore the regulatory burden should be substantially 
less than what we see with respect to the large organizations.
    What we want is confidence in our banking system by 
depositors and businesses, and so finding the right level of 
regulation to make sure that our community banks are safe and 
sound is the key to that confidence and what will allow them to 
continue to provide the vital function that you have 
articulated so well.
    So I do believe in a measured, tailored approach to 
regulation.
    Senator Scott. Thank you very much. Governor?
    Ms. Cook. I would agree with Governor Jefferson, and I 
would just like to add a few things. Like you, I am very 
interested in the diversity of the sizes of institutions in the 
financial system. As you know, I have served on the board of a 
CDFI, and I was elected by community banks to serve on the 
board of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. So I 
completely understand relationship banking, as you are 
discussing, and how deeply rooted community banks in their 
communities, and how they serve entrepreneurs, businesses, and 
the people, households, in those communities.
    And I agree with tailoring, that they should not have to be 
burdened by the same requirements that large banks are, and 
that they should be able to thrive in these communities without 
the burden of significant regulation. So I agree with you. 
There has been a secular decline for 30 years in the number of 
community banks, and I think it is a serious issue. But I think 
the diversity of the banking system, sizes especially, is a 
strength of the U.S. banking system.
    Senator Scott. Thank you. I am running out of time so I am 
going to ask, unfortunately, the two of you one more question 
as it relates to--Vice Chair Barr has indicated that he wants a 
higher capital standard as it relates to how much capital is 
kept on the sidelines. I think that may ultimately end up 
punishing small businesses and their relationship with the 
banks, the more capital we require on the sidelines as a result 
of SVB or Signature Bank, which I think would be a mistake. It 
leaves fewer dollars to be loaned out.
    I would love to hear your perspective on higher capital 
standards, specifically as it relates to the failures that we 
have just experienced, which I think is more of a liquidity 
issue than a capital standard.
    Mr. Jefferson. Well, as I indicated in my response to 
Chairman Brown, these liquidity issues and interest rate issues 
that you mentioned, Senator, were quite significant in the bank 
stress episode that we experienced in March.
    Now with respect to capital requirements, that is something 
that I know Vice Chair Barr is in the process of evaluating. My 
personal view is that we want a banking system that is sound 
and resilient so that banks are able to lend throughout the 
cycle. So as we think about capital requirements we are always, 
or I will always be thinking about that tradeoff between making 
banks more resilient and sound and credit available. We do not 
want to prohibit the banks from doing their vital role in the 
economy, which is allocating credit, and they are the ones to 
assess entrepreneurs to see what businesses they want to fund. 
And that is a vital role, and we never want to curtail that.
    So I think we have to deal with always, grapple with, the 
tradeoffs between those two things and spending the right level 
of capital.
    Senator Scott. Thank you. Anything you want to add to that, 
ma'am?
    Ms. Cook. I will just add that I think about this like an 
economist would in terms of the objective function. What is the 
objective to have more resilience in the financial system? But 
I am aware of the constraints as well, the other 
considerations, and that includes possibly not having enough 
capital, enough credit to lend out to businesses.
    So we take into account holistically both the objective of 
resilience and the constraints associated with obtaining that 
resilience. And like you, I am interested in the diversity of 
the banking system, so that is a strength. I would not want 
small community banks to be burdened with the regulation that 
we see for larger institutions. And I think that there are 
many, as a result of getting back to your question of SVB, 
there are proposal that are being developed, and I look forward 
to seeing those and reviewing those proposals as you put them 
forward.
    Senator Scott [presiding]. Thank you, Governor Cook. 
Senator Smith.
    Senator Smith. Thank you, Ranking Member, and thank you to 
all of you for being here. Congratulations. You are all highly 
qualified nominees, and I thank you for your willingness to 
continue to serve on the board, and to serve on the board.
    Dr. Jefferson and Dr. Cook, I was proud to support your 
nominations last year, and I look forward to doing so again. 
And Dr. Kugler, I really enjoyed our conversation this last 
week, and I appreciate the breadth of your expertise and your 
thoughtful approach to the variety of issues that is within the 
Fed's purview, and of course, your connection to Minnesota, 
which I learned about as well when we met. So I look forward to 
supporting your nomination as well.
    Dr. Kugler, I wanted to ask you a bit about--I was very 
impressed by your experience and research that you have done on 
the intersection between labor markets and public policy. And 
could you just talk a bit more about that and how that research 
will inform your work at the Fed?
    Ms. Kugler. Thank you, Senator Smith, and thank you very 
much for taking the time to meet with me last week. I very much 
enjoyed our conversation and appreciated hearing your views on 
the economy.
    I spoke a little bit in response to the question by Senator 
Brown about my 25-year career generating original research and 
policy work, and I think that would be critical in informing my 
views on the dual mandate. I have worked extensively on the 
employment side of the mandate, but I have also worked on the 
stable prices side of the mandate.
    In addition to having done extensive research and 
understanding dynamics of businesses and worker mobility in the 
labor market I have also spent a good amount of time in policy 
roles. During the Great Recession I was Chief Economist at the 
U.S. Department of Labor, and during that time we spent a lot 
of time thinking about developing policy proposals to address 
job creation, to address unemployment, to address workforce 
development. All of those measures were critical in terms of 
getting people back to work, working on the supply side, 
getting people back into the labor force and into job, but also 
in terms of trying to help businesses hire new people. So both 
sides are really very critical.
    I understand that the labor market has two sides to it. It 
is the businesses and the workers that are trying to make the 
best for each other.
    So that has been part of my work. When I was there, I have 
to say, I very much took data-driven approach and evidence-
based driven approach to policy proposals. I truly believe that 
data is very key in informing decisions and policy decisions. 
It grounds you on the facts. It grounds you on what is 
happening in the economy, it informs what the drivers of those 
new developments in the economy are, and it allows you to 
identify what works and what does not work, based on impartial 
studies and impartial evidence that can tell you where to go 
next.
    Senator Smith. Thank you. Thank you so much.
    I want to just quickly, if I could, ask--I will direct this 
to Dr. Cook and Dr. Jefferson. I am very interested, of course, 
in the Community Reinvestment Act and the incredible power that 
this law has to expand and improve access to credit and 
investment in traditionally disadvantaged and marginalized 
communities. And the CRA has finally been updated, after quite 
a long time.
    I am wondering if you just have any comments that you would 
like to make about why it is important to have that updated CRA 
and where you see us going from here. Dr. Cook?
    Ms. Cook. Thank you for your question, Senator. I 
definitely believe that the CRA is fundamental to a fair 
banking system. I sat on the board, as you know, of a CDFI in 
Grand Rapids, Michigan, and getting credit to the entire 
economy is something that is a part of the CRA. So getting 
funding for them is a part of the CRA, a part of the updating, 
and I look forward to considering it further when the proposals 
are put out later.
    Senator Smith. Thank you. Thank you very much.
    Chair Brown [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Smith.
    Senator Vance, of Ohio, is recognized.
    Senator Vance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate 
everybody being here, and I appreciate the Chairman for holding 
this important hearing.
    And I want to start maybe by just pointing out the obvious, 
that one of the important things the Federal Reserve does, of 
course, is hopefully help us prevent the next global financial 
crisis. And I want to focus, in particular, Ms. Cook, on some 
of your views here, because I think you have written some 
things I agree with and some things that I disagree with too.
    Just to start with and to give you some chance to explain 
your particular perspective here, I understand this is a very 
complicated question, but at a high level what do you think 
caused the 2008 global financial crisis?
    Ms. Cook. I think there were multiple factors causing the 
2008 crisis. Certainly I would say, living in Michigan, I 
certainly saw the mass layoffs that allowed for people who had 
taken out mortgages to no longer be able to make those 
payments. So that, to me, was one of the primary causes. But 
certainly extending credit in a way that was not sensible, both 
receiving credit and extending credit, especially in the 
subprime sector, helped to cause the global financial crisis.
    Senator Vance. I appreciate that, Ms. Cook, and I agree 
with you. Of course, one thing that I would add here is that we 
took, as you said, some primary credit problems and really 
exploded them by introducing a whole host of highly complex 
financial instruments. It seems like nobody understood them 
especially well. That obviously provided a lot of leverage in 
the economy, so when $10 disappeared, all of a sudden $1 
million disappeared, $10 million disappeared, and on and on the 
dominoes went.
    I want to ask, Ms. Cook, if you had to rank it, where would 
you say a lack of racial and gender diversity ranks on that 
list? Would you say it is a top 5 factor, a top 10 factor in 
what caused the global financial crisis? Lack of gender and 
racial diversity, of course, at the big banks.
    Ms. Cook. Senator, as a Federal Reserve Governor I think 
about the dual mandate first and I think about the two legs of 
that dual mandate, and those are maximum employment and stable 
prices. And as a Governor, I have been engaged with my 
colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee in fighting 
inflation aggressively. And I have been focused on the dual 
mandate, and that is how, if reconfirmed, I would plan to 
proceed.
    Senator Vance. I appreciate that, Ms. Cook, and the reason 
I asked this question is this. In a 2019 interview, you said 
that a lack of women and diversity leads to the next economic 
crisis. In another speech you suggested that a lack of 
diversity was, quote, ``at the root of the financial crisis and 
the Great Recession.''
    So my question is, do you think that a lack of diversity 
was a root cause of the recent turmoil in the banking sector, 
or do you think it was a root cause of the 2008 GFC?
    Ms. Cook. Senator, again I would focus on my time in the 
past year of being a Governor and focusing on the inflation 
fight. When I have written about diversity, in particular, 
something that you might be interested in that you focused on 
is immigration and where capital goes, and where in the country 
it is. So certainly as a Fed Governor I have been out in all 
parts of the country, listening to community banks and 
listening to communities about where credit is available and 
where it is not, and what the Federal Reserve might be able to 
do to provide such credit in the system, which is part of our 
dual mandate.
    Senator Vance. I appreciate that, Ms. Cook, and I will say 
that I hope you continue that work because I certainly agree 
that we need to extend credit where possible and make sure that 
businesses, whatever the color of the skin of the founder, have 
access to capital, and I think that is probably an area where 
there is some alignment between the two of us.
    The final point I would make, and the reason I asked this 
question, and probably one of the last times I will ever get to 
talk to you, and you are likely to be confirmed, is I really 
worry about how much time we focus on the tasks that we have in 
a given day, and if we are focused too much on the wrong things 
we do not have enough time to focus on the right things. That 
is certainly true in my job, and I think it is true in any 
other job.
    My worry is that especially at the Federal Reserve, which 
is doing important supervisory work, to the extent that we are 
focused on diversity, that may distract from our ability to 
focus on far, far more important things that are at the root of 
the Federal Reserve's mandate.
    So I hope, whatever your views and whatever your 
disagreements and agreements with me on that topic, when you 
are confirmed, as you likely will be, you take the focus on the 
core function, and I hope that none of us are distracted by 
some of these other concerns. Because I think that is what may 
lead to the next financial crisis, a lack of supervisory 
authority from the Federal Reserve, and I think over-focusing 
on diversity enhances and makes that more likely. It does not 
make it less likely. Thank you for answering my questions.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Vance.
    Senator Fetterman, of Pennsylvania, is recognized.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Dr. Cook, hello. Last time you were here my predecessor was 
minimized by your credentials and insisted that you were not 
prepared for this job. Essentially, he made tanking your 
nomination to be his priority in 2022. Would you agree with 
that, tanking your nomination?
    Ms. Cook. Senator, in the year that I have been a Governor, 
a Federal Reserve board Governor, I have focused on the dual 
mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. And I have 
brought to that both experience and research, experience in 
policymaking at the Council of Economic Advisors, at the 
Treasury, and I have also brought my research to bear.
    Senator Fetterman. Thankfully, he failed. Thankfully, he 
failed. And it is abundantly clear that you are qualified. You 
have a Ph.D. in economics. Correct?
    Ms. Cook. Yes.
    Senator Fetterman. You worked as a Professor of Economics 
at Michigan State. Correct?
    Ms. Cook. Yes.
    Senator Fetterman. You served as a Senior Economics at the 
Council of Economic Advisors, and on the board of a Community 
Development Financial Institution in Grand Rapids. Correct?
    Ms. Cook. Yes.
    Senator Fetterman. Not that you have been at that role now 
for over a year, can you now speak to how your experience 
prepared you for this role and for your year on the board for 
informing your future work?
    Ms. Cook. Thank you for that question, Senator. In 
particular, I will just piggyback on the answer that I gave 
Senator Scott. My time as a member of the board of directors of 
a CDFI has certainly informed the way I see credit getting into 
the system and the stability of the financial system, and 
tailoring regulation of the smallest institutions. That is one 
immediate way that I have seen that. And as a member of the 
committee on smaller regional banks and community banks, I have 
leveraged that knowledge to understand how our supervision and 
regulation affect small and medium-sized institutions.
    So I think it was critical to have that experience and 
experience in the financial sector, at an investment bank, at a 
large commercial bank, with the Federal Home Loan Bank of 
Indianapolis, where community banks selected me to serve. And 
certainly my research is clearly focused on the dual mandate, 
on maximum employment, in particular, related to economic 
growth, productivity, innovation. And I have brought that 
research to bear in addressing these questions in our 
decisions.
    Again, thank you for that question, Senator.
    Senator Fetterman. Thank you. And again, I am so grateful 
that my predecessor was not able to stop you being appointed.
    Dr. Kugler, I believe that it is critical for the Federal 
aims to create an economy that truly works for working people. 
Can you please talk about your background in labor economics 
and your time at the Department of Labor which will shape your 
work for working on the board?
    Ms. Kugler. Thank you, Senator Fetterman, and thank you for 
meeting with me last week. I very much appreciated your time.
    Let me say that I totally believe that the two sides of the 
dual mandate, both bringing down inflation and promoting 
maximum employment, can benefit all Americans and create broad-
based prosperity for the entire country, and I think this is 
critical.
    I have certainly worked much more in one side of the 
mandate, the employment side of the mandate. I have deep 
expertise in labor markets. As U.S. Chief Economist at the 
Department of Labor I worked on job creation policy, on 
policies that tried to get people back into work, including 
workforce development, and I have extensive experience 
analyzing U.S. economic data. In particular labor market data, 
data on employment, on wages, on prices from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics were critical to develop some of these policy 
proposals because I truly believe in evidence-based 
policymaking. I believe that a data-driven approach can give us 
a balanced approach toward policymaking, and it is critical.
    In fact, after I left my position as Chief Economist at the 
Department of Labor I was asked by BLS to join the Technical 
Advisory Committee to help them develop better measures of the 
CPI that would take into account product substitution, that 
would take into account changes in the consumer basket so that 
we could understand, in times like we are living through today, 
better where we are in terms of inflation and where we need to 
go.
    As U.S. Executive Director of the World Bank, which is a 
Senate-confirmed position, and I thank Senator Hagerty for 
having supported me in that role, I have also helped the World 
Bank grapple with some of the same issues. In fact, inflation 
around the globe is something that we have seen spread 
throughout. It is not a U.S. phenomenon. It is an international 
phenomenon, and it is something that we are seeing, even at 
much higher levels, experienced in other countries.
    I also have engaged on the recovery from the pandemic 
across the world, which again, is the other side of the 
mandate, the mandate that grows economies, that creates jobs.
    And so I believe I really bring a different perspective, a 
nuanced understanding of labor data, which is critical to 
understanding where we are and where the economy is going. And 
I look forward to continuing to work on both sides of the 
mandate. But as I indicated before, I think right now the price 
stability side of the mandate is very critical, and I am 
certainly committed to bringing down inflation to the 2 percent 
target.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Fetterman, and I concur 
that your predecessor's inability to stop Dr. Cook's nomination 
was a very good thing.
    Senator Hagerty is recognized.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Governor Jefferson, welcome back. It is good to see you 
again. If confirmed for this new position you are going to take 
over a key monetary policy position at the Federal Reserve. You 
will likely be tasked with considering whether the United 
States Government should issue a retail central bank digital 
currency. Chair Powell has been clear that the Federal Reserve 
lacks the authority to issue a retail CBDC without 
congressional authorization.
    In March, before the House Financial Services Committee, 
Chair Powell testified that, quote, ``It is absolutely the case 
that Congress will need to authorize the Federal Reserve to 
issue a CBDC.'' He is also on record saying that to advance a 
retail CBDC the Fed, quote, ``would need buy-in from Congress, 
from the Administration, from broad elements of the public,'' 
and that again, quote, ``the Fed would not proceed with a CBDC 
without support from Congress in the form of an authorizing 
law.''
    My first question, Governor, is do you agree with Chair 
Powell that the Federal Reserve cannot issue a CBDC without 
authorization from Congress?
    Mr. Jefferson. I do, Senator.
    Senator Hagerty. Thank you. Governor, before I continue I 
just want to make it clear that I am going to vehemently oppose 
any attempt to create a central bank digital currency, whether 
that is at the Federal Reserve, here at Congress, or in the 
executive branch. A tool of this nature not only represents an 
attack on American sovereignty, it poses an unprecedented 
threat to our individual liberties. And frankly, I think that 
any tool like this that the central bank and the Chinese 
Communist Party in China uses to control its people should be 
vehemently rejected by the American public.
    Governor Cook, welcome. As you know, Vice Chair of 
Supervision Michael Barr will soon release his significant 
alteration to the bank capital rule structure, known as Basel 
III or Basel Endgame. And as a member of the Federal
    Reserve's Committee on Financial Stability have you had an 
opportunity to review the draft of the new rule? And if so, if 
you could clarify, what specific weaknesses in our current 
framework would this new draft address?
    Ms. Cook. Thank you for the question, Senator. Indeed, Vice 
Chair Barr is conducting a holistic review of capital 
standards, but we have not received proposals yet to review 
related to the Basel III Endgame.
    Senator Hagerty. So for the record you have not reviewed a 
draft? You have not seen it? This is a 1,000-page proposal. You 
have not had an opportunity to look at any of this at this 
point?
    Ms. Cook. Neither the review, which is not yet complete, 
the holistic review, nor----
    Senator Hagerty. I am talking about the draft that is being 
put together now.
    Ms. Cook. Right. So I have not had a chance to review it 
yet, no. I have not received it, but I look forward to 
reviewing it when I receive it, yes.
    Senator Hagerty. It is going to be extensively--if it is a 
1,000-page-plus rule, it is going to be an extensive proposal 
that has very, very broad-ranging ramifications. So I hope that 
you will have the opportunity to review that, and once you do I 
would very much be interested in getting your perspective, and 
your staff can get back with mine----
    Ms. Cook. Absolutely.
    Senator Hagerty. ----on the specifics of what ought to be 
addressed by this dramatic proposal that we are anticipating. 
Again, I am hearing a lot of rumors about what is in it. I know 
a lot of people are talking about what is in it. I would be 
interested in your perspective once you have a chance to see 
the draft.
    I think that we ought to keep in mind the fact that we have 
been through some very real-world banking stress, when you 
think about what has happened through the pandemic, what we 
have navigated with Silicon Valley Bank, with Credit Suisse, 
and it is tested the large banks, and I think they have done 
fairly well through this process. So again, I am looking at 
this very keenly in my eye, and I will be very interested to 
see where you land on this too, what your concerns might be, 
and again, what you think this might address.
    But what I want to make sure that we do not do is use this 
in some way as an effort to back-door certain changes that some 
of my colleagues would like to see, ideological changes, that 
do not have anything to do with the strength, the security, and 
soundness of the banking system.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Hagerty.
    Senator Warner, from Virginia, is recognized.
    Senator Warner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My apologies to my 
colleague from Vermont.
    Before Senator Hagerty leaves I would like to make a couple 
of quick comments. One, I think you right on the central bank 
digital currency. I was concerned prior to COVID that China, by 
moving aggressively with the digital yuan, and with Chinese 
tourists flooding Europe that that might become a default 
international standard.
    Mr. Chairman, we had hearings on this earlier. I think it 
would be time to revisit it. I do not feel this maybe a 
strongly as Senator Hagerty, but I sure as heck would like to 
get further educated. I know we have looked at this from the 
intel side, but I hopefully would----
    Senator Hagerty. Senator Warner, I certainly respect your 
opinion on this too, and you have a different perspective in 
your role as Chair of the Intel Committee. In our role in this 
subcommittee here, in the Banking Committee, I----
    Senator Warner. I think it is time to revisit. And I do 
want to actually mention again Senator Hagerty's point. Dr. 
Kugler, it is nice to see you, but your colleagues, who I have 
had the chance of supporting in the past, I think we have got 
to have appropriate safety and soundness standards. But I do 
worry, when we have got as aggressive a monetary policy we have 
at this moment in time that if there is not a phase-in on some 
of these new capital standards we could have the perfect storm 
of these two entities intersecting and dramatically decreasing 
access to credit at a moment when we have got large segments of 
our economy, commercial real estate in particular, could really 
be hit hard.
    So I do hope, recognizing that this more falls into Vice 
Chair Barr's standpoint, that that intersection--and I just 
really, you know, this could be that time when monetary policy 
and safety and soundness, both on their own, might be 
worthwhile and appropriate, but could have an intersection 
point on access to capital.
    And that, Dr. Kugler, is going to lead me to my first 
question for you, and congratulations on your nomination, 
because I know Dr. Cook and Dr. Jefferson, to a lesser extent, 
we talked about this issue which is near and dear to my heart, 
and a whole lot of us on this Committee, and that is access to 
capital issues for underserved communities. I was very proud of 
the fact that working with then-Chair Crapo--maybe not then-
Chair--but during the Trump administration we actually got $12 
billion--$3 billion in grants, $9 billion in Tier 1 capital--
for minority depository institutions and community development 
financial institutions, CDFIs. We have now created a caucus 
that continues to grow. I think we are up to about 20 
bipartisan members.
    CDFIs are kind of an underserved part of the community, but 
they have, by this Tier 1 capital that has gone out--and again, 
I know Dr. Cook was on the board of one--we have seen an 
outward lending uptick of about 40-some percent from this Tier 
1 capital.
    We are actually now working--again, Secretary Crapo, Deputy 
Secretary Adeyemo, and I--on getting many of the corporates 
who, in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, promised 
they would do things. They promised about $300 billion. Five 
billion dollars was all that we have been able to track, but we 
have got $1 billion of additional commitments of deposits in 
CDFIs.
    And some of this money has to be sticky because if not you 
could have, in a world of internet-based runs, the same 
phenomenon, and frankly, CDFIs could be the first victims, even 
though we have upped their capital, could be the first victims 
of capital flight. So trying to get these companies with large 
balance sheets to put at least a year-long capital into CDFIs.
    This is quickly turning into a monologue, not a question, 
but I know your colleagues are already supportive. You, as a 
labor economist, I hope, and would believe, would have a strong 
interest in making sure we have access to capital across all 
communities. And particularly Black and brown communities bore 
the brunt of COVID, their businesses.
    So could you, in this last minute, address that issue of 
CDFIs and MDIs and their role in the overall lending 
environment in the country?
    Ms. Kugler. Thank you very much, Senator Warner, for that 
question. I truly believe that a healthy and a strong banking 
system requires a diverse banking system with a diversity of 
sizes. But in particular, I think that the small and community 
banks play a key role in providing credit to low- and moderate-
income communities. So I truly believe they play a critical 
role. I agree with you. I think additional resources are 
important for CDFIs and MDIs as well as technical assistance 
but also ensuring that they are not overburdened.
    So I think there are many ways to support CDFIs, and I 
would certainly work to support them. I believe that they need 
to serve all communities across the country, including rural 
communities, underserved urban communities, and also Native 
land areas. So we need to reach all Americans, and we need to 
make sure everybody has access to credit in a way that allows 
them to prosper.
    Senator Warner. Again, as you know, and Dr. Kugler, I have 
not served on one and I do not think you are going to get a 
chance to answer this. My time has expired. But CDFIs, by their 
definition, have to serve 60 percent low- and moderate-income 
individuals. While I applaud a lot of our community banks, 
CDFIs have a much greater focus, and I think they need that 
extra support.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Warner.
    Senator Warren, of Massachusetts, is recognized.
    Senator Warren. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and 
congratulations to our nominees who, like every one of 
President Biden's Democratic Fed nominees, have committed to 
the strongest ethical standards in the history of the Fed. 
Thank you for that.
    The single biggest threat to our banking system is 
concentration. Three bank failures this spring reminded us that 
too-big-to-fail is still alive and kicking in the banking 
industry. Little banks, even mid-sized banks, do not pose those 
risks to our economy, but when multibillion-dollar banks 
stumble, taxpayers are ultimately on the hook.
    Even though we know about these risks, the big banks keep 
merging with other banks and getting bigger and bigger. But 
every one of those mergers must, by law, be approved by our 
financial regulators before they can go through. Despite the 
too-big-to-fail dangers, the Fed, the FDIC, and the OCC have 
not formally rejected a bank merger application in more than 15 
years. Now President Biden knows that this is a serious 
problem. That is why he issued an executive order directing 
banking agencies to revamp bank merger review process and to 
use it to, and I will quote him here, ``guard against excessive 
market power.''
    As part of the Fed, you all would be called on to review 
and approve any big bank merger applications. So I just want to 
go down the line here. Dr. Jefferson, do you agree with 
President Biden that we need to strengthen the bank merger 
review process to protect against consolidation?
    Mr. Jefferson. Thank you, Senator, for that question, and I 
want to contextualize my response a little bit, if you will 
allow me. We follow the requirements given to us, the laws 
given to us, by the Congress in determining mergers, according 
to competitiveness, compliance with the Community Reinvestment 
Act, and the managerial competency for the----
    Senator Warren. Dr. Jefferson, I know the law here. The 
question I am asking you is you are about to have to face this 
question about the bank merger review process that is yours, 
the Fed's. That is what the law says. You get the power here. 
And all I am asking is do you agree with the President that we 
need to strengthen the bank merger review process to protect 
against consolidation? It is a pretty simple question. Yes?
    Mr. Jefferson. Well, Secretary, yes, I mean, I want to----
    Senator Warren. I will take yes.
    Mr. Jefferson. OK. But I also would like to contextualize 
what is happening in these processes. So the banks are aware of 
the law, just as you have stipulated, and so we do not want too 
much consolidation. That is exactly right.
    Senator Warren. Good. I will take that then as a yes. That 
is all I am looking for here, is that consolidation is a 
problem. Bank merger review guidelines are one way to beat back 
some of this consolidation drift that we seem to be heading 
into.
    Can I just settle this on a yes?
    Mr. Jefferson. You can settle this in saying that we 
appreciate the fact that we need a diversity of banks in the 
economy and that we would not want too much consolidation. I 
agree with that wholeheartedly.
    Senator Warren. OK. I just want to go down the line here, 
but I have got to tell you, I find your answer really 
troubling, that you cannot just say yes.
    Dr. Cook, what about you?
    Ms. Cook. Thank you for that question. So I am not familiar 
with what President Biden said, but as a member of the 
Committee on Financial Stability I have a broad host of 
concerns related to safeguarding the financial system. And one 
of those issues happens to be concentration among a lot of 
other factors. So I would look forward to, if any proposal 
comes our way, look forward to reviewing it carefully.
    Senator Warren. So does that mean that you think 
consolidation is a problem and bank merger guidelines, which 
have something to do with the consolidation, we should make 
them tougher in order to beat back consolidation?
    Ms. Cook. Bank concentration is definitely a risk to 
financial stability, and therefore, yes, I am concerned about 
that.
    Senator Warren. Good. Good. And Dr. Kugler, how about you?
    Ms. Kugler. Thank you, Senator Warren, and I appreciated 
talking about these issues in your office last week. I first 
want to say that I am very grateful for your commitment to 
uphold the integrity and trust in our Government institutions, 
and I was happy to sign the pledge.
    So getting to your question, let me say that I believe that 
the diversity of the banking sector is essential. Competition 
in the banking sector is critical. And I think it is certainly 
one of the factors that allows low- and moderate-income 
households to have access to credit. So I think this is very 
critical.
    I can assure you that I would consider every merger 
application on its own merits, that I would understand the 
facts, that I would understand the consequences of 
consolidation, and I worry about excessive consolidation. So I 
certainly understand that you need a diversity of sizes of 
banks in the economy, but I think you need that competition, 
and it is critical to allow low- and moderate-income households 
to have access.
    Senator Warren. You know, I just want to say I am 
particularly concerned because regulators allowed America's 
biggest bank, JPMorgan Chase, to swallow up First Republic 
following its May collapse, making JPMorgan Chase the biggest 
too-big-to-fail bank, $200 billion bigger. And now some of 
those same regulators are rolling out the red carpet for even 
more mergers.
    According to a recent New York Times report, Treasury 
Secretary Yellen told big bank CEOs, in a private meeting, that 
she would welcome more bank mergers, in part because it would 
make it easier for regulators to do their job of overseeing the 
financial system.
    Encouraging giant, too-big-to-fail banks to buy up small 
banks so there are fewer banks to monitor would be a dangerous 
mistake. We need tougher bank merger review guidelines and 
tighter rules on big banks. I know that the Fed is working on 
those right now, and I expect each of you to push for the 
strongest version of these proposals.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Chair Brown. Senator Tillis, of North Carolina, is 
recognized.
    Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Congratulations to 
all of you on your nominations, and Mr. Jefferson, 
particularly, congratulations to you. I supported your 
confirmation and I intend to support your confirmation on your 
next step. I also want to personally thank you for the time 
that we spent on the phone last week. I found your insights and 
your candor to be a breath of fresh air.
    I have got a quick question. Mr. Barr, who has taken a look 
at the holistic review--and I understand that you will not 
necessarily opine on what Mr. Barr is doing within his lanes--
but I am trying to square public comments he has made about the 
bank system being quite sound and what we all assume is going 
to be a decision to increase capital requirements for banks.
    So where do you believe that we find a balance between 
capital standards? I mean, how can you reconcile the person who 
is responsible for this holistic review who says the banking 
system is quite sound and what we think is an eventual increase 
in capital requirements? How do you do that?
    Mr. Jefferson. Senator, I want to thank you for taking time 
out to speak with me last week. I also enjoyed our 
conversation.
    As you can imagine, I do not think it would be appropriate 
for me to speak about Vice Chair Barr's philosophies because I 
know he comes before this and other committees.
    Senator Tillis. That is fair enough. I anticipated that 
your answer was very disciplined, but I just hope Mr. Barr 
understands that those two need to be reconciled, so when we 
see his recommendations we will deal with them at that time.
    We just had--I do not know if you were here, and I know 
some were in the audience--we were talking about this clawback 
law. The point that I made there is we are only talking about 
one of what I consider to be the two root causes of Silicon 
Valley Bank failure, Signature Bank failure. I think First 
Republic is a slightly different category. But what I am 
surprised by is that I do not know if the FDIC or the Federal 
Reserve, can you confirm for me whether or not the FDIC or the 
Federal Reserve has taken any action against the supervisors 
that were responsible with the SVB supervision?
    Mr. Jefferson. I can say, to my knowledge, I am not aware 
of that.
    Senator Tillis. So if there is a general sense that there 
was a lapse in supervision--and even, Senate bill 2155, for 
about a month or two after the collapse, was said by some of my 
friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle as the 
root cause of the collapse. But we all know that there is 
optionality in there, and we know that the supervisors know 
that now because we are seeing an increasing rate of MRAs and 
MRIAs that are coming out with banks, subsequent to the Silicon 
Valley Bank lapse. So that suggests to me that someone did not 
put their foot on the accelerator with Silicon Valley Bank, and 
it suggests to me that we really need a full accounting of why 
they did that. Why were they lax with the MRAs, with the MRIAs, 
the outstanding MRIAs? We had the CEO here and said that he was 
encountering, I think, 31. I think that was the number.
    So it just seems to me, and actually, if any other 
nominees--I see you taking notes--have your own comment, it 
does not seem like we are really focusing on the second part. 
There was a management failure. There was management 
malpractice. But it seems like there was a supervisory failure 
and potentially supervisory malpractice.
    So how do we actually get to a point that there is some 
accountability there? There does not seem to be accountability 
today. How do you deal with that?
    Mr. Jefferson. Well Senator, my recollection of Vice Chair 
Barr's report was that he did identify----
    Senator Tillis. He pointed to supervisory lapses, which is 
why I am wondering why there was not action taken.
    Mr. Jefferson. Well, that, Senator, is above my pay grade 
in terms of determining who might----
    Senator Tillis. But if we get away from the specifics, but 
conceptually, when we look at the activities, the supervision 
and the bank, and most people think there is a general sense 
that there was a lapse, and there have been people at the Fed 
that have stipulated that maybe there was a lapse, why would 
there not be a natural follow-up to hold individuals 
accountable? Just conceptually.
    Mr. Jefferson. Well Senator, I think that the points that 
you are raising are vital for further consideration by the 
board, and I think that in time to come, as we learn more about 
what happened in this episode, it will be the case that that 
knowledge will be used so that going forward--and I think that 
is really what is critical here, Senator, is lessons learned, 
and what can we do in terms of----
    Senator Tillis. Yeah. If we get nothing more than say maybe 
this group of supervisors gets a pass, but that behavior that 
was demonstrated there is unacceptable so there will be 
consequences in the future if we have a lapse in supervision, 
to me would be a great start.
    I want to thank you for being here, I want to thank you for 
your service to Davidson College, and I look forward to 
supporting your nominations.
    Chair Brown. Thank you, Senator Tillis.
    Senator Menendez is going to take the chair. I am really 
appreciative of that. But Senator Cortez Masto will ask the 
next questions. Thank you.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Congratulations to the nominees. Hello to the family members. 
This is almost done. You can almost go grab some lunch. And it 
is a pleasure for me always to be at these hearings to see 
these incredible nominees like yourselves who are willing to 
engage in public service, so thank you. Thank you. It is not 
always easy in this environment at times.
    Let me bring us back to Nevada, my State. I want to talk a 
little bit about employment. There is sort of a paradox in the 
workforce in Nevada. The most recent data shows Nevada is both 
the highest job growth and the highest unemployment rate in the 
country right now. We had the highest unemployment rate in the 
Nation in April, which was about 5.4 percent, 2 points above 
the national rate of 3.4 percent, but we also had the largest 
percent increase in employment, at 4.2 percent as well.
    So let me ask all three of you, and let me start with you, 
Dr. Kugler, and thank you for meeting with me. You have 
experience both at the national level, as a Chief Economist at 
the Department of Labor, and also at the international level as 
Executive Director of the World Bank Group for the USA and 
other entities. As you consider the Federal Reserve's mandate 
to keep unemployment levels low, how do you consider a State 
like Nevada in that paradox, with respect to unemployment?
    Ms. Kugler. Thank you, Senator Cortez Masto. It was really 
a pleasure having the opportunity to meet with you last week.
    I have to say that some of the models that the Federal 
Reserve uses actually take into account both the levels as well 
as the changes. So what you are talking about is very 
important. Where do you start from and are you approaching, is 
your trajectory moving in the right direction.
    Interestingly, most models consider one or the other, but I 
think both are really key and very important to consider as one 
is thinking about monetary policy decisions. So that is a very 
key question.
    You want to be moving in the right direction. You want to 
be bringing down the level so that you are changing more, and 
more rapidly, so you are eventually bringing down the level and 
bringing down the level of unemployment for everyone in the 
State of Nevada, hopefully. So that is very key.
    I think another key issue is how are we considering labor 
force participation and how are we considering the marginally 
attached, for example? What is the real tightness in the labor 
market, which you do not usually get to consider very well in 
some of these measures, the standard measures of unemployment. 
It is helpful to broaden some of those measures of unemployment 
in order to consider the real tightness in the labor market, 
which has been a real issue when we are considering the 
concerns with inflation in the economy.
    The other area where I think it is very key to focus on, 
and the Fed has been moving in this direction in its framework, 
is in thinking about shortages as opposed to surpluses in full 
employment. We are worried when people are unemployed, and that 
should be the focus in terms of that side of the dual mandate. 
It should be in achieving full employment. You know, if we are 
surpassing full employment that would only be a concern if you 
have a really, really tight labor. But the concern is when you 
have people out of work and unable to make ends meet.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. And Dr. Jefferson and Dr. 
Cook, similarly, how would you share or consider unemployment 
rates that are seemingly contradictory with the high 
unemployment rate but also what we see with the job growth as 
well? I am just curious.
    Dr. Cook, do you want to go first?
    Ms. Cook. Thank you for that question. It is a really 
important question. You and I talked about this in 2021, when I 
was testifying before Congress before. And I would agree with 
my colleague here that it is a difference in levels in changes. 
And what we know about strong labor markets is that they bring 
in people who may be at the margins of the labor market. So I 
think it is a good indicator. The unemployment rate is just 
people who are looking for jobs. And I think following the fact 
that there are jobs being added I think is a good thing, and 
hopefully the unemployment rate will follow.
    But it is somewhat paradoxical because you can have an 
increase in the labor force participation rate and have an 
increase in the unemployment rate at the same time, just 
because more people are looking for work. But that is what 
strong labor markets do. So I would not consider them entirely 
contradictory if we are just thinking economically or 
statistically.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Mr. Jefferson. I would just add that what you have 
described is a very dynamic labor market, where you have 
certain sectors surging and other sectors releasing labor, and 
labor then has to be reallocated. So I definitely appreciate 
your concern with regards to the level of unemployment, but I 
would also want to share that what you have described is a 
dynamism in the Nevada economy, and is going through a 
transition in which it will settle, I believe, eventually, with 
higher levels of employment overall.
    Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
    Senator Menendez [presiding]. Thank you. Before I begin my 
questions let me take a moment to further note the outpouring 
of support Dr. Kugler has received. Dozens of groups, including 
bipartisan organizations such as the Hispanic Chamber of 
Commerce, the Latino Coalition, the American Society of 
Hispanic Economists have written in support of Dr. Kugler's 
nomination. Latino advocacy groups such as NALEO Hispanic 
Federation, the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda have also 
endorsed here. So I ask unanimous consent that these be entered 
into the record.
    Without objection, so ordered.
    Dr. Kugler, a key component of the Federal Reserve system 
is its independence, which gives it the ability to insulate 
itself from political pressures and implement evidence-based 
monetary policy. An independent Federal Reserve allows a 
financial system to remain stable and safe and our economy 
resilient to headwinds of the day. Through this, our country 
has been able to wade through challenging economic times and 
high inflation.
    So as the U.S. Executive Director of the World Bank, you 
are clearly no stranger to economic leadership. Can you talk 
about your approach to data and evidence in your work at the 
World Bank and in academia?
    Ms. Kugler. Thank you very much, Senator Menendez. First 
let me say how honored and humbled I am by your introductory 
remarks and how humbled I am by the outpour of support from the 
Hispanic community and many economists, bipartisan economists, 
who have also written on my behalf.
    I very much share your commitment to Fed independence. I 
think it is critical for the Fed to be able to work well and 
fulfill its mandate. It allows the Fed to focus on the long-
term needs of the economy as opposed to short-term political 
pressures, and I think that is very critical.
    It also allows the Fed to focus on a data-driven, evidence-
based approach to policymaking, which I think is critical. We 
need to find out what the realities of the economy are. We need 
to find out the drivers of where the economy is. We need to 
find out where to go. All of that can be done only with 
objective and impartial analysis of data. So that is what I 
have done over the past 25 years of my career. I have actually 
published over 40 academic papers that are highly vetted. My 
colleagues know that here, that any economics paper that gets 
published in an economic journal is highly vetted. It gets 
many, many reviews. You get asked to recheck and check and 
triple-check and check 10 times before it can be published.
    In terms of policy work, my approach has always been to 
look at data, to understand the realities of our economy, to 
understand the drivers of those realities, and to understand 
where we need to go based on impartial evidence produced by 
researchers from throughout the political spectrum.
    So I do believe that in my work, both as Chief Economist at 
the U.S. Department of Labor and at the World Bank I have 
certainly used that approach, whether it is in regard to 
workforce development issues, to job creation, or at the World 
Bank most recently, when we come to analyze such important 
issues as high inflation around the world or food insecurity 
around the world.
    So that has been exactly my approach, and if confirmed, 
Senator Menendez, I fully commit to upholding the independence 
of the Federal Reserve system.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you. That was my next question. I 
am going to yield to Senator Warnock.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and 
congratulations to the nominees here today. We have before the 
Committee three outstanding and historic nominees to the 
Federal Reserve who are all eminently qualified to apply their 
efforts to abide by the Fed's dual mandate to maximize 
employment and manage inflation. They will further help the 
board reflect the diversity of our great Nation, and are also 
all ready to maintain the safety and the soundness of our 
financial system.
    Georgia banks are sound in terms of their expertise to lend 
to their communities, but they are having to carefully navigate 
higher rates and maintain customers' confidence following the 
failures of banks in other parts of the country. With higher 
interest rates and tightening credit conditions, small 
businesses, especially, are having trouble finding loans to 
help fund their growth. Meanwhile, the giant banks are spending 
billions on buybacks while their consumer and small business 
banking revenue has sharply increased, taking money straight 
from Georgia's communities and delivering it to their wealthy 
shareholders.
    Dr. Cook, what actions is the Federal Reserve taking to 
ensure small businesses are not facing needless restraints on 
credit?
    Ms. Cook. Thank you so much for your question, Senator, and 
it was a pleasure to speak with you in your office yesterday.
    The way we approach financial stability is to think about 
the optimization problem, as any economist would, and the 
tradeoffs associated with optimizing supervision and 
regulation. Certainly we do not think that community banks, for 
example, should be burdened with the kind of regulation that 
you might see for larger banking institutions, and those are 
the ones that typically fund small businesses. And this is why 
I am particularly concerned about the bank stress that has been 
concentrated among the regional banks that typically fund small 
businesses, for example.
    So what we are doing in terms of financial stability is to 
monitor very closely the ongoing effects of bank stress and 
making sure to monitor, and making sure that the system stays 
sound and resilient. And I am a big supporter of the diversity 
of the financial system, the diversity in sizes of financial 
institutions, and community banks, especially, have deep roots 
in their communities and know their clients very well. So I 
think that is the major way that the Federal Reserve is 
supporting small businesses and small institutions.
    Senator Warnock. I think you are right about the importance 
of community banks, and just to push a little more, so what 
support has the Federal Reserve provided small lending 
institutions in the wake of these collapses?
    Ms. Cook. We are reviewing, as a part of Vice Chair Barr's 
holistic review, of not just capital standards but also this 
review that was already published of SVB, to learn the lessons 
of the failure of SVB. So I think that is one of the major 
things, and then to translate that into concrete steps, and 
that is what we are doing.
    I sit on the subcommittee on smaller regional banks and 
community banks, and we are actively discussing the ways in 
which we learned the lessons and make sure that this monitoring 
is happening so that that part of the financial system, and all 
of the financial system, stays sound and resilient.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you so much.
    Dr. Kugler, how would your experience at the World bank 
inform your work on the Federal Reserve board to support small 
businesses?
    Ms. Kugler. Thank you for that question, Senator Warnock. 
You know, it is interesting because just like we are 
experiencing inflation today here in the U.S., at alarming 
levels, that inflation is even higher if you look at around the 
world. Inflation in a place like Lebanon is 200 percent. 
Inflation in a place like Zimbabwe is 60 percent, 50 percent in 
Argentina, 35 percent in Turkey. So you see it throughout the 
world, in different regions, and it is certainly much more 
pronounced everywhere else in the world. These are issues I 
have had to work with.
    On the other side, the recovery from the pandemic was 
something that I also worked on at the World Bank, and I have 
worked on at the World Bank. And part of that help was not only 
helping households, but it was helping small- and medium-sized 
businesses recover from the pandemic or stay afloat through the 
pandemic so that the private sector could thrive, and when the 
time came to get out of the pandemic, that was so painful to us 
throughout the world, then the private sector could continue to 
hire those households and workers that very much needed that 
help after the pandemic.
    So I have worked both on the recovery side as well as on 
the inflation side more recently, which just like here in the 
U.S. was experienced because of supply chain disruptions 
because of people withdrawing out of the labor force, and all 
of these exacerbated by Russia's war on Ukraine. So that has 
been felt even more in other continents, in other parts of the 
world, and I have worked very actively on all of those 
important issues, in particular in terms of supporting small- 
and medium-sized businesses.
    Senator Warnock. Thank you so very much, Mr. Chair.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you. I am going to submit the rest 
of my questions for the record to all three of you.
    Thank you to our nominees for being here today, for 
providing testimony, for your willingness to serve and your 
families who have been enjoying, in some cases, your testimony 
behind you. I am looking at the faces, and they really think 
you are really brilliant at the end of the day. So I can see 
they are all very proud.
    I hope we can work together as a Committee to move forward 
quickly on today's nominees. For Senators who wish to submit 
questions for the hearing record, those questions are due at 5 
p.m. on Monday, June 26th. To the nominees, we would like to 
have your responses by Thursday, July 6th, at noon.
    Again, on behalf of the Chairman, thank you for your 
testimony today, and this hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 12:08 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
    [Prepared statements, biographical sketches of nominees, 
responses to written questions, and additional material

               PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIR SHERROD BROWN
    The Committee meets today to consider three nominations to the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System:
    The Honorable Philip Jefferson to be Vice Chairman;
    The Honorable Lisa Cook to be a member; and
    The Honorable Adriana Kugler to be a member.
    We thank the nominees for appearing here today and for their 
willingness to serve in these important roles.
    The economy is in a different place from where it was at this time 
last year.
    Back then, Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine devastated global 
energy markets--driving up the cost of gas at the pump. The national 
average price of gas topped $5 a gallon.
    Global supply chain disruptions resulted in shortages of key 
goods--increasing costs on American families.
    And inflation hit a peak rate of 9.1 percent.
    Today, inflation is at 4 percent-short of the Fed's target rate of 
2 percent, but a steady improvement from the 9 percent rate last year.
    Global supply chains have begun to stabilize. Product shortages 
have eased. Ports are less congested.
    The price of gas at the pump has fallen and domestic energy 
production has increased.
    The unemployment rate is under 4 percent.
    This is the strongest labor market for American workers in decades. 
The country added 339,000 jobs in May--bringing the total number of 
jobs created since January 2021 to 13 million.
    In April, the Black unemployment rate hit 4.7 percent--the lowest 
in more than 50 years. In May, the unemployment rate for Latinos 
decreased.
    The economy is trending in the right direction. We must build on 
that success, and work to solve the persistent problems that have held 
back American workers for decades, regardless of the economic trends.
    At this important time in our economic recovery, we need all seven 
Federal Reserve governors working to grow an economy with low prices 
and plentiful job opportunities.
    To uphold the Fed's dual mandate of promoting stable prices and 
maximum employment.
    We are fortunate to have three exceptionally qualified nominees 
before the Committee today.
    Dr. Philip Jefferson is the President's nominee to be Vice Chair of 
the Federal Reserve. If confirmed, Dr. Jefferson would be only the 
second Black man to serve in this role. In 2022, the Senate confirmed 
Dr. Jefferson in a 91-7 vote to a 14-year term as a member of the 
Federal Reserve.
    Dr. Jefferson is a recognized expert on the economics of poverty 
and opportunity. Before joining the Fed, Dr. Jefferson served as Vice 
President for Academic Affairs, Dean of Faculty, and Paul B. Freeland 
Professor of Economics at Davidson College. He began his career as a 
Fed economist, and served as chair of the Economics Department at 
Swarthmore College.
    Welcome, Dr. Jefferson. Glad to have you here today.
    The President has renominated Dr. Lisa Cook to a 14-year term on 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Despite a toxic campaign 
by the far-right to discredit her nomination, the Senate confirmed Dr. 
Cook's nomination to the Board of Governors in May of last year. Like 
Dr. Jefferson, Dr. Cook is a respected economist with decades of 
monetary policy experience.
    Prior to joining the Fed, Dr. Cook served as professor of economics 
and international relations at Michigan State University--becoming one 
of the country's leading researchers on international economic growth 
and innovation economics.
    Before that, Dr. Cook served as a Senior Economist at the White 
House, Senior Adviser at the Department of Treasury, and Adjunct 
Professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.
    Welcome, Dr. Cook. Good to see you again.
    It took over a century to have a Black woman governor on the 
Federal Reserve. Dr. Cook shattered that glass ceiling last year.
    Today, this Committee will consider another historic nomination. 
Dr. Adriana Kugler would be the first Hispanic American to serve on the 
Federal Reserve.
    Before yielding the balance of my time to Senator Menendez, who 
will introduce Dr. Kugler, I want to recognize Senator Menendez for his 
many years of championing Hispanic representation in our financial 
system and at the highest levels of Government.
                                 ______
                                 
                PREPARED STATEMENT OF SENATOR TIM SCOTT
    Thank you, Chairman, and thank you for your hard work on this 
legislation, and frankly, thank you to your staff and certainly my 
staff is amazing. I know that [as] this legislation came together, we 
were working on the amendment process as late as 3:30 in the morning, 
and I thank my staff for their hard work, their dedication, and 
certainly their willingness to take into consideration not Republicans 
or Democrats, but the American people. At the end of the day both of 
these pieces of legislation, the goal of the legislation, is to make 
sure we (A) have a more responsible response from bank execs, (B) that 
the 70,000 Americans who lost their lives to fentanyl, that their 
families understand that we're serious about stopping the flow of 
fentanyl.
    I'll say that this is our first markup since 2019. Since becoming 
Ranking Member, I've repeatedly underscored the importance of regular 
order--of allowing our committee to debate and negotiate bills under 
our jurisdiction. This return to regular order is long overdue, sorely 
needed, and certainly celebrated.
    Today, we consider two commonsense pieces of legislation. First, my 
FEND (Fentanyl Eradication and Narcotics Deterrence), or FEND Off 
Fentanyl Act. This bill will direct the Department of Treasury to use 
our economic sanctions tools to choke off the profits of the Chinese 
precursor manufacturers and the Mexican cartels that push fentanyl 
across our border, leading to the deaths of more than 70,000 Americans.
    I talk a lot about opportunity in this country, because it provided 
me with remarkable opportunities. But the deaths represent the loss of 
opportunity to fulfill one's purpose, to contribute to their own 
communities, and to achieve their version of the American Dream.
    That is why I'm especially proud that the Committee will take up my 
FEND Off Fentanyl bill because it is past time we sanction the 
manufacturers, the exporters, and the cartels that traffic and sell 
this poison by hitting them where it hurts the most--their bank 
accounts.
    Over 70,000 Americans died just last year, an all-time high, fueled 
by Mexican cartels trafficking these drugs across the wide-open 
southern border that this Administration refuses to close. Again, these 
precursors come from China are manufactured in labs in Mexico, and are 
smuggled across our southern border and ports of entry by the Mexican 
cartels.
    Virtually all of us in this room know family members and/or 
families in our communities who have lost a loved one. I have often 
spoken about my friend Alan Shao, former business dean at the College 
of Charleston whose son at 27 years old, Alan Shao II, lost his life to 
fentanyl. It's a pain that no parent should ever experience, the pain 
of bearing your kids. While nothing we can do here will bring back 
those we've lost, we should do something and everything we can to stop 
the flow of fentanyl into our communities so other families don't have 
to experience the same pain of the Shao family.
    So, I want to thank the Chairman and all the Members of this 
Committee for joining me in this effort. Today we get one step closer 
to getting FEND Off Fentanyl across the finish line, and hopefully 
saving thousands upon thousands of American lives.
    Moving on to the second bill today, the RECOUP Act. This bill 
represents a commonsense solution that will protect the American 
taxpayer from holding the bag when bank mismanagement runs rampant and 
seeks to hold the leadership of failed banks accountable by requiring 
commonsense corporate good governance requirements. And as we saw in 
the failures earlier this year, the bill would penalize bad actors for 
their gross negligence.
    Immediately after SVB and Signature Bank failed in March, I said 
that this was nothing short of a failure in three parts. First, the 
bank executives certainly mismanaged their banks. Second, a failure of 
the supervisors to do their jobs. And third, a failure of the Biden 
administration to curb their reckless spending which fueled the highest 
inflation we've seen in forty years. That historic inflation led to ten 
interest rate hikes in a little more than a year. And soaring costs for 
everyday families.
    As I understand it, shortly after the collapse of SVB, the CEO, 
Greg Becker fled to Hawaii while the American people were left holding 
the bag for billions. And now our institutions who did nothing wrong, 
are having to pay the price for it. That's not right.
    There is little disagreement that these banks' executives were 
completely derelict in their duties. In order to hold bank executives 
who act in a grossly negligent manner accountable, the claw-back 
authority in this bill is tailored in that it applies to incentive and 
equity-based compensation, in the event--and hopefully there won't be--
another grossly negligent failed bank, thereby incentivizing bank 
executives to run their institutions in a prudent manner so the 
American taxpayer is not left footing the bill. There was a lot of 
press about these executives selling their stocks and taking bonuses 
days before the failures. That can't become the standard.
    But that only addresses part of the issue. Through the adoption of 
our Managers Amendment, this bill will also shine a light into the 
black box of our regulators and how they operate in by bringing much-
needed transparency and accountability for the American people so that 
they can be confident that their bank supervisors aren't asleep at the 
wheel again.
    The RECOUP Act is a commonsense solution to address accountability, 
and it is tailored to protect the American taxpayer. I look forward to 
discussing and marking up both of these bills, which are important and 
timely legislation.
                                 ______
                                 
             PREPARED STATEMENT OF PHILIP NATHAN JEFFERSON
 To Be Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
                                 System
                             June 21, 2023
    Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of the Committee, 
thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I am honored 
by President Biden's nomination to serve as Vice Chair of the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System. If confirmed, I will continue 
to use my experience and expertise in pursuit of the goals that 
Congress assigned to the Federal Reserve on behalf of all Americans: 
maximum employment and price stability.
    When I spoke to this Committee over 16 months ago, I was a Ph.D. 
economist with an eclectic research background: macroeconomics and 
monetary economics, poverty and economic inequality, and applied 
econometrics. I posited then that these varied specializations would 
provide unique perspectives on the complex issues facing the Fed. One 
year of service as a Fed Governor has tested this hypothesis, and I can 
confirm its accuracy. I have equally learned from and enjoyed the broad 
range of views around the Federal Open Market Committee table.
    As a Governor, I have focused on the design, implementation, and 
transmission of monetary policy; served on key committees on monetary 
affairs, supervision and regulation, and community banks; and chair the 
committee on Board affairs.
    The Fed's decisions affect all Americans. We consult data, 
empirical evidence, and research. But fully understanding the U.S. 
economy means understanding the experiences of those who live and work 
in it. Since arriving at the Federal Reserve, I have made two-way 
communication with the public a priority, from meeting with business 
and community leaders, workers, students, and retirees to public 
speeches.
    Experience shows that achieving our dual mandate fosters an 
environment characterized by a dynamic labor market, thriving 
entrepreneurship, sustainable growth, and secure and stable savings and 
investment. It also provides a critical foundation for monetary policy 
in challenging times. Our commitment to these goals will ground 
inflation expectations appropriately so that policy does not encumber 
private economic decision making. Long-run inclusive prosperity also 
requires paying careful attention to the financial system's safety and 
soundness.
    The economy faces multiple challenges, including inflation, 
banking-sector stress, and geopolitical instability. The Federal 
Reserve must remain attentive to them all. Inflation has started to 
abate, and I remain focused on returning it to our 2 percent target. 
Despite recent stress, the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient, 
and I remain attuned to any threats to its stability.
    Before closing, I wish to acknowledge the love and support of 
friends and family, especially my sons Nathan and Miles. Again, thank 
you for the opportunity and for your consideration of my nomination.
    If confirmed as Vice Chair, I look forward to working with each of 
you and with this Committee. I welcome your questions.

                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF LISA DENELL COOK
 To Be a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
                             June 21, 2023
    Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and other Members of the 
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.
    I am humbled and honored to have been renominated by President 
Biden to serve a full 14-year term on the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System.
    In my work as a Federal Reserve governor, my background and 
professional experience have proven to be invaluable. I spent my 
childhood in Milledgeville, Georgia, in the midst of the rural, 
desegregating South. My dedication to public service was invigorated by 
observing the courage and resolve of my late parents and other members 
of my family. We stood alongside friends and neighbors whose names were 
never recorded, and others, like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
whose memories are engraved in our Nation's history.
    After being a Marshall Scholar at Oxford University and earning my 
Ph.D. in economics at the University of California, Berkeley, I engaged 
in pathbreaking analytical and empirical research on economic growth, 
innovation, and financial institutions while on the faculty of Harvard 
University and of Michigan State University and as a National Fellow at 
the Hoover Institution. My professional colleagues elected me to help 
lead the field as a member of the Executive Committee of the American 
Economic Association, and I was selected as a Research Associate of the 
National Bureau of Economic Research. In addition, I have gained 
valuable experience from my work at the U.S. Department of the Treasury 
and the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
    I have significant experience in banking and finance, as is 
evidenced by my service on the board of directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Chicago and of a Community Development Financial 
Institution in Michigan, in addition to my employment at an investment 
bank and a large commercial bank. Indeed, community banks and other 
local financial institutions elected me as a director of the Federal 
Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis.
    When I appeared before you last spring, I pledged to protect the 
independence of the Federal Reserve. Over the past 13 months, I have 
been unwavering in my dedication to ensuring that our decisions serve 
the American people rather than any political or special interests.
    As a policymaker, I am committed to following a data-driven 
approach. My analysis draws extensively on high-frequency data and 
cutting-edge methodologies. This approach is especially important in a 
context where the pitfalls of relying on traditional analytical methods 
have been quite evident.
    I am acutely aware that the Federal Reserve's policy actions affect 
the daily lives of all Americans. The economy can only thrive when 
everyone can take part and contribute. Therefore, I consistently strive 
to engage directly with business and community leaders, workers, 
entrepreneurs, students and retirees, and other Americans. Listening to 
their experiences and perspectives where they are from--Grand Rapids to 
Oakland to Spartanburg to Detroit to New Orleans--has been critical for 
informing my own policy decisions.
    I am committed to promoting sustained economic growth in a context 
of low and stable inflation. A strong economy contributes to broad-
based prosperity by bringing people off the sidelines and providing 
opportunities to develop key job-market skills.
    As I stated to this Committee last year, elevated inflation is a 
grave threat to sustaining the expansion of the American economy. 
Therefore, in my role as a voting member on the Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC), I have been consistently supportive of our rapid and 
forceful actions to tighten monetary policy and bring inflation down.
    If confirmed, I will stay focused on inflation until our job is 
done. The American economy is at a critical juncture, and it will be 
essential for the FOMC to act as needed to bring inflation back to our 
2-percent inflation target.
    Senators, it has been an honor to serve the American people. As 
public servants, we vow to work on behalf of all Americans. I am 
grateful for your time and attention today, and for your consideration 
of my nomination. If confirmed, I look forward to continuing to work 
with you in this important role.
    Before concluding, I would like to express my gratitude to all of 
my family members, especially those here today--my aunt Wivona Murray 
Ward and my sisters, Melanie and Pamela Cook--for their steadfast 
encouragement, prayers, and support over many years.
    Thank you. I look forward to your questions.

              PREPARED STATEMENT OF ADRIANA DEBORA KUGLER
 To Be a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
                             June 21, 2023
    Good morning, Chairman Brown, Ranking Member Scott, and Members of 
the Committee. It is truly a privilege to have been nominated by 
President Biden to be a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System. I am honored for the opportunity to appear before you 
today.
    With me today are my husband of 29 years, Ignacio Donoso, and my 
daughter, Miri. My son, Danny, is watching from New York. I am also 
tremendously grateful to introduce my parents, Bernardo and Nelly, who 
have sacrificed so much to support me over the years.
    As a first generation American and daughter of Colombian 
immigrants, I am fortunate to have lived the American Dream after 
having seen poverty and adversity. I have had educational and economic 
opportunities that my parents and grandparents would have never had, 
and I have benefitted from social mobility only possible in our dynamic 
U.S. economy. My maternal grandfather had to leave high school to help 
his widowed mother raise his 5 siblings and my maternal grandmother was 
orphaned at the age of 3 in Colombia. My paternal grandparents fled 
religious persecution and had to restart their lives on a new 
continent. My parents worked hard every day to ensure I had every 
available opportunity to succeed. My family has instilled in me the 
importance of resilience and an unwavering work ethic, and the value of 
giving back to those less fortunate than you.
    I attended public high school in Maryland, earned a bachelor's 
degree at McGill University and completed a Ph.D. in Economics at U.C. 
Berkeley. My areas of specialization are applied econometrics and labor 
economics. Over the course of my 25-year career, I have produced 
original research and evidence-based policy analysis on labor markets, 
unemployment, worker mobility, and firm productivity, all topics that 
inform the Federal Reserve's important work. If confirmed, my extensive 
experience analyzing U.S. economic data will be critical in fulfilling 
my duties at the Federal Reserve and in making well-informed monetary 
policy decisions.
    The Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote stable prices and 
maximum employment remains fundamental. And, as we have seen in recent 
months, the role of the Federal Reserve in fostering the safety and 
soundness of banks and resilience of the financial system remains as 
critical as ever. If confirmed, I am deeply committed to setting 
monetary policy to reduce inflation and promote maximum employment, and 
to foster the resilience of the financial sector to support job 
creation and economic growth. My personal and professional experience 
guides my understanding that high inflation hurts workers and 
businesses alike, and I believe that it is important to bring inflation 
down to the Fed's 2 percent target in order to set a strong foundation 
to build an economy that supports all Americans.
    If confirmed, I look forward to upholding the Federal Reserve's 
independence, making decisions in collaboration with my colleagues, and 
based on the best data and analysis. As Chief Economist at the U.S. 
Department of Labor, I worked on issues related to job growth, 
unemployment, and workforce development following the Great Recession. 
In my current role, as U.S. Executive Director at the World Bank, I 
have worked to provide strategic direction as the world grapples with 
multiple crises, including the recovery from the pandemic, high 
inflation around the globe, and the economic spillovers of Russia's war 
on Ukraine.
    I have also served in a number of leadership roles during the 
course of my career, including as Vice-Provost at Georgetown 
University. In those roles, I have always placed the highest priority 
on being a reasoned voice, grounded in evidence and working to advance 
organizational goals. If confirmed, I intend to bring the same balanced 
and cooperative leadership approach to the Board of Governors.
    Thank you again for the opportunity to come before you today. I 
would be happy to answer your questions.
